Each man who was called up to the Torah read his section by himself. All this was possible because children {{right from the start}} learned to read without any vowels. Their diction is much more correct than the Sephardic and Ashkenazic dialect. The results of their education are outstanding, for example if someone is speaking with his neighbor and needs to quote a verse from the Bible, he speaks it out by heart, without pause or effort, with its melody.|$|E

Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.0/10, ("Impressive") writing, [...] "For an episode that began ho-hum, things certainly got interesting {{in the last}} half, with two surprise introductions." [...] Goldman praised the fight sequences {{as well as the}} unveiling of Tombstone and Mary Jane. Goldman concluded his review by writing, [...] "It's a testament to this show that it has it <b>exactly</b> <b>right</b> that Peter Parker's everyday, unmasked persona is so integral to the story, and that I actually am very curious how this dance goes." ...|$|E
500|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter {{explores the}} {{references}} to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. David Colbert, {{the author of the}} book, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the Harry Potter novels [...] "are [...] literary treasure hunts for [...] readers. What seem like funny-sounding names and places and excursions into fantasy all have a basis in either history, myth or legend." [...] He added, however, that he thinks Rowling has been able to turn these elements into her own, and concluded: [...] "A couple of times, every generation, some writer gets it <b>exactly</b> <b>right</b> and really makes it their own, and J.K.

500|$|Every {{episode of}} Last of the Summer Wine {{was written by}} Roy Clarke and every episode {{featured}} Peter Sallis as Clegg. The Comedy Playhouse pilot and all episodes of the first series were produced and directed by James Gilbert. Bernard Thompson produced and directed the second series of episodes in 1975. In 1976, Sydney Lotterby took over as producer and director. He directed all but two episodes of the third series – Ray Butt directed [...] "The Great Boarding House Bathroom Caper" [...] and [...] "Cheering up Gordon". Lotterby directed two further series before departing the show in 1979. In 1981, Alan J. W. Bell took over as producer and director.

500|$|The {{one group}} number, [...] "Pure Imagination", {{received}} reviews that touched on the song itself {{as much as}} the performance.

Benigno felt that while the song was [...] "really quite good", the [...] "stupidity of the scene" [...] it was in detracted from it, resulting in a grade of [...] "B+", while Gonzalez, when she gave it an [...] "A−", said she hadn't been a [...] "huge fan of the cover" [...] when she heard it before the show aired, but it grew on her in context.

500|$|Palpatine's wardrobe, {{tailored}} by {{costume designer}} Trisha Biggar, {{played an important}} part {{in the development of the}} character throughout the films.

[...] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, [...] "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering." [...] McDiarmid's favorite costume in Revenge of the Sith was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that [...] "it just feels reptilian, which is <b>exactly</b> <b>right</b> for [...]" [...] According to Trisha Biggar, Palpatine's costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, [...] "His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking him toward the dark side." ...|$|E

2500|$|The version {{from the}} Elevation Tour, {{featured}} just the Edge on a Gibson Les Paul Custom {{playing in a}} higher key with less wah-wah. Bono did not play guitar on these versions, as he usually performed on the heart-shaped stage in the audience. This version is also notable for its added introduction with Bono singing new lyrics over only the Edge's arpeggiated chords. His new lyrics would then involve him reciting parts of the chorus of the song. The Edge did not sing in falsetto during the chorus as he has done on the versions from other tours. This tour also included the first extended ending of the song. The band felt that although the song was good, they hadn't gotten it <b>exactly</b> <b>right.</b> David Bowie told them, upon hearing it, that {{it needed to be}} re-recorded.

2500|$|This {{filibuster}} {{to block}} Wilson's effort to expand war powers through his Armed Neutrality Bill proved successful. Lane and his co-thinkers, including Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr., became {{the targets of}} intense political hostility in the aftermath, however, with President Wilson demeaning them as [...] "a little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own" [...] who nevertheless [...] "rendered the great Government of the United States helpless and contemptible." [...] Many Oregonians were similarly incensed, and an outcry erupted for Lane's recall from office. An editorial in The Oregonian newspaper stated [...] "Next to being ashamed of Harry Lane for {{what he has done}} [...] [...] [...] the people of Oregon are ashamed of themselves for having sent Harry Lane to the United States Senate."
