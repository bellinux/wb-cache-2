40|$|Effectiveness of {{gain control}} in EDFAs against traffic with {{different}} levels of bursty behaviour M. Karasek, A. Bononi, L. A. Rusch and M. Menif Abstract: Previous publications have addressed the impact of bursty, self-similar traffic on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFA). Several gain control techniques have been suggested to combat the gain fluctuations of EDFA {{with this type of}} traffic. The effectiveness of two such methods are investigated namely highly <b>inverted</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and all-optical gain clamping, while varying the parameters characterising the burstiness of the sources. While previous publications have focused on the effect of the average load or activity factor, the paper further investigate the dependence on the relative variability of the packet burst lengths (ON times), and lengths of the interburst idle times (OFF times). Both gain control methods reduce the output power and signal-to-noise ratio excursions with respect to a standard amplifier chain. The authors find that, for an eight channel WDM system and a cascade of six EDFAs, all-optical gain clamping can reduce the variations by a factor of five, provided adequate power is present in the clamping laser, while highly <b>inverted</b> <b>amplifiers</b> have variations reduced by a factor of two. The authors find that, in...|$|R
