25|$|Einem's defence team (now {{consisting}} of barrister David Peek with assistance from Helena Jasinski) appealed the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia and requested {{that a new}} trial be set. The basis for this appeal was the evidence given about Kelvin's heterosexuality, the references to Einem's own homosexuality through the trial and the negative impact that might have had on the jury, and also <b>how</b> <b>Mr.</b> Justice White in his summation did not include reference to the testimony given by Einem's relative about his attendance at the birthday party on the day Kelvin's body was dumped. The Court of Criminal of Appeal rejected the appeal, saying that the trial was conducted fairly and just throughout, however they did concede that Mr. Justice White should have included the evidence relating to the birthday party.|$|E
25|$|In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts {{are invited}} to Rosings Park, the {{imposing}} home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, patroness of Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy's extremely wealthy aunt. She expects Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Colonel Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth <b>how</b> <b>Mr.</b> Darcy managed to save a friend from a bad match by convincing the friend of the lady's indifference. Elizabeth realizes the story must refer to Jane and is horrified that Darcy has interfered and caused her sister so much pain. Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, has {{fallen in love with}} Elizabeth and proposes to her. She rejects him angrily, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Mr. Wickham unjustly. The latter accusation seems to anger Mr. Darcy, and he accuses her family of wanting propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself. They part, barely speaking.|$|E

500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly <b>how</b> <b>Mr.</b> Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E
500|$|Carte's children's {{production}} earned enthusiastic {{reviews from}} the critic Clement Scott {{and the other}} London critics, {{as well as the}} audiences, including children. However, Captain Corcoran's curse [...] "Damme!" [...] was uncensored, shocking such prominent audience members as Lewis Carroll, who later wrote: [...] "a bevy of sweet innocent-looking girls sing, with bright and happy looks, the chorus 'He said, Damn me! He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning... <b>How</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand".|$|E
500|$|By season 8, {{the show}} {{had begun to}} explore episodes {{revolving}} around secondary characters. Reverend Lovejoy was selected for this episode because, aside from being noted as [...] "the priest who didn't care", he had not had much character development. This was the first episode that Donick Cary wrote for The Simpsons. He was disappointed that his first story was about [...] "Marge's crisis with faith." [...] The trip to the dump was inspired by Donick Cary's youth, {{in which he would}} often go [...] "dump picking". This led to the writers deciding to have Homer's face on a discarded box, which became the Mr. Sparkle subplot. To help create the advertisement, the writers watched videos of many Japanese commercials. An original scene from Lovejoy's flashback showed that Jasper Beardley preceded him as minister of the First Church of Springfield. The solution for <b>how</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sparkle resembles Homer was written by George Meyer, after hours of time had been spent {{trying to come up with}} a realistic ending. Matsumura Fishworks was named after Ichiro Matsumura, a friend of David X. Cohen.|$|E

500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter <b>how</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in my own life in every way." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{what they}} had done with other social issues and in {{developing}} their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it. [...] The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. [...] The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called [...] "a curriculum bath"; Bernstein described it in this way: [...] "We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. [...] We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard". [...] The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] They decided not to focus on <b>how</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. [...] They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: [...] "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all". [...] Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers' skills as educators as well as entertainers.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Bennett {{started a}} private {{prosecution}} against the entertainer Michael Barrymore over alleged offences involving drink and the possession {{and use of}} Class A and Class B drugs by Barrymore during the night when 31-year-old Stuart Lubbock was found dead at Barrymore's house in March 2001. The prosecution was blocked by a District Judge (Magistrates' Court) at Southend-on-Sea Magistrates' Court {{on the grounds of}} insufficient evidence. After the decision was made, Bennett announced that he had been acting independently but that he had the support of the Lubbock family. Barrymore released a statement in which he said, [...] "Mr Bennett's motivation to seek the truth as to <b>how</b> <b>Mr</b> Stuart Lubbock received the injuries to his body is absolutely right. I remain totally committed, as I always have been, to continue to pursue the truth. Allegations about drugs on that night have always been a complete irrelevance as to how Stuart Lubbock suffered those injuries. The court held Mr Bennett's misguided application to prosecute me for drugs offences was an abuse of process." ...|$|E
