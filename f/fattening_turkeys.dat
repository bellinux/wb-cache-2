40|$|Skin {{samples of}} {{reticulate}} scales from the metatarsal and digital foot pads from heavy-breed Big 6 turkeys were macroscopically, light microscopically, histochemically, transmission and scanning electron microscopically {{as well as}} biochemically examined. Additionally, a field trial investigating the influence of variable, economically justifiable biotin levels on the devel-opment of foot pad lesions was conducted and statistically analysed. In its basic structures, the reticulate scale epidermis of <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys</b> is {{comparable to that of}} broilers. Nevertheless, the results presented here suggest that there are differences within the bird population and that an age dependent maturation of the skin as a whole occurred. The results on the epidermal lipid metabolism of the reticulate scales are contrary to any pre-vious investigation in birds and emphasises the need of further investigations of the mecha-nism and structure of the avian permeability barrier. Based on my results, the permeability barrier in turkeys is solely maintained by the interdigitation of glycolipids located within the lipid cell envelope of neighbouring sebocorneocytes. In birds these glycolipids originate from lipid bilayer residuals of the broken down multigranular bodies, rather than their limiting membrane as in mammals. The observed foot pad lesions are the consequence of a progressive inflammatory reaction. In severe cases an ulcer is formed. With increasing age these ulcers can heal, leaving visible scar tissue behind. The occurrence of foot pad lesions is associated with a decrease of epi-dermal &# 969; 6 -fatty acids and a change in the hydroxy fatty acid pattern. It was not possible to demonstrate an influence of the different biotin levels on the structure of the reticulate scales from the examined turkeys. An influence of biotin on the epidermal fatty acid pattern and the macroscopic evaluation of the foot health was detectable only in positive environmental conditions. None of the applied biotin levels compensated for the negative environmental influences or prevented the development of foot pad lesions. A posi-tive effect on the healing of existing foot pad lesions was detectable using high biotin levels in the last seven weeks of fattening. The skin from the various turkeys examined had an indi-vidually varying affinity to develop foot pad lesions and also, a genetic factor cannot be ex-cluded. Consequently, exclusion of affected chicks from the breeding program should be considered. Avoiding a decrease of biotin levels during the last seven fattening weeks under optimal envi-ronmental conditions seems advisable to improve foot health in male <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys.</b> With-out a doubt, foot pad lesions are an issue concerning animal welfare and should attract more attention. <br /...|$|E

The first epi-demic was caused by a low pathogenicity (LPAIV) H 7 N 7 subtype and occurred in <b>fattening</b> and breeder <b>turkeys</b> in 1995. Two waves of H 5 N 1 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) took place in 2006 and 2007. In spring 2006, 64 cases of the H 5 N 1 virus were detected, mostly in mute swans. In December 2007, ten outbreaks of H 5 N 1 HPAI were detected in commercial poultry (n= 9) and wild birds kept in captivity (n= 1). The outbreaks in 2006 and 2007 were caused by genetically similar but clearly distinguishable viruses of the 2. 2 clade. In 2013, an H 9 N 2 avian influenza virus was detected in 4 fatten-ing turkey holdings. The virus was low pathogenic and a phylogenetic study has shown a close relatedness to the Eurasian lineage of AIV of the wild bird origin. Nei-ther preventive nor prophylactic vaccinations have ever been used in poultry or other birds.

Between 2010 and 2011, 163 Enterococcus isolates were collected from broilers, layers and <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys</b> that showed various clinical signs. Genus and species identification was determined with multiplex-PCR and gene sequencing. Most of the isolates were E. faecalis (n= 127), while E. faecium (n= 18), E. gallinarum (n= 13), and E. hirae (n= 5) were found in lower numbers. Susceptibility to 24 antimicrobial substances was tested using broth microdilution test to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). CLSI established breakpoints as well as MIC 50 and MIC 90 values were applied for evaluation. Resistance rates for lincomycin (72 - 100 %) and tetracycline (40 - 100 %) were high for all Enterococcus species. In addition, most E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were resistant to gentamicin (89 - 98 %) and erythromycin (70 - 89 %). No vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) were found and sensitivity to ampicillin was 100 % for E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, and E. hirae. MIC 50 and MIC 90 values for beta-lactam antibiotics, chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were {{at the lower end}} of the test range. Enterococcus faecalis isolated from turkeys had thehighest rates of resistances for all antimicrobial substances except ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Sixty-one percent of Enterococcus isolates were resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes. Again, isolates from turkeys stood out with 80 % multi-resistance. The most frequent resistance phenotypes of E. faecalis isolated from broilers, layers and turkeys were gentamicin, lincomycin, and tetracycline. Five virulence factors (aggregation substance, cytolysin, enterococcal surface protein, gelatinase, hyaluronidase) were determined in 28 isolates from turkeys (10 E. faecalis, 10 E. faecium, 8 E. gallinarum). First, virulence genes asa 1, cylA, cylB, cylLL, cylLS, cylM, esp, gelE and hylEfm were determined with multiplex-PCR. Gene-specific amplification products were confirmed by gene sequencing. All 28 Enterococcus isolates were tested for hemolytic activity, and gelatinase and hyaluronidase production. The gelE gene was found in all Enterococcus species, asa 1 was not found in E. gallinarum and esp was only found in E. faecium. Three E. faecalis and one E. faecium isolate showed the whole cytolysin operon. No virulence genes were found in six E. faecium and two E. gallinarum isolates. Six E. gallinarum isolates displayed cytolysin activity, seven E. faecalis broke down gelatine and seven E. gallinarum isolates displayed hyaluronidase activity. Virulence of the 28 isolates from turkeys was determined calculating survival index and death rate. According to survival index, three isolates were found highly virulent, seven isolates were moderately virulent and 18 isolates were less virulent. According to death rate, one isolate was found highly virulent, eight isolates were moderately virulent and 19 isolates less virulent...|$|E
40|$|Infection {{with low}} {{pathogenicity}} avian influenza (LPAI) virus is widespread and {{has led to}} outbreaks in domestic birds in many countries. Although infection does not pose a serious concern for animal heath, LPAI virus subtypes H 5 and H 7 can mutate into the highly pathogenic form (HPAI), which can cause massive epidemics in poultry and threaten human health. However, {{the knowledge of the}} underlying mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is insufficient for predicting these mutations, especially because the molecular changes necessary for the virulence shift seem to occur at random. Hence, to reduce the likelihood of HPAI emergence, LPAI circulation in general should be reduced. To this end, early detection of LPAI infections in domestic poultry is fundamental. The main objective of this thesis was to develop a framework of surveillance strategies for the early detection of LPAI infections in poultry. The studies described in this thesis were based on surveillance data collected during the LPAI epidemics in Italy in the period 2000 - 2009, which involved both the industrial and rural sectors. First of all, the Italian monitoring system, which is the longest running system in the EU, was evaluated in terms of its capacity to detect outbreaks of LPAI infection in poultry, with particular regard to <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys,</b> which has been the most affected species. It was shown that the majority of outbreaks were detected by active surveillance, which was especially successful in vaccinated flocks, given the vaccine-induced decrease in the severity of clinical signs and the consequent reduction in the sensitivity of passive surveillance. Subsequently, the involvement of the rural poultry sector in LPAI outbreaks was investigated. Grower and dealer holdings probably {{play a major role in}} perpetuating the infection, due to the peculiar husbandry and trade practices adopted, which facilitate the circulation and persistence of LPAI viruses in the rural sector. After that, the transmission dynamics of LPAI infections in industrial turkey flocks was modelled based on field data, and it was shown that these dynamics varied greatly among flocks. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays for detecting LPAI antibodies were estimated, without considering any assay as a gold standard. The estimates confirmed that the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, which is generally accepted as the gold standard, has a near perfect accuracy and may be considered as a reference test; however, to perform LPAI surveillance, for which large numbers of samples have to be processed, valid alternatives exist. Finally, different surveillance strategies were evaluated in terms of their performance for early warning; it was shown that the prompt detection of LPAI outbreaks in turkeys can be achieved through active surveillance by increasing the sampling frequency to once every 15 days, though very frequent sampling may not be sustainable in the long term. In the last chapter, the main findings of the above mentioned studies were integrated and critically discussed coming up with a framework of surveillance strategies for the early detection of LPAI infections in industrial poultry...|$|E
40|$|According to the Ministry for Agriculture, Environment and Consumer Protection in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the avian (coming from birds) {{influenza}} virus of the subtype H 5 N 8 and hence poultry plague was detected in a <b>fattening</b> farm for <b>turkeys</b> {{in the former}} administrative district of Uecker-Randow. The subtype H 5 N 8 virus is characterised by its highly pathogenic (strong ability to cause disease) properties for birds. To date, {{there have been no}} known cases of human infections with the H 5 N 8 virus. While conceivable in theory, transmission of the pathogen (H 5 N 8) via infected food is unlikely. Past cases of transmission of other subtypes (H 5 N 1, H 7 N 9) of avian viruses from birds to humans have almost exclusively been attributable to direct contact with infected live birds. There is no evidence to date for the possibility of humans contracting the virus through raw eggs or raw sausage products made from poultry meat of infected animals. When handling and preparing raw poultry meat and poultry meat products, the rules of hygiene should always be applied. The BfR already published more extensive information on avian {{influenza virus}}es in 2007. The Internet pages of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (www. fli. bund. de), the Robert Koch Institute (www. rki. de) and the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (www. bmel. bund. de) contain more details on the subject of avian influenza.
