25|$|In May 1970, {{soon after}} Carlton Gary moved to Albany, {{an elderly woman}} named Marion Brewer was robbed and {{attacked}} in her hotel room. Two months later, 85-year-old Nellie Farmer was robbed in <b>her</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>and</b> strangled to death. After Gary attempted an assault on a third elderly woman, {{he was arrested and}} his fingerprints matched one left {{at the scene of the}} Farmer murder. Gary admitted having taken part in a robbery, but claimed that an accomplice, John Lee Mitchell, was responsible for the actual murder. Gary testified against Mitchell in court and Mitchell was charged, despite no material evidence connecting him to the crime. Gary was only charged with robbery, a sentence he served in the Onondaga County Correctional Institution in Jamesville, New York. He was paroled in 1975 and moved to Syracuse, New York. Here, two more elderly women were attacked, raped, and strangled in their homes; one died and the other survived. Both attacks occurred within four days of each other. The two survivors were not able to identify Gary positively as the crimes occurred in the dark; at least one victim was sure that her attacker was a mustachioed black male, and she was strangled with a scarf. Gary was never charged for any of these crimes but was instead sent back to prison for parole violation and robbery after he was caught trying to sell coins stolen from the same apartment building as one of the surviving Syracuse victims. On August 22, 1977, Gary escaped from his low-security prison by sawing through the bars of his cell and made it back to Columbus, Georgia.|$|E
