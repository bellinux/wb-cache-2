5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon <b>her</b> <b>victim,</b> and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp <b>her</b> <b>victim.</b> There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E
500|$|Rand drew {{inspiration}} for Night of January 16th from two sources. The first was The Trial of Mary Dugan, a 1927 melodrama about a showgirl prosecuted for killing her wealthy lover, which gave Rand {{the idea to}} write a play featuring a trial. Rand wanted her play's ending {{to depend on the}} result of the trial, rather than having a fixed final scene. She based <b>her</b> <b>victim</b> on Ivar Kreuger, a Swedish businessman known as the [...] "Match King" [...] for the matchstick-manufacturing monopolies he owned, before he was found dead in March 1932. When Kreuger's business empire became financially unstable, he shot himself after being accused of executing underhanded and possibly illegal financial deals. This incident inspired Rand to make the victim a businessman of great ambition and dubious character, who had given several people motives for his murder.|$|E

500|$|During testing, Nordby and {{the special}} effects teams {{realized}} that getting Fox {{in and out of}} the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. [...] "very day (for about 10 days) she would sit in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [...] would have to do is the dentures", stated Nordby. He said that [...] "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [...] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack <b>her</b> <b>victim</b> and [...] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked". The camera accompanied them in the same way, as [...] "it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" [...] in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear contact lenses and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. [...] "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby. [...] "KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw." ...|$|E

Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted." ...|$|E

2500|$|Revenge porn or revenge {{pornography}} is the sexually explicit portrayal {{of one or}} more people that is distributed without their consent via any medium. The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner of an intimate relationship with the knowledge and consent of the subject, or it may be made without his or her knowledge. The possession of the material may be used by the perpetrators to blackmail the subjects into performing other sex acts, to coerce them into continuing the relationship, or to punish them for ending the relationship. Halder and Jaishankar (2013) define revenge porn as: [...] "an act whereby the perpetrator satisfies his anger and frustration for a broken relationship through publicizing false, sexually provocative portrayal of his / <b>her</b> <b>victim,</b> by misusing the information that he may have known naturally and that he may have stored in his personal computer, or may have been conveyed to his electronic device by the victim herself, or may have been stored in the device with the consent of the victim herself; and which may essentially have been done to publicly defame the victim".|$|E

2500|$|The police {{record of}} Abe's {{interrogation}} and confession {{became a national}} best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe's story {{within the context of}} the [...] or [...] "poison woman" [...] stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s. In the wake of the popular [...] "poison woman" [...] literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s. By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. Kanno Suga, who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate Emperor Meiji in what was known as the High Treason Incident, wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison. Fumiko Kaneko, who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered. Abe's confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for <b>her</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{reveals that}} the true murderer had been Elsa, who had become disillusioned and betrayed when she overheard Amyas reassure his wife {{that he had no}} {{intention}} of leaving her; he had made the promise to Elsa of doing so, merely to keep her from leaving so that he could complete his portrait of her, unaware that his model had taken his promise quite seriously. Although she falsely recalled the gist of this conversation, the mention of Caroline saying to Amyas, [...] "you and your women", showed to Poirot that Elsa was in the same category as all of Amyas' other, discarded mistresses, despite having been too young to realise this at the time, while he further notes that the remark made by Amyas of [...] "see to her packing" [...] was in regards to his intention to send Elsa packing once he was finished with his painting, and not about Angela; Caroline was distressed by his cruelty to Elsa despite his reassurances, and remonstrated with him on a second occasion about this. After overhearing their conversation, Elsa recalled seeing Caroline help herself to the coniine the day before, and stole some under the pretence of fetching a cardigan, which she then used on a glass of warm beer she provided Amyas; Poirot noted that his exclamation of [...] "everything tastes foul today," [...] meant that he must have drunk something already, before the cold beer that Caroline had provided, that had tasted foul as well. Amyas did not know he was poisoned until he began to become gradually weaker while Elsa was posing for his artwork, and that he knew by who by the [...] "malevolent glare" [...] he gave to the painting that Meredith had seen. Poirot notes the unusual vitality in the face of the portrait and says, [...] "It is a very remarkable picture. It is the picture of a murderess painted by <b>her</b> <b>victim</b> – it is the picture of a girl watching her lover die." ...|$|E
