5|$|Aimed at older {{children}} and teenagers, the programme {{was based on}} the activities of a children's newspaper, the Junior Gazette, produced by pupils from the local comprehensive school. In later series it was depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the <b>dramatic.</b> <b>As</b> well as addressing interpersonal relationships (particularly in the Lynda-Spike story arc), the show tackled issues such as solvent abuse, child abuse and firearms control.|$|E

5|$|After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} of England. Henry vigorously re-established royal {{authority}} {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war, dismantling castles and increasing revenues, although several of these trends had begun under Stephen. The destruction of castles under Henry was not as <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> once thought, and although he restored royal revenues, the economy of England remained broadly unchanged under both rulers. Stephen's remaining son William I of Blois was confirmed as the Earl of Surrey by Henry, and prospered under the new regime, with the occasional point of tension with Henry. Stephen's daughter Marie I of Boulogne also survived her father; she had been placed in a convent by Stephen, but after his death she left and married. Stephen's middle son, Baldwin, and second daughter, Matilda, had died before 1147 and were buried at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. Stephen probably had three illegitimate sons, Gervase, Ralph and Americ, by his mistress Damette; Gervase became Abbot of Westminster in 1138, but after his father's death Gervase was removed by Henry in 1157 and died shortly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Krishnamurti himself repudiated these claims, {{insisting that}} he was not the World Teacher, and then {{resigned}} from the Society; the impact on the society was <b>dramatic,</b> <b>as</b> it lost a third of its membership over the coming few years.

25|$|Charles passed several {{laws that}} appealed to the upper class, but angered the middle class. The {{situation}} {{came to a head}} when he appointed a new minister on 8 August 1829 who did not have the confidence of the chamber. The chamber censured the king on 18 March 1830 and in response Charles proclaimed five ordinances on 26 July intended to silence criticism against him. This almost resulted in another revolution as <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> the one in 1789, but moderates were able to control the situation.|$|E

On April 14, 2010, the Bulls clinched the playoffs with the number 8 seed. Unlike the previous year, however, the Bulls' playoff run was shorter and less <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> they were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. On May 4, 2010, the Bulls officially fired head coach Vinny Del Negro.|$|E
25|$|Flowering {{shrubs and}} wildflowers {{dominate}} the parkway in the spring, including rhododendrons and dogwoods, moving from valleys to mountains {{as the cold}} weather retreats. Smaller annuals and perennials such as the daisy and aster flower through the summer. Brilliant autumn foliage occurs later in September on the mountaintops, descending to the valleys by later in October. Often in early-to-middle October and middle to late April, all three seasons can be seen simply by looking down from the cold and windy parkway to the green and warm valleys below. October is especially <b>dramatic,</b> <b>as</b> the colored leaves stand out boldly and occur mostly at the same time, unlike the flowers.|$|E
25|$|The main {{public concern}} {{regarding}} the ozone hole {{has been the}} effects of increased surface UV radiation on human health. So far, ozone depletion in most locations has been typically a few percent and, as noted above, no direct evidence of health damage is available in most latitudes. If {{the high levels of}} depletion seen in the ozone hole were to be common across the globe, the effects could be substantially more <b>dramatic.</b> <b>As</b> the ozone hole over Antarctica has in some instances grown so large as to affect parts of Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa, environmentalists have been concerned that the increase in surface UV could be significant.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's {{entry into}} office would prove just as <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> his {{campaign}}. One {{of the campaign}} issues had been a valuable piece of city-owned downtown lakefront property, which outgoing mayor John H. Farley and the council had agreed to hand over to the railroads without compensation. Johnson obtained a court injunction to stop the giveaway, but it was set to expire {{three days after the}} election. Taking advantage of a legal technicality to get the new mayor sworn in early, Johnson's men staged a surprise takeover of City Hall and saved the land for the city (today this land, with later landfill additions, holds Cleveland Browns Stadium, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center).|$|E
25|$|India {{began their}} innings poorly. Steve Waugh, with runs to work with, {{attacked}} {{from the beginning}} {{with as many as}} 7 men catching. Opener Sadagoppan Ramesh duly obliged to Jason Gillespie, edging one to Ponting in the slips without a single run on the board. Shiv Sunder Das and Rahul Dravid played out the remainder of the session to take India to 32/1 at tea. The final session again would prove the most <b>dramatic,</b> <b>as</b> India then collapsed from a cautious 34/1 to 113/8. Wickets fell regularly as Das was soon followed by the celebrated Indian middle order. Tendulkar played across one from McGrath and was adjudged lbw, Dravid lost his stumps to Warne and Ganguly was snapped up brilliantly by Steve Waugh at gully. India ended Day 2 on 128/8 with the two Hydrabadis VVS Laxman and Venkatapathy Raju at the crease, still needing 118 more to avoid the follow-on. India had lost 7 wickets in a session like the Australians the previous day and Australia looked odds-on favourites to extend their winning streak to 17.|$|E
25|$|The gradual {{breakdown}} {{and transformation}} {{of economic and}} social linkages and infrastructure resulted in increasingly localized outlooks. This breakdown was often fast and <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> it became unsafe to travel or carry goods over any distance; there was a consequent collapse in trade and manufacture for export. Major industries that depended on trade, such as large-scale pottery manufacture, vanished almost overnight in places like Britain. Tintagel in Cornwall, as well as several other centres, managed to obtain supplies of Mediterranean luxury goods well into the 6th century, but then lost their trading links. Administrative, educational and military infrastructure quickly vanished, and the loss of the established cursus honorum led to the collapse of the schools and to a rise of illiteracy even among the leadership. The careers of Cassiodorus (died c. 585) {{at the beginning of this}} period and of Alcuin of York (died 804) at its close were founded alike on their valued literacy. For the formerly Roman area, there was another 20 per cent decline in population between 400 and 600, or a one-third decline for 150-600. In the 8th century, the volume of trade reached its lowest level. The very small number of shipwrecks found that dated from the 8th century supports this (which represents less than 2 per cent of the number of shipwrecks dated from the 1st century). There were also reforestation and a retreat of agriculture that centreed around 500.|$|E

25|$|Brownsville has {{consistently}} been {{considered to be}} the murder capital of New York City, with the 73rd Precinct ranking 69th safest out of 69 city precincts for per-capita crime in 2009. That year, there were 3 murders per 10,000 residents (higher than in any other neighborhood in the city), making for 28 overall murders in Brownsville; in overall crime, the 73rd Precinct was the 66th safest out of 69 neighborhoods. In the fifteen years between 1990 and 2005, reports of murder in Brownsville–Ocean Hill dropped 63 percent (to 22 murders in 2005); robberies 79 percent (to 597 in 2005); and felony assaults decreased 51 percent (to 562 in 2005). Crime rates in Brownsville had declined in the same manner that they had elsewhere in the city, but the declines were not as <b>dramatic</b> <b>as</b> {{in other areas of the}} city, with 72 people shot and 15 killed in Brownsville in 2013. At 348 per 100,000 adult residents in prison, Brownsville's incarceration rate is three times the city's as a whole and higher than all but one other neighborhood's incarceration rate. At a non-fatal assault rate of 180 per 100,000 people, Brownsville also sees the most violent crimes per capita out of any neighborhood in the city. By contrast, Morrisania, a Bronx neighborhood that once had a crime rate as high as Brownsville's, saw its crime rate decline by 25 percent between 1998 and 2011, while Brownsville's crime rate stayed roughly even during the same time period.|$|E
