40|$|Abstract] The aim of {{this study}} is to examine how {{participants}} express their agreement during a conversation for planning a trip through comparing Japanese and Korean internal situations. Also, this paper describes how agreement consists of, and what kinds of strategies participants used to express their agreement. In order to explore the above, I analyzed 6 Japanese internal situations and 7 Korean internal situations. As a result, <b>I</b> found <b>agreement</b> consists of prior utterance, agreement utterance, and reaction. <b>I</b> classify <b>agreement</b> as substantial agreement and ritual agreement. For the strategies, I classify them as direct-verbal agreement, indirect-verbal agreement, and non-verbal agreement. Compared to both situations, there were an average of 10 more utterances in the Japanese internal situation. Moreover, nods and style-shifts as contextualization cues asking for agreement were only present in the Japanese internal situation...|$|R
