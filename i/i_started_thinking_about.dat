She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E

It's really about the obstacles of trying to let it go, but at the same time how great it makes you feel, so it's hard to let it go. Again, it goes back to a story that we all can relate to... It's not Rihanna's story; it's her story in the video, and she's acting. But everybody's [...] Obviously, there's a lot of comparisons to her real life, and that's not at all the intention. It's just that I guess people naturally go there because art imitates life, and it's a story we all relate to and we've all experienced.

5000|$|Before the 1946 revival, Eliot {{considered}} {{revising the}} play, but [...] "as soon as <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the play, <b>I</b> have inklings of altering it still further" [...] {{and rather than}} completely rewrite his 1939 text Eliot felt [...] "it would be healthier to leave it alone" [...] and he started work on a new play, [...] "One-Eyed Riley", which became The Cocktail Party. Despite his own criticism of The Family Reunion in his 1951 lecture, Eliot let the original text stand.|$|R

[...] Ohio State assistant coach Esco Sarkkinen credited Johnson's physique: [...] "Johnson has good size, speed, agility and balance. But his extraordinary physique {{give him the}} ability to shake off tacklers." [...] Johnson himself credited his ability to find an opening as his main asset: [...] "Picking the hole is what I think I do best. It's more instinct than anything else. You either have it or you don't. When the play is called in the huddle <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> where the hole is supposed to be." ...|$|R

500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other."

500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{has written}} nearly thirty books, {{some of which}} are {{mentioned}} here. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only Way I Know, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times bestseller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, [...] "I was thinking, 'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book." [...] Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T.

[...] "As a fellow musician, I definitely get that," [...] Brendan says, [...] "but I actually had {{a good reason to}} do it. The album is self-titled because I feel like it’s my first recording that really showcases the different sides of me as a musician. It’s got everything from the mellow to the upbeat, to the somber to the unashamedly positive. My friends know me as the guy who loves to jump {{in the middle of a}} pick-up basketball game, but they also know me as the guy who needs to be reminded to stop spiraling when <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> something too deeply.

5000|$|Regarding the albums lyrical content, and the {{personal}} nature of Dream Rivers songs, Callahan noted, [...] "I feel like theres already a written narrative going on everywhere.

2500|$|Asher {{explains}} that he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their [...] "experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth". He maintains that his contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly {{as a source of}} second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, Asher clarified, [...] "The general tenor of the lyrics was always his... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter." [...] While speaking about [...] "God Only Knows", Wilson reflected: [...] "I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it deeper... because I had never written that kind of song. And I remember him talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs." [...] A typical writing session would either start with Wilson playing melody or chord patterns that he'd been working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. Asher called his interactions with Wilson and the Beach Boys an [...] "embarrassing" [...] experience, and that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book [...] he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E

A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This could be my final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I knew that when <b>I</b> <b>started.</b> <b>I</b> was <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> my regeneration scene from the outset, that’s my terrible melancholic nature, when you accept the job you know there’ll come a day, inevitably, when you’ll be saying goodbye.” ...|$|R

30|$|I {{propose that}} we {{consider}} the additional possibility that, like the other systems and species we study, humans are also highly fire adapted.

When <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> this a decade ago, I was surprised that only a few other people seemed to be asking the same sorts of questions.

I'm just acutely aware of how limited time is and I think I'd rather spend it doing what I do best which is taking risks and making experiments.""I was interested to see if I could develop a way of making music that was less destructive, because I was aware of how much I had brutalised myself living such an insane life over the last twelve years or so, how little I'd slept and so on. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> again <b>about</b> doing more playing, more bass stuff again.
