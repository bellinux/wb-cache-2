When nanofluid is used with wire coil inserts appreciable enhancement in the Nusselt number was observed.

There was no noteworthy increase in pressure drop for nanofluid.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to <b>insert</b> <b>wiring</b> without the proper tool, but this requires great care to avoid damaging the connectors. For example, pushing a screwdriver {{down the middle of}} the block is a bad practice as it forces the two blades of the terminal post apart, leading to bad contacts. It is also possible to punch-down multiple wires on top of each other in a single post of a punch-down block, but this practice is discouraged because of reliability concerns. If these multiple wires are of different thicknesses (wire gauges), it is even more likely that the thinner wire will develop contact problems. Similarly, stranded wire can be used on punch-down blocks, even though they were originally designed for solid wire connections.|$|R

40|$|Dielectric {{materials}} {{are used as}} spacers in antennas. The design of the dielectric determines {{the properties of the}} antenna. The insertion of high dielectric materials in a specific pattern into a low dielectric matrix material is one means to accomplish this. This thesis studies the means to <b>insert</b> metal cylinders (<b>wire</b> or nails) into polymer foams to produce such a material. Depending on the antenna properties desired, the patterns and number of nails varies tremendously. To decrease the manufacturing time and, therefore, the cost of creating these materials, an automatic machine capable of rapidly <b>inserting</b> <b>wires</b> to a predetermined pattern is developed. This thesis has two parts. In the first part, the ballistic impact of nails into foam is modeled. Experimental observations of the nails impacting the foam are used to verify the model. Penetration equations are developed to express the penetration capability of a nail into foam. All of this allows one to predict the forces required for a nail to be inserted into foam to a desired depth, thereby facilitating manufacture of these dielectric materials. In the second part, a fully automatic nail insertion device is designed, fabricated, and tested with the experimental tests used as control settings. M. S.

40|$|Results of {{transverse}} {{impedance measurement}} using image current are reported. The {{results show that}} this technique can be used up to frequency of 3. 9 GHz and high Q of 3300. I. Introduction The transverse coupling impedance {{is a measure of}} the interaction between the beam and deflecting modes (TM 1 n 0) in accelerator cavities. Two-wire and bead-pull techniques are usually employed for the measurement of transverse coupling impedance. The principle of the wire technique is to <b>insert</b> <b>wires</b> into cavities and beam line components to transform them into transmission lines and measure the scattering parameters. Coupling impedances (longitudinal or transverse) are extracted from S parameters [1]. For longitudinal coupling impedance measurement, a single <b>wire</b> is <b>inserted</b> in the center of cavities and beam components to form a coaxial transmission line. For transverse coupling impedance, two off-center <b>wires</b> are <b>inserted</b> to form a balanced-two-wire transmission line and a 180 degree, 3 db pow [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to surface electrodes, clinicians may also <b>insert</b> <b>wires</b> or needles intramuscularly to record an EMG signal. While {{this is more}} painful and often costly, the signal is more reliable since surface electrodes pick up cross talk from nearby muscles. The use of surface electrodes is also limited to superficial muscles, making the intramuscular approach beneficial to access signals from deeper muscles. The electrical activity {{picked up by the}} electrodes is recorded and displayed in the same fashion as the surface electrodes. Prior to placing surface electrodes, the skin is normally shaved, cleaned and exfoliated to get the best signal. Raw EMG signals resemble noise (electrical signal not coming from the muscle of interest) and the voltage fluctuates, therefore they are processed normally in three ways: rectification, filtering, and integration. This processing allows for a unified signal that is then able to be compared to other signals using the same processing techniques.|$|R
40|$|Background Ultrasound-guided {{techniques}} are increasingly used in anaesthetic practice to identify tissues {{beneath the skin}} and to increase the accuracy of placement of needles close to targeted structures. To examine ultrasound's usefulness for dilatational tracheostomy, we performed ultrasound-guided tracheal punctures in human cadavers followed by computer-tomographic (CT) control. Methods The trachea of nine cadavers was punctured using an in-plane approach with a longitudinal ultrasound visualization of the trachea. As soon as a loss of resistance was felt, or air/fluid could be aspirated into the attached syringe, the syringe was disconnected and the ultrasound transducer set aside. Thereafter, a cricothyroidotomy guidewire was inserted through the needle into the trachea. The needle was then removed, leaving the wire in place and a control CT imaging of the neck and the chest was performed. Primary outcome was successful wire insertion into the trachea. Results Tracheal puncture and wire insertion was successful in eight of nine cadavers at the first attempt and in one at the second attempt (total of 10 puncture attempts, nine successful). In eight of nine successfully <b>inserted</b> <b>wires,</b> the wire {{was placed on the}} defined midline. Conclusions Ultrasound guidance can facilitate successful tracheal puncture.
