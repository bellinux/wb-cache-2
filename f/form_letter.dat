25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, rumors {{circulated}} in Mormon culture that the Book of Mormon {{was being used}} by the Smithsonian to guide primary archaeological research. These rumors were {{brought to the attention of}} Smithsonian directors who, by 1982, sent a <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> to inquiring parties stating that the Smithsonian did not use the Book of Mormon to guide any research, and included a list of specific reasons Smithsonian archaeologists considered the Book of Mormon historically unlikely. In 1998, the Smithsonian revised the <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> and stated that Book of Mormon had not been used by the Smithsonian in any form of archaeological research. Mormon scholars speculated that this was because the earlier version of the letter contradicts some aspects of research published by Smithsonian staff members. Non-Mormon scholars note that the Smithsonian has not retracted any of its previous statements and feel that the response was toned down to avoid negative public relations with Mormons. Terryl Givens speculates that the change in the statement was an effort to avoid controversy.|$|E
25|$|Gamergate {{supporters}} were {{critical of the}} wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose {{from a list of}} target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> containing it to an advertiser. Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.|$|E
500|$|After 1994, Armstrong refused all {{requests}} for autographs because {{he found that}} his signed items were selling for {{large amounts of money}} and that many forgeries were in circulation; any requests that were sent to him received a <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> in reply, saying that he had stopped signing. Although his no-autograph policy was well known, author Andrew Smith observed people at the 2002 Reno Air Races still trying to get signatures, with one person even claiming, [...] "If you shove something close enough in front of his face, he'll sign." [...] He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts, because he believed these letters should come from people who know the Scouts personally.|$|E

500|$|The Angry Whopper has jalapeños, [...] "Angry Sauce" [...] and [...] "Angry Onions", pepper {{jack cheese}} and bacon. The sandwich, {{originally}} released in Europe, {{made its way}} to the United States in 2008. A variation called the Angriest Whopper debuted in 2016. The new variant added a red bun with hot pepper sauce baked into the roll. The Angriest Whopper followed a similar sandwich, the A1 Halloween Whopper released for Halloween 2015, which was prepared with black-colored, smoke-flavored buns, which caused fecal discoloration in some consumers. The Angry Whopper was released with a viral marketing push created by Burger King's advertising agency at the time, Crispin Porter + Bogusky. The two tiered program, designed to create a word-of-mouth marketing push, featured a webpage that allowed consumers to create an [...] "Angry-gram" [...] that could be emailed to other individuals. The <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> format page would send an insulting email to a recipient of choice from the sender. The second part consisted of a Facebook-oriented program where the company would issue a coupon for a free sandwich if the consumer would de-friend 10 people on their Facebook page. The Angriest Whopper was pitched using advertising similar to trailers for movie sequels, with a movie trailer-style opening screen, shots of lava, a helicopter and flames. The tag line for the ad was [...] "The only way to handle the heat is to embrace it." ...|$|E

On November 11, 2008 (Veteran's Day), Pietrzak's mother composed a formal letter to president-elect Barack Obama in which she discussed what her son and daughter-in-law had endured, and the possible primary motive for the murders. In this letter, Henryka stated: [...] "If it was a robbery, why didn't they come when nobody was home instead of {{in the dead of}} night, armed to the teeth? ... What was it about my son and daughter-in-law that inspired such hatred and loathing?" [...] Seven months later on July 27, 2009, the Obama administration responded with generic <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> of the type issued to all soldiers killed in combat.

2500|$|Despite the {{description}} of his views and {{his reputation as a}} misogynist, Sim maintains that he is not one. In 2008, Sim sent out a self-written <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> to individuals who had sent him mail, detailing his disagreement with being called a misogynist and disenchantment with what he perceived as a dearth of support in refuting those claims to his character. Contending that society perceived misogynists as the [...] "lowest, subhuman form of life in our society", he mentioned that few, if any, people had defended him, allowing him to be called [...] "the lowest, subhuman form of life in our society with impunity." [...] Sim's letter ended with an ultimatum, requesting that those who wished to receive his return correspondence reply with a letter or online posting and the statement, [...] "I do not believe Dave Sim is a misogynist."

2500|$|After Bennett Cerf's death, {{stations}} {{continued to}} air shows {{where he was}} a panelist resulting in confusion among some fans, who were seeing [...] "new" [...] episodes with Cerf long after hearing about his death. At the time, syndication involved tape sharing between stations airing series, a practice referred to as [...] "bicycling." [...] As such, while What's My Line? aired daily, each station airing the show did not air the same episode on a particular day. This prompted producer Gil Fates, who recalled the situation in his book, What's My Line?: TV's Most Famous Panel Show, to send a <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> response to fans who had written complaining about the late Bennett Cerf's failure to disappear, some saying the television stations were using poor taste. Fates explained that Cerf indeed had died, but television was practicing a time-honored tradition of celebrating one's work long after their death. As he wrote in his book, Fates knew, but did not tell viewers, about the production costs that would have gone to waste had his company acceded to the demands, some coming from station managers, to scrap the Cerf tapes.|$|E
2500|$|According to the biographer of Gobe Matenge, {{a former}} Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, {{he was one}} of several civil {{servants}} – including the future vice president Peter Mmusi – that compelled the Motswana government to adopt [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] as the anthem of the independent nation. [...] In order to ascertain the opinion of the general public on the matter, the government transmitted all of the contending hymns over Radio Botswana. [...] However, Matenge's group was able to obtain recordings of these songs for themselves and air them in front of quasi-town hall gatherings held in major settlements like Lobatse, Molepolole, and Mafikeng, in addition to the capital Gaborone. [...] They strategically played [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] as the last song – which in theory would increase the likelihood that the audience would remember the tune – while having their organisers add words of praise for it in an attempt to sway the crowd's opinion in favour of that hymn. [...] At the end of the exercise, they would circulate a boilerplate <b>form</b> <b>letter</b> articulating the author's viewpoint of [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] being their favourite candidate for national anthem. [...] This was done because of the low levels of literacy in Botswana at the time. [...] Of the multitude of letters sent to the Department of Information and Broadcasting, {{the vast majority of them}} expressed an inclination towards the aforementioned song.|$|E
