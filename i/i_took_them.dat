25|$|Behold, {{this was}} the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, {{fullness}} of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen {{the hand of the}} poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> away as I saw good.|$|E
500|$|Balked again, Butler {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} campaign personal, calling Tillman a liar and trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler's tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a questioner who asked why he did not meet Butler's insults with violence, [...] "Yes, I tell you, you cowardly hound, why <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> , and I'll meet you wherever you want to. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> because I, as governor of the State, {{could not afford to}} create a row at a public meeting and have our people murder each other like dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|At Manchester City he was {{occasional}} penalty taker, but {{his success}} rate was not high {{and he was}} relieved when Don Revie joined the club and took the responsibility for penalties, commenting that [...] "the only reason <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> was because no-one else fancied it".|$|E

500|$|At the {{recommendation}} of Leiber and Stoller, frontman David Johansen asked veteran producer Shadow Morton {{to work on the}} album. Morton was best known for his work with the Shangri-Las, of whom the New York Dolls were fans, and had also been Johansen's first choice to produce their debut album. Morton had become disenchanted with the music industry and wanted to challenge himself by producing the band's second album: [...] "The Dolls had energy, sort of a disciplined weirdness. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> into the room as a challenge. I was bored with the music and the business. The Dolls can certainly snap you out of boredom." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next week}} on another ride home, a similar {{conversation}} ensued, this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will. [...] Two weeks later, she alleged, they had complete consensual intercourse. [...] After, when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant, {{he told her that}} [...] "he knew of some pills that he would give me and if <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> {{at the end of each}} month before I menstruated that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant." [...] MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way, with sex occurring an average of three times per week. [...] In September 1931, she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in Vancouver; she alleged that during that time, Brownlee had his son, who usually slept in Brownlee's room, transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex.|$|E
500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{will begin}} with a few {{sentences}} from the excellent little local guide-book of Mr. Satya Chandra Mukerji. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> from {{here and there in}} his description: ...|$|R

2500|$|In the stanza that follows, Odin {{describes}} {{how he had}} no food nor drink there, that he peered downward, and that [...] "I took up the runes, screaming <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them,</b> then I fell back from there." [...] While Yggdrasil is not mentioned by name in the poem and other trees exist in Norse mythology, the tree is near universally accepted as Yggdrasil, and if the tree is Yggdrasil, then the name Yggdrasil directly relates to this story.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 November, Nanavati {{returned}} home {{from one of his}} assignments and finding Sylvia aloof and distant, he questioned her. Sylvia, who now doubted Prem's intention to marry her, confessed about the affair to her husband. Nanavati dropped his family at the Metro Cinema, for a show he had promised to take them to, but excused himself and headed straight to confront Prem Ahuja. When Sylvia was asked in court, why she went to the theatre, leaving her agitated husband behind, she answered, [...] "I was upset myself and I did not think clearly then. I was not indifferent to my husband killing himself… It is difficult to explain these things to children, so <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> to the cinema.|$|E
2500|$|Production of salt did not {{retain its}} lucrative luster for long, however, for {{downward}} price pressures had hit that industry from several angles. For one, {{the completion of}} the Erie Canal in 1830 meant a sharp increase in competition from companies that were mining massive salt deposits in Syracuse, New York. [...] Local competition had increased as well – by 1837, Provincetown had 78 saltworks, and the selling price had fallen from a high of eight dollars per bushel {{at the turn of the}} nineteenth century, down to only one dollar. Around that same time, demand for salt-cured fish began to decline, yielding to a growing consumer preference for ice harvesting and storage. [...] John Atwood Jr., the son of Long Point's founder, boasted that [...] "In 1848 I brought the first mackerel ever received on ice to Boston. It was August. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> in the sloop smack American Eagle." [...] He later pioneered the use of a jib topsail to shorten his time-to-market, so as to meet the growing appetite for fresh-caught fish.|$|E

2500|$|Jay Michaelson {{proposes a}} reading of the story of Sodom that {{emphasizes}} the violation of hospitality as well as the violence of the Sodomites. [...] "Homosexual rape {{is the way in which}} they violate hospitality—not the essence of their transgression. Reading the story of Sodom as being about homosexuality is like reading the story of an ax murderer as being about an ax." [...] Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with other Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers, and argues that when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom, they do so without commentary on homosexuality. The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah 23:14, where the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery, lying, and strengthening the hands of evildoers; Amos 4:1-11 (oppressing the poor and crushing the needy); and Ezekiel 16:49-50, which defines the sins of Sodom as [...] "pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did toevah before me, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> away as I saw fit." [...] Michaelson uses toevah in place of abomination to emphasize the original Hebrew, which he explains as being more correctly translated as [...] "taboo".|$|E

6000|$|... "They'll necessarily, {{whatever}} happens, {{hold their}} tongues, I hope, and I'm talking of <b>them</b> now as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> for myself only.
