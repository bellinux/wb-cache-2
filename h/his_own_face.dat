5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, with Loxton taking 0/12. Loxton came in at 2/327 and made 12, before sweeping a ball from Freddie Brown into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> and breaking his nose. He retired hurt and took no further part in the match. Australia declared at 8/469 and the hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the final}} match for Bradman in England, and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions. It was Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Ring. The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat, but Lindwall took 6/59 in an innings that lasted into the second day, bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62. Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face,</b> breaking his nose. Australia reached 2/407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8/469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result. Leveson-Gower's XI played out time, with Bradman bowling the last over.|$|E

Chetham's efforts are {{insufficient}} {{to produce an}} arc, and he splashes <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face.</b> Curll, on the other hand, produces a stream over his own head, burning (with an implied case of venereal disease) all the while. For this, Chetham is awarded a kettle, while Curll gets the phantom lady's works and company.|$|E

25|$|Simeon the Just (a High Priest) {{was opposed}} to the nazirite vow and ate of the {{sacrifice}} offered by a nazirite on only a single occasion. Once a youth with flowing hair came to him and wished to have his head shorn. When asked his motive, the youth replied {{that he had seen}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> reflected in a spring and it had pleased him so that he feared lest his beauty might become an idol to him. He therefore wished to offer up his hair to God, and Simeon then partook of the sin-offering which he brought.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Jedi Master Yoda, Stuart Freeborn used <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> {{as a model}} and added the wrinkles of Albert Einstein for the appearance of exceptional intelligence. Sets for Dagobah were built five feet above the stage floor, allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the Yoda puppet. The setup presented communication problems for Frank Oz, who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath the stage and unable to hear the crew and Mark Hamill above. Hamill later expressed his dismay at being the only human character on set for months; {{he felt like a}} trivial element on a set of animals, machines, and moving props. Kershner commended Hamill for his performance with the puppet.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{primarily}} during Brown's adolescence and finishes {{at the time}} of the book's creation. [...] Brown uses a bat-winged figure with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> to narrate the story and goad Chet in a way similar to the trope of the angel and devil on the shoulders. [...] Chet never acknowledges the narrator, who appears to be visible only to the reader. [...] The narrator talks about Brown in the third person in the adolescent parts of the story, but in the first person in Brown's adult years.|$|E

A matte of the scene was then cut and various fire effects were placed into Underwood's face via green screen technology.

Although more conventional artwork was created for the film, featuring the main characters' faces emblazoned over the Golden Gate Bridge, Wiseau chose the [...] "Evil Man" [...] for what he regarded as its provocative quality; {{around the time of}} the film's release, the image led many passers-by to believe that The Room was a horror film. Wiseau also paid for a small television and print campaign in and around Los Angeles, with taglines calling The Room [...] "a film with the passion of Tennessee Williams".|$|E
500|$|In DC's New 52, a 2011 {{relaunch}} of its titles following Flashpoint, the Joker has <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> cut off.

At {{the end of the}} storyline, the Joker falls off a cliff into a dark abyss. The Joker returns in the 2014 storyline [...] "Endgame" [...] in which he brainwashes the Justice League into attacking Batman, believing he has betrayed their relationship. The story implies that the Joker is immortal—having existed for centuries in Gotham as a cause of tragedy after exposure to a substance the Joker terms 'dionesium'—and is able to regenerate from mortal injuries. [...] "Endgame" [...] restores the Joker's face, and also reveals that he knows Batman's secret identity. The story ends with the apparent deaths of Batman and the Joker at each other's hands.|$|E
500|$|Earlier, Håkan {{stops and}} kills a passerby {{on a busy}} {{footpath}} near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making {{his way home from}} a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face,</b> disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to [...] "go steady". While Eli states, [...] "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{was the first}} for {{director}} Samuel Bayer. Bayer stated he believed he was hired because his test-reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be [...] "punk" [...] and [...] "not corporate." [...] The video {{was based on the}} concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot. Inspiration was taken from Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film, Over the Edge, as well as the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. Filmed on a soundstage in Culver City, the video featured the band playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The music video features a brief appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene would cut to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. [...] "Once the kids came out dancing they just said ' you,' because they were so tired of this [...] throughout the day," [...] Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired. One of Cobain's major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face</b> after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that [...] "the video had something that was truly about what they were about." [...] The video had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{very first}} version of Eddie was a mask made by an art student who was friends with Dave [...] "Lights" [...] Beasley, then in charge of lighting, {{pyrotechnics}} and other effects for Iron Maiden's live show. According to Beasley, the original mask was a papier-mâché mould of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face,</b> which was then used in the band's backdrop, consisting of lights and the band's logo. At {{the end of their}} live set, during the [...] "Iron Maiden" [...] song, a fish tank pump was used to squirt fake blood out of the mask's mouth, which typically covered their then-drummer Doug Sampson. After this initial incarnation, Beasley constructed a larger mask out of fibreglass, equipped with flashing eyes and the ability to release red smoke from its mouth.|$|E
2500|$|One legend {{holds that}} a man who, while under the {{influence}} of the drug, thoroughly sliced off pieces of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>face,</b> including his eyes, to feed to his pet dogs. [...] Some versions of this tale say he suffered permanent brain damage as well. [...] This legend is remarkably similar to what the character Mason Verger did in Thomas Harris' 1999 novel Hannibal. [...] The legend, however, dates back earlier than 1999, and can be traced to former New York homicide detective Vernon J. Geberth, who writes about it in his book Practical Homicide Investigation. [...] According to Geberth, this actually did occur to a man named Michael, and that Geberth was one of the detectives called to the scene." [...] A 1989 book by Dr. Joseph Sacco also mentions this story, albeit with a few differences in the details.|$|E
