50|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} (as bottom-up approach) {{of dense}} lines less than 20 nm wide in large pre-patterned trenches has been demonstrated. The degree of dimension and orientation control {{as well as}} prevention of lamella merging {{still need to be}} addressed for this to be an effective patterning technique. The important issue of line edge roughness is also highlighted by this technique. Self-assembled ripple patterns and dot arrays formed by low-energy <b>ion-beam</b> <b>sputtering</b> are another emerging form of bottom-up lithography. Aligned arrays of plasmonic and magnetic wires and nanoparticles are deposited on these templates via oblique evaporation. The templates are easily produced over large areas with periods down to 25 nm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ion-beam</b> <b>sputtering</b> (IBS) is {{a method}} in which the target is {{external}} to the ion source. A source can work without any magnetic field like in a hot filament ionization gauge. In a Kaufman source ions are generated by collisions with electrons that are confined by a magnetic field as in a magnetron. They are then accelerated by the electric field emanating from a grid toward a target. As the ions leave the source they are neutralized by electrons from a second external filament. IBS has an advantage in that the energy and flux of ions can be controlled independently. Since the flux that strikes the target is composed of neutral atoms, either insulating or conducting targets can be sputtered. IBS has found application {{in the manufacture of}} thin-film heads for disk drives. A pressure gradient between the ion source and the sample chamber is generated by placing the gas inlet at the source and shooting through a tube into the sample chamber. This saves gas and reduces contamination in UHV applications. The principal drawback of IBS is the large amount of maintenance required to keep the ion source operating.|$|E

A biological sample on a conducting substrate in air does not meet this criteria and requires a conductive coating for stable and reproducible STM imaging. In this paper, the authors describe the STM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization of ultra-thin <b>ion-beam</b> <b>sputtered</b> films of iridium and cathode sputtered gold/palladium and platinum films on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) which were developed for use as biomolecule coatings.
