Background: The Platinum mining {{operations}} in South Africa mining platinum containing ore from areas where variable amounts of uranium are found, {{leading to the}} possibility of occupational exposure to the radioactive <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of Uranium- 238 and in particular the gas Radon- 222. No scientific data is available for occupational exposure to Radon- 222 in South African platinum {{mining operations}}. Objective: To determine the risk of occupational exposure to the radioactive <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of naturally occurring Radon- 222 gas in a South African platinum mine. Design: Quantitative sampling (personal and static) to establish baseline data on exposure to radioactive <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of naturally occurring Radon- 222 gas in a underground South African platinum mine. Setting: The Bafokeng Rasimone platinum mine located 30 km North West of Rustenburg in the Bushveld complex in the North West Province of South Africa. Study subjects: One hundred and seventy four potentially highest exposed underground employees and one hundred and twelve static underground samples were sampled. Method: Personal and area samples were taken on selected employees and in locations using RGM samplers using CR- 39 plastic as a detection medium. Employees were selected to sample the highest exposed occupations and static samples were located to sample returning air from levels underneath the sampling point before it is exhausted to the above ground atmosphere. After analysis by an accredited laboratory, the results were converted to exposure following the National Council on Radiation Protection- 78 methodology. Main outcome measures: Quantify the relative risks of potentially highest exposed employee`s exposure to the radioactive <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of naturally occurring Radon- 222 gas in underground working areas in milliSievert per year. Results: The mean reference background exposure averaged 0. 6168 mSv/a with underground personal exposure averaging 0. 6808 mSv/a, and underground static exposure averaging 0. 8726 mSv/a. These values are substantially below the 50 mSv/a Occupational Exposure Limit, and only pose a slightly elevated risk for the development of lung cancer above the normal back-ground exposure. Mining Team leaders and rock drill operators were identified as the potentially highest exposed employees due to the close proximity to the working face, large amounts of time spent close to the working face and the lower ventilation volumes at the working face, with Team leaders having the highest exposure of the sampled occupations with a average of 1. 16 mSv/a. Conclusions: Occupational exposure to radioactive <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of naturally occurring Radon- 222 gas in the underground air of a South African platinum mine does not pose a significant risk to the health of employees working in the platinum mine.

Circadin is indicated for patients with primary insomnia aged 55 and over, but is more widely used “off-label” to treat sleep disorders especially in the paediatric population. Children and older people often have difficulty swallowing tablets and dividing the tablet is sometimes required to ease administration. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the release profile of melatonin from Circadin tablets when divided or crushed, and compare this with release from intact tablets. Dissolution testing was also performed for unlicensed melatonin products for comparison. Dissolution tests were performed using the pharmacopoeial paddle apparatus, with melatonin release analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Melatonin content, hardness, friability, and <b>disintegration</b> of the <b>products</b> were also evaluated. The prolonged release of melatonin from Circadin tablets was unlike that of any other product tested. When divided into halves, Circadin preserved most of the prolonged-release characteristic (f 2 = 58), whereas quarter-cut and crushed tablet had a more immediate melatonin release profile. Circadin is significantly less expensive and should be preferred to unlicensed medicines which are not pharmaceutically equivalent and offer less quality assurance...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{inclusions}} in Sao Luiz diamonds {{have been}} characterized using angle dispersive X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. We identified two different garnet phases coexisting with an omphacitic pyroxene. They represent <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> {{of a former}} homogeneous majorite-rich garnet phase. The two garnets have significantly different cell parameters but are tightly intergrown with their unit cells parallel to each other. The garnets are oriented relative to the diamond host with [100]garnet parallel to [110]diamond. Combining the measured cell parameters of the garnet inclusions with chemical analyses of similar inclusions from the same source allows the extraction of a residual pressure between 1 and 3 GPa, depending on the exact chemical composition assumed. Depth-resolved Raman spectra at the diamond-garnet interface indicate a residual pressure of about 1 GPa. Such a low residual pressure is unexpected at first glance for a garnet assemblage from the transition zone.

40|$|When {{specimens}} of Actinosphaerium nucleofilum are placed at 4 °C, the axopodia retract and the birefringent core (axoneme) of each axopodium disappears. In fixed specimens, {{it has been}} shown that this structure consists of a highly patterned bundle of microtubules, each 220 A in diameter; during cold treatment these microtubules disappear and do not reform until the organisms are removed to room temperature. Within a few minutes after returning the specimens to room temperature, the axonemes reappear and the axopodia begin to reform reaching normal length 30 – 45 min later. In thin sections of cells fixed during the early stages of this recovery period, microtubules, organized in the pattern of the untreated specimens, are found in each reforming axopodium. Reforming axopodia without birefringent axonemes (and thus without microtubules) are never encountered. From these observations we conclude that the microtubules may be instrumental not only in the maintenance of the axopodia but also in their growth. Thus, if the microtubules are destroyed, the axopodia should retract and not reform until these tubular units are reassembled. During the cold treatment short segments of a 340 -A tubule appeared; when the organisms were removed from the cold, these tubular segments disappeared. It seems probable that they are one of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of the microtubules.

This investigation describes chemical and physicochemical conditions in which these structures are stable and what treatments cause their disruption. The effects on fixed and unfixed sections of tendon, cornea, lung and ear from rat, mouse and rabbit of pH, electrolyte concentration, EDTA, mercaptoethanol, hydrogen peroxide, free radicals, periodate, acetylation, urea, nonionic detergent and organic solvents were assessed by staining with Cupromeronic blue or Alcec blue in CEC techniques to localise AGAG bridges or their <b>disintegration</b> <b>products.</b> Ca 2 + {{was not involved in}} the structures, oxidation/reduction had no effect and Triton X 100, a nonionic detergent did not damage them.

The combination of Triton and urea at concentrations too low to cause damage separately was disruptive. Free radicals in periodate solutions were damaging.

40|$|The study proposes an {{alternative}} perspective to elucidate interfirm labor division under vertical disintegration {{in order to}} explore product development capabilities in open environments, drawing {{on the case of}} the global mobile handset industries. Product modularization with the birth of supply chain of standardized components/technologies is regarded as the major force to enhance vertical <b>disintegration.</b> Nevertheless, a <b>product</b> developer, particularly a firm without sufficient experiences and/or resources, still faces difficulties with product development because of the firm's insufficient system knowledge to integrate a variety of components into a product system. Under such condition, each specialized vendor develops a platform to provide a part of layered system knowledge according {{to the level of the}} nested-module system of a product. Product development processes are modularized into development processes of these specialized vendors and product developers. Inexperienced new entrants are not allowed to develop products until such modularized interfirm development processes collectively complement system knowledge necessary for product development. On the other hand, experienced manufacturers mostly dedicate themselves to system integration at product platform and/or product system levels, and secure product development capabilities based on their accumulated firm-specific local system knowledge, architectural knowledge, at these levels. Yet, leading manufacturers sometimes extend the locus of their architectural knowledge even to core product technologies beyond the locus of their product development tasks. These findings imply that under open interfirm environments where system knowledge is disseminated across specialized firms, product manufacturers’ development capabilities primarily rest on the attributes and locus of their accumulated architectural knowledge for system integration at product system levels. 本研究では、オープンな環境下での製品開発力を検討するため、世界の携帯電話端末産業のケースを参考に、水平分業下での企業間分業についての代替的な視点を提示する。製品のモジュラー化とそれに対応した汎用の部品や技術の供給が、水平分業を促しているとされてきた。しかし、製品開発レベルでは多様な部品や技術を統合するためのシステム知識がいまだに不可欠であり、開発経験や資源が乏しい企業が製品開発を行うのは容易ではない。このような状況ではあるが、製品コア技術を含め製品システムは階層的に分化しており、各階層に対応したシステム知識が、プラットフォームとして専門化した企業によって開発・提供されるようになっている。こうしたモジュラー化した企業間開発プロセスによって製品開発に必要なシステム知識が補われることで、新興企業でも製品開発が可能となっている。一方、開発力のあるメーカーは、もっぱら製品レベルのシステム統合に専念し、自社の蓄積されたローカルなシステム知識、アーキテクチャ知識による製品開発力を保持している。ただし、先進的メーカーでは、こうしたアーキテクチュラルな知識は、各社が実際に行っている開発作業の範囲を超えて製品コア技術の知識にまで及んでいる。これらの発見は、オープン化した環境ではシステム知識が専業企業間で分散しており、そうした環境下での製品開発力は、システム統合のための各社のアーキテクチュラルな知識の特性と範囲に大きく依存することを示唆している...|$|R

The influence of these processes {{on the structure of}} two analogous compositions of glass, involving La or Ce, and the consequences for their chemical durability were studied. Monoliths of glasses were irradiated with electrons that had been accelerated to 2. 5 MeV and samples were then leached in static bidistilled water for one month at 90 ^∘. Raman spectrometry, ^ 27 Al MAS-NMR and EPR spectrometry experiments, performed after irradiation, globally indicated weak structural modifications. The two main effects of irradiation were an increase of the (Al_IV) /(AlVI+Al_V) ratio and the formation of a paramagnetic center in the case of La-glass (g≃ 1. 99). The former observation could indicate a slight migration and segregation of the rare earth, preferentially surrounded by highly charged Al_V and Al_VI units initially. The second point could be correlated with a change in the oxidation state of one of the La-glass component. The reason why no similar paramagnetic center is created during irradiation for Ce-glass is not well understood but a possible charge trapping process involving Ce(III) /Ce(IV) is developped. Finally, leaching solution analysis indicated that normalized elemental releases are almost unchanged after irradiation for both of the La and Ce-glass. The globally weak influence of β irradiation on this family of glass is subsequent to the low mobility of the major components that form high field strength bonds with oxygen...|$|R

Uranium may also reach the environment anthropogenically for instance in mineral phosphate fertilisers. Because of its widespread presence traces of uranium can also be detected in foods like drinking and mineral water. Uranium is not essential for humans. The ongoing intake of higher uranium concentrations can lead to kidney damage because of the chemical toxicity of the substance. The radioactive <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of uranium can cause cancer. Various institutions have established toxicological limit values for the intake of uranium or elaborated guidance values for still tolerable amounts of uranium in drinking water.

Around 5 % of the tested mineral waters were found to have a higher uranium content. These waters may have a negative effect on health if more than half a litre is consumed daily. BfR has repeatedly pointed this out and established a limit value of 2 μg uranium per litre for mineral waters that are advertised for the preparation of infant formula.

Description of the work is divided into four thematic parts describing four independently performed experiments. The very first analyses of the asymmetrical vibration ν 4 band and the symmetrical ν 2 band of the FCO 2 · radical, that belong among significant intermediate products of degradation processes of halogen hydrocarbons, were performed within this work. The detailed analysis led to determination of rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, and fine splitting constants of both bands. For the first time in history we performed the spectroscopically unambiguous identification of the molecular radical ion CS+ using the microwave spectroscopy with high spectral resolution in the frequency range of 414 to 622 GHz. The complex analysis allowed us to exactly determine the values of the rotational constant, fine splitting constant, and hyperfine splitting constant.

It has been defined that {{in the basement of the}} moraine bed there is a clear dependence of the large detrial material composition and the granular composition of the moraine silt on the basement rocks composition. The dependence considerably weakens upwards the section. The received data testify to the plastic glacier flow having dominated in the region, when layers in the glacier basement shifted slowest and the speed of the glacier movement increased upwards the section. The plastic flow has been associated with shifting along internal splits, which provides the inflow of the detrial material to the upper layers of the glacier. Some faults of the moraine that formed under the Middle Dryas advance of the glacier are considered as erratic mass of sedimentary rocks. Their contemporary appearance formed during the change of the glacier gliding along the bed for its inner shifting along internal splits and by plastic flow. An irregularstructured moraine occurred, when the detrial material in flakes, which lost their plasticity and as a result peeled off the basement of the moving glacier, did not consolidate before each flake peeled off. When the interval between the exfoliation of flakes was longer, the transferred detrial material interacted with the formed moraine. In result of the debris abrasion fine layers enriched by clayey particles occurred. The layers can be observed in a moraine with a bedded structure. The tabular structure was produced under the freezing of the previously deposited moraine. The ablation moraine differs from the basal one in its lower silt content.

In this study, we designed an assay that requires two separate oligonucleotides to be brought together via interactions between integrase promoters to form a "crossbones" substrate that mimics the integration intermediate. The crossbones substrate contains two viral DNA ends, each joined to one strand of target DNA and separated by a defined length of target DNA. We showed that purified integrases of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) could mediate a concerted strand cleavage-ligation between the two half-substrates at one or both viral DNA joining sites (trans <b>disintegration).</b> Another major <b>product,</b> termed fold-back, resulted from an intramolecular attack on the phosphodiester bond at the viral-target DNA junction by the 3 '-OH group of the same DNA molecule (cis disintegration). The activity of integrase on the crossbones substrate depended {{on the presence of}} viral DNA sequences. For trans disintegration, the optimal length of target DNA between the viral DNA joining sites of the crossbones substrate corresponded to the spacing between the staggered joints formed on two opposite strands of target DNA during retroviral DNA integration in vivo. The activity of integrases on crossbones did not require complementary base pairing between the two half-substrates, indicating that the half-substrates were juxtaposed solely through protein-DNA interactions. The crossbones assay, therefore, measures the ability of integrase to juxtapose two viral DNA ends, an activity which heretofore has been difficult to detect by using purified integrase in conventional assays. Certain mutant integrases that were otherwise inactive with the crossbones substrate could complement one another, indicating that no single protomer in the integrase multimer requires a complete set of functional domains either for catalytic activity or for juxtaposition of the two viral DNA ends by the active multimer...|$|R
40|$|From the {{foregoing}} description {{it is evident}} that when rabbits are inoculated intravenously with equal amounts of tubercle bacilli of bovine and human type respectively, they are subject to an immediate reaction {{in the form of an}} interstitial pulmonary exudation, which, being of equal severity and character does not serve to distinguish the type. There is an hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue which is much more pronounced in the bovine series and which may distinguish this type. Opinion on this point may well be reserved until other typical cultures are examined for this response. The two types are sharply distinguished by the behavior of the tubercle bacillus and by the progression of tubercle formation. Tubercles are formed by both types and for about I week after inoculation they are not distinguishable. Progressively thereafter those formed as a response to the bovine bacillus become more numerous; they caseate and become conglomerate, finally coming to occupy the major part of the pulmonary tissue and its associated lymph nodes. With the human type the tubercles do not progress to caseation, do not become more numerous after their first well defined formation, and finally tend to disappear. The human type bacillus does not multiply considerably, if at all, and disappears early. The bovine bacillus suffers little or no restraint in growth and finally multiplies enormously. It seems clear that so far as histologic evidence goes the fundamental difference in the reaction of the rabbit to the two types of tubercle bacilli is referable to the ability of the animal to restrain the growth of the human type or to the prevalence of conditions which permit a most vigorous multiplication of the bovine type. The initial cellular responses seem to be qualitatively of the same order and their quantitative distinctions are for the most part developed coincidently with the manifest growth of the bovine type bacillus. If we undertake to state the observed results in the terminology of immunity we can say only that the histologic picture discloses a difference in the rate of bacillary multiplication which suggests that a difference in the physiologic requirements for growth of the two types of bacilli is satisfied or unsatisfied, in the respective cases, by the rabbit as host; or on the other hand, that there is a positive growth-restraining action exerted with efficiency against bacilli of the human type. It is evident that the present observations furnish no points of discrimination between these alternatives. There is, however, an occasional result of the injection of human type bacilli into rabbits (not seen in this series) which offers a suggestion. When animals so injected are allowed to live for 2 or 3 months, the lungs at autopsy not infrequently present a few nodules of large size, often 1 cm. in diameter, which are found to be well encapsulated, soft, caseous masses. These often contain large numbers of tubercle bacilli. Since we know nothing of the particular conditions which give rise to these rather exceptional formations it is impossible to draw general conclusions from them, but they do suggest that the rabbit is not lacking in the food materials required by the human type bacillus; and that if the more usual suppression of this type is due to failure of its essential nutritives, it is rather a question of the distribution within the animal than an absence which is responsible. The usual result would then appear to be due to a positive growth-restraining action exerted against the human type bacillus. Certain other points of interest in the histologic picture described are worthy of comment. The lymphocytes do not appear as active cells in any preponderant way in either series and they are much less in evidence in the immune case (human type) than in the non-immune (bovine type). This might suggest that the activity of this cell type is a response to infection rather than that it furnished an effective preexisting barrier against infection in this particular case. If the lymphocytes were the most important agents in the immune reaction, it might be expected that they would show an immediate sharp response in the human series. The large mononuclear type of cell is clearly most closely related physically to the tubercle bacillus within the body of the rabbit and this without distinction as to bacillary type. Foci of these cells are the loci of the disappearing bacilli of human type, and in either the active or necrotic state similar cell collections are the site of the most vigorous multiplication of the bovine bacilli. These cells undoubtedly stand in a central position in any picture which can be drawn of experimental tuberculosis in the rabbit and deserve as a consequence all of the very considerable attention they have received at the hands of numerous observers in recent years. It has been quite usual of late to consider that the whole of the essential reaction of the animal against tubercle bacilli is carried by the cells of the mononuclear series, either lymphocytes or large mononuclears according to the predilections of the observer. We cannot, however, entirely overlook the presence in very large numbers of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, both amphophilic and eosinophilic, in this experimental series. They are much less prominent in the animals injected with the killed culture and hence can hardly be neglected on the assumption that they are merely a part of a reaction to an indifferent foreign body They are in large measure a reaction to the living organism: whether a primary and direct or a secondary, indirect consequence of its presence we are unable to decide. These cells are not massed in any regular relationship to the well formed tubercles or to the clusters of mononuclear cells initiating tubercle formation. They are also very much less abundant in the very severe late lesions of the bovine type where enormous numbers of bacilli are enclosed in the tubercles. It seems possible that the polymorphonuclears are a response to the living free tubercle bacilli as contrasted with either the dead bacilli or the living bacilli segregated in mononuclear cell clusters or in tubercles. They would appear also to be related to something apart from the bacillus itself, either a diffusion or <b>disintegration</b> <b>product,</b> since phagocytosis of bacilli, or the presence of bacilli in close physical relation to polymorphonuclear leucocytes, is so infrequent in general as not to have been observed in this series of experiments...|$|R

Whereas a recent draft guideline by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed the replacement of dissolution testing with disintegration testing, the mentioned criteria are not globally accepted. This study provides scientific justification for using disintegration testing rather than dissolution testing as a quality control method for certain immediate release (IR) formulations. A mechanistic approach, which is beyond the current FDA criteria, is presented. Dissolution testing via United States Pharmacopeial Convention Apparatus II at various paddle speeds was performed for immediate and extended release formulations of metronidazole. Dissolution profile fitting via DDSolver and dissolution profile predictions via DDDPlus™ were performed. The results showed that Fickian diffusion and drug particle properties (DPP) were responsible for the dissolution of the IR tablets, and that formulation factors (eg, coning) impacted dissolution only at lower rotation speeds. Dissolution was completely formulation controlled if extended release tablets were tested and DPP were not important. To demonstrate that disintegration is the most important dosage form attribute when dissolution is DPP controlled, disintegration, intrinsic dissolution and dissolution testing were performed in conventional and disintegration impacting media (DIM). Tablet disintegration was affected by DIM and model fitting to the Korsmeyer–Peppas equation showed a growing effect of the formulation in DIM. DDDPlus was able to predict tablet dissolution and the intrinsic dissolution profiles in conventional media and DIM. The study showed that disintegration has to occur before DPP-dependent dissolution can happen. The study suggests that disintegration can be used as performance test of rapidly disintegrating tablets beyond the FDA criteria. The scientific criteria and justification is that dissolution has to be DPP dependent, originated from active pharmaceutical ingredient characteristics and formulations factors have to be negligible.

Design: Collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer. Setting Nine European countries. Subjects 7148 cases Of lung cancer and 14 208 controls. Main outcome measures: Relative risks of lung cancer and radon gas concentrations in homes inhabited during the previous 5 - 34 years measured in becquerels (radon disintegrations per second) per cubic incite (Bq/m(3)) Of household air. Results: The mean measured radon concentration in homes of people in tire control group was 97 Bq/m(3), with 11 % measuring > 200 and 4 % measuring > 400 Bq/m(3). For cases of lung cancer the mean concentration was 104 Bq/m(3). The risk of lung cancer increased by 8. 4 % (95 % confidence interval 3. 0 % to 15. 8 %) per 100 Bq/m(3) increase in measured radon (P = 0. 0007). This corresponds to an increase of 16 % (5 % to 31 %) per 100 Bq/m(3) increase in usual radon-that is, after correction for the dilution caused by random uncertainties in measuring radon concentrations. The dose-response relation seemed to be linear with no threshold and remained significant (P= 0. 04) in analyses limited to individuals from homes with measured radon < 200 Bq/m(3). The proportionate excess risk {{did not differ significantly}} with study, age, sex, or smoking. In the absence of other causes of death, the absolute risks of lung cancer by age 75 years at usual radon concentrations of 0, 100, and 400 Bq/m(3) would be about 0. 4 %, 0. 5 %, and 0. 7 %, respectively, for lifelong non-smokers, and about 25 times greater (10 %, 12 %, and 16 %) for cigarette smokers.

40|$|Raman {{characterization}} {{revealed that}} the Keggin anion structure of H 4 PVMo 11 O 40 is inherently unstable upon heat treatment and loss of water. Vanadyl and molybdenyl species are expelled from the Keggin cage and defective Keggin structures are formed. These defective structures further disintegrate to presumably Mo 3 O 13 triads of the former Keggin. These Keggin fragments oligomerize at later stages to molybdenum oxygen clusters comparable to hepta- or octamolybdates. The final disintegration and structural reorganization product is MoO 3. This disintegration and recondensation process seems to be strongly affected by the heating rate and hence the presence {{of water in the}} sample. Only partial expulsion of V occurred under moderate dehydration conditions. The absence of water during heat treatments stabilizes the intermediate defective structures. Raman spectroscopy proved that free polyacids are unstable under catalytic partial oxidation conditions. Therefore, it can be suggested that intact Keggin anions are not the active species within an operating partial oxidation catalyst. From this Raman spectroscopy study it may be inferred that the structurally reorganized intermediates are relevant for the catalytic action. The Raman investigations of the HPA decomposition additionally revealed a dependency of the decomposition process on the reactive atmosphere and the presence of Cs. The presence of Cs led to a partial stabilization of the structural <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> of PVMo 11 and to the formation of the thermodynamically stable, but catalytically inactive Cs 3 -salt. Cs also inhibited the condensation of MoO 3 -type oxides. O 2 present in the gas phase also led to stabilization of the structural reorganization intermediates. Importantly, the presence of water did not lead to a stabilization of the intact Keggin structure. In contrast, hydrolysis of the Keggin anions seemed to be enhanced compared to the water-free situation. This observation is of high importance because water is added to the feed in industrial partial oxidation reactions. Hence, under industrial conditions, HPA-derived catalysts are inherently unstable and cannot contain intact Keggin anions at their active surface. Catalytic partial oxidation conditions even led to a more pronounced structural reorganization and amorphous suboxides of the MoO 3 -x type seemed to be formed. Hence, heteropolyacids have to be understood only as defined molecular precursor compoun...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{radiation}} {{levels are}} modified in regions where the oil industrial activity is more aggressive, {{such as in}} the Zulia State and the Orinoco´s Oil Belt. In these regions Venezuela is producing 1750 thousand barrels of oil from the near-to-the-surface or deep oil drilling, being its 2003 total OPEC market share 2932 thousand barrels of oil per day [1]. Petroleum constitutes an important source of energy and as the majority of natural sources it contains radionuclides and their <b>disintegration</b> <b>products.</b> The combustion of oil concentrates in the ashes those radioelements, which later enters the environment by different pathways producing adverse effects on the quality of man life. The concentration of radioelements varies greatly between oil fields, and then still requiring local survey studies in this area. Moreover due to the recent national interest in recycling processes, it becomes important to take care in the selection of materials that may contain by-products of industrial origin. In fact the oil ashes and other mining by-products are employable in the building industry. The concentration of radioactivity and heavy metals in crude oil, fuel oil Nº 6 and the ashes from power plants were determined. The analysis includes the two major thermoelectric power plants in Venezuela, Ricardo Zuluaga on the northern seaside of Caracas and Planta Centro on the littoral of Carabobo State. The study covers different samples: fuel oil No 6, heavy and medium petroleum as well as fuel Oil No 6 ashes. Gamma spectrometry was used for measuring 226 Ra, 214 Pb, 214 Bi, 228 Ac, 212 Pb, 212 Bi, 208 Tl and 40 K, and heavy metallic cations were determined by ICP-MS, which also allows the direct determination of 232 Th and 238 U. In this material (oil ashes) the total activity concentration is above 300 Bq. kg- 1. Some criteria from the literature have been compared and used to investigate the applicability of oil ashes as an additive for building materials. The combustion concentrate also heavy metal cations, as is the case of Pb, Ni, Mn, V, Zn among others. The found high metal concentrations can represent an important environmental risk since the high amount of sulfates in the Venezuelan oil and ashes contributes to their dissolution and bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|Compilation of a {{simplified}} geologic/geomorphic map onto digital terrain {{models of the}} Valles Marineris permitted an evaluation of elevations {{in the vicinity of}} the troughs and the calculation of depth of troughs below surrounding plateaus, thickness of deposits inside the troughs, volumes of void spaces above geologic/geomorphic units, and volumes of deposits. The central troughs north Ophir, north and central Candor, and north Melas Chasmata lie as much as 11 km below the adjacent plateaus. In Ophir and Candor chasmata, interior layered deposits reach 8 km in elevation. If the deposits are lacustrine and if all troughs were interconnected, lake waters standing 8 km high would have spilled out of Coprates Chasma onto the surrounding plateaus having surface elevations of only 4 - 5 km. On the other hand, the troughs may not have been interconnected at the time of interior-deposit emplacement; they may have formed isolated ancestral basins. The existence of such basins is supported by independent structural and stratigraphic evidence. The ancestral basins may have eventually merged, perhaps through renewed faulting, to form northern subsidiary troughs in Ophir and Candor Chasmata and the Coprates/north Melas/Ius graben system. The peripheral troughs are only 2 - 5 km deep, shallower than the central troughs. Chaotic terrain is seen in the peripheral troughs near a common contour level of about 4 km on the adjacent plateaus, which supports the idea of release of water under artesian pressure from confined aquifers. The layered deposits in the peripheral troughs may have formed in isolated depressions that harbored lakes and predated the formation of the deep outflow channels. (If these layered deposits are of volcanic origin, they may have been emplaced beneath ice in the manner of table mountains.) Areal and volumetric computations show that erosion widened the troughs by about one-third and that deposits occupy one-sixth of the interior space. Even though the volume eroded is larger than the volume deposited, topographic and geologic considerations imply that material eroded from trough walls was probably part of the interior layered deposits but not their sole source. Additional material may have come from subterranean piping, from reworking of local <b>disintegration</b> <b>products</b> on the floors, such as chaotic materials, or from eolian influx. But overall it is likely that the additional material is volcanic and that it forms mostly the upper, more diversely bedded layers of the interior deposits...|$|E
