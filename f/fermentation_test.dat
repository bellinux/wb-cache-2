50|$|In 1898 {{he became}} {{successor}} to G. van Overbeek de Meyer, as Professor in Hygiene and Forensic Medicine at Utrecht. His inaugural speech was entitled Over Gezondheid en Ziekten in Tropische Gewesten (On health and diseases in tropical regions). At Utrecht, Eijkman {{turned to the}} study of bacteriology, and carried out his well-known <b>fermentation</b> <b>test,</b> by means of which it can be readily established if water has been polluted by human and animal defecation containing coli bacilli. Another research was into the rate of mortality of bacteria as a result of various external factors, whereby he was able to show that this process could not be represented by a logarithmic curve. This was followed by his investigation of the phenomenon that the rate of growth of bacteria on solid substratum often decreases, finally coming to a halt. Beyerinck's auxanographic method was applied on several occasions by Eijkman, as for example during the secretion of enzymes which break down casein or bring about haemolysis, whereby he could demonstrate the hydrolysis of fats under the influence of lipases.|$|E

40|$|Succinic acid (SA) is a {{well-established}} chemical building block. Actinobacillus succinogenes fermentation {{is by far}} the most investigated route due to very promising high SA yield and titer on several sugars. This study contributes to include the SA production within the concept of biorefinery of lignocellulose biomass. The study was focused on the SA production by A. succinogenes DSM 22257 using sugars representative from lignocellulose hydrolysis— glucose, mannose, arabinose, and xylose—as carbon source. Single sugar batch <b>fermentation</b> <b>tests</b> and mixture sugar <b>fermentation</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out. All the sugars investigated were converted in succinic acid by A. succinogenes. The best fermentation performances were measured in tests with glucose as carbon source.

The sugar mixture <b>fermentation</b> <b>tests</b> highlighted the synergic effects of the copresence of the four sugars. Under the operating conditions tested, the final concentration of succinic acid in the sugar mixture test was larger (27 g/L) than that expected (25. 5 g/L) by combining the fermentation of the single sugar.

Isolates were presumptively identified based on colony morphology, Gram-staining properties and biochemical characteristics [oxidase, triple sugar iron (TSI), sulphur indole and motility (SIM), citrate, and urease tests].

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} the rapid xylose and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (MDG) fermentation tests in distinguishing Enterococcus gallinarum from Enterococcus faecium, 156 well-characterized clinical isolates of enterococci (55 E. gallinarum, 91 E. faecium, and 10 Enterococcus faecalis isolates) known to be of different clones were examined in a blinded fashion. Species identification was confirmed by PCR of the ddl ligase genes of E. faecium and E. faecalis and the vanC 1 gene of E. gallinarum. Xylose tests were performed with d-xylose tablets by using a heavy bacterial suspension and were interpreted after 2 h of incubation. Standard MDG fermentation tests were read after 24 h of incubation. The xylose <b>fermentation</b> <b>test</b> had a sensitivity of 98 % (54 of 55) and a specificity of 99 % (100 of 101) in distinguishing E. gallinarum from E. faecium and E. faecalis.
