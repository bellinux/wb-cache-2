5000|$|A musical {{keyboard}} is {{the set of}} adjacent <b>depressible</b> levers or keys on {{a musical}} instrument. Keyboards typically contain keys for playing the twelve notes of the Western musical scale, {{with a combination of}} larger, longer keys and smaller, shorter keys that repeats at the interval of an octave. Depressing a key on the keyboard causes the instrument to produce sounds, either by mechanically striking a string or tine (piano, electric piano, clavichord), plucking a string (harpsichord), causing air to flow through a pipe (organ), striking a bell (carillon), or, on electric and electronic keyboards, completing a circuit (Hammond organ, digital piano, synthesizer).

5000|$|Black seadevils are characterised by a gelatinous, mostly scaleless, globose body, a large head, {{and generous}} {{complement}} of menacingly large, sharp, glassy, fang-like teeth lining {{the jaws of}} a cavernous, oblique mouth. These teeth are <b>depressible</b> and present only in females. Some species have a scattering of epidermal spinules on the body, and the scales (when present) are conical, hollow, and translucent. Like other anglerfishes, black seadevils possess an illicium and esca; the former being a modified dorsal spine - the [...] "fishing rod" [...] - and the latter being the bulbous, bioluminescent [...] "fishing lure". The esca is simple in black seadevils (with either a conical terminus or anterior and posterior ridges in some species), and both it and the illicium are free of denticles.|$|E
5000|$|In females, {{the mouth}} {{is large and}} oblique. The subequal jaws are {{anteriorly}} lined with rows of numerous close-set, <b>depressible,</b> and retrorse teeth; vomerine teeth are absent. Footballfish females {{differ from those of}} other ceratioid families by their shortened, blunt snout; along with the chin, it is covered in sensory papillae. Originating above or slightly in advance of the small eye is an ilicium (the [...] "fishing rod") and at its end a bioluminescent, bulbous esca (the [...] "fishing lure", its light owing to symbiotic bacteria). Escal morphology varies between species, and {{it may or may not}} possess denticles or accessory appendages, the latter either branched or unbranched.

The hero prop may have legible writing, lights, moving parts, or other attributes or functions missing from a standard prop; a hero prop phaser from the Star Trek franchise, for example, might include a <b>depressible</b> trigger and a light-up muzzle and display panel (all of which would make the hero prop more expensive and less durable). The term is also used on occasion {{for any of the}} items that a main character would carry in film and television (which are often hero props in the first sense as well). The term may sometimes be used in stage production, as many props from film find their way into theatre from common rental and purchase shops.|$|E
5000|$|In adults, {{the largest}} two fangs {{of the lower}} jaw are so long, the fangtooths have evolved a pair of {{opposing}} sockets {{on either side of}} the brain to accommodate the teeth when the mouth is closed.

The juveniles are morphologically quite different - unlike the adults, they possess long spines on the head and preoperculum, larger eyes, a functional gas bladder, long and slender gill rakers, much smaller and <b>depressible</b> teeth, and are a light gray in colour. These differences once caused the two life stages to be classed as distinct species, with one in another genus; Caulolepis.|$|E
50|$|The female horned {{lantern fish}} {{measures}} up to 23 cm {{in length and}} is long and slender, with a large head and jaws of equal length. The jaws are filled with slender, recurved, <b>depressible</b> teeth of mixed large and small sizes. There is a large oval pit {{in front of each}} eye in specimens larger than 42 mm. The eye itself lies beneath the skin and appears through a translucent patch. The fish is reddish brown to black in color; its skin is covered with numerous close-set spines. The illicium ("fishing rod") and esca (lure) are attached to the snout. The esca has a fan-shaped appendage in front and another short appendage on the back; the tip is white with scattered large melanophores. There is a small hyoid barbel, although it is vestigial in adult females.|$|E
50|$|The marlin has two dorsal fins and two anal fins. The fins are {{supported}} by bony spines known as rays. Its first dorsal fin has 39 to 43 rays from front to back. Its second dorsal fin has six or seven rays. Its first anal fin, which is similar in shape and size to the second dorsal fin, has 13 to 16 rays, and the second anal fin has six or seven rays. The pectoral fins, which have 19 to 22 rays, are long and narrow and can be drawn in {{to the sides of}} the body. The pelvic fins are shorter than the pectorals, have a poorly developed membrane, and are <b>depressible</b> into ventral grooves. Its first anal fin, along with its pectoral and caudal fins, can be folded into grooves. This streamlines the fish and thereby reduces drag.|$|E
50|$|Adult female Phyllorhinichthys have a short, {{somewhat}} globulose body, entirely {{dark brown}} to black in color.

The illicium ("fishing rod") is short; the escal bulb ("lure") is internally pigmented on the upper half and unpigmented on the lower, and bears internally pigmented appendages with silvery tips. The most distinctive feature of the genus are a pair of translucent leaf-like flaps on the snout, forward of the eyes and flanking the esca. Each flap has a central opaque nerve fiber running from the base to the tip. In some specimens, there is another, smaller pair of similar flaps placed above the main pair.

5000|$|In 1996, the {{instructions}} to a handheld voice game called Bop It were copyrighted. This game {{was the first}} of what was later to become a series of Bop It games relying on the same set of basic patents. The original game, called simply Bop It, features three inputs — [...] "Bop it!" [...] (a <b>depressible</b> button), [...] "Twist it!" [...] (a twistable lever) and [...] "Pull it!" [...] (a pullable handle) — and three game modes: Solo Bop, Vox Bop and Beat Bop. Gameplay is predicated upon a player's efforts to match the commands issued by the Bop It in a timely manner by performing the task that is commanded. Thus if the Bop It is to call out [...] "Bop it!", the player must quickly depress the [...] "Bop It!" [...] button. If the Bop It is to call out [...] "Twist it!", the player must quickly turn the [...] "Twist it!" [...] crank. If the Bop It is to call out [...] "Pull it!", the player must quickly pull the [...] "Pull It!" [...] handle. Players' scores are announced at the end of gameplay with a cypher in which different tones represent different point values and the maximum possible score is 100. Thus, in the end sequence, each [...] "Pull It!" [...] whistle denotes 100 points, each ratchet denotes 10, and each drum denotes 1 point. This style of score-reporting would later recur in later Bop It models, and the Zing It spin off (see below). The same cypher values were used for all subsequent Bop It cyphers.

40|$|Laryngocele {{is a rare}} pathology, {{but because}} of their {{clinical}} evolution and the symptoms they generate, they should always {{be considered as a}} differential diagnosis when investigating neck masses. A laryngocele is basically a herniation of the mucosa of the laryngeal ventricle (Morgagni's ventricle) arising usually from the saccular region. This herniation may remain confined to the larynx - in which case the laryngocele is internal- or expand through the thyro-hyoid membrane into the structures of the neck - thus being called an external laryngocele. Usually the laryngocele has both an internal and external component thus being a mixed laryngocele. Diagnosis of laryngoceles still relies heavily on clinical signs such as tympanism, easily <b>depressible</b> neck mass, indirect laryngoscopy, but is now simplified by imagistic investigations (ultrasound, CT and MRI). However, the treatment of this condition is exclusively surgical and consists of total excision of the laryngocele, as well as proper identification of the point of origin from the saccule and also the final suture of the breach in order to prevent recurrence. Investigation of possible causes of obstruction of the laryngeal ventricle should always be performed (because of the possibility of an underlying malignancy) as well as a follow-up protocol of the patient, given the risk of relapse. We present a recently diagnosed case of a 32 year old man with mixed laryngocele, which we have operated in our clinic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe desmoplastic {{small round}} cell tumour {{is a rare}} and {{aggressive}} intra-abdominal neoplasia, with only 200 cases reported, and a higher incidence in men and predilection for the second decade of life. Histologically {{it is characterised by}} the presence of small nests of undifferentiated tumour cells, wrapped in fibrous desmoplastic stroma. Clinical caseA 24 -year-old male started with abdominal pain of 4 weeks onset in the right upper quadrant, colic type, sporadic, self-limiting and accompanied by early satiety, decreased appetite, and involuntary weight loss of 10 kg in 3 months. At the time of admission the abdomen was globular, with decreased peristalsis, soft, and <b>depressible.</b> Computed tomography of the abdomen showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal-pelvic cavity. A laparotomy was performed, with a subsequent omentum resection due to the presence of multiple tumours, which microscopically were characterised by groups of small, round, blue cells, separated by a desmoplastic stroma. The immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin (> 75 %), epithelial membrane antigen (> 75 %), CD 99 (> 50 %), and S 100 (25 %), concluding with an abdominal tumour of small, round, blue cells as a diagnosis. Chemotherapy treatment was initiated based on IMAP plus GM-CSF. ConclusionsThe desmoplastic small round cell tumour is a rare neoplasia, with diagnostic complexity and a lethal course. Its clinical presentation is unspecific. Histologically, it is classified as an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that shares similar characteristics with the family of the small and blue cells tumours...|$|E
40|$|Background: With the {{increasing}} number of cataract surgeries, incidence of posterior segment complications including rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is likely to rise. Scleral buckling (SB) surgery is an effective and less expensive option. The primary advantage of non-drainage procedure is avoidance of possible complications associated with trans-choroidal drainage. The aim of present study is to describe the clinical profile of subjects undergoing non-drainage SB surgery with solid silicone elements for RRD and analyze their treatment outcomes. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, non-randomized, interventional study at a tertiary care center. Three hundred and six eyes of 298 patients undergoing non-drainage SB surgery with solid silicone elements from year 2000 to 2006 were included. Inclusion criteria were primary RRD, peripheral <b>depressible</b> retinal break, media clarity affording peripheral retinal view and proliferative vitreo-retinopathy (PVR) up to grade C 2. Uni- and multivariate analyses was done to analyze factors affecting anatomical and visual outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 10. Results: Mean follow-up was 303 ± 393. 33 days. Primary anatomical success was obtained in 279 (91. 2 %) eyes; primary functional success in 286 (93. 5 %) eyes. PVR (grade B or C), intraocular pressure < 10 mm Hg and the inability to find a retinal break were significantly associated with final anatomical failure. Baseline vision ≤ 3 / 60 was significantly associated with poor visual recovery. Conclusions: SB surgery is reasonably safe and highly efficacious. Solid silicone elements are effective in non-drainage SB surgery. However, case selection is important...|$|E
