5|$|The philosopher Peter Singer {{considers}} that usually when we <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> action as conscientious {{in the critical}} sense we do {{so in order to}} deny either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.|$|E

50|$|A leap is {{converted}} into a rider by doubling its letter. For example, WW <b>describes</b> <b>a</b> rook, FF <b>describes</b> <b>a</b> bishop, and NN <b>describes</b> <b>a</b> nightrider. The second letter can instead be a number, which is a limitation on how many times the leap motion can be repeated; for example, W4 <b>describes</b> <b>a</b> rook limited to 4 spaces of movement.|$|R
50|$|Each {{coordinate}} xi may be parameterized {{a number}} of parameters t.

5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Several sources <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> {{incident}} which purportedly had {{an influence}} on Cadron-Jetté's future career. Between 1830 and 1832, while living in Montreal, Cadron-Jetté was visited at her house {{in the middle of}} the night by a prostitute who was seeking asylum from two sailors with intentions of violence. Cadron-Jetté hid the woman for the night in her cellar, fed her, and counselled her to change her way of life. Subsequently Cadron-Jetté received a letter from the woman informing her the woman had emigrated to the United States and made positive changes to her life, including marriage.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing to the camera. In a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> argument, which she has with an off-screen lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, as she sits tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling on the bed.|$|E

25|$|Interpretations where quantum {{mechanics}} is said to <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking. Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, {{rather than as an}} objective event.

25|$|The poets of Ettuthogai {{believed}} in the unique effects of a few deft touches of description, not in the elaborate and full descriptions of all the parts of a beautiful object or scene.

25|$|A polaron is a {{quasiparticle}} used in {{condensed matter physics}} {{to understand}} the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The polaron concept was first proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 to <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms move from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron's effective mass.|$|E
25|$|The terms “eraser” and “reader” {{have been}} {{associated}} with RNA modification. “Eraser” is a general term to <b>describe</b> <b>an</b> enzyme that de-methylates m6A.

50|$|In linguistics, a stative verb is {{one that}} <b>describes</b> <b>a</b> state of being, in {{contrast}} to a dynamic verb, which <b>describes</b> <b>an</b> action.

Many languages distinguish between these two types in terms of how they can be used grammatically.|$|R
