5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of the turret {{protruded}} above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by <b>flameproof</b> bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{with modern}} Estes-type rockets, the Jetex is quite different. It {{has a much}} gentler, cooler exhaust, so flight {{characteristics}} tend to feature gradual acceleration rather than firework-like performance. The cooler exhaust is easier to handle and does not require extensive <b>flameproofing</b> of the airframe. However, the fuel is more toxic and requires special handling to keep it dry and in working condition (the fuel is slightly deliquescent and will gradually absorb moisture from the atmosphere which quickly renders it inactive). As a result, Jetex were quite unreliable, often failing to ignite.|$|R
50|$|Bolivia mined about a {{fifth of}} the world's {{antimony}} in the late 1980s and was the leading producer among market economies. Private companies were responsible for all antimony production. The largest output came from the United Mining Company (Empresa Minera Unificada), which controlled the two largest antimony mines, located at Chilcobija and Caracota, both in Potosí Department. Medium and small miners generated an average of 9,500 tons of antimony a year in the mid-to late-1980s, all of which was exported. Antimony, a strategic mineral used in <b>flameproofing</b> compounds and semiconductors, was exported in concentrates, trioxides, and alloys to all regions of the world, with most sales going to Britain and Brazil. Antimony reserves in 1988 stood at 350,000 tons.|$|R
40|$|Fabrics knitted or woven from polybenzimidazole (PBI) fibers {{were treated}} to reduce {{flammability}} in oxygen atmospheres, particularly that of 5 psia oxygen. Bromination to approximately 15 % weight gain of such fabrics led to markedly lower burning rates; samples brominated to over 80 % weight gain were self-extinguishing in 5 psia oxygen. The loss in tensile strength of fabrics due to bromination was negligible although shrinkage was observed. Free fibers showed negligible losses on bromination. Treatment of PBI fabric with organophosphorus compounds also achieved self-extinguishing character in 5 psia oxygen but the enhanced <b>flameproofing</b> was largely lost on leaching.

50|$|No. 7052 {{locomotive}} was {{an experimental}} locomotive {{built by the}} Hunslet Engine Company at their Leeds works in 1934. It carried an original number of 7402 only within the works and was delivered as LMSR as number 7052. For six years it was used for shunting at Leeds before being loaned to the Air Ministry in 1940. It was loaned to the War Department between 1940-1942, which numbered it 24. It was withdrawn from LMS stock in December 1943 and sold for use at RNAD Broughton Moor, near Maryport, for which use it was <b>flameproofed</b> by Hunslet. After withdrawal in 1966, it was sold to a scrap metal company in Long Marston, which {{used it as a}} yard shunter for a further three years, after which it was scrapped.|$|R
5000|$|Jute has {{the ability}} to be blended with other fibers, both {{synthetic}} and natural, and accepts cellulosic dye classes such as natural, basic, vat, sulfur, reactive, and pigment dyes. As the demand for natural comfort fibers increases, the demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, some manufactures in the natural fiber industry plan to modernize processing with the Rieter's Elitex system. The resulting jute/cotton yarns will produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with caustic soda, crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid ammonia has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with <b>flameproofing</b> agents.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: High-performance {{materials}} for <b>flameproofing,</b> phosphates (polyphosphate and ammonium phosphate) were synthesized on viscose rayon felt. This surface reac-tion {{has the advantage}} of a nonblooming effect and an application in thermosetting plastics. Metal complexes have the effect of reducing the amount of smoke. Therefore, in the second step, transition-metal complexes were synthesized on the viscose rayon ammonium phosphate felt. This article focuses on the surface modification of phos-phates and metal complexes on viscose rayon. All reactions were confirmed by atten-uated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. As the concentrations of phosphoric acid and urea increased, the peak intensities of ammonium ion groups and phosphate groups greatly increased. The thermal properties of the synthesized materials were studied with thermogravimetric analysis and oxygen index testing. On the basis of the experimental results, the synthesized flame-retardancy materials showed excellent physicochemical and therma...|$|R
50|$|As mines {{increased}} {{in size and}} output, the aforementioned methods became impractical because of the distances and quantities of material involved, so larger carts would be used, hauled by narrow gauge diesel and electric locomotives (in coal mining operations, where gas that is flammable would present a problem, the locomotives would be <b>flameproof</b> or battery powered).

50|$|Actuators {{are used}} in {{applications}} where potentially explosive atmospheres may occur. This includes among others refineries, pipelines, {{oil and gas exploration}} or even mining. When a potentially explosive gas-air-mixture or gas-dust-mixture occurs, the actuator must not act as ignition source.

The fuel is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.|$|E
