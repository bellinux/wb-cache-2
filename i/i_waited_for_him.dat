500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time. Pirlo scored in the shoot-out with an audacious chipped penalty down {{the centre of the}} goal, also known as a Panenka. Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to move and hit it like that... It was easier for me to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E

60|$|At {{the time}} named the chaise drew {{up at the}} gates. Her ladyship was right--Sir Percival never came back. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> till the last moment, and waited in vain.|$|E

30|$|The {{enduring}} {{absence of}} men in this context has also impact on conjugal relations, which may influence the subsequent migration decisions and consolidation of such status quo. Anna, who is a 54 [*]year-old nurse and whose husband regularly since two decades spent {{part of the year}} working in Germany, says I have everything organized, what to do, where to go shop, I then sit with my friends over a coffee, that’s how it’s going, (…) sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to go.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to unleash}} {{the topic of}} the day, but he didn't seem to want to get going. Conversation languished. He stared {{straight}} ahead of him in a glassy sort of manner.|$|E
60|$|We bowed formally, as men bow who {{are about}} to cross swords, and whilst <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak, I noted that his face was pale and bore the impress of {{suppressed}} anger.|$|E
60|$|Why did he pause? Was he {{about to}} tell me he had {{discovered}} that my advances sprang from curiosity {{to know more about}} him than he was willing to reveal? <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to proceed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> scarce <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to finish. His pompous words stung me {{like the}} lash of a whip, and I gave no heed to his cloth as I answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> stood <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to explain. But as I did so I {{seemed to}} become aware that a voice, not Mr. Narrowpath's but a voice close at my ear, was repeating [...] "Toronto--Toronto--Toronto--" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{battle was}} over--unless the beast {{considered}} me fair prey, too. <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>him</b> with knife and bludgeon--also filched from a dead foeman; but he {{paid no attention}} to me, falling to work instead to devour one of the corpses.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to proceed, and in {{the pause}} that ensued, while he licked his dry lips with his tongue, the thing ambushed in his skull peered at me through his eyes and seemed almost {{on the verge of}} leaping out and pouncing upon me.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} {{impossible}} for any man, I care not what his form of speech might be, to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did, in these four words. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak again, but he rested his chin upon his hand and shaking his head twice or thrice fixed his eyes upon the fire.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on {{the pier}} while he went to see her ladyship. He joined me again with his bitterest smile. [...] "What did I tell you? She is not well enough to see me to-day. The doctor looks grave, and the {{companion}} puts her handkerchief to her eyes. We may be kept in this place for weeks to come." ...|$|E

60|$|The old hunter left me presently, {{and went}} outside. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> awhile <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{but as he}} did not return I lay down upon the bearskins and dropped to sleep. It seemed I had hardly closed my eyes when I felt {{a hand on my}} arm and heard a voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Reuben Dale, if {{your friend}} Jacob {{was the great}} Israel of Bible story, or even Moses himself, <b>I</b> would not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Don't {{interrupt}} me again, lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Catch him!" [...] said Nick, with {{a little}} excusable profanity; [...] "he went in {{at one end of}} such a warren and came out at another. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in two streets until an officious person chanced along and {{threatened}} to take me before the Alcalde. What the devil is that you have got in your hand, Davy?" [...] he demanded, raising his head.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} him to where, in a dark corner of the great dome-shaped hall, a wide cushioned lounge was set against the wall. He seated himself and motioned me to follow his example. For several moments he remained silent, twisting a cigarette with thin nervous fingers stained yellow with nicotine. Every {{now and then he}} glanced furtively around. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak. He was Lady Angela's brother, but I disliked and distrusted him.|$|E
6000|$|... "These days, sir, {{despite all}} their {{harrowing}} anxiety, {{despite all the}} pain they held for the girl whom I grew to love more and more with each passing hour, have been the happiest of my life!" [...] He kept silence for a long time; so long that, as <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak, with my heart beating, I {{began to wonder if}} my frankness had been too effusive. At last he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I got Craig all right," [...] he replied. [...] "He {{came to the}} Servants' Club where <b>I</b> was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> My luck's out, though. The {{place was}} burnt to the ground last night. I saved his life and then the brute gave me away to the police. I had to make my escape as best I could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it is possible," [...] said he. [...] "I {{took his}} consent to our {{marriage}} by main force from <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to give it. When, in fact, he refused it, I just snatched it from him, and I'll defy him now {{to win it}} back from me. I {{think that is what}} he most resents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will," [...] Dolly answered. [...] "You're {{strong enough}} and wiry enough to outlive anything. [...] . But I wrote to Walter from Sir Anthony's this morning, and told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> if <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> forever. <b>For,</b> of course, while YOU live, I couldn't think of marrying him. I couldn't think of burdening {{an honest man}} with such a {{mother-in-law}} as you are!" ...|$|R
60|$|To my surprise, Chainbearer {{expressed}} no delight at this announcement. I {{remarked that}} he had said nothing to me on his favorite old subject of my marrying his niece, since my arrival at the Nest; and now, when I was not only so ready, but so anxious to meet his wishes, I could plainly see that he drew back from my proposals, and wished {{they had not been}} made. Amazed, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak with a disappointment and uneasiness I cannot express.|$|E
6000|$|... "Timothy?" [...] said he at once. He thinks Timothy {{was a real}} boy, and is very {{jealous of}} him. He turned his back to me, and stood alone and wept passionately, while <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> You may be sure I begged his pardon, and made it all right with him, and had him {{laughing}} and happy again before I let him go. But nevertheless what I said was true. David is not my boy, and he will forget. But Timothy would have remembered.|$|E
6000|$|We had {{remained}} {{standing at the}} point where I had gone round to meet him, and it seemed, in the awkward silence that now followed, as if I were rooted there. I would very willingly have said something leading, for my own sake, if not for his, but I had nothing in mind but that I had better keep there, and so <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak. I believed he was beating about the bush in his own thoughts, to find some indirect or sinuous way of getting at what he wanted to know, and that it was only because he failed that he asked bluntly, [...] "March, do you know where my daughter is?" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{you know}} him and can speak his {{language}} carry my thanks to him, {{and tell him that}} <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> seven days <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to return.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what of Kallikrates, Allan? Is it {{not enough}} that for my sins, with tears, empty longings and repentance, <b>I</b> must <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{through all the}} weary centuries? Must I also wear the chains of this Kallikrates, to whom I owe many a debt, when he is far away? Say, didst thou see him in that Heaven of thine, Allan, for there perchance he dwells?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want that}} man," [...] he {{declared}} with shut teeth. [...] "I want him {{so badly that}} I'd forfeit five hundred dollars sooner than miss him. Slip forward, Gillow, as much out of sight as you can, and hide yourself {{on the other side}} of the ladder. Mattawa and <b>I</b> will <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> here, and among us three we ought to make sure of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you are mistaken in its application. You think I {{followed}} the man lately deceased as pertinaciously as you followed me. You are wrong. When you met me in Chancery Lane I was {{in pursuit of}} a gentleman to whose case I have devoted myself for several days. It has interested me much. There is no reason why I should conceal his name. It is one honoured in this country, Sir Wilfrid Lawson. He looked in on his man of business, which delayed me at the shop-window of which you have spoken. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and I thought I had him this time. But you see I lost him in the Strand, after all." ...|$|E
60|$|In vain <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to start}} some popular song. His records were {{only of the}} best, and the care he took {{of them was a}} revelation. He handled each one reverently, as a sacred thing, untying and unwrapping it and {{brushing}} it with a fine camel's hair brush while it revolved and ere he placed the needle on it. For a time all I could see was the huge brute hands of a brute-driver, with skin off the knuckles, that expressed love in their every movement. Each touch on the discs was a caress, and while the record played he hovered over it and dreamed in some heaven of music all his own.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for us to discern the Indian's trail in the elastic moss, which, like a thick carpet, covered every rock and fallen tree, {{as well as the}} earth. Nevertheless, I did occasionally detect the track of a man, and I gave myself some credit for it. I carried my whole load at once, a heavy knapsack, and a large rubber bag containing our bread and a blanket, swung on a paddle, in all about sixty pounds; but my companion preferred to make two journeys by short stages while <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> We could not be sure that we were not depositing our loads each time farther off from the true path.|$|E
6000|$|BEGGAR [...] Ay, Sir, there's nobody {{that feels}} for us. [...] Why now--but {{yesterday}} I overtook [...] A blind old Greybeard and accosted him, [...] I' th' name {{of all the}} Saints, and by the Mass [...] He should have used me better!--Charity! [...] If you can melt a rock, he is your man; [...] But I'll be even with him--here again [...] Have <b>I</b> been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{probably}} playing truant {{in the empty}} upper rooms, as usual. <b>I</b> can't <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> any longer, so I'm doing his work myself," [...] answered Miss Dickenson, who was tenderly winding a wet bandage round her Juno's face, one side of which was so much plumper than the other that {{it looked as if}} the Queen of Olympus was being hydropathically treated for a severe fit of ague.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Monsieur George, “and I {{hope you}} will consent to act for me altogether. First of all, pray, let him know by wire that <b>I</b> am <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> This {{will be enough to}} fetch him down here, I can assure you. You may ask him also to bring two friends with him. I don’t intend this to be an affair for Parisian journalists to write {{paragraphs}} about.” ...|$|R
