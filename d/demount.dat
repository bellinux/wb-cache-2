25|$|On 4 October 1939 in Berlin, Adolf Hitler {{issued the}} order {{to blow up the}} Royal Castle. On 10 October 1939, special German units, under the {{supervision}} of history and art experts (Dr. Dagobert Frey, an art historian at the University of Wrocław; Gustaw Barth, the director of museums in Wrocław, and Dr. Joseph Mühlmann, an art historian from Vienna) started to <b>demount</b> floor, marbles, sculptures and stone elements such as fireplaces or moulds. The artefacts were taken to Germany or stored in Kraków's warehouses. Many of them were also seized by various Nazi dignitaries who resided in Warsaw. The Castle was totally emptied. Disobeying German orders, despite the danger of being shot, Polish museum staff and experts in art restoration managed to save many of the works of art from the castle, as well as fragments of the stucco-work, the parquet floors, the wood panelling, and more which were later used in the reconstruction. The great service done to Poland by Professor Stanisław Lorentz, in leading this campaign to save the castle's treasures, is well known. Wehrmacht sappers then bored tens of thousands of holes for dynamite charges in the stripped walls.|$|E

40|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} (GaAs) wafer manufacturing {{often requires}} {{the reduction in}} overall wafer thickness {{in order to allow}} the device to achieve its intended performance specifications. GaAs wafers are extremely difficult to handle when they become very thin, so a carrier wafer is often used to support the wafer during thinning and subsequent operations. The GaAs wafer must be temporarily bonded to this carrier and then be able to be demounted cleanly and efficiently.

40|$|A major {{objective}} of missions to Mars {{will be to}} conduct reconnaissance and to explore the surface. Systems that will allow astronauts to operate freely in the Martian environment are discussed. Special consideration {{is given to the}} design of manned rovers and to the safety and science issues involved. To conduct a wide-ranging exploration, a sortie time of at least 7 Martian days and an adequate fuel/power source are needed for at least a 100 -km range. The concept of a hybrid rover is proposed, that will fulfill these requirements. In the Hybrid Rover, the driver of the vehicle will transport a space-suit-wearing astronaut to the area of interest, where the 'suitman' will <b>demount</b> and conduct typical field geological exploration, while the driver will continue to reconnoiter the area, and/or conduct independent sampling sorties using manipulator arms. Attention is also given to the design of a life support system. For fulfilling the power requirements of transportation and a power-intensive closed-cycle life supporting system, nuclear power is being considered as one of the possible power sources...|$|E

40|$|Trace {{materials}} often {{establish the}} most physical information of a crime. Textile fibres {{have long been}} recognised as being able to provide important evidential information and are the most frequently encountered type of trace evidence recovered in relation to crime. A well established sequential examination protocol has been developed for the examination of fibres. This is based on microscopy of fibres mounted on glass slides with a suitable mountant and a glass cover slip. In this protocol, fibres are both identified and features such as colour are observed. Comparison microscopy is also conducted between recovered fibres and fibres from known sources. However, for some examinations, especially of manmade fibres, fibres {{may have to be}} removed from the mountant for examination such {{as is the case with}} FTIR. In an ideal examination protocol, it would be desirable to gain the maximum information from mounted fibres. With respect to Raman spectroscopy, this has proven to be a useful tool in the identification of fibres and that analysis of their dye components. However, its implementation into the general routine protocol of fibre dyes has not yet been completely incorporated by laboratories. This is partly due to variations in the way fibres are presented to the instrument. For Raman spectroscopy, it is common practice to <b>demount</b> the fibre and suspend it over tape on an aluminium covered slide. This can pose a serious risk for recovered evidence, as there is potential for loss of sample, particularly where small fibres like cotton are concerned. The chemicals used to dissolve the mountant, so that fibres can be recovered, may also have adverse effects on the fibre dye or substrate. It would be highly desirable, to keep the fibres mounted on glass under a glass cover slip. Not only would evidence be maintained, but also sample preparation would be reduced, thereby increasing the efficiency of fibre examinations. Hence the primary focus of this study was to examine the effect that glass and mountant have on Raman spectroscopy and whether a meaningful Raman spectrum can be obtained from mounted fibres. This was a baseline study, in which Raman spectra were interpreted at the raw data level for visual differences. Using a Renishaw InVia Reflex Raman Microscope with a 785 nm laser attachment, successful Raman spectra were obtained from samples mounted on glass. This was dependent upon a number of factors including dye shade and focal position...|$|E
