5|$|Byne's disease, more {{accurately}} known as Bynesian decay, is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing chemical reaction) which often attacks mollusk shells {{that are in}} storage or on display <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain still <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{and have}} a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, {{they are capable of}} quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} enter as {{dissolved}} organic carbon through rivers and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|The cafe {{originated}} {{when friends}} from the Rainbow Family began {{to communicate with each}} other about a possible response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Rainbow Family are best known for the Rainbow Gathering, a large, primitive type camping event in which up to 20,000 people attend. Those who attend these gatherings have become skilled at making and serving food for extremely large groups of people <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and in very basic situations.|$|E
5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E

5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E
5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is {{an easy target for}} its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} cell {{continued to}} intensify throughout the afternoon. The Bureau of Meteorology then recognised it as a supercell, which often bring erratic developments and often last <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The storm dropped hailstones which were between eight and ten centimeters around Maroochydore, on the Sunshine Coast, damaging {{the roofs of}} around 80 houses in the area. The hail also damaged aircraft at a local airport and dented cars, as well as inflicting injuries {{to a handful of}} swimmers at beaches near Maroochydore.|$|E
50|$|Blisterponds are {{the closest}} that any blimp {{comes to a}} {{permanent}} residence, and these specialised chambers {{can be used for}} short, recuperative rests or <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> stasis.|$|R

5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks, a {{commentator}} on class who attended an Episcopal prep school, writes that WASPs {{took pride in}} [...] "good posture, genteel manners, personal hygiene, pointless discipline, the ability to sit still <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time." ...|$|R

5|$|Ernst Lindemann met Charlotte Weil (née Fritsche; 1899–1979), a Berlin singer, in {{the spring}} of 1920. The couple married on 1 February 1921, and they had a daughter, Helga Maria, born on 26 February 1924. Lindemann's job as a naval officer demanded that he be away from his family <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This proved to be too {{demanding}} on the marriage, and they were divorced in 1932. Lindemann was engaged again on 20 July 1933 to his youngest brother's sister-in-law, Hildegard Burchard. Hildegard was 14 years younger than Lindemann. They married on 27 October 1934 in the St. Annen Church in Berlin–Dahlem. The ceremony was performed by Martin Niemöller, a founder of the Confessing Church, later imprisoned as an anti-Nazi. They had a daughter, Heidi Maria, born on 6 July 1939.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all {{have the capacity to}} hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Continuous (as {{opposed to}} [...] "momentary") {{implies that the}} device can {{function}} at this power level <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time; that heat can be removed {{at the same rate}} it is generated, without temperature building up to the point of damage.|$|R
50|$|For centuries, the {{strategic}} {{location of the}} current province made it a much-coveted region among Europe's major powers. Romans, Habsburg Spaniards, Prussians, Habsburg Austrians and French have all ruled parts <b>of</b> Limburg. <b>For</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> history the region was not united under the same rule.|$|R
50|$|Dr. A. C. Mandal’s {{research}} from the 1960s and 1970s concluded that a forward sloping seat did effectively tip the pelvis forward, opening up the angle between torso and thigh, and thereby correctly aligns the spine, indicating a more suitable position <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> sitting.|$|R
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
5|$|The family Cucurbitaceae {{has many}} species used as human food. Cucurbita species are some {{one of the}} most {{important}} of those, with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and seeds of cultivated varieties are quite edible and need little or no preparation. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, inedible skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into pumpkin seed oil, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared.|$|E
5|$|The moths migrate in {{response}} {{to changes in the}} host plants. Chrysiridia larvae defoliate the whole plant, and even eat the flowers and fruit, and thus have a considerable negative impact on the reproduction and survival of seedlings. The plants probably react by changing their nutrient and secondary compound levels, becoming toxic to the larvae and causing high mortality. Omphalea populations that are not damaged by moths <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> have lower toxicity. These factors cause mass increases in local population, followed by sudden crashes. The population crashes might result from increased larval mortality, but are more likely caused by the emigration of the adult moths. Through semiochemicals, the plant may recruit hymenopteran parasitoids as a protection, hence playing a role in the population dynamics of the moth.|$|E
50|$|This bird, {{not always}} seen, may sing <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time; {{it appears to}} be {{endlessly}} repeating the same question and answer. It holds the record for most songs given in a single day among bird species, by singing more than 20,000 songs in one day.|$|R
25|$|Some {{forms of}} {{polyandry}} {{appear to be}} associated with a perceived need to retain aristocratic titles or agricultural lands within kin groups, and/or because of the frequent absence, <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods,</b> <b>of</b> a man from the household. In Tibet the practice was particularly popular among the priestly Sakya class.|$|R
