25|$|<b>Full</b> <b>mouth</b> {{disinfection}} protocols are favoured by some clinicians. There is {{no evidence}} that <b>full</b> <b>mouth</b> disinfection or <b>full</b> <b>mouth</b> scaling protocols improve the outcome when compared to standard mechanical scaling and root planing.|$|E
25|$|Dosage due to dental X-rays varies {{significantly}} {{depending on}} the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem. A <b>full</b> <b>mouth</b> series of X-rays may result in an exposure of up to 6 (digital) to 18 (film) mrem, for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem.|$|E
500|$|Her eyes gaze {{downward}} in humility, {{in contrast}} to her relatively extravagant clothes. The piety of her expression is achieved through motifs common to van der Weyden's work. Her eyes and nose are elongated and her lower lip made fuller {{by the use of}} tone and pronounced finish. Some vertical lines around these features are emphasised, while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised. In addition the contours of her face are highlighted {{in a manner that is}} slightly unnatural and abstract, and outside the usual spatial constraints of 15th-century human representation. This methodology was described by art historian Erwin Panofsky: [...] "Rogier concentrated on certain salient features—salient both from a physiognomical and psychological point of view—which he expressed primarily by lines." [...] Her high forehead and <b>full</b> <b>mouth</b> have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual, ascetic, and passionate, symbolic of [...] "an unresolved conflict in her personality". Panofsky refers to a [...] "smouldering excitability".|$|E
5000|$|Cetacaine {{compared}} {{to some of}} the leading competitors is considered by most a cheaper option. [...] For the spray option the bottle containing 56g can dispense 100 doses and only cost the dentist $0.79 per dose. The liquid Cetacaine that comes in the 30 g bottle can dose 73 <b>full</b> <b>mouths</b> {{at a cost of about}} $0.75 per dose.|$|R
2500|$|The bust has {{a rather}} stoic facial {{expression}} {{similar to the}} [...] done by portrait painter George W. Morrison. However, Dexter's portrait gives Willard a <b>fuller</b> <b>mouth</b> and a more narrow nose than the Morrison painting. [...] His hair style is similar in both works, it is parted on the proper left hand side and combed over the crown of the head. His hair has long curling locks [...] that add volume to the sides and {{back of the head}} and hang just below his earlobes. This style is in keeping with men's hairstyles in the late 1850s early 1860s.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{a change}} in her appearance, as her {{original}} face had a wide, tilted nose, a prominent chin and thin lips, but the donated face gave her a straight and narrow nose, a smaller chin and a <b>fuller</b> <b>mouth.</b> In 2008, Dinoire admitted {{in an interview that}} she sometimes struggled to accept the appearance of her transplanted face, as she had expected it to look more like her own, saying: [...] "It takes an awful lot of time to get used to someone else's face." [...] In the same interview, she reported that full sensitivity had returned to her face.|$|R
500|$|Several {{film critics}} have {{described}} Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, [...] "In this slightly modernized {{version of the}} story, Mulan... {{is something of a}} rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes." [...] Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that [...] "Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy," [...] observing {{the way in which the}} character speaks using a <b>full</b> <b>mouth.</b> Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; broad shoulders and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her [...] "traditionally slim Disney waist." [...] Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as [...] "brainy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rose's thoughts, {{ideas and}} {{concerns}} {{were taken into}} consideration {{when it came to}} finalizing Tiana's design. [...] "I … said I wanted it to look like she ate and wasn’t skinny, and she has a <b>full</b> <b>mouth</b> and a little round nose and curly hair and these are all things that made her look distinctly herself," [...] she said. Rose didn't want Tiana to resemble [...] "a cookie-cutter princess who had been coloured in brown. When I saw {{her for the first time}} and realized how much she looked like me I was really blown away." [...] Rose also served as a form of visual, live-action reference for supervising animator Mark Henn as he worked on Tiana, videotaping her as she recorded her lines and incorporating some of her distinct characteristics, such as her dimples and left-handedness, into Tiana's design.|$|E

6000|$|Julia had {{at first}} been cold {{and hard to}} Malchus, but {{gradually}} her manner had changed, and she now spoke kindly and condescendingly to him, and would sometimes sit looking at him from under her dark eyebrows with an expression which Malchus altogether failed to interpret. Clotilde was more clear sighted. One day meeting Malchus alone in the atrium she said to him: [...] "Malchus, {{do you know that}} I fear Julia is learning to love you.

60|$|When Helena came back, she sat {{opposite}} {{to him to}} see him. His naïve look of joy was very sweet to her. His eyes were dark blue, showing the fibrils, like a purple-veined flower at twilight, and somehow, mysteriously, joy seemed to quiver in the iris. Helena appreciated him, feature by feature. She liked his clear forehead, with its thick black hair, and his <b>full</b> <b>mouth,</b> and his chin. She loved his hands, that were small, but strong and nervous, and very white. She liked his breast, that breathed so strong and quietly, and his arms, and his thighs, and his knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I've {{seen him}} before," [...] replied Mrs. Dawes indifferently, as she {{shook hands with}} him. She had scornful grey eyes, a skin like white honey, and a <b>full</b> <b>mouth,</b> with a {{slightly}} lifted upper lip that {{did not know whether}} it was raised in scorn of all men or out of eagerness to be kissed, but which believed the former. She carried her head back, as if she had drawn away in contempt, perhaps from men also. She wore a large, dowdy hat of black beaver, and a sort of slightly affected simple dress that made her look rather sack-like. She was evidently poor, and had not much taste. Miriam usually looked nice.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{not very}} tall, and pale, with thick {{chestnut}} hair, irregular features, and a wide, <b>full</b> <b>mouth.</b> She was like a small bird. He often called her a [...] "robinet". Though naturally rather quiet, he would sit and chatter with her for hours telling her about his home. The girls all liked to hear him talk. They often gathered in a little circle while {{he sat on a}} bench, and held forth to them, laughing. Some of them regarded him as a curious little creature, so serious, yet so bright and jolly, and always so delicate in his way with them. They all liked him, and he adored them. Polly he felt he belonged to. Then Connie, with her mane of red hair, her face of apple-blossom, her murmuring voice, such a lady in her shabby black frock, appealed to his romantic side.|$|E

60|$|As the archdeacon {{stood up}} to make his speech, erect {{in the middle of}} that little square, he looked like an ecclesiastical statue placed there, as a fitting {{impersonation}} of the church militant here on earth; his shovel hat, large, new, and well-pronounced, a churchman's hat in every inch, declared the profession as plainly as does the Quaker's broad brim; his heavy eyebrows, large open eyes, and <b>full</b> <b>mouth</b> and chin expressed the solidity of his order; the broad chest, amply covered with fine cloth, told how well to do was its estate; one hand ensconced within his pocket, evinced the practical hold which our mother church keeps on her temporal possessions; and the other, loose for action, was ready to fight if need be in her defence; and, below these, the decorous breeches, and neat black gaiters showing so admirably that well-turned leg, betokened the decency, the outward beauty and grace of our church establishment.|$|E
60|$|As is {{occasionally}} the case among Zulu women, she was beautiful--so beautiful that {{the sight of}} her went straight to the white man's heart, for a moment causing the breath to catch in his throat. Her dress was very simple. On her shoulders, hanging open in front, lay a mantle of soft white stuff edged with blue beads, about her middle was a buck-skin moocha, also embroidered with blue beads, while round her forehead and left knee were strips of grey fur, and on her right wrist a shining bangle of copper. Her naked bronze-hued figure was tall and perfect in its proportions; while her face had little in common with that of the ordinary native girl, showing as it did strong traces of the ancestral Arabian or Semitic blood. It was oval in shape, with delicate aquiline features, arched eyebrows, a <b>full</b> <b>mouth,</b> that drooped a little at the corners, tiny ears, behind which the wavy coal-black hair hung down to the shoulders, and the very loveliest pair of dark and liquid eyes {{that it is possible to}} imagine.|$|E
60|$|Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft {{hair and}} a small <b>full</b> <b>mouth.</b> Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, {{had a habit of}} glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs. Mooney had first sent her {{daughter}} to be a typist in a corn-factor's office but, as a disreputable sheriff's man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides, young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away. Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs. Mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them meant business. Things went on so {{for a long time and}} Mrs. Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young men. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel.|$|E
