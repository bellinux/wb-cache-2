The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's <b>fire</b> <b>sale</b> helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E

The Marlins invited Fernández to spring training but sent him to minor league camp before the season began.

Also, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria hoped that promoting Fernández would buy him goodwill with the fans, following a <b>fire</b> <b>sale</b> the previous offseason. He was planned to be limited to approximately 150 to 170 innings during the 2013 season in order to protect his development.

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>sales</b> {{that occur}} during crises beg the {{question}} of why sufficient outside capital does not move in quickly to take advantage of <b>fire</b> <b>sales,</b> or in other words, why outside capital is so "slow-moving". We propose an answer to this puzzle {{in the context of an}} equilibrium model of capital allocation. Keeping capital in liquid form in anticipation of possible <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> entails costs in terms of foregone profitable investments. Set against this, those same profitable investments are rendered illiquid in future due to agency problems embedded with expertise. We show that a robust consequence of this trade-off between making investments today and waiting for arbitrage opportunities in future is the combination of occasional <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> and limited stand-by capital that moves in only if fire-sale discounts are sufficiently deep. An extension of our model to several types of investments gives rise to a novel channel for contagion where sufficiently adverse shocks to one type can induce <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> in other types that are fundamentally unrelated, provided arbitrage activity in these investments is sourced from a common pool of capital. ...|$|R

25|$|Rockefeller saw the SIC as {{the ideal}} {{mechanism}} for achieving another goal: A monopoly on oil refining in Cleveland. Once the SIC had severely weakened his competitors, Standard Oil would buy out the city's 26 major oil refining companies at <b>fire</b> <b>sale</b> prices. The monopoly would allow Standard Oil to dominate the national refining market, garner significantly higher profits, and drive even more competitors out of business. With higher profits, Standard Oil could then rapidly expand, becoming the nation's dominant oil refining company. To make the purchases, Standard Oil needed cash. To secure the cash, Rockefeller allowed Amasa Stone, Stillman Witt, Benjamin Brewster, and Truman P. Handy—all of whom were officers in Cleveland banks—to buy shares in Standard Oil at par in December 1871. Witt and the other bankers used their influence at their own and other banks to give Rockefeller the financial backing he needed.

D.C. area lawmakers pressed the advisory panel to act immediately on the Old Post Office.

40|$|Most {{treatments}} of financial regulation worry about {{threats to the}} banking system and the economy from defaults or credit crunches. This paper argues that the recent crisis points to <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> through capital markets as another source of financial and economic instability. Accounting for <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> implies several changes to the standard approach. First, if there are three channels of instability, then three regulatory tools are needed to deliver stability. Second, if only a single capital tool and a single liquidity tool are available, {{then there is a}} risk that using them pushes activity into the shadow banking system. Third, liquidity requirements on the asset side of bank balance sheets are conceptually different from liquidity requirements on the liability side. The paper starts with a review of the recent theoretical work on <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> that form the building blocks for a next generation of models of the financial system. A summary of some evidence suggesting that <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> were present in the crisis is offered. Next, the paper outlines a general equilibrium framework {{that can be used to}} think about a financial system in which default, credit crunches, and <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> are all possible. The paper concludes with a discussion of the regulatory options and some speculation on how such a framework could be extended. ...|$|R

[...] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies. [...] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years. [...] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions {{in an attempt to}} remain solvent. [...] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds. [...] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.

However, the Phillies management (including general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. and president Dave Montgomery) did not think a <b>fire</b> <b>sale</b> would benefit the organization. According to Amaro: [...] Marlon Byrd and closer Jonathan Papelbon were top trade candidates because of other teams' needs and the fact that neither had no-trade clauses. Papelbon expressed a willingness to be traded, saying that it was [...] "mind-boggling" [...] to him that some players would prefer to remain on a losing team. According to a USA Today article: [...] Although Amaro announced Cole Hamels' availability, his high asking price hindered the possibility of a deal. Cliff Lee had been available, but after re-injuring his elbow (and probably missing the rest of the season) the possibility of a deal evaporated. The non-waiver trade deadline passed with no trades by the Phillies. Amaro was harshly criticized for holding onto Papelbon, Byrd, Hamels, Lee, A. J. Burnett and Antonio Bastardo. Although they did not make a deal before the non-waiver trading deadline, the team could still move a player on waivers; they did so, trading Roberto Hernandez to the Dodgers on August 7 for two players to be named later.

But when the strike ended eight months later, by the order of United States federal judge Sonia Sotomayor, the failure to implement strong revenue sharing was a major blow to the Expos. The team had already built a reputation as a penny-pinching organization (Larry Walker once complained in the media that the team asked the players to buy their own vitamins), with the second-lowest payroll in MLB in 1994. Following the strike, the team initiated a <b>fire</b> <b>sale</b> of players: Ken Hill, John Wetteland and Marquis Grissom were traded while Larry Walker was allowed to leave as a free agent. Moisés Alou, Pedro Martínez and Mel Rojas would eventually follow. In his book, My Turn At Bat, Brochu argued that the <b>fire</b> <b>sale</b> was the only viable option, since his partners in the ownership group were not interested in financing the team's losses. Brochu estimated that had he tried to keep the 1994 team together, the Expos would have lost $25 million in 1995, which would have pushed the franchise to the edge of bankruptcy. [...] He claimed that he would have certainly kept Hill, Wetteland, Grissom and Walker had the partners been willing to put up the money necessary to keep them in Montreal. [...] When Brochu told Malone that Hill, Wetteland, Grissom and Walker all had to go, Malone tried to persuade Brochu to keep at least one of them.

40|$|The {{events from}} the 2007 - 2009 {{financial}} crisis have raised {{concerns that the}} failure of large financial institutions can lead to destabilizing <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> of assets. The risk of <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> is related to exemptions from bankruptcy's automatic stay provision enjoyed {{by a number of}} financial contracts, such as repo.

In this paper, we construct a model of repo transactions, and consider the effects of changing the bankruptcy rule regarding the automatic stay on the activity in repo and real investment markets. We find that exempting repos from the automatic stay is beneficial for creditors who that hold the borrowers' collateral. Although the exemption may increase the size of the repo market by enhancing the liquidity of collateral, it can also lead to subsequent damaging <b>fire</b> <b>sales</b> that are associated with reductions in real investment activity. Hence, policy makers face a trade-off between the benefits of investment activity and the benefits of liquid markets for collateral...|$|R
