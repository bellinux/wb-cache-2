5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every {{individual}} was encouraged to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E

Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E

5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J. Simpson for the role, but Cameron did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Simpson would be believable as a killer.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a good}} deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E
5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it.

5|$|I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> {{talking about}} it trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah.

There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed.

But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging {{the preservation of the}} walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E

Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E
