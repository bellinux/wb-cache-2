5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the field went back to green on lap 84, Jacques Villeneuve had made up one of <b>his</b> <b>laps.</b> He was running 20th, one lap down.|$|R
50|$|Parnelli Jones {{becomes the}} first driver to break the 150 mph barrier. <b>His</b> first <b>lap</b> was run at 150.729 mph, a new all-time one-lap track record. All four of <b>his</b> <b>laps</b> were over 150 mph, and his four-lap average came in at 150.370 mph. Jones was rewarded by having 150 silver dollars poured into his helmet by Phil Hedback of Bryant Heating & Cooling.|$|R
50|$|Luyendyk {{continued}} {{to perform well}} at Indianapolis, scoring pole positions in 1993, 1997 and 1999, and retiring from the race while leading on three occasions. In 1995, Luyendyk controlled the race early until an incident with Scott Sharp put him several laps down. For {{the rest of the}} race, Luyendyk was able to make up all <b>his</b> <b>laps</b> and barely beat winner Jacques Villeneuve at the stripe to get <b>his</b> final <b>lap</b> back and finish on the lead lap.|$|R
5|$|Just as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set {{the fastest}} times in Q2 as well. Verstappen {{was unable to}} {{continue}} and therefore only four of the running cars were to be eliminated. Those were Hülkenberg, the second Toro Rosso of Sainz, Pastor Maldonado and Fernando Alonso, who said <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> was likely the best he had ever driven at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E
50|$|At 12:50 p.m., Billy Boat crashed for {{the third}} time of the month. On <b>his</b> warmup <b>lap,</b> he spun on cold tires in turn 2, and hit the wall on the backstretch. Minutes later, Robbie Buhl crashed on <b>his</b> warmup <b>lap</b> as well.|$|R

50|$|Rookie Tony Adamowicz {{suffered}} {{bad luck}} during his attempt. On <b>his</b> first qualifying <b>lap,</b> the yellow light was {{turned on by}} error. He slowed down, and <b>his</b> first <b>lap</b> was turned in at 160.829 mph. The green light came back on moments later, and he completed the run. Though he had two laps over 166 mph, <b>his</b> first <b>lap</b> pulled <b>his</b> average down to 164.820 mph, and made him the second-slowest car {{in the field for}} the day.|$|R
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|Detective J.D.

When she realizes his ruse, she pours a cup of hot coffee in <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> Undercover officer Belker (Bruce Weitz) arrests a bald-headed pickpocket at the hostage situation and processes him at the precinct. Belker's proclivity for biting the ankles of perpetrators redeems itself in this episode. Desk Sergeant Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) confides in Fay about his teen-age sweetheart, Cindy. When officers Hill (Michael Warren) and Renko (Charles Haid) respond to a domestic situation, their police car is stolen, and they are shot after walking into a rundown building while trying to find a phone to call in the theft.|$|E
5|$|Three {{camera angles}} were used during Lorne's {{scene in the}} F-302. To save costs, one of the camera angles was {{operated}} by Kavan Smith himself, who held it on <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> Elsewhere, the producers {{wanted to make the}} control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it different than any other actions involving the control chair. A stunt {{towards the end of the}} episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face.|$|E
50|$|With just seconds {{remaining}} until the 6 o'clock gun, Bobby Rahal {{made it to}} the front of the qualifying line. At 5:59 p.m., he pulled away for <b>his</b> warm up <b>laps.</b> Kevin Cogan (217.230 mph) was now on the bubble. Rahal's first lap was completed at 217.360 mph, just fast enough to bump his way in. However, <b>his</b> second <b>lap</b> dropped to 216.820 mph. <b>His</b> third <b>lap</b> (214.782 mph) was the dagger, and Rahal failed to qualify.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 November 1985 Speedway Park {{held the}} first ever Australian Sprintcar Masters to {{coincide}} with the running of {{the first ever}} Australian Formula One Grand Prix being run on the then new Adelaide Street Circuit. The Masters was won by World of Outlaws driver Randy Kinser of the United States in his JPS-sponsored Gambler Sprintcar from local favourite Bill Barrows. Kinser was in Australia in 1985/86 as part of JPS Team Kinser which consisted of older brother Steve Kinser and cousins Mark and Kelly, with another cousin, Karl, being the crew chief. During the Sprintcar Masters a couple of the visiting Formula One drivers including Renault drivers Derek Warwick and Patrick Tambay were given the chance to do a few 'hot laps' in one of the sprintcars. The governing body of Formula One, the Paris-based FIA, was not impressed, and Warwick received a hefty fine for <b>his</b> <b>laps.</b> Tambay escaped sanction as he had done <b>his</b> <b>laps</b> on the Friday night while Warwick did <b>his</b> <b>laps</b> before the start of Saturday nights action. This actually broke FIA regulations which did not allow a Formula One driver to drive another race car within 24 hours of the start of a Grands Prix without written permission. Among other visitors was triple World Drivers' Champion Jackie Stewart, who reportedly described Sprintcar racing as the [...] "Most exciting form of motorsport in the world".|$|R
5|$|In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and {{his brother}} Lakshmana riding the {{celestial}} elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> and rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka {{and get into the}} Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, drenched in oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. A black woman in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey (vanara) messenger of Rama burns the city. Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materializes, she will protect her rakshasi guards.|$|E
5|$|Itala driver Maurice Fabry {{started the}} fastest of the competitors; {{he covered the}} first {{kilometre}} in 43.4seconds. Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time of 52minutes and 25.4seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position {{on the road and}} into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{started to}} close on Verstappen for second place, {{starting}} overtaking attempts on lap 33 and finally succeeding on lap 38. Meanwhile, Vettel was judged to have forced Felipe Massa {{off the track}} when he overtook him for eighth place, handing him a five-second time penalty. On lap 40, Jolyon Palmer retired in the pitlane. While Rosberg initially closed in on Hamilton, the latter started to improve <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> times {{towards the end of}} the race. As Räikkönen got back into fifth at the expense of Pérez, Rosberg reported problems with his gearbox on the team radio. His team told him to avoid using seventh gear, following which Rosberg was able to consolidate his slim lead over Verstappen, which had initially come down due to his problem. Hamilton was unaffected by this and crossed the line to take victory, 6.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg. He was the first driver to win the British Grand Prix three times in a row and also became the record winner at the Silverstone circuit, with four victories. It was the 47th victory of his career.|$|E
50|$|Mario Andretti {{drew the}} coveted first {{qualifying}} attempt.

50|$|Practice summary: Practice resumed {{after three}} off-days, and track {{activity}} was busy. Oriol Servià {{was named to}} the Rahal Letterman entry, and took <b>his</b> first <b>laps</b> of the month. At 221.353 mph, Servia was the fastest among non-qualified cars. Veteran Buddy Lazier took <b>his</b> first <b>laps</b> of the month as well. No incidents were reported.|$|R
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday afternoon and evening sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday afternoon and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held on a wet track with a clear sky after rainstorms {{earlier in the day}} left standing water on parts of the circuit, and high humidity slowed the drying process. These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session's closing minutes. Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 minute and 54.589 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set <b>his</b> <b>lap.</b> Adrian Sutil, with a lap of 1:58.827, was third fastest, ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari. Button, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Buemi, Kubica, and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers.|$|E
5|$|Although 52 {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Riggs clinched the third pole position of his career, and his third consecutive at Lowe's Motor Speedway, {{with a time of}} 28.203 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kahne, his Evernham Motorsports teammate, and held the pole position until Riggs' lap. Kurt Busch originally qualified in third, but his car's right-rear shock absorber was found to have violated NASCAR regulations during the post-qualifying inspection because it did not bounce back. Busch was required to start from 42nd position after using a provisional. As a result, Casey Mears inherited third, Sadler fourth, and Harvick fifth. Burton, Martin, Clint Bowyer, Reed Sorenson and Johnson rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Kenseth, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified eleventh, while Earnhardt took 16th and Kyle Busch 18th. The nine drivers who failed to qualify were Elliott, Kevin Lepage, Derrike Cope, Chad Chaffin, Hermie Sadler, Kirk Shelmerdine, Kenny Wallace (who crashed on his first timed lap), Morgan Shepherd (who elected not to set a lap time), and Carl Long (who crashed while attempting to record a timed lap). After the qualifier Riggs said that his team knew his car was good, and achieved a good draw by recording <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time {{in the latter half of}} the session. He stated when returning to the track, his team wanted to get back into a rhythm of starting and finishing in a top position.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday sessions were held in dry and cloudy conditions, becoming damp during the day, resulting in the track surface becoming slippery. Michael Schumacher set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 43.532 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello was just off Häkkinen's pace with Coulthard setting the fourth fastest time. Frentzen and BAR driver Ricardo Zonta followed in fifth and sixth positions respectively. Fisichella, Mika Salo, Ralf Schumacher and Herbert completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Williams driver Jenson Button crashed into the pit lane {{at the end of}} the barriers and lost his front wing. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher did not manage to improve <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time but was still quickest. Frentzen was running quicker and was second fastest. The two McLaren drivers were running slower—Häkkinen in third and Coulthard fifth–although both drivers were undertaking race set-up and brake performance testing. They were separated by Barrichello. Trulli was sixth fastest, ahead of Zonta. Villeneuve, Fisichella and Salo followed in the top ten.|$|E
50|$|After the race, {{during the}} post-race scoring evaluation, Patrick Racing {{threatened}} to protest Emerson Fittipaldi's one-lap penalty. When official results were posted on Monday morning, USAC {{once and for}} all retracted Fittipaldi's penalty, reinstating <b>his</b> <b>laps,</b> which elevated him to a second-place finish. Al Unser, Sr. was officially third. Jim Crawford's exciting day finished with a 6th place.|$|R
50|$|Rain kept cars off {{the track}} until 3 p.m. An {{abbreviated}} practice session saw only 15 cars on the track, with Teo Fabi (223.381 mph) the fastest of the day; <b>his</b> fastest <b>lap</b> all month. Willy T. Ribbs took <b>his</b> first <b>laps</b> of the month, and first laps since 1991, topping out in the 210 mph range.|$|R
50|$|With Geoff Brabham on the bubble, {{and with}} rain approaching, Rick Miaskiewicz {{was the next}} car out. <b>His</b> first two <b>laps</b> were not nearly fast enough, and his team waved him off. That gave Derek Daly {{just enough time to}} get out on the track. <b>His</b> first two <b>laps</b> were fast enough to bump Brabham, but as he was {{completing}} <b>his</b> second <b>lap,</b> the skies poured rain, and the run was negated.|$|R
5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. Qualifying {{was divided}} into two groups of thirteen cars, with the odd numbered vehicles in Group A and the even numbered cars in Group B. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Light rain fell as the session started with some drivers electing to equip the super soft tyres to their cars while other competitors chose to utilise wet-weather compounds. Rossi clinched the second pole position of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 37.019 seconds. The achievement ended Vandoorne's run of consecutive pole positions which started at the 2014 Spa-Francorchamps round. He was joined on the grid's front row by Marciello who was three-tenths of a second off Rossi's pace and had the pole until the latter's lap. Marciello pushed hard and narrowly avoided losing control of his car at Massenet's barriers. Pic qualified third and Vandoorne was fourth. Sergey Sirotkin improved <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> time late in the qualifying period to start from fifth place. He shared the third row with Julián Leal who was ahead of Nick Yelloly and Jordan King. Canamasas and de Jong completed the top ten qualifiers; de Jong slid into the Mirabeau barrier in the closing minutes of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} <b>his</b> <b>lap</b> in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna lined up on the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on <b>his</b> <b>lap,</b> smiling.|$|E
