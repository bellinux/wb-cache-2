5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the committee's work was subject of great debate.

Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.|$|E
5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the rear guard. The regiment {{often had to}} fight dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition was exhausted, and then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they {{lost control of the}} action.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> characters and required too much effort. Hoshino {{was pleased with}} her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912. Consideration was given to {{equipping}} the new ships with triple turrets mounting the 30.5cm (12in) guns of the preceding s, but after examining the gun turrets of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the , {{it was determined that}} the triple gun turrets still <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|Disney greenlit Dick Tracy in 1988 {{under the}} {{condition}} that Warren Beatty keep the production budget within $25 million, which began to rise once filming started. It quickly jumped to $30 million and then $47 million as its final production budget. Disney spent an additional $54 million on the marketing campaign, resulting in a total of $101 million spent overall. The financing for Dick Tracy came from Disney and Silver Screen Partners IV, as well as Beatty's own production company, Mulholland Productions. Disney was originally going to release the film under the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner, but chose instead to release and market the film under the adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures label leading up to the film's theatrical debut, because the studio felt it <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> mature themes for a Disney-branded film.|$|E
5|$|This {{rapid rise}} {{in the power of}} Macedon was in part due to Philip's {{exceptional}} military and diplomatic skills. However, it was also in part due to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece. Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, as discussed above, was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power. Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> other problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC.|$|E

5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimates}} of the number of Japanese troops on Biak were out by a similar margin, resulting in heavy casualties. In the Battle of Biak, stubborn Japanese resistance halted the 41st Infantry Division, and forced its commander, Major General Horace H. Fuller, to appeal to Krueger for reinforcements. In response, Krueger sent the 163rd Regimental Combat Team from Wakde. MacArthur soon grew impatient, as he needed the airstrips on Biak to support Admiral Chester Nimitz's Invasion of Saipan. Nimitz's operation ultimately drew Japanese attention away from Biak. MacArthur put pressure on Krueger for results, and Krueger in turn put pressure on Fuller. Krueger decided that Fuller <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> responsibilities as both task force commander and division commander, and decided to supersede him by sending Eichelberger to take over the task force. Fuller then submitted his resignation. Eichelberger's chief of staff, Brigadier General Clovis Byers, offered to have Decker intercept and destroy the resignation before Krueger saw it, but Fuller decided against this. The battle raged for nearly a month. Afterwards, Krueger demanded an explanation from Eichelberger as to why he had allowed Fuller to quit.|$|E

25|$|The game {{received}} mixed {{views from}} critics. Most critics enjoyed the game's humor, {{and those who}} did not noted that players who enjoyed the humor from the previous two games will enjoy The Baconing. Critics were divided as to aspects of gameplay. Some thought that the game <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> repetitive quests, while others felt that gameplay was tightened in comparison to the previous two DeathSpank games.|$|E
25|$|After that century, however, Wettimuny's Test form {{went the}} same way as his ODI form. Despite hitting two fifties, he <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> scores below 20, and the 12 Tests {{following}} the England tour only yielded 402 runs at an average of 19.14. Wettimuny never got into control of the pitches in his home country, as he averaged a paltry 18.19 with the bat at home – an average more usually associated with a bowling all-rounder – but 39.95 overseas.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Army Air Forces had {{originally}} ordered 200 production model B-35s. Since Northrop's facilities were {{not up to}} the task of producing them, the Glenn L. Martin Company agreed to undertake mass production. This proved irrelevant when the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> development problems. Even disregarding these, so many of Martin's engineers had been drafted by 1944 that Martin pushed the first delivery date back to 1947. Seeing that it would almost certainly never be ready in time for the war, the Army Air Forces canceled the production contract, though the Air Technical Services Command continued to run the program for research purposes.|$|E
25|$|By 4 February the BEF front had {{increased}} from 95 miles to 123 miles, {{an increase of}} almost 30%. Besides constructing his defences, {{for which he had}} inadequate labour, Gough was formally ordered (Instructions to Fifth Army 9 February, following recommendations by Tavish Davidson on 4 February) to construct defence in depth, including an “emergency defensive zone” along the Somme and Tortille rivers (which run roughly north-south south of Peronne), and a fortified bridgehead around Peronne, from whence “strong counterattacks” were to be conducted when Petain sent the promised reinforcements. GHQ possibly still thought that the main German attack might be elsewhere. Gough <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> men too far forward in positions too far apart to be mutually supporting.|$|E
25|$|A lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a fast-medium right-handed bowler, Cowie played first-class cricket for Auckland {{from the}} 1932-33 season, appearing regularly in Plunket Shield matches from 1934-35. According to his obituary in Wisden in 1995, he {{started as a}} batsman but converted himself into a bowler because the Auckland side <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> batsmen {{for him to be}} guaranteed a place. As a bowler, he relied on accuracy and the ability to move the ball after it pitched, and Wisden likened him to a latter-day New Zealand bowler, Richard Hadlee. But his success in domestic cricket was limited until the 1936-37 season, when he took 21 wickets in four first-class matches, and in the match against Wellington at Auckland took five wickets in an innings for the first time, finishing with five for 81.|$|E
