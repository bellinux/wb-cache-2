5|$|Kilburn {{was born}} in Sheffield in 1909, and {{attended}} Holgate Grammar School in Barnsley, before completing a degree in economics at the university there. From an early age, he showed interest in cricket; as a boy he received coaching from former Yorkshire cricketer George Hirst at Scarborough, and played for Barnsley in Yorkshire Council matches and for Bradford in the Bradford League. Bowling fast-paced off spin, Kilburn was successful <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> bat and ball to win medals for Bradford and have his achievements reported in the press. He worked briefly as a teacher in a Harrogate preparatory school. While in Bradford, he met the vice-consul for Finland; as a result, he went to live in Finland for a year.|$|E

5|$|Malta had {{organised}} the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for {{the first}} time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellos. At the consulate it was decided that four merchants familiar <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> maritime procedures shall be appointed consuls to administer justice, on similar approach to Barcellona and Messina. Perellos had established foreign relations between Malta and Russia in 1698, {{for the first}} time, exactly a century before the Order's expulsion from Malta. During his grandmastership the coastal fortifications of Malta were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the driving force behind the third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705. In 1707 he entrusted Romano Carapecchia with the reorganization of the drainage system in Valletta.|$|E
5|$|Pistrucci's early clients {{included}} two of Rome's major art dealers, Ignazio Vescovali and Angelo Bonelli, and Napoleon's three sisters, Elisa, Pauline and Caroline. Pistrucci gained prominence by winning a competition {{to make a}} cameo of Elisa (the Grand Duchess of Tuscany), working nearly nonstop for eight days to complete it. The Grand Duchess was so impressed by his work that she gave him studio space at her palace. Pistrucci felt secure <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> this patronage that in 1802, he married Barbara Folchi, daughter of a well-to-do merchant; they had nine children together. He continued working in Rome, turning out portrait cameos and engraved gems, until 1814.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{finished}} {{fifth in}} 1935 and seventh in 1936. Dodger management felt Stengel {{had not done}} <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> the talent he had been given, and he was fired during the 1936 World Series between the Yankees and Giants. Stengel was paid for one year left on his contract, {{and he was not}} involved in baseball during the 1937 season. Stengel had invested in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, Randy Moore, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well to do, and they put the profits in California real estate. Stengel considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president Bob Quinn offered him the Boston managerial job in late 1937, and he accepted.|$|E

5|$|Balchen {{was born}} in February 1670, the only {{surviving}} child of the yeoman gentleman, John Balchen, and his wife, Ann Edspur. Home educated, Balchen took a commission in the Royal Navy aged 15 and, seven years later, gained promotion to lieutenant. For most of this period Balchen was stationed in the West Indies and, during his service there, was lucky in his health; the West Indies command was considered very dangerous during this period, mortality rates amongst sailors stationed there being very high due to malaria and yellow fever. The high death rate led to rapid promotion for those who survived, and Balchen was made Post Captain at the relatively young age of 27 during the Nine Years' War. Balchen had spent the war aboard HMS Dragon and HMS Cambridge under Admiral John Neville, who was impressed <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> his subordinate to give him command of the prize ship HMS Virgin, the safe conduct of which to England earned him the step to captain.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{arrived back}} in the UK in April 1942 {{and spent the next}} three months working up. In August she was {{detailed}} to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal, but she was only to sail far <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> them to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta. This she did, just as Eagle was torpedoed, but Furious turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the Balearic Islands. After this mission Furious was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch, and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden {{recruited}} {{yet another}} guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth. Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, {{as well as}} original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound. A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided {{that he had had}} <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
5|$|NSB assured {{passengers}} {{that the}} trains were more capable than their reputation, {{and that they}} would continue to be used on the Bergen Line. If an alternative was needed, NSB stated {{that they would have to}} use El 18 locomotives in combination with B5 carriages. However, the carriages were at the time being used on regional rush-hour trains around Oslo, were in need of renovation and did not offer the facilities required by intercity travelers. In October, NSB stated that they planned to withdraw Class 73 from service on the Bergen Line, because the use of multiple units was not flexible <b>enough.</b> <b>With</b> locomotive-hauled trains, it was possible for the company to add or remove just a single carriage, but with multiple units, it was necessary to double the capacity if a single unit was insufficient. While originally planned to be introduced in 2008, delays in the upgrades delayed the delivery of the carriages beyond 2010.|$|E
5|$|Parma {{was more}} than willing to help. The Electorate, {{strategically}} important to Spain, offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, it was a long, arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed. An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process of intervention had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken Aachen, which Protestants had seized; by the mid–1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate. By 1590, these garrisons gave Spain access to the northern provinces and Philip felt comfortable <b>enough</b> <b>with</b> his military access to the provinces, and with their isolation from possible support by German Protestants, to direct more of his attention to France, and less to his problems with the Dutch.|$|E
