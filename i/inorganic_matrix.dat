However, probably with no exception, most pharmaceutical products are not devoid of adverse consequences. Immunomodulators are commonly considered a “benign” drug whose advantages bypass consequences. The immunomodulator AM 3 (Immunoferon®) is a clinically used, orally administered compound whose active principle is stabilised in an <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrix</b> of calcium.

40|$|The {{stability}} of amorphous aluminosilicate inorganic polymer (AIP) systems {{with regard to}} the structural role of water molecules incorporated in <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrix</b> is discussed. Innovative approach to preparation of amorphous AIP systems with identical chemical composition but differing in structural and mechanical behavior is introduced. It is shown that even small changes in the manufacture dramatically affect mechanical properties and the overall structural {{stability of}} AIP systems. If the required quantity of water is admixed to the reaction mixture during the initial step of AIPs synthesis the resulting amorphous aluminosilicate matrix undergoes extensive crystallization (zeolitization). On the other hand, if the amount of water is added to the reaction mixture during the last step of the preparation procedure, the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrix</b> exhibits long-term stability without any structural defects. To find the structural reasons of the observed behavior a combination of traditional solid state NMR (1 H and 29 Si MAS NMR, 29 Si CP/MAS NMR, 29 Si inverse-T 1 -filtered NMR), XRPD and TGA measurements were used. The applied experiments revealed that the structural stability of AIPs {{can be attributed to the}} tight binding of water molecules into the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrix.</b> The structural stability of the prepared amorphous AIP systems thus seems to be affected by the extent of hydration i. e. the strength of binding water into the inorganic framework...|$|E

40|$|The {{configuration}} of hemoglobin in solution and confined inside silica nanotubes {{has been studied}} using synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering and electrochemical activity. Confinement inside submicron tubes of silica aid in preventing protein aggregation, which is vividly observed for unconfined protein in solution. The radius of gyration (R-g) and size polydispersity (p) of confined hemoglobin {{was found to be}} lower than that in solution. This was also recently demonstrated in case of confined hemoglobin inside layered polymer capsules. The confined hemoglobin displayed a higher thermal stability with Rg and p showing negligible changes in the temperature range 25 - 75 degrees C. The differences in configuration between the confined and unconfined protein were reflected in their electrochemical activity. Reversible electrochemical response (from cyclic voltammograms) obtained in case of the confined hemoglobin, in contrary to the observance of only a cathodic response for the unconfined protein, gave direct indication {{of the differences between the}} residences of the electroactive heme center in a different orientation compared to that in solution state. The confined Hb showed loss of reversibility only at higher temperatures. The electron transfer coefficient (alpha) and electron transfer rate constant (k(s)) were also different, providing additional evidence regarding structural differences between the unconfined and confined states of hemoglobin. Thus, absence of any adverse effects due to confinement of proteins inside the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrices</b> such as silica nanotubes opens up new prospects for utilizing <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrices</b> as protein ``encapsulators'', as well as sensors at varying temperatures...|$|R

In this configuration, the organic dye {{acts as the}} radiative recombination site for charge carriers injected into the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrix.</b> Our investigation is aimed at finding a material combination where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the organic dye are situated in between the valence and conduction bands of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>matrix</b> {{in order to promote}} electron and hole transfer from the matrix to the dye. Bilayer and composite thin films of zinc selenide (ZnSe) and a red iridium complex (Ir(BPA)) organic light emitter were prepared in situ via UHV thermal evaporation technique. The electronic and atomic structures were studied applying X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies. The measured energy band alignments for the ZnSe/Ir(BPA) bilayer and ZnSe+Ir(BPA) composite reveal that the HOMO and LUMO of the organic dye are positioned in the ZnSe bandgap. For the initial steps of ZnSe deposition on a dye film to form Ir(BPA) /ZnSe bilayers, zinc atoms intercalate into the dye film leaving behind an excess of selenium at the interface that partly reacts with dye molecules. Photoelectron spectroscopy of the composites shows the same species suggesting a similar mechanism.
