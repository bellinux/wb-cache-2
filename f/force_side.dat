40|$|Abstract—Side force {{occurrence}} on slender {{bodies of}} revolution at high angle-of-attack (AOA> 30 o) {{has long been}} observed by experimenters. Flow-field features for a slender body at high AOA recently have received considerable attention in the recent year’s. These studies demonstrate that flow separating from the body rolls up {{into a pair of}} asymmetric vortices between 30 o <AOA< 70 o. Significant <b>side</b> <b>force</b> results from asymmetric vortices. The magnitude of this <b>side</b> <b>force</b> can equal that of the normal force acting on the slender body, which causes an aircraft to spin or a missile to tumble in situations where these effects are not thoroughly considered as part of the control system design. It is also found that <b>side</b> <b>force</b> distribution exhibited an oscillatory behavior along slender body. In this study, CFD simulations are performed to calculate <b>side</b> <b>force</b> on high angle of attack without any side angle. It is found that this asymmetrical pair of vortices strengths increases as we move backward from the tip and if slenderness ratios is increased then exhibited <b>side</b> <b>force</b> is also increased. The CFD algorithm directly cannot calculate or simulate the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> without <b>side</b> angle because it is symmetric in nature. So in this research study methods are suggested how to calculate the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> with zero <b>side</b> angle. So in this research study computational challenges at high angle of attack are studied and simulated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{wind tunnel}} {{experiments}} is conducted to get inspiration {{for understanding the}} mechanism of the asymmetric flow pattern and developing an innovative flow control technique for a slender body at high angle of attack. The bi-stable situation of the <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> is observed, which could be easily switched by a tiny disturbances either from coming flow or from artificial disturbances at nose tip (including manufacturing defect). In turbulent flows the <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> switched randomly between positive and negative. There exists a hysteresis loop of <b>side</b> <b>force</b> with the rolling angle. A rod {{in front of the}} slender body is used to change the vortex pattern, which could be kept even the rod is moved out from the stream. A miniature strake attached to the nose tip of the model can be moved to different circumferential position. When the strake is stationary, the hysteresis loop disappears and the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> does not change with the turbulent fluctuation of coming flow. The results from dynamic measurements of section <b>side</b> <b>force</b> indicates that when the strake swung at lower frequency the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> can follow the cadence of the swinging strake. With increasing frequency, the magnitude of the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> decreases. At still high frequency, the <b>side</b> <b>force</b> diminishes to zero. If the strake is swinging, while the middle position can be changed to different circumferential angle ϕs on either left or right <b>side,</b> the <b>side</b> <b>forces</b> can be changed proportionally with the angle ϕs.
