5|$|Sharad Panday (22 October 1934 – 8 November 2004) was an Indian heart surgeon. He was on {{the team}} of {{surgeons}} who performed the first-ever <b>heart</b> <b>transplant</b> in India at the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College in Mumbai. He was a specialist in bloodless heart surgery, and was an early exponent of bloodless open heart surgery in India.|$|E
25|$|He is {{currently}} licensed as a physician, and is board certified in both general surgery and thoracic surgery.

5|$|Born Kathy Petro, {{she grew}} up in a horse racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 she took it over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a <b>heart</b> <b>transplant</b> in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows no signs of organ rejection.|$|E
5|$|The {{first week}} {{stabbing}} {{was regarded as}} similar to the Murder of Jonathan Levin. ABC sent the media the first two episodes prior to the season 6 premiere. In the first episode, Smits is both stabbed and inadvertently cut by his dentist. Based {{on the first two}} episodes, Dave Matheny and Neal Justin of the Star Tribune determined that Simone would endure a worsening mysterious illness. In the third episode of the arc, Smits was hospitalized and in need of a <b>heart</b> <b>transplant.</b> The fourth episode was a buildup to impending heart surgery as he struggles with cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a <b>heart</b> <b>transplant.</b> During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: With {{improving}} {{results of}} heart transplantation and subsequently increasing survival, long-term complications such as neoplastic malignancies {{are more often}} being discovered. Presentation of case: In this report, we present a unique case of successful oesophagus resection with gastric pull-up, on a heart-transplanted patient diagnosed with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Discussion: With {{the growing number of}} long-term surviving <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> patients, the number of neoplasia in this patient-group will subsequently grow. Since physical condition and quality of life in long-term surviving <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> patients is comparable to the general population, and since surgical treatment remains the mainstay of treatment for localised oesophageal carcinoma in non-heart transplanted patients, a larger subgroup of <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> patients will most likely be considered for cancer surgery. Conclusion: Our case demonstrates the possibility of operating on the <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> patient-group, and supports the option, that well-managed heart transplantation not should be a limiting factor, when deciding whether a patient is a candidate for surgical intervention or not...|$|R

She initially refuses but accepts after Cale is rendered a paraplegic attempting the assignment he was recruiting her for. A romantic interest buds between the two. While assisting Cale, Max also makes {{a living as a}} bicycle messenger at Jam Pony, a courier company, along with her friends Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller), Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard), and Sketchy (Richard Gunn). Other X5s are periodically introduced, most significantly the unit leader Zack (William Gregory Lee). The Manticore hunt for the escaped X5s is led by Colonel Donald Lydecker (John Savage). Near {{the end of the season}} Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, the even more ruthless Elizabeth Renfro (Nana Visitor), and he defects from Manticore. He aids Max and Zack in an assault on Manticore headquarters. Max is badly wounded and captured. Zack, who has also been captured, commits suicide to provide Max with his heart, as she needs an X5 <b>heart</b> <b>transplant</b> to survive.|$|E

Victor travels to Mexico and nearly dies, and Ashley is able to find him; they end up rekindling their romance. They remarried when Ashley became pregnant, but she miscarries when Adam gaslights her into having a hysterical pregnancy, but convinced her that she was still pregnant. Despite Adam stealing Nicholas’ daughter, Faith, and passing her off as Ashley’s, she and Victor divorce as he reunites with Nikki again. Victor was later shot by Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) and needed a <b>heart</b> <b>transplant,</b> receiving Colleen Carlton’s (Tammin Sursok) heart. Victor and Nikki left for treatment in Europe, and upon their return, Adam’s scheme was revealed and he faked his death. Victor went searching for him in Canada and met Meggie McClaine (Sean Young); he brings her to Genoa City and she works as Nikki’s assistant, but causes her to relapse into alcoholism. In reality, Meggie was trying to foil Victor and Nikki’s union to marry him for his money. Victor marries her, but has her arrested soon after; Nikki moves on with Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan). Afterward, Victor’s children file a lawsuit against him over a cosmetics line, which they win.|$|E

25|$|Post-operative {{complications}} include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, {{as well as}} the side-effects of the immunosuppressive medication. Since the transplanted heart originates {{from another}} organism, the recipient's immune system typically attempts to reject it.

40|$|Infection {{with the}} {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma cruzi {{often results in}} chronic heart- and gut-associated disease known as Chagas disease. In this study we show that contrary to previous reports, neonatal <b>hearts</b> <b>transplanted</b> into mice chronically infected with T. cruzi do not exhibit signs of autoimmune-type rejection or any significant inflammatory response. In addition to an absence of inflammation, these syngeneic <b>heart</b> <b>transplants</b> survive for more than 1 year and are absolutely free of parasites as determined by in situ PCR analysis. However, if well-established <b>transplanted</b> <b>hearts</b> in chronically infected mice are directly injected with live parasites, a rapid and dramatic inflammatory response ensues that results in cessation of <b>heart</b> function. Likewise, <b>transplanted</b> <b>hearts</b> established in mice prior to systemic infection with T. cruzi or <b>hearts</b> <b>transplanted</b> into mice during the acute stage of T. cruzi infection become parasitized and develop inflammatory foci. In these cases where the <b>transplanted</b> <b>hearts</b> become parasitized, the ensuing inflammatory response is nearly identical to that observed in the native hearts of T. cruzi-infected mice in terms of cell types present and adhesion molecules and cytokines expressed. Importantly, this response is strikingly different from that observed in the allogeneic heart rejection. These results clearly document that parasitization of heart tissue is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of tissue damage in Chagas disease and strongly argue against a principal autoimmune etiology for this disease...|$|R
40|$|Reported {{clinical}} and experimental observations indicate that heart grafts in combined heart-lung transplantation are less frequently rejected than <b>heart</b> grafts <b>transplanted</b> alone. In order to elucidate {{the mechanism of}} this difference, twenty-eight inbred male Lewis rats receiving heterotopic allografts from inbred male Fisher rats were evaluated for surface markers of graft infiltrating lymphocytes (GIL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using flowcytometry. Monoclonal antibodies investigated {{in this study were}} W 3 / 25 (anti-helper T lymphocyte), OX 8 (anti-suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte), OX 39 (anti-interleukin 2 receptor), and OX 6 (anti-MHC class II antigen). In the acute study, a <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> group (n = 7) and a heart-lung transplanted group (n = 7) without immunosuppression were studied. In the chronic study, cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day i. m.) were administered in the <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> group (n = 7) and the heart-lung transplanted group (n = 7). Both in the acute and chronic studies, the proportion of W 3 / 25 positive cells in GIL of heart grafts of the <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> group was significantly higher than that of heart grafts and lung grafts of the heart-lung transplanted group. OX 8 positive cell proportion in GIL of heart grafts and lung grafts of the heart-lung transplanted group were significantly higher than that of heart grafts of the <b>heart</b> <b>transplanted</b> group. These results lead us to speculate that suppressor T lymphocytes are an important distinguishing factor in the rejection processes of heart allografts and heart-lung allografts as observed in clinical experience. </p...|$|R
