25|$|A mid-diastolic {{rumbling}} murmur with presystolic accentuation will {{be heard}} after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.|$|E
25|$|Stretches and {{isometric}} exercises {{will aid}} in prevention for persons at risk. Stretching before the activity and during breaks will aid in alleviating tension at the wrist. Place the hand firmly {{on a flat}} surface and gently press for a few seconds to stretch the wrist and fingers. An example for an <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> of the wrist is done by clenching the fist tightly, releasing and fanning out fingers. None of these stretches or exercises should cause pain or discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> {{provides}} a {{maximum amount of}} resistance based on the force output of the muscle, or muscles pitted against one another. This maximum force maximally strengthens the muscles over all of the joint angles at which the <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> occurs. By comparison, weight training also strengthens the muscle throughout the range of motion the joint is trained in, but only maximally at one angle, causing a lesser increase in physical strength at other angles from the initial through terminating joint angle as compared with <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise.</b> In addition, the risk of injury from weights used in weight training is greater than with <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> (no weights), {{and the risk of}} asymmetric training is also greater than with <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> of identical opposing muscles.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Anterior {{knee pain}} {{is a disease}} {{associated}} with abnormalities in the patellofemoral joint. It is a common reason for seeking advice from an orthopaedist. This problem is characterised by chronic pain in the anterior part of one or both knees. This issue often affects women, especially at a young age. The effect of this ailment is deterioration {{of the quality of}} life. This dysfunction significantly reduces abilities, and often prevents the performance of daily activities. Pain usually occurs during physical activity, but may also be accompanied by prolonged immobilisation of the knee joint. In defining the type of patellofemoral instability, orthopaedists use magnetic resonance imaging, arthroscopy, ultrasonography, and X-ray examination. A relatively effective method of treatment of pain in the patellofemoral joint is through <b>isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> of the quadriceps. They increase the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle and reduce instability in the patellofemoral joint. Aim of the research: To evaluate the effectiveness of <b>isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> of the quadriceps muscle on young female patients with anterior knee pain. Material and methods : The study involved 30 women aged 13 – 44 years (mean age: 26. 8 years), who had been diagnosed with pain {{in the front of the}} knee. Results and conclusions: <b>Isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> of the quadriceps muscle are an effective method of reducing anterior knee pain. <b>Isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> have a beneficial influence on improving physical activity, including performing basic activities of daily living. Student’s t distribution showed, that <b>isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> of the quadriceps muscle reduce pain at the front of the knee. Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed a significant reduction of anterior knee pain...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{strength}} training. Examples include weight training, circuit training, <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise,</b> gymnastics, plyometrics, Parkour, yoga, Pilates, Super Slow.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> tools perform {{exercises}} or {{strength test}} using static contraction of a muscle without any visible {{movement in the}} angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term [...] "isometric" [...] combines the prefix [...] "iso" [...] (same) with [...] "metric" [...] (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change, [...] as compared to isotonic contractions ("tonos" [...] means [...] "tension" [...] in Greek) in which the contraction strength does not change but the joint angle does. New <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> tools often used force gauges and a micro processor and then output the force onto an LCD screen or store the information later to be downloaded onto a computer.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise</b> {{training}} {{was applied for}} four weeks resulting in isometric peak power at 60% of maximal voluntary contraction.

50|$|Iron Wire builds {{internal}} power and {{is attributed to}} the martial arts master Leung Kwan (Chinese: 梁坤; pinyin: Liáng Kūn; 1815-1887), better known as Tit Kiuh Saam (Chinese: 鐵橋三; pinyin: tiěqiáosān). Like Wong Fei Hung's father Wong Kei-Ying, Tit Sin Saam {{was one of the}} Ten Tigers of Canton. As a teenager, Wong Fei Hung learned Iron Wire from Lam Fuk-Sing (Chinese: 林福成; pinyin: Línfúchéng)a student of Tit Sin Saam. The Iron Wire form is essentially a combination of Hei Gung (Chinese: 气功; pinyin: qigong) or meditative breathing with <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise,</b> particularly dynamic tension, although weights were also used in traditional practice in the form of iron rings worn on the wrists. If properly practiced, it can increase strength considerably and promote a stable root. However, as with both most forms of qigong and most forms of <b>isometric</b> <b>exercise,</b> it must be practiced regularly or the benefits are quickly lost.|$|E

50|$|An <b>isometric</b> <b>{{exercise}}</b> tool is {{a device}} used to exercise most body parts including {{the wrist and}} is often used as part of physical therapy or {{in order to build}} muscle strength in a low impact manner. Devices can range in size from large bulky machines used by physicians to small hand-held devices that can be used by an individual. Isometric devices have been used for centuries. The first devices did not display the users' output; nowadays there are devices that can digitally output the users force. Before that some devices used an analog format.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> {{have some}} {{differences}} in training effect {{as compared to}} dynamic <b>exercises.</b> While <b>isometric</b> training increases strength at the specific joint angles of the exercises performed and additional joint angles to a lesser extent, dynamic exercises increase strength throughout {{the full range of}} motion. Generally speaking however, people who train isometrically don't train through a full range of motion as the strength gained at the training joint angle is where they require it. While dynamic exercises are slightly better than <b>isometric</b> <b>exercises</b> at enhancing the twitch force of a muscle, isometrics are significantly better than dynamic exercises at increasing maximal strength at the joint angle.Flexibility may be increased when isometrics are performed at joint range of motion extremes. These isometric contractions recruit muscle fibers that are often neglected in some dynamic exercises. For example, gymnasts are extremely strong at great ranges of motion through the practice of isometric holds.|$|R
