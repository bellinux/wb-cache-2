500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Guitar World, posted on November 12, 2008, about the making of his upcoming new EVH Wolfgang guitar from Fender, Eddie Van Halen said, in regard to new Van Halen music, [...] "I'll be making music 'til the day I die. I've done all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> and more is coming. I can't tell you exactly when right now. Wolfgang is in the 12th grade {{and he needs to}} graduate first. Then I'm getting married in June. We'll pick it up after that." [...] Eddie underwent surgery on his left hand in 2009, following some treatment for arthritis as he felt pain in his fingers during the 2007 tour. In {{an interview}} with Glide Magazine appearing in the May 2010 issue, Dweezil Zappa commented that Eddie had played him [...] "new stuff from his record." [...] It was not clear from the interview if the music was intended for a new Van Halen record.|$|E

"Yuh, but Dad, {{they just}} teach {{a lot of}} old junk that isn't any {{practical}} use--except the manual training and typewriting and basketball and dancing--and in these correspondence-courses, gee, you can get all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> that would come in handy.

A {{practical}} professional man, tired and hungry, who has been travelling ever since daylight this morning, will hardly be inclined to talk and air courtesies to-night. He wants food and shelter, and you must see that he has it, simply because I am suddenly laid up and cannot. There is nothing so dreadful in that, I hope?

50|$|Monism is {{the view}} that the universe, at the deepest level of analysis, is {{composed}} of one fundamental kind of stuff. This is usually contrasted with substance dualism, the view found in the writings of Plato and Descartes that the universe is composed of two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> the physical and the stuff of soul, mind or consciousness.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} of the septuplets' tenth {{birthday}} in 2007, the family was declining most requests for interviews, other than annual stories with KCCI (the Des Moines CBS affiliate) and Ladies' Home Journal. Bobbi McCaughey has noted that the level of media attention does not necessarily mean they have granted many interviews, saying, [...] "There was all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> in the papers early on but they never actually interviewed us. Most of it is one paper quoting another." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Laugh Button praised Moore's voice, saying, [...] "Moore's {{incredible}} voice, smoky and edgy {{and closely}} resembling the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> soulful grunge bands aspired to {{back in the}} 90s." ...|$|R

50|$|Later, Willow {{emerged as}} a threat to Nick and Chelsea's happiness. When Nick stole the hairbrush, it left Willow as the only suspect for the fire. Nick felt sorry for Willow and lent her money. Willow asked for more money, and Nick leased an {{apartment}} for her and gave her his credit card to use for her and her baby. Willow used Nick's credit card excessively, then she called Nick and blackmailed him into giving her more money, credit cards, and all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{started to}} become really {{frustrating}} and tours were getting cancelled and all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> was happening, so when that stupid, horrible shit blew {{up on the}} Internet, then it had {{reached the point where}} the three of us said that we'd had enough of this, it's done, and so we decided to actually kick Jon Parkin out of the band. Then we sat with Gaza for awhile, {{trying to figure out what}} we were going to do, and eventually it felt like the only right thing to do was just start from scratch." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stylistically, Harris {{argues that}} the record is [...] "more {{mainstream}} rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial… but good commercial. There's all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> going on, with nods to The Who and UFO and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting." [...] During his appearance on That Metal Show in September 2012, Harris revealed that he tried a number of bass-playing techniques which he would not do with Iron Maiden, such as letting his strings [...] "go dead".|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} for there only being one substance (or, more colloquially, one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff)</b> {{in the universe}} occurs in the first fourteen propositions of The Ethics. The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism: ...|$|R
50|$|Neuropsychoanalysis meets this {{challenge}} via dual-aspect monism, {{sometimes referred to}} as perspectivism. That is, we are monistic. Our brains, including mind, are made <b>of</b> one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> cells, but we perceive this stuff in two different ways.|$|R
5000|$|Substance monism ("stuff monism") {{asserts that}} {{a variety of}} {{existing}} things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance. Substance monism posits that only one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> (e.g., matter or mind) exists, although many things may be made out <b>of</b> this <b>stuff.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Subjective mind, that is, sensations and {{thoughts}} and feelings and consciousness, seems a completely different thing from the cellular matter that gives rise to mind, {{so much so that}} Descartes concluded they were two entirely different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> mind and brain. Accordingly, he invented the [...] "dualism" [...] of the mind, the mind-body dichotomy. Body is one kind of thing, and mind (or spirit or soul) is another. But since this second kind of stuff does not lend itself to scientific inquiry, most of today's psychologists and neuroscientists have rejected Cartesian dualism.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{interview}} continued, {{she described the}} EP's creative and recording process, stating, [...] "You know, I didn't go into the studio saying 'I'm {{going to make a}} V-Day EP'. I stay in the studio. I have a studio in LA and DC and I travel with a studio, so I'm always creating all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> of all different genres and on every track there is musicianship and live music. There's really nothing that I'm chasing other than putting people in the mood. That's what music should be: an experience. That's why I chose these particular songs around Valentine's Day." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{was just}} {{a lot of fun to}} work with the {{different}} people and make everyone comfortable. One of the times I couldn’t find the studio and I didn’t have GPS in my car, so I was trying to find it on my own. All <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> like that happened, but we got it done! At first you might go [...] "Oh, wow," [...] because you aren’t sure you can sing the song they picked, and then you just look at each other and say, [...] "Oh, yeah." [...] You just have to cowboy up and make it right.|$|E
5000|$|Winton keeps {{away from}} the public eye, unless {{promoting}} a new book or supporting an environmental issue. He told reviewer Jason Steger [...] "Occasionally they wheel me out for green advocacy stuff but that's the only <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I put my head up for." ...|$|R

5000|$|On 22 May 2013 {{the murder}} of Lee Rigby {{was carried out by}} two members of Al-Muhajiroun, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. From about 2003, Adebolajo was {{corrupted}} by Bakri and then by Choudary, after Bakri left the country in August 2005. One former associate said Adebolajo that “locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert. He was spouting all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> and said he had changed his name." [...] Adebolajo insisted to be called during the Rigby trial [...] "Mujaahid".|$|E
5000|$|Billy Martin {{hoped to}} have the book {{released}} in October, 2007, though on October 29, 2007, Martin wrote a note on his DeviantArt page commenting on the release date of the book: [...] "You can probably guess by now that my book isn't coming out in October. It's been finished for months now, it's just taking longer than expected to finalize everything. Choosing paper type, fonts, test printing for color corrections, all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I never knew went into publishing a book. I don't know the exact release date at this point, but I will give plenty of notice about its release as soon as I know." ...|$|E

3000|$|Her lack of {{participation}} and frustration {{seemed to be}} particularly strong {{when she had to}} collaborate with non-Korean students, as shown when she said, “I am not sure if I am correct.
