5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of <b>flexible</b> <b>bag</b> was {{required}} to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a <b>flexible</b> <b>bag</b> is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

40|$|A body {{oscillating}} {{in water}} will produce waves. A big {{body and a}} small body may produce equally large waves provided the smaller body oscillates with larger amplitude.

This can be obtained by an oscillating body as explained above. Alternatively, wave generation by oscillatory displacement of water can be obtained, for instance, by an oscillating water column (OWC) in a fixed chamber having an opening into the sea.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} multi-category support vector machines (SVMs) for classification of bags. To train and test the SVMs a collection of 120 images {{of different types of}} bags were used (backpacks, small shoulder <b>bags,</b> plastic <b>flexible</b> <b>bags,</b> and small briefcases). Tests were conducted to establish the best polynomial and Gaussian RBF (radial basis function) kernels. As {{it is well known that}} SVMs are sensitive to the number of features in pattern classification applications, the performance of the SVMs as a function of the number and type of features was also studied. Our goal here, in feature selection is to obtain a smaller set of features that accurately represent the original set. A K-fold cross validation procedure with three subsets was applied to assure reliability. In a kernel optimization experiment using nine popular shape features (area, bounding box ratio, major axis length, minor axis length, eccentricity, equivalent diameter, extent, roundness and convex perimeter), a classification rate of 95 % was achieved using a polynomial kernel with degree six, and a classification rate of 90 % was achieved using a RBF kernel with 27 sigma. To improve these results a feature selection procedure was performed. Using the optimal feature set, comprised of bounding box ratio, major axis length, extent and roundness, resulted in a classification rate of 96. 25 % using a polynomial kernel with degree of nine. The collinearity between the features was confirmed using principle component analysis, where a reduction to four components accounted for 99. 3 % of the variation for each of the bag types...|$|R
