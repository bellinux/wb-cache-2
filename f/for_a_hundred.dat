5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E

Catching up, Danica confides in Archer that her father has not been himself since {{the loss of her}} brother, Quinn, some 15 years ago in an early transporter experiment. After they arrive in “the Barrens” — a sub-space node void of starlight <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> light years — in order to test Erickson's new work, a strange anomaly is detected on the ship. Crewman Burrows is sent to investigate but is found dead, having been exposed to high levels of Delta radiation.|$|E

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with tears in his eyes asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata also records an {{encounter}} between the sage Uttanka and Kalmashapada. After serving his guru Gautama <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years, Uttanka {{is allowed to}} go, but must provide Gautama with Gurudakshina, a traditional repayment for his teacher's services. Gautama's wife Ahalya suggests that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti, Kalmashapada's wife, as repayment. Uttanka meets the cannibalistic Kalmashapada, who approaches Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stops him and explains that he is duty-bound to get Madayanti's earrings as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, will return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agrees and directs him to his wife, who refuses to part with her earrings until Uttanka brings some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gives him the earrings.|$|E

He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, we are told that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{remained the}} home of the City of London School <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years, although the site expanded to include not only the original building on the Victoria Embankment itself, but a range of buildings at right angles along the whole of John Carpenter Street, which was named after the founder of the school, and further buildings constructed at the back along Tudor Street, with the school playground, Fives courts and cloisters enclosed within the site. These other buildings were demolished when the school moved again in 1986. Here the school was adjacent to the City of London School for Girls, which was founded by the City of London Corporation as a sister school in 1894 and moved in 1969 to its present site in the Barbican, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama which has also since moved to the Barbican. It was also next to the traditional home of the British newspaper industry in Fleet Street.|$|E

5|$|Written records {{establish}} the Navajo as fine weavers {{for at least}} the last 300 years, beginning with Spanish colonial descriptions of the early 18th century. By 1812, Pedro Piño called the Navajo the best weavers in the province. Few remnants of 18th-century Navajo weaving survive; the most important surviving examples of early Navajo weaving come from Massacre Cave at Canyon de Chelly, Arizona. In 1804, a group of Navajo were shot and killed there, where they were seeking refuge from Spanish soldiers. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years the cave remained untouched due to Navajo taboos until a local trader named Sam Day entered it and retrieved the textiles. Day separated the collection and sold it to various museums. The majority of Massacre Cave blankets feature plain stripes, yet some exhibit the terraces and diamonds characteristic of later Navajo weaving.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years {{while in the}} Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While {{he did not feel}} the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E
