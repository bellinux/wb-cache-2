He now came to be {{discharged}} from very numerous and large debts, contracted with a knowledge of his situation, after having left Cambridge. Such a career must be marked by the Court. It should be marked under the <b>discretionary</b> or 47th <b>clause</b> of the statute. The Insolvent by his conduct had lost much of that estimation which he might have obtained.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Kluwer via [URL] data protection sits in a relationship of profound tension with public freedom of expression. Although, Directive 95 / 46 include a special purposes provision for processing ‘carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purposes of artistic or literary expression’, its limited scope fails to provide for a general reconciliation of values in this area. As vividly highlighted by the recent Google Spain decision, these problems were only partially resolved in the Satamedia judgment. Proposed amendments to require Member States to effect a reconciliation between data protection and freedom of expression itself run the theoretical risk of expanding {{the scope of this}} highly <b>discretionary</b> <b>clause</b> into one of universal application. However, as this would clearly conflict with the core harmonizing aim of reform, it would almost certainly be interpreted much more restrictively, thereby fuelling existing confusions. A two-pronged, layered approach may be preferable. Firstly, the special purposes provision would be expanded to clearly protect all activities orientated towards disclosing information, opinion or ideas {{for the benefit of the}} public collectively. Secondly, Member States would be obliged to effect a broader but more stringent reconciliation of data protection with the right to public freedom of expression under the law’s general derogation provisions. I would like to thank the Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and the many individuals who have assisted the research presented here, as well both the British Academy and the Leverhulme Trust who provided much needed financial support for it...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) The {{charging}} {{of interest}} and the variation thereof throughout the term of a credit agreement has, in a modern South Africa, become the rule rather than the exception. This is so because in a constant evolving economy {{it will not be}} viable for large financial institutions to commit themselves to fixed interest rates especially where a credit agreement such as a mortgage agreement may extend over many years. With this comes the question as to the extent of a credit provider’s discretion to vary interest rates {{and the manner in which}} it purports to do so. Naturally where the National Credit Act finds application in respect of a credit agreement the provisions thereof relating to interest and the variation thereof will determine whether a clause allowing a credit provider to vary the interest rate unilaterally is valid and enforceable. However in instances where the National Credit Act is not applicable to a certain credit agreement, especially in the case where the consumer is a juristic person, the interest rate levied and the variation thereof will fall to be decided in terms of the common law. The application of the common law in this regard is not without difficulty and there have been many conflicting decisions of our courts in this regard. Whilst the supreme court of appeal has finally decided on the matter of <b>discretionary</b> interest rate <b>clauses</b> it is no doubt that this issue will surface for many years to come. This dissertation explains the comparative positions of interest rate and variable interest rate clauses in terms of the National Credit Act and the common law...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} study {{seeks to}} propose {{a new approach to}} the resolution of those legal problems that arise where <b>discretionary</b> <b>clauses</b> are contained within contracts. To this end, a specific legal scenario will be employed, namely where provisions which unilateraly state the price are inserted within commercial contracts of sale. The paper begins with a consideration of how these clauses have been treated by the French civil law system and then proceeds to compare this approach with that adopted by the common law systems of England and the United States. The initial question is that of the validity of the provisions themselves, and of the contracts that contain them. After resolving this first issue, the paper then considers whether a regime might be introduced which would seek to control the impact of the clauses through the introduction of legal responsibility for the party in whose favour the provision is created. Finally, the study addresses the precise nature of this potential responsibility, which is likely to be of a mixed character, combining both objective and subjective elements...|$|E
