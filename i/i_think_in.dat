25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> casual {{conversation}} I {{would have}} told anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> some ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be something new in the future.

We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months.
