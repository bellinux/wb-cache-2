50|$|Kyp escapes, injured, {{and spends}} a month recuperating in a burrow, despite the laws against it. He then meets <b>Katakata</b> when they fight over a fish. <b>Katakata</b> is a crow who was banished from his clan due {{because the new}} {{leadership}} enforced new religious laws which <b>Katakata</b> did not believe in. When <b>Katakata</b> learns that Kyp is headed looking for a female crow (Kym) who can speak with humans, he tells Kyp that he heard a rumor about such a crow from the east. <b>Katakata</b> joins Kyp in his journey, feeling that perhaps the Maker has brought them together for a reason.|$|E
50|$|Kyp remains reclusive and determined, {{occasionally}} straining his new {{friendship with}} <b>Katakata.</b> They are soon {{joined by a}} group of three crows: the talkative Kyf, her quiet brother Kaf, and her other brother Kwaku, a small crow who was banished from his flock due to his prophetic visions. <b>Katakata</b> takes a disliking to this group, but Kyp thinks that they are perhaps another gift from the Maker. Kwaku's visions appear to be helpful, but <b>Katakata</b> is still skeptical. When <b>Katakata</b> eats some poisoned meat left out by the humans, a strange crow named Erkala who tests <b>Katakata.</b> Luckily, <b>Katakata</b> tests true, and is given the remedy. Erkala takes them to her rocky shoreline home, Where she tells them of how her mother died after they were driven out to sea in a storm and she made her own way in the world, even moving in with a family of rats. Erkala asks to join them.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main types of Yakan vocal music: the lugu and other melodies used {{in reading the}} Quran and other {{religious}} books; the kalangan or songs which may be further reclassified into Jamiluddin and Lunsey; and the <b>katakata,</b> nahana, yaya, lembukayu, and sa-il, among others. The kalangan, jamiluddin, <b>katakata,</b> nahana, and yaya are sung solo, while the lunsey, sa-il, meglubulebu seputangen, and lembukayu involves singers from two groups singing solo as they answer each other. The kalangan, jamiluddin, lunsey, and lembukayu are courting songs. The <b>katakata,</b> jamiluddin, and nahana may also narrate {{the history of the}} Yakan people. The <b>katakata</b> is a long traditional song narrating the lives, loves, and historical backgrounds of people who lived during early times. The Yakan believed that such stories originated from people who lived in another world. The <b>katakata</b> is sung only at night, at a big gathering with food served by the host or hostess. The singing, in episodes, may last for several nights. The singer lies on a mat, the back supported by several pillows. The audience, either sit or lie around the singer. The jamiluddin relates love stories. At present, it is also sung when families discuss marriage engagements. Both the <b>katakata</b> and jamiluddin are sung by wise {{men and women of the}} tribe.|$|E
5000|$|Kyf is a thin, prim, but {{slightly}} bedraggled crow {{who left}} her flock when her brother Kwaku was banished. She is talkative, and while not unkind, can be critical and gets on <b>Katakatas</b> nerves. She is very protective of her brothers. Kyf first {{appears in the}} second book.|$|R
50|$|Spiraeanthemum <b>katakata</b> is {{a species}} of plant in the Cunoniaceae family. It is endemic to Fiji.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Katakata</b> (ru Kamu) is a crow {{who first}} {{appears in the}} second book. He is a bit skeptical, as he has lived as a loner {{for much of his}} life after being banished from his clan (he refused to perform th prayer and {{purification}} after eating the forbidden scavenge from around the human settlements). He is a thief, believing that the Maker intends for him to be [...] "resourceful". However, he also shows much kindness and bravery towards Kyp and his flock of outcasts. <b>Katakata</b> eventually becomes mates with Erkala in the third book.|$|E
5000|$|Many slight {{variants}} {{have been}} patented in the United States, {{one from the}} 1940s having in one block an indentation to hold a penny, which then appeared to dis- and re- appear. The Japanese polymath Hiraga Gennai (1729-1779) constructed a Jacob's ladder which later {{came to be called}} [...] "Gennai's Wondrous Click-clack" [...] (Gennai no fushigina <b>katakata,</b>　源内の不思議なカタカタ).|$|E
5000|$|They then {{journey to}} a large human city (New York City, {{although}} the crow's do not recognize it by that name). After living in Central Park for weeks, they finally find Kym in a building caged up with many other birds. The humans are taking their blood, and Kym suspects {{it has something to}} do with fighting the plague. Despite her interest in the humans, Kym wants to be freed. Erkala enlists the aid of the rats, despite the laws forbidding crows to go underground. [...] "The Maker's tests are never easy," [...] she explains. Together, Kyp, Kwaku, Erkala, and <b>Katakata</b> journey up into the building to free Kym and the other birds. However, the building catches on fire at that moment. Kwaku manages to guide nearly everybody to freedom and safety, but he himself is engulfed by the flames and perishes. <b>Katakata</b> later has a dream in which he is seated in a tree with Kwaku, and Kwaku gives him and Kyp some final guidance before his spirit departs forever. When he recovers from the ordeal inside the burning building, Kyp leads the flock away from the human city in search of a land where they can live in peace and safety.|$|E
5000|$|Erkala (ru Erkata ru Eru) is {{a female}} hooded crow from Europe ("across the waters"), with white {{feathers}} that the North Americans do not have. She is somewhat harsh, viewing nearly every situation {{as a test}} from the Maker, yet willing to risk her life to free the captive birds. She is on good terms with the rats, the only crow the others have ever seen who has made contact with that species. Erkala first appears in the second book and survives {{throughout the rest of}} the series and eventually becoming the mate of <b>Katakata.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{night when}} they are resting, an owl comes along. Kyp tells them to stick close to the tree, {{but some of them}} fly out and are {{attacked}} by the owl. Among those is Kaf, leaving Kyf the only living member of her family. When flying away along the coast, they become hungry because there is little they can eat. They find a loading dock with tons of fish, and Kryk creates the sound of a police siren. The humans run away distracted and the crows gather to eat fish. <b>Katakata</b> finds that a human dropped one of their rings and wears it like a necklace. Although it slows him down and occasionally chokes him when he perches, he does not drop it.|$|E
5000|$|Feather and Bone: The Crow Chronicles is a trilogy {{of young}} adult fantasy novels written by Canadian playwright and screenwriter Clem Martini. All {{of the main}} {{characters}} are crows, which {{are not so much}} anthropomorphic as simply animals of human intelligence who have their own culture, religion, and folktales based on Native American mythology. While the novels take place in the [...] "real world," [...] elements such as the quest-like structure of the plot and the existence of a prophetic crow guided by [...] "the Maker" [...] lie somewhere between the realm of reality, fantasy, and the supernatural. The trilogy is written in the first person minor point of view, with the first book {{from the point of view}} of Kalum, and the second and third from the point of view of <b>Katakata.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crows have a rich {{mythology of}} stories that they use to explain everything. The Maker is the creator of all, and Great Crow is their ancestor. The {{beginning}} of the book will begin {{with one of these}} stories, and occasionally chapters in the middle will do the same thing. Sometimes these stories are used in actual speech by the characters in conversation. In The Judgment, Kyp uses the story of The Maker forgiving Great Crow for stealing Sun Eagle to get a band of crows known as the Urkana to forgive a crow named Kryk. Other times it will be used as a symbol for what they are going through. At {{the end of the third}} book, <b>Katakata</b> tells us a tale about after Great Crow lost Kaynu Firstmate and the Maker created three new mates for him; he picked the third, a crow, because it bleeds and feels pain but recovers. This was to symbolize how through their journeys they had experienced death and pain, but they had recovered.|$|E
5000|$|Then {{there are}} the songs, which the Yakan sing during daily activities. In keeping watch over rice fields, they sing some forms of the jamiluddin and kalangan. While resting at home, they also leisurely sing the <b>katakata,</b> jamiluddin, and nahana. Children at play imitate the adults in singing the kalangan, jamiluddin, lembukayu, and lugu (Nicolas 1977:97-100).One popular Yakan dance adopted from the Tausugs Pangalay is called mangalay. The dance is {{accompanied}} by the kunlintangan kayu and played by three people. In the Yakan [...] "bumblebee" [...] mimetic dance usually performed by a male dancer, a searcher successfully finds honey {{with the aid of}} a torch. He overeats, and the result is a stomachache (Orosa-Goquingco 1980:175). Another example of a mimetic dance is the tahing baila, which imitates the movement of a fish (Tiongson 1991:236). At weddings, the tumahik or war dance is to be performed by the groom as well as male relatives of both the groom and the bride. Dressed in Yakan finery, the dancer uses a spear and a shield to fight an imaginary enemy to the music of the kulintangan. - R. Matilac ...|$|E
50|$|Two mornings after, the {{assembly}} begins again, {{and when a}} very elderly crow gives his reasons for joining the Collection, Kyp becomes as angered as Kuru, but instead of giving a speech, {{he says that he}} is taking the flock elsewhere and they will never {{become a part of the}} Collection. This sends Kuper into a rage and he starts fighting Kyp. With each attack the Urkana draws away from the Collection. Kyp never gets hurt because of his flying agility. One move he performs with grace, but he does not see a car coming and gets hit. Afterwards, Erkala requests that she leave the flock. The next night when <b>Katakata</b> is walking alone, he throws the ring off of his shoulders. Kyp hears the sound and calls for Kata to come by and tells him that he pretended to be dead, and he and Erkala had planned it the whole time, using the body of Kyup in place of Kyp's own. He told Kata to make sure that the flock slowly leaves the Urkana and only then would he and Erkala come back to join them. Kata follows this plan, but soon afterwards hunters come and plan to kill the crows. Kyp comes back to warn all of the crows. The Urkana and Kyp's flock go back to the fallback nests, but the Collection begins attacking the humans, and eventually the others do, too. Kyp hears Kym calling for help and tries to help her, but instead gets caught in a spiderweb when Kuper and Kryk come. Kuper had told Kryk to imitate Kym's call and promised Kryk that he would have a new home once they were finished. Kuper then says to Kryk that his new home would be among the dead and tries to kill Kryk. However, Kryk survives and manages to attack Kuper back into the spiderweb, where Kyp grabs hold of Kuper's leg. Then, a tornado strikes and Kuper is caught between a moment of self-preservation and revenge. He hesitates, and a willow branch knocks him unconscious. He and Kryk are pulled into the tornado and are killed, while Kyp, though pulled in as well, survives.|$|E
40|$|Metatheatre often {{refers to}} the {{capability}} of a stage text and performance to ostensibly establish a gamut of commentaries needed to repudiate a pervading social and political quagmire, tellingly obtainable in societies under siege. Metatheatre is a long established theatre tradition which has been sufficiently calibrated in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, put into a utilitarian proclivity in Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, and fully aestheticized in Jean Genet's The Balcony and The Blacks. It is also a tradition which has been successfully exploited in Wole Soyinka's Madmen and Specialists; Athol Fugard's Sizwe Bansi is Dead; Femi Osofisan's The Chattering and the Song and Segun Oyekunle's <b>Katakata</b> for Sofahead. Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Ngugi wa Mirii steeped a metatheatre into the interface of politics and religion in I Will Marry When I Want, in order to foreground the hypocrisy of Christianity as underscored by the exploitation of the downtrodden masses, by the land grabbing Christian elite of the Kenyan society. This paper will be examining how Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Ngugi wa Miriis' I Will Marry When I Want builds on the harvest of the oral, mimetic and metaphoric signification of myth, history and song, to launch a barrage of criticism {{against a backdrop of}} land theft. This appropriation is poignantly accentuated by a language of equivocation, usually associated with the Christian elite in Kenya. The paper will among other things emphasize that, the rapacious gluttony for land grabbing is indubitably faith driven, as clearly demonstrated by the Kenyan Christian elite in the play...|$|E
