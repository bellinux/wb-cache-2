5000|$|The {{platforms}} of the LRT {{station was}} significantly revamped and remodelled when {{the station was}} physically linked to the nearby monorail station in 2012. These platforms seen here have also been lengthened to accommodate longer trains. The <b>elevated</b> KL <b>Monorail's</b> station is located northeast to the LRT station. The concourse of the stations are located at the street level and level 1 respectively.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the public}} imagination, [...] "maglev" [...] often evokes {{the concept of}} an <b>elevated</b> <b>{{monorail}}</b> track with a linear motor. Maglev systems may be monorail or dual rail and not all monorail trains are maglevs. Some railway transport systems incorporate linear motors but use electromagnetism only for propulsion, without levitating the vehicle. Such trains have wheels and are not maglevs. Maglev tracks, monorail or not, can also be constructed at grade (i.e. not elevated). Conversely, non-maglev tracks, monorail or not, can be elevated too. Some maglev trains do incorporate wheels and function like linear motor-propelled wheeled vehicles at slower speeds but [...] "take off" [...] and levitate at higher speeds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{city also}} has a metro system, {{consisting}} of two heavy rail lines. Line 1 crosses the city from northeast to southwest, while Line 2 crosses from west to east. Line 3 from northwest to southeast is an <b>elevated</b> <b>monorail.</b> All the lines are and will be operated by the [...] (DTRO). Another line will operate {{in a few years}} as a heavy rail system using the Gumi–Daegu–Gyeongsan section of Gyeongbu Line. Line 4 is a long-range plan and will be a circle line. Fare is 1200 won on distance and 1100 won with a prepaid card. There is a free interchange scheme between the metro and bus within an hour of first use for the prepaid card users.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, {{the project}} was stalled after {{disagreement}} between PT Jakarta Monorel as the contractor and developer with Jakarta Municipal Government, over {{the design of the}} stations as well as the land acquisition for the monorail depot. The proposed <b>elevated</b> grand <b>monorail</b> station in Dukuh Atas, Stadion Madya Senayan and Kuningan Sentral for example, has raised critical questions since the supporting pylons of this grand stations will occupy public spaces; street, canal, pedestrian and public parks.|$|R
50|$|The Skyway runs on an <b>elevated</b> two-way <b>monorail</b> track. The 2.5 mi system serves eight {{stations}} in Downtown Jacksonville: {{five in the}} Downtown Core and LaVilla areas, and three across the St. Johns River on the Southbank. There are two routes running south from Rosa Parks Transit Station and branching at Central station: one going west and terminating at Convention Center station, and the other going south over the river and terminating at Kings Avenue station on the Southbank.|$|R
5000|$|Monorails {{have found}} {{applications}} in airport transfer and medium capacity metros. To differentiate monorails from other transport modes, the Monorail Society defines a monorail as a [...] "single rail {{serving as a}} track for passenger or freight vehicles. In most cases rail is <b>elevated,</b> but <b>monorails</b> can also run at grade, below grade or in subway tunnels. Vehicles either are suspended from or straddle a narrow guide way. Monorail vehicles are wider than the guide way that supports them.” ...|$|R

50|$|Between 1988 and 2013, {{the bridge}} carried the <b>elevated</b> Sydney <b>Monorail,</b> which {{travelled}} between Darling Harbour and the Sydney central business district. The monorail track {{rested on a}} pivot that allowed the track to remain stationary while the bridge swung underneath. The pivot allowed the monorail to continue to cross the bridge even when the bridge was opened. Upon {{the closure of the}} Monorail in June 2013 the hydraulic lifting rams and support infrastructure were removed, and the control cab was to be relocated to its original position {{in the middle of the}} bridge.|$|R

50|$|Major {{changes to}} the public {{transportation}} section were made. The monorail, a fast moving above-ground railway, was introduced for high density areas. Unlike its similar partner, the above-ground railway (<b>Elevated</b> Rail), the <b>monorail</b> is much more modern-looking and faster, and also can be built over ground level roads, highways, avenues, streets and railways, much like an elevated highway. The elevated rail is cheaper than the monorail and can connect to the city's subway system.|$|R
40|$|MONORAIL SYSTEMS. DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. INITIATIVE STATUTE.

5|$|Nolan {{worked with}} {{production}} designer Nathan Crowley {{to create the}} look of Gotham City. Crowley built {{a model of the}} city that filled Nolan's garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its <b>elevated</b> freeways and <b>monorails.</b> The Narrows was based on the slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.|$|R

50|$|Tram {{opposition}} campaigners {{suggested that}} a monorail system could be considered as an alternative solution to west London congestion problems. In 2003, a proposal was considered by Hounslow London Borough Council to construct a 21 km <b>elevated</b> <b>monorail</b> along the central reservation of the A4 route from Hammersmith to Heathrow Airport. The proposal was rejected by TfL.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these blueprints, additional facilities will also be installed together with the existing bike route such as Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV), solar panel and revitalization of the landscape surrounding the bike route. Furthermore, additional 4m of the space under <b>elevated</b> railway and <b>monorail</b> has been reserved for bike route purpose. Due {{to some of the}} motorists start parking at bike route illegally since the opening of the Southwest Dedicated Bicycle Highway, actions has been taken by the authorities to ensure that no motorists can park their car on the bike route by educating the motorists about rules of the bike route in {{addition to}} tow away the car that are parked on the bike lane.|$|R
5000|$|In Batman Begins, the {{art deco}} Chicago Board of Trade Building {{was used for}} the film's Wayne Tower, which in the film, was also as the hub of Gotham's water and {{elevated}} railway systems. Garrick Theatre stood in as Gotham's opera house. 35 East Wacker was used as the Gotham courthouse. Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire was used to portray Wayne Manor. Nolan desired that Gotham appeared as a large, modern city that nonetheless reflected a variety of architecture styles and periods, as well as different socioeconomic strata. The production's approach depicted Gotham as an exaggeration of New York, with elements taken from Chicago, the <b>elevated</b> freeways and <b>monorails</b> of Tokyo, and the [...] "walled city of Kalhoon" [...] in Hong Kong, which was the basis for the slum in the film known as The Narrows.|$|R
5000|$|From the passenger's perspective, monorails {{can have}} some {{advantages}} over trains, buses, and automobiles. As with other grade-separated transit systems, monorails avoid red lights, intersection turns, and traffic jams. [...] Surface-level trains, buses, automobiles, and pedestrians can collide each one with the other, while vehicles on dedicated, grade-separated rights-of-way such as monorails can collide only with other vehicles on the same system, with much fewer opportunities for collision. As with other <b>elevated</b> transit systems, <b>monorail</b> passengers enjoy sunlight and views and by watching for familiar landmarks, they can know better when to get off to reach their destinations. [...] As with other systems, expensive and noisy ventilation systems are not necessary if the cars have traditional windows that can be opened by passengers. (This also eliminates the weight and bulk of ventilation systems.) Monorails can be quieter than diesel buses and trains. They obtain electricity from the track structure, eliminating costly and unsightly overhead power lines and poles. Compared to the elevated train systems of New York, Chicago and elsewhere, a monorail beamway casts a narrow shadow. (See 'Chicago [...] "L"' [...] ) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{train is}} one of the most environmentally friendly systems because it is a completely electrical system and does not create direct pollution. Also, the <b>elevated</b> <b>monorail</b> system and hill climbing capabilities guarantee a minimal environmental impact. This makes the system compatible with the fragile and rich ecosystems because this kind of track requires less earthmoving than conventional systems. Likewise, generated electromagnetic fields meets international standards.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAsian {{countries}} have experienced tremendous {{changes in their}} mobility patterns in recent years. As economic development has allowed {{a rise in the}} standards of living of a god part of the population, the rate of motorzation has increased very quickly. At the sametime, cities populations continue to grow at a fast pace, and the spread of the urbanized area requires more and more to be able to travel on distances too long for walking or even bicycling. Given the high density of many central cities, and the concentration of economic activity, this had led to major problems of urban congestion and pollution. National and local governments have tried to solve some of the problems by investing heavily in major public transportation projects such as subways, <b>elevated</b> light-rail or <b>monorail.</b> A less costly approach has been the development of Bus Rapid Transit inspired by South American successful experiences. A the sam time, the automobile, and in some places the motorbike, have relegated the oncedominant bicycle into secondary streets, and the fabric of the city is now largely shaped bythe needs of the automobile. However, little attention has been given to the informal sector, often considered as a nuisance hindering more modern forms of transit throught he city, even if its provides many jobs for lesser-skilled workers and cheap transport for the poorer populations...|$|R
