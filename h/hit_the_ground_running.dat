They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E

As the 2012–13 season drew to a close, League Two managers voted him the fifth best player of the season at the annual Football League Awards.

Game Informer was disappointed {{and gave it a}} 6.25/10, saying [...] "Empire Earth couldn't walk the walk like it talked the talk.

[...] Ford was a fan of the show as a child, and revealed that when she was 12, she wrote around ten letters to the casting director requesting a part.

[...] Zac Bertschy gave the series a 4.5 for the first episode, saying [...] "Iron-Blooded Orphans has a lot of moving parts, but it's only deceptively complex; this episode starts out confusing (due to the relatively haphazard way they introduce all the various factions and the sizable cast) but as it goes on it all becomes very clear". He also adds [...] "Instantly likable characters, desperate battles, a broad science fiction story about a colony struggling for independence, giant robots and even a Char-like smooth-talking pretty boy weirdo who's working with the bad guys; what's not to love?" ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2006, I {{was sitting on a}} hard chair in a former library, a room that had once heaved with text but was now full of people. This was a conference about type, and those present were people who love type, like to use it, like to collect it, like to call it by its name. Then came a lengthy pause, the {{previous}} speaker’s PowerBook (or maybe it was a PC) had been disconnected from the big projector and the next person was connected but not yet <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running.</b> My mind wandered to thoughts of the Gettysburg Address as a Power-Point presentation, and I drifted into wondering if anyone ever gives lectures any more, even illustrated ones: are they all ‘presentations’? Then came the notion that something else could be happening while the technicians were mumbling and fiddling with the technology, something involving the audience. Something involving writing, real writing, not just playing around with bézier curves in Illustrator, could be going on while we were waiting. A little later on I had a chat with Caroline Archer, one of the conference organisers. She didn’t recoil in horror so I thought I might be on to something...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the leadership}} style of Tri Rismaharini, the Mayor of Surabaya City (2010 - 2020) using feminist research methodology by centralizing on women‟s personal experiences {{in a specific}} context to gain knowledge based on their real life experiences. It employed a qualitative approach by using various videos and written materials of Risma‟s attitudes and experiences as a female political leader. The findings discover that unlike the common feminine leadership style of Indonesian female political leaders, Risma‟s shows a masculine leadership style. It {{can be seen from}} her assertive approaches while closing down Gang Dolly located in Surabaya as the biggest red-light district in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, Risma‟s masculinity is combined with motherly value which results in an androgynous leadership style. This paper shows that rather than merely accepting the western notion which believes that the more a woman shows masculinity, <b>the</b> more she <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running</b> for exercising power in the male-dominated political atmosphere. This paper would like to show that Javanese society‟s acceptance of Risma‟s leadership style indicates their approval for female leadership and wider tolerance towards new value of masculinity performed by a female leader despite inconsistency with the gender normative standard of feminine Javanese women. This paper concludes by emphasizing that Risma‟s masculine leadership traits can be seen as strategizing a move towards hijacking “hegemonic masculinity”...|$|R

5000|$|On 23 October 2002, it was {{reported}} that Tracy would be reintroduced later that year. A show spokesman says the new Tracy will be sexy, sassy and opinionated. She will make a beeline for womanising bookie Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), her own stepbrother, before moving on to former sailor Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) and knicker factory boss Joe Carter (Jonathan Wrather). Tracy returns home to Weatherfield at Christmas after turning to her mother, Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), when her marriage breaks down - she left the Street after marrying Robert Preston (Julian Kay) at Weatherfield Register Office. The character was last played by Dawn Acton. A Coronation Street spokesman said: [...] "We are looking at other actresses because the character has changed so much - she's going to be explosive." [...] Explaining the decision to bring Tracy back as an anti-hero, writer Daran Little commented: [...] "You only have to look at a character whose parents got divorced when she was very young and then pulled either way to find out this woman is very flawed and has a chip on her shoulder. So you take that and bring her back a few years later as a very selfish person." [...] On 13 November 2002, it was announced that Kate Ford had been cast as Tracy. It {{was reported}} that Acton was said to be [...] "devastated" [...] when she failed to win the part which Instead went to Ford. But whereas Tracy Barlow was a glum-faced teenager, Tracy Preston - as she is now called - is a sexy, sassy and opinionated man-eater. At the same time it was also reported that Tracy would sleep with her mother's former flame Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin). A Coronation Street spokeswoman said Ford, fresh from London's Webber Douglas Academy but originally from north Lancashire, was [...] "thrilled" [...] to have landed the role. [...] "She is very excited to have got the part. The character has changed substantially {{in the past four years}} and really <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running.</b> Kate is thrilled."

Melodies and scores well-receivedWong Yue Sang (see #1 above) and Chu Ngai Kong (see #4 above) came up {{with most of the}} well-known pieces.Mr. Wong Sum Fan (王心帆 1896 to August, 1992） refused to write lyrics, disliking those easy to sing modern melodies not written by the two above. (traditional versus easy for beginners, not veterans like Yam who can sing in a different way each and every time, to sing = 梆黃/小曲"易上口")4). Glamorous setting and costumes to matchEnticing to first time theatre-goers who are not knowledgeable. Especially when compared to rags to riches of The Story of the Lute which is known as the favorite of many performers. Glamor is opposite to tradition. Chinese opera (Xìqǔ) has been relying on no more than a table and two chairs as support for travelling performers with storylines, voices and skills to hold the audience's attention. Yam, for example, has been called the prevailing performer as (落拓窮酸書生) a scholar in rags. It was believed glamorous/fancy costume, just like fancy vocal style, would have made Yam less manly.5). Big castsFor example, Lam Kar Sing, the successor of Sit, along Leung Sing Bor and Lang Chi Bak. Most important was Yam Kim Fai as male lead exclusively on stage while Yam still worked with other co-stars in films. Why Not Return? in 1958 was also a breakthrough for Lam Kar Sing starring his first film, a Sit classic legacy title, opposite Fong (instead of a classmate). These four performers were also what some called [...] "film distributors could take to the bank".6). RehearsalsFollow the Sit tradition to rehearse till confident about <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>running</b> at debut.7). Sing and dance but duet instead of soloSee musical theatre - Tang's solution when the female lead could neither measure up to Fong/Hung nor hold her own court with vocal performances. (For example, from the January The Story of the Lute all the way up against September The Summer Snow in 1956.) While some, LGBT or not, in the audience enjoyed the arousing singing of the female lead, some (conservatives 良家婦女) opined that noises she made were obscene.8). Hanky-pankyWithout being pornographic or scandalous, hanky-panky of some sort, of two actresses. Shippers like Natalia Chan had expressed their 360 degree fantasy such as [...] "too bad they don't...." [...] while two sisters had a plan for their own boy toy. Ban on actors/actresses sharing the stage was lifted about 20 years before this. The interaction on stage between actors (or actress like Yam) in male lead roles and actresses in female lead roles were very modest.9).
