However, after {{completing}} the first shooting schedule, she was unceremoniously dropped and replaced by Meera Jasmine. She was signed up under <b>false</b> <b>pretences</b> for a sex comedy, a genre she was uncomfortable with, and {{decided to leave the}} project. Thereafter, she signed on for a third Tamil film, Manasellam (2003), but was replaced by Trisha as the director was dissatisfied with her work. Kalari Vikraman, another Malayalam film that she completed work for in 2003, failed to get a theatrical release.|$|E

They arrived at Dundee {{on the evening of}} 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under <b>false</b> <b>pretences</b> by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day.

When Sanson arrived {{at the gates of}} Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on <b>false</b> <b>pretences.</b> This was over a year after Martin Luther published his Ninety-five theses (31 October 1517). The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.|$|E

5|$|In 1528, {{sweating}} sickness {{broke out}} with great severity. In London, {{the mortality rate}} was great and the court was dispersed. Henry left London, frequently changing his residence; Anne Boleyn retreated to the Boleyn residence at Hever Castle, but contracted the illness; her brother-in-law, William Carey, died. Henry sent his own physician to Hever Castle to care for Anne, and shortly afterwards, she recovered. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment from Catherine. Henry had set his hopes upon a direct appeal to the Holy See, acting independently of Cardinal Wolsey, to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans related to Anne. In 1527 William Knight, the King's secretary, was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, {{on the grounds that}} the dispensing bull of Pope Julius II permitting him to marry his brother's widow, Catherine, had been obtained under <b>false</b> <b>pretences.</b> Henry also petitioned, in the event of his becoming free, a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in the first degree of affinity, whether the affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection. This clearly referred to Anne.|$|E

He asks Quinn to watch over Devra. Quinn leaves Devra unwatched to return to question the men about his missing girl but is again unsuccessful. He is increasingly agitated about being intimidated by the men.|$|E
25|$|Le Vau redid the exteriors of Saint-Fargeau {{at a cost}} of 200,000 livres. They {{were lost}} in a fire in 1752 and {{suffered}} further damage in 1850, thus all evidence of the appearance of Mademoiselle's residence was lost. Despite being an exile, she still visited her father at Blois. While at Saint-Fargeau, she dabbled in writing and wrote a small biography under the title of Madame de Fouquerolles despite her bad spelling and grammar. Mademoiselle looked to her financial affairs, which had been under her father's management. Having reached her majority in 1652 it was discovered that her father had not been entirely honest with the management of her finances and that was the reason for her 800,000 livres of debt. At the same time her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Guise, tricked Mademoiselle into signing away money to her under <b>false</b> <b>pretences.</b> Her father was involved with this, which caused her relationship with Gaston to deteriorate. In 1656, hearing that her father had been excused for his various scandals, Mademoiselle herself said she would forget the bad blood caused by his financial misdemeanours and resumed her close relationship with him.|$|E

In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, [...] "Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants got money, {{and to a lesser}} extent, what they did with that money when they got it...

[...] Less than three months elapsed between the discovery of Emily Mather’s body in Windsor, Melbourne, in March 1892, and Deeming’s execution at the Old Melbourne Gaol for her murder in May 1892; a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards. [...] After his execution, it was reported that over 12,000 people cheered on the streets outside, and there was public speculation that Deeming was in fact Jack the Ripper.|$|E

500|$|Garrow {{started as}} a {{criminal}} defence barrister at the Old Bailey, in a time where many defendants became increasingly reliant on barristers to prevent their conviction. His first case was actually as a prosecutor; on 14 January 1784, barely two months after he was called to the Bar, he prosecuted John Henry Aikles for obtaining a bill of exchange under <b>false</b> <b>pretences.</b> It was alleged that Aikles had promised to pay Samuel Edwards £100 and a small commission for a £100 bill of exchange, and {{when he took the}} bill, failed to hand over the money. Despite Aikles's counsel claiming, according to Edward Foss, that [...] "this was no felony", and being represented by two of the most prestigious criminal barristers of the day, Garrow convinced both the judge and the jury that Aikles was guilty. Garrow later defended Aikles in September 1785, securing his release due to ill-health.|$|E
500|$|The rumours persisted; {{sixty years}} later the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off during the scandal, but Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, was convicted of obstruction of justice for helping his clients escape abroad, and was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Over twenty years later in 1910, Newton was struck off for twelve months for professional misconduct after falsifying letters from another of his clients, the notorious murderer Dr Crippen. In 1913, Newton was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by <b>false</b> <b>pretences.</b>|$|E

[...] Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of [...] "sharia for UK", saying in reference to the exclusion of women: [...] "Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until you either become like them or adopt their ways." [...] Outside the hall, Choudary criticised British society, and predicted that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades.

500|$|Lody {{was taken}} back to London where he was {{detained}} in Wellington Barracks under the watch of the 3rdBattalion, the Grenadier Guards. A meeting of the Cabinet on 8 October decided to try him for [...] "war treason", a decision that {{has been described as}} [...] "legally, very curious" [...] by the legal historian A. W. B. Simpson. He was not charged with espionage under either of the two relevant statutes, the Official Secrets Act 1911 or DORA. The principal reason lay in the wording of the Hague Convention of 1907, which states: [...] "A person can only be considered a spy when, acting clandestinely or on <b>false</b> <b>pretences,</b> he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party." [...] Lody was operating in the British Isles, outside the zone of operations, and was therefore not covered by this definition. Such circumstances had been anticipated by the most recent edition of the British Manual of Military Law, published in February 1914, which recommended that individuals in such cases should be tried for war treason: [...] "Indeed in every case where it is doubtful whether the act consists of espionage, once the fact is established that an individual has furnished or attempted to furnish information to the enemy, no time need be wasted in examining whether the case corresponds exactly to the definition of espionage." ...|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by <b>false</b> <b>pretences.</b> Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E
