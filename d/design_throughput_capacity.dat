This comparison is instrumental in taking architectural level trade-off decisions in-order to meet the present day requirements and also be ready to support a future evolution. In terms of throughput, a gain of 20 % (6250 packets/sec) is achieved in the HW-SW implementation by accelerating the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding in hardware.

Based on the benchmark random network model, we then elaborate the advanced strategies adopted to improve the <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity,</b> and other factors that affect the scaling laws. We also present the fundamental tradeoffs between <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> and delay under a variety of mobility models. In addition, the capacity and delay for hybrid wireless networks are surveyed, in which there are at least two types of nodes functioning differently, e. g., normal nodes and infrastructure nodes.

Using the exact modeling for line networks, it is shown that the <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> is unaltered in the absence of hop-by-hop feedback provided packet-level network coding is allowed.

The end-to-end <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> is computed by considering the interference due to neighboring nodes, as well as various modes of hidden node interference.

The end-to-end <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> can then be determined once these link capacities are obtained. To illustrate the utility of our proposed methodology, we present two important applications: (a) route optimization to determine the path with the maximum end-to-end <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> and, (b) optimal offered load control for a given path so that the maximum end-to-end capacity can be achieved.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} many-to-one <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> (and by symmetry, one-to-many <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity)</b> of IEEE 802. 11 multi-hop networks. It has {{generally}} been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> is upper-bounded by the link <b>capacity</b> L. <b>Throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> L is not achievable under 802. 11. This paper introduces the notion of “canonical networks”, which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the <b>throughput</b> <b>capacity</b> of canonical networks under 802. 11 has an analytical upper bound of 3 L/ 4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink; and simulated throughputs of 0. 690 L (0. 740 L) when the source nodes are many hops away (two hops away). We conjecture that 3 L/ 4 is also the upper bound for general networks. When all links have equal length, 2 L/ 3 can {{be shown to be}} the upper bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802. 11 networks with random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be improved significantly by more than 150 %. Indeed, in a dense network, it is worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.
