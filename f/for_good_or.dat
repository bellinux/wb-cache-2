5|$|The story follows protagonist Cole MacGrath on {{his quest}} in New Marais to grow {{powerful}} {{enough to be able}} to face his nemesis, the Beast. Cole possesses electricity-based superpowers which are used in combat and navigating the city. The player is given several opportunities to use these powers <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> selfish purposes in the game's Karma system. The Karma system affects what powers become available, the reaction of the city's populace towards Cole, and the story.|$|E
5|$|Infamous (stylized as inFAMOUS) is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Sucker Punch Productions {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3. The game was released in North America on May 26, 2009, in Europe on May 29, 2009, in Australia on June 4, 2009 and in Japan on November 5, 2009. In Infamous, the player controls the protagonist Cole MacGrath, a bike messenger caught {{in the center of}} an explosion that devastates several city blocks of the fictional Empire City. The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity-based super powers. Though the game's story follows Cole using his new abilities to restore some semblance of order to Empire City, the player is given several opportunities to use these powers <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil purposes in the game's Karma system. These choices ultimately affect character growth, the reaction of the City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E

He is trying to understand why God has denied him the Stairway to Heaven by allowing him to be made into an immortal spirit who is bound to the gold-encased bones of his mortal body. As a genie, he must obey the Master of those bones (whoever has them at the moment) and become the Master's Servant, whether <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil.

25|$|Along {{with the}} majors and pioneers, {{there were other}} BMX {{governing}} bodies, both national and regional and past and present. Among them were the Bicycle Motocross League (BMXL); the United Bicycle Racers Association (UBR) (1977–1983); the United States Bicycle Motocross Association (USBA) (1984–1986), which merged with the ABA {{at the end of}} the 1986 racing season after financial trouble made it unsustainable; the International Cycling Association (ICA), which was started in part by professional racer Greg Hill in 1990; and the Southeast Region-based National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA) (1975–1988).

[...] Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human.

500|$|In February 1912, Mackintosh married Gladys Campbell, {{and settled}} into an office job as {{assistant}} secretary to the Imperial Merchant Service Guild in Liverpool.

500|$|In {{naming the}} character, {{executive}} producer and head writer Russell T Davies {{drew inspiration from}} the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows {{him to get a}} grip of the character on the blank page. Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, [...] "Is he a force <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> ill?" ...|$|E

In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity.

500|$|The {{show has}} some {{superficial}} similarities to {{the comic strip}} Dilbert, which also features employees coping with an inept superior. John Spector, CEO of The Conference Board, says that both show the impact a leader can have, <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad. Dilbert creator Scott Adams also touts the similarities: [...] "The lesson from The Office and from Dilbert {{is that people are}} often dysfunctional, and no amount of training can fix it." [...] A labor-affiliated group praised the episode [...] "Boys and Girls" [...] for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of union busting on American television. [...] Metacritic, a review aggregation website, only graded the first, third, sixth, and final seasons. However, it denoted that all four of them received [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] from critics, awarding a 61, 85, 78, and 64 score—out of 100—to each of them, respectively.
