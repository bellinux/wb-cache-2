Toxicity of all tested compounds to soil organisms was accurately described by the toxicity-K-ow relationship. However, for the sediment invertebrates exposed to some of the tested heterocyclic PACs deviations from narcosis were identified, related to specific physicochemical properties of the test compounds and/or species specific sensitivities. It is concluded that existing toxicity-K-ow relationships describing narcosis in some cases underestimate chronic PAC toxicity to sediment inhabiting invertebrates...|$|R

These toxicity tests typically result in a No Observed <b>Effect</b> <b>Concentration</b> (NOEC, also called a No Observable Effect Level or NOEL).

40|$|<b>Effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the {{toxicity}} assessment of chemicals with fish and fish cells are generally based on external exposure concentrations. External concentrations as dose metrics, may, however, hamper interpretation and extrapolation of toxicological effects {{because it is}} the internal concentration that gives rise to the biological effective dose. Thus, we need to understand the relationship between the external and internal concentrations of chemicals. The objectives of this study were to: (i) elucidate the time-course of the concentration of chemicals {{with a wide range of}} physicochemical properties in the compartments of an in vitro test system, (ii) derive a predictive model for toxicokinetics in the in vitro test system, (iii) test the hypothesis that internal <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> in fish (in vivo) and fish cell lines (in vitro) correlate, and (iv) develop a quantitative in vitro to in vivo toxicity extrapolation method for fish acute toxicity. To achieve these goals, time-dependent amounts of organic chemicals were measured in medium, cells (RTgill-W 1) and the plastic of exposure wells. Then, the relation between uptake, elimination rate constants, and log KOW was investigated for cells in order to develop a toxicokinetic model. This model was used to predict internal <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> in cells, which were compared with internal <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> in fish gills predicted by a Physiologically Based Toxicokinetic model.

40|$|Mechanistic {{studies on}} {{membrane}} toxicity are reviewed and linked to effects observed in-vivo. Time-resolved spectroscopy on energy-transducing membranes is an in-vitro test method that {{provides information on}} the toxicodynamics of membrane toxicity, namely baseline toxicity and uncoupling. Without blurring effects of the toxicokinetic phase, the intrinsic potency of membrane toxicants can directly be determined thus allowing {{the development of a}} classification system to distinguish between baseline toxicity and uncoupling. Toxicity data of known baseline toxicants and of substituted phenols from literature are reevaluated in light of the information obtained from the mechanistic test system. Exposure-based effect data (aqueous <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations)</b> of substituted phenols (baseline toxicants and uncouplers) from various aquatic organisms (bacteria, protozoa, algae, daphnids, fish) are compared to the corresponding <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> expected from baseline toxicity. The results of the comparison support the view that the membrane is the primary target site for acute toxicity of substituted phenols in aquatic organisms. The classification into baseline toxicants and uncouplers based upon the criteria derived from the mechanistic test system is correct. Nevertheless, the acute toxicity in-vivo cannot be correlated quantitatively to the mechanistic data presumably because bioaccumulation is not directly proportional to intrinsic toxicity and the metabolic transformation is variable within the test set of substituted phenols. The pH-dependence of acute toxicity is mainly determined by the pH-dependence of bioccumulation, the internal <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> are virtually independent on external pH. The internal <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations,</b> also called lethal body burdens or critical body residues, which are taken from the literature or calculated from aqueous <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> and bioconcentration factors, are related to membrane concentrations using a simple three-compartment equilibrium partitioning model. The modeled membrane concentrations of non-polar and polar narcotics turn out to be statistically indistinguishable, which is consistent with the findings from the mechanistic test system. The toxic ratios, i. e., the excess toxicity of uncouplers in relation to their baseline toxicity, agree for most compounds upon comparison of the mechanistic test system with the aquatic organisms thus confirming that uncoupling is the dominant mode of action responsible for lethality...|$|R

5000|$|Dose-Response Analysis, is {{determining}} {{the relationship between}} dose {{and the type of}} adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. mouse, rat) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to genetics or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a no <b>effect</b> <b>concentration.</b> In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the [...] "safe" [...] dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.|$|E
5000|$|Biology-based methods {{not only}} aim to {{describe}} observed effects, {{but also to}} understand {{them in terms of}} underlying processes such as toxico-kinetics, mortality, feeding, growth and reproduction (Kooijman 1997). This type of approach starts with the description of the uptake and elimination of a compound by an organism is, as an effect can only be expected if the compound is inside the organism, and where the No <b>Effect</b> <b>Concentration</b> is one of the modeling parameters. As the approach is biologically based it is also possible by using Dynamic Energy Budget theory [...] to incorporate multiple stressors (e.g. effects of food restriction, temperature [...] ), and quite a few processes that are active under field conditions (e.g. adaptation, population dynamics, species interactions, life cycle phenomena [...] ). The effects of these multiple stressors are excluded in the standard test procedures by keeping the local environment in the test constant. It is also possible to use these parameter values to predict effects at longer exposure times, or effects when the concentration in the medium is not constant. If the observed effects include those on survival and reproduction of individuals, these parameters {{can also be used to}} predict effects on growing populations in the field.|$|E

30|$|Absolute sensitivity, however, is {{of crucial}} {{importance}} in risk assessment since parameters like the Predicted No <b>Effect</b> <b>Concentrations</b> (PNEC) {{are derived from}} the toxic <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations.</b> If the in vitro <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> are higher than the corresponding in vivo values, this will lead to non-protective PNEC values, {{and the use of}} in vitro cytotoxicity data instead of in vivo toxicity data would substantially underestimate the hazard of chemicals and effluents for the environment. The apparently low sensitivity of the in vitro assays is, therefore, a major stumbling block in their application for regulatory hazard assessment [31, 126]. The crucial point here is that the simple linear comparison of in vitro and in vivo <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{does not take into account}} possible differences of chemical bioavailability in vitro and in vivo [14, 120]. The serum in the cell culture media as well as the plastic material of the culture plates for the cells can reduce chemical bioavailability to the cells by binding substantial fractions of the test chemicals [84]. As shown by Gülden et al. [67], converting the in vitro EC 50 values into the free fraction EC 50, i.e. the concentration that is not bound to serum, leads to a much better correspondence of in vitro and in vivo <b>effect</b> <b>concentrations.</b> This line of thinking was consequently further developed in the study of Tanneberger et al. [141]: Instead of nominal EC 50 concentrations, these authors used the effective EC 50 concentrations, i.e. the chemical fraction that is freely available to the cells and found a very good agreement between the effective EC 50 values of 35 organic chemicals in the RTgill-W 1 cytotoxicity assay and the in vivo LC 50 values of the test compounds. For up to 73 % of the test chemicals, the difference between the in vitro and the in vivo data was less than fivefold, thus, much lower than what is observed in comparisons on the basis of nominal concentrations (see above). Appropriate toxicokinetic prediction models can further improve the estimation of in vivo toxic concentrations from in vitro cytotoxicity data. A number of such models have been developed over the last decade in human toxicology (e.g. [13, 154]), but corresponding approaches are now emerging in fish toxicology as well [25, 136].|$|R
