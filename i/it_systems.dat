40|$|Since {{the concept}} of {{universal}} design is already extending the boundary of disabilities, it is significant to include different aspects of information technology where universal design enabled efforts can contribute towards better designed systems, products and services. Sustainability is an important and growing public concern in today’s world. Nevertheless, attempts of designing <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> that can be called sustainable in nature are not so evident at present. In this {{paper we propose a}} framework originating from sustainable <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> design principles (also described in the paper). The universal design principles are used as a foundation upon which the resultant sustainable <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> design principles were derived. The concept of ‘sustainable IT system’ addressed in this research paper is beyond the common phenomenon of sustainability like green IT, CO 2  emission etc. Rather, the framework proposed in this paper incorporates more user inclusion and increased user satisfaction together towards higher usability. And an <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> designed in this manner is a sustainable <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> according to the argument of this paper which can therefore be designed by following the proposed design principles and framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} to apply the risk assessment framework into the information system of the hospital in Thailand. By using our proposed framework, the hospital's IT administrators {{would be able to}} manually collect and evaluate some system vulnerabilities and risk of the <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> by themselves. The risk assessment framework consists of 6 steps including (1) Information gathering, (2) current capabilities to control vulnerability, (3) Number of threat occurrence from the past, (4) Evaluation of threat’s likelihood, (5) Threat’s impact measurement, and (6) Risk evaluation and determination. This research applies the technique called Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing in order to explore system vulnerabilities inside the <b>IT</b> <b>system,</b> and subsequently examine the capability to control these vulnerabilities. After developing a conceptual model and process of risk assessment, this framework has been used at 2 medium-size hospital. As the pre-forecasting evaluated from factors such as system readiness, hardware readiness, user readiness, as well as the proposed technique in which develop check list and check sheet to examine the sysytem, the results are consistent with the outcome when we apply our conceptual framework into the hospital's <b>IT</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, the experimental result shows the risk inside the <b>IT</b> <b>system,</b> severity of vulnerability and consequent impact that may occur when <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> is under attack. The results of this research can be used to fix and strengthen the <b>IT</b> <b>system</b> in the hospitals in order to efficiently reduce the level of risks...|$|R
