5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra {{experienced}} widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and colonnade columns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> by shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.|$|E

5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that the crime scene may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of prehistoric}} human {{occupation}} {{in the parish}} exists {{in the form of}} 30 round barrows, about half of which are sited over chalk and half over Reading Beds. Many of the barrows <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> by more recent activities. The remains of strip lynchets of 'Celtic' fields have been found near a few of the barrows. One of the three 'Rainbarrows' on Duddle Heath has been excavated; bucket urns containing cremations from the site were taken to the Dorset County Museum.|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as a focal point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} Endangered Species Act protections for orca.

5|$|Action Film and JIF {{continued}} producing films {{until the}} beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Indies began in early 1942, leading to the closing of all but one film studio. The cast of Srigala Item remained with JIF until the company closed, as did Tan. According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Catalogue of Indonesian Films), a copy of Srigala Item is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. The reels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> by acid, leading to part of the film being excised.|$|E

Andrew and Samantha decide to hitchhike their way to the coast.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Leo Joseph {{and colleagues}} {{acknowledged}} the finding but {{pointed out that}} the sample might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the Coracopsis genus, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that are believed to be psittaculines. He also {{pointed out that the}}re is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support the hypothesis that the species evolved elsewhere before reaching Réunion.|$|E

5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some concern}} that {{areas of the}} Moss <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> or partly {{destroyed}} {{as a result of}} agricultural activity, including the digging of drainage ditches. Natural England, the agency responsible for the management of SSSIs in England, has suggested that no further irrigation channels should be dug, existing ones should not be deepened, and that the area should not be exposed to fertilisers or surface water run-off. Natural England further notes that the site's continued status as an SSSI depends on maintaining a high water table.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E

5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged,</b> greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into {{the interior of the}} ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|During the Mongol {{invasion}} in 1240, the monastery {{is believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> seriously. The Mongols damaged the cathedral and removed its gold-plated domes. The cloister subsequently fell into disrepair {{and there is no}} documentation of it for the following two and a half centuries. By 1496, the monastery had been revived and its name was changed from St. Demetrius' Monastery to St. Michael's after the cathedral church built by Sviatopolk II. After numerous restorations and enlargements during the sixteenth century, it gradually {{became one of the most}} popular and wealthiest monasteries in Ukraine. In 1620, Iov Boretsky made it the residence of the renewed Orthodox metropolitan of Kiev, and in 1633, Isaya Kopynsky was named a supervisor of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|During the Syrian Civil War {{which began}} in 2011, UNESCO voiced {{concerns}} that the war might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as Krak des Chevaliers.

The castle was reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> in July 2013 by an airstrike during the Siege of Homs, and once more on 18 August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown. The Syrian Arab Army recaptured the castle and the village of al-Hosn from rebel forces on March 20, 2014, although the extent of damage from earlier mortar hits remained unclear.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E

It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E
