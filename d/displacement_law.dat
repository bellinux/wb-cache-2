25|$|Measurement of the {{spectrum}} of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-dimensional black body can provide an accurate temperature measurement because the frequency of maximum spectral radiance of black-body radiation is directly proportional to {{the temperature of the}} black body; this is known as Wien's <b>displacement</b> <b>law</b> and has a theoretical explanation in Planck's law and the Bose–Einstein law.|$|E
25|$|Evidently, the {{location}} of the peak of the spectral distribution for Planck's law depends on the choice of spectral variable. Nevertheless, in a manner of speaking, this formula means that the shape of the spectral distribution is independent of temperature, according to Wien's <b>displacement</b> <b>law,</b> as detailed below in the sub-section Percentiles of the section Properties.|$|E

25|$|Which peak to use {{depends on}} the application. The {{conventional}} choice is the wavelength peak at 25.0% given by Wien's <b>displacement</b> <b>law</b> in its weak form. For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the total radiation into two halves may be more suitable. The latter {{is closer to the}} frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at short wavelengths and only polynomially at long. The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|For {{experimental}} physics, hotness means that, {{when comparing}} any two given bodies {{in their respective}} separate thermodynamic equilibria, any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or {{that they have the}} same temperature. This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic. A definite sense of greater hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's <b>displacement</b> <b>law</b> of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

From the apparent magnitude and distance, astronomers have estimated an effective temperature of 3200 K and a visual luminosity of 0.2 percent of that of the Sun.) in a 3-planet system |url=http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/udry_preprint.pdf |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters |volume=469 |issue=3 |pages=L43–L47 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20077612|bibcode=2007A |arxiv=0704.3841 |format=PDF }} However, a red dwarf such as Gliese 581 radiates primarily in the near infrared, with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm (estimated using Wien's <b>displacement</b> <b>law,</b> which assumes the star radiates as a black body), so such an estimate will underestimate the star's total luminosity. (For comparison, the peak emission of the Sun is roughly 530nm, {{in the middle of}} the visible part of the spectrum). When radiation over the entire spectrum is taken into account (not just the part that humans are able to see), something known as the bolometric correction, this star has a bolometric luminosity 1.3% of the Sun's total luminosity. A planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth. The region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly the same energy as the Earth is sometimes termed the [...] "Goldilocks Zone", or, more prosaically, the habitable zone. The extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{mathematical}} model of the waving machine CAMEL. This machine consists of many moving parts (rotational and translational movements), belts, flexible elements and therefore it is very complex. CAMEL uses servomotors working in electronic cam regime. It means that the actual angular velocity of the rotor is not constant and therefore {{it is really important}} to reduce the moment of inertia of rotating elements. The inertia of the rotor of the drive is very important too. Existing simulation model can help to choose the optimal drive of the machine.

A simple bridging law of this kind, with only a few unknown parameters to be evaluated, offers a reasonable balance between consistency with the underlying physical mechanisms and engineering practicality.

40|$|Abstract Molecular {{or direct}} bonding is an {{emerging}} technique to assemble directly two silicon wafers or metal parts. In vaccum, the two surfaces {{are free to}} bond perfectly if their lattice orientation is coincident. When defects {{have to be considered}} like a misorientation or when bonding is processed in air, a slowdown of the bonding velocity is observed and its efficiency in term of adhesion energy decreased. The aim of this project is to gain insight in the bonding process and to investigate the influence of the bonding characteristics. A specific strategy based on a non linear contact mechanics scheme is adopted to describe the bonding process: the methodology is shown to provide enough flexibility to account for the normal and tangential interactions. These latter are described with Traction-Opening <b>displacement</b> <b>laws</b> that are first derived from interactomic potential. the influence on the bonding characteristic on the bonding wavefront is investigated to attempt deriving local information of the bonding mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} grasps and fixtures whose contacts react {{according to}} force-displacement laws consistent with friction constrains at the contacts. The passive force closure set of such grasps and fixtures is {{the set of}} external wrenches (forces and torques) that can act on the grasped object and be stably balanced by the contacts. An external wrench belongs to this set if it induces a feasible equilibrium whose basin of attraction contains the initial unperturbed grasp configuration. The paper focuses on planar grasps and fixtures hav-ing sharp-tipped fingers or fixels that satisfy linear force <b>displacement</b> <b>laws.</b> Using Morse Theory, the paper characterizes the number and stability type of k-contact equilibria induced by a given external wrench. Based on this analysis, the paper provides closed-form expres-sions for the passive force closure set of k-contact grasps and fixtures. Computation of the allowed external wrenches is illustrated with examples. Finally, the paper describes experi-ments verifying the passive force closure set on a spring-loaded grasping system. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution of}} the stochastic wave equation is presented to model 2 D heterogeneous geological environments. In the formulation, a plane-harmonic seismic wave propagates in a medium having random elastic properties in the horizontal and vertical directions. The 2 D random field representation is introduced in the stiffness properties of the medium by assuming it has log-normal probability density functions. The constitutive stress and <b>displacement</b> <b>laws</b> with the momentum balance equation for total stress yield a partial differential equation, which is developed using a perturbation approach by assuming a 2 D random geological medium having material heterogeneity randomly distributed in the horizontal (x) and vertical (z) directions. The method yields a double integral representation of the displacement wave vector based on the Green’s tensor and the Fourier-Stieltjes increments. The double integral is reduced to one integral representation by removing the singularities. The final form of the integral is used to construct the stochastic wave field displacement components {{expressed in terms of}} a single integral that is appropriate for calculations. This paper also describes a numerical approach that predicts the stochastic wave field used to test the applicability of the theory by simulating a 2 D randomly heterogeneous geologica...|$|R
