40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cross-laminated}} timber (CLT) is a prefabricated solid <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> made of {{at least}} three orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber or structural composite lumber that are laminated by gluing of longitudinal and transverse layers with structural adhesives to form a solid rectangular-shaped, straight, and plane timber intended for roof, floor, or wall applications. While this <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> has been used in Europe for over 15 years, the production of CLT and design of CLT structural systems have just begun in North America. For the acceptance of new construction materials or systems in North America, such as CLT, a consensus-based product standard is essential to the designers and regulatory bodies. This paper describes and documents the background information and some key issues that were considered during the development of the ANSI/APA PRG 320 Standard for Performance-Rated Cross Laminated Timber. This standard is a bi-national standard between the U. S. and Canada, and was developed based on the consensus standard development process of APA–The <b>Engineered</b> <b>Wood</b> Association as a standards developer accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ...|$|R

30|$|Glued {{laminated}} timber, {{also called}} Glulam, {{is the most}} popular structural timber <b>product</b> in heavy <b>wood</b> constructions. In fact, glulam is the only <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> that can be produced in curved shapes, offering unlimited design flexibility. It is available in a range of appearance characteristics to meet end-use requirements. In the timber structures, the connections are usually made with dowel-type fasteners and steel plates.|$|R
50|$|Plywood, is a wood {{structural}} panel, {{is sometimes}} called the original <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product.</b> Plywood is manufactured from sheets of cross-laminated veneer and bonded under heat and pressure with durable, moisture-resistant adhesives. By alternating the grain direction of the veneers from layer to layer, or “cross-orienting”, panel strength and stiffness in both directions are maximized. Other structural wood panels include oriented strand board and structural composite panels.|$|R
50|$|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> {{that uses}} {{multiple}} layers of thin wood assembled with adhesives. It is typically used for headers, beams, rimboard, and edge-forming material. LVL offers several advantages over typical milled lumber: Made in a factory under controlled specifications, it is stronger, straighter, and more uniform. Due to its composite nature, it is much less likely than conventional lumber to warp, twist, bow, or shrink.|$|R

50|$|Typically, <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> {{are made}} from the same {{hardwoods}} and softwoods used to manufacture lumber. Sawmill scraps and other wood waste {{can be used for}} engineered wood composed of wood particles or fibers, but whole logs are usually used for veneers, such as plywood, MDF or particle board. Some <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> like oriented strand board (OSB), can use trees from the poplar family, a common but non-structural species.|$|E

50|$|Particle board, {{also known}} as {{particleboard}} and chipboard, is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> manufactured from <b>wood</b> chips, sawmill shavings, or even sawdust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Oriented strand board, {{also known as}} flakeboard, waferboard, or chipboard, is similar but uses machined wood flakes offering more strength.

50|$|Medium-density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> made {{by breaking}} down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, {{often in a}} defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is generally denser than plywood. It {{is made up of}} separated fibres, but {{can be used as a}} building material similar in application to plywood. It is stronger and much denser than particle board.|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} much lower cost of sheet goods (particle board, medium density fiberboard, and other <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products)</b> {{has helped to}} {{displace}} solid wood from many cabinetry applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> can be {{stronger}} than hardwood because layering methods increase the strength. They are sometimes used just at critical stress areas when maximum strength is needed. Modern furniture making, however, tends {{to rely upon}} a combination of engineered woods and solid woods in frame making. <b>Engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> commonly used in furniture making include plywood, hardboard, millboard, chipboard, and medium-density fiberboard. Upholstery itself is often applied with staples, and so metal frames will typically have a plywood panel inserted into them as a backer for the upholstery and to allow these staples to be pinned into it.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is common}} today for {{furniture}} manufacturers and retailers to advertise such veneered plywood furniture as made of [...] "wood solids with cherry veneers".

5000|$|An <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> joist, more {{commonly}} known as an I-joist, is a product designed to eliminate problems that occur with conventional wood joists. Invented in 1969, the I-joist is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> that has great strength in relation to its size and weight. The biggest notable difference from dimensional lumber is that the I-joist carries heavy loads with less lumber than a dimensional solid wood joist. As of 2005, approximately 50% of all wood light framed floors used I-joists. I-joists were designed to help eliminate typical problems that come with using solid lumber as joists.|$|R
30|$|Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> {{that was}} {{originally}} developed in Europe [1]. Lately, CLT has been increasingly used in buildings in Europe, the US, and Canada. Moreover, {{in countries like}} Japan, CLT {{has emerged as a}} new <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> that utilizes a large quantity of domestic lumber. Following this, the Japanese Agricultural Standard was immediately developed for CLT (JAS for CLT) [2] to respond to the expectations of developing CLT products. At present, there are no specifications in place to define the design strength of CLT, owing to the wide varieties of CLT that could be produced using domestic lumber. To this end, studies on CLT have just begun.|$|R

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that developed countries such as Australia and Sweden place more emphasis on waste recycling, and waste reuse/recover, whereas other countries such as Taiwan, South Africa, and India have put emphasis on improving almost all processing and manufacturing techniques identified above. This might be due to the fact that developed countries may already have good operating practices and required technology in the timber production sector. A study carried out by Daian and Ozarska (2009) in Australia has highlighted the need for using recovered and waste wood in the mulching and compost sector, bioenergy sector, animal <b>product</b> sector, and <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> sector.|$|R
