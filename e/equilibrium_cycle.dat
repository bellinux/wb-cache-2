40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to establish the feasibility of extending the lifetime of fuel elements for the Ford Nuclear Reactor (FNR) by replacing current aluminide fuel with silicide fuel comprising a heavier uranium loading but with the same fissile enrichment of 19. 5 wt% {sup 235 }U. The project has focused on fuel designs where burnable absorbers, in the form of B{sub 4 }C, are admixed with uranium silicide in fuel plates so that increases in the control reactivity requirements and peak power density, due to the heavier fuel loading, may be minimized. The authors have developed <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> models simulating current full-size aluminide core configurations with 43 {approximately} 45 fuel elements. Adequacy of the overall <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> approach has been verified through comparison with recent FNR experience in spent fuel discharge rates and simulation of reactor physics characteristics for two representative cycles. Fuel cycle studies have been performed to compare <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> characteristics of silicide fuel designs, including burnable absorbers, with current aluminide fuel. These <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> studies have established the feasibility of doubling the fuel element lifetime, with minimal perturbations to the control reactivity requirements and peak power density, by judicious additions of burnable absorbers to silicide fuel. Further study will be required to investigate a more practical silicide fuel design, which incorporates burnable absorbers in side plates of each fuel element rather than uniformly mixes them in fuel plates...|$|E
40|$|Where {{river water}} flows {{in to the}} sea a lot of entropy is created. A blue engine harvests (blue) energy from this {{increase}} in entropy. A device to obtain this energy is a capacitive mixing engine. This engine consists of two supercapacitor-like porous carbon electrodes immersed in water connected to a voltage source. Brogioli designed an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> that extracts this energy by changing the potential and switching the salt and fresh water accordingly. Brogioli calculated that the work per liter of fresh water was 1. 6 kJ, which equals the energy of waterfall of 160 m. Because this is an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle,</b> which takes infinitely long, the power output is 0. This Thesis focusses on finding the maximum power output for a Brogioli-like cycle by modeling the dynamics of a pore-reservoir system and using the Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations. Also the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> is calculated and yields a work of 2 kJ per liter of fresh water, which is {{in agreement with the}} results of Brogioli. The maximum power output is found around a cycle time of 2. 7 mu s at 304 W m 2, but highly depends on the flushing times and the length of the pore. If the flushing times are determined the maximum power output can be calculated more accurately...|$|E

The differences between the codes are described and related to the differences observed in the nuclide densities in pebbles discharged from the core. Differences in the methods for computing fission product buildup and average number densities lead to significant differences in the computed core power and eigenvalue.

In order to improve the neutronics and reduce the fuel self-shielding effect, a carbon-diluted kernel is introduced in this work. The double-heterogeneity of TRISO fuels are handed {{with the aid of}} the RPT (Reactivity-equivalent Physical Transformation) method. It is shown that the RPT method provides a very accurate solution for the diluted-kernel TRISO fuel. Instead of conventional radial fuel shuffling, an axial-only block shuffling strategy is used to reduce the axial neutron leakage. Based on a 4 -batch axial-only fuel block shuffling scheme, <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> is directly searched with repeated 3 -D Monte Carlo depletion calculations.

40|$|AbstractThe Korean Prototype Gen-IV {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (PGSFR) {{is supposed to}} be loaded with a relatively-costly low-enriched U fuel, while its envisaged transuranic fuels are not available for transmutation. In this work, the U-enrichment reduction by improving the neutron economy is pursued to save the fuel cost. To improve the neutron economy of the core, a new reflector material, PbO, has been introduced to replace the conventional HT 9 reflector in the current PGSFR core. Two types of PbO reflectors are considered: one is the conventional pin-type and the other one is an inverted configuration. The inverted PbO reflector design is intended to maximize the PbO volume fraction in the reflector assembly. In addition, the core radial configuration is also modified to maximize the performance of the PbO reflector. For the baseline PGSFR core with several reflector options, the U enrichment requirement has been analyzed and the fuel depletion analysis is performed to derive the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> parameters. The linear reactivity model is used to determine the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> performances of the core.

40|$|An <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> method, {{embodied}} in the REBUS- 3 [1] code system, has generally been used in conventional fast reactor design activities. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> method provides an efficient approach for modeling reactor system, compared to the more traditional non-equilibrium cycle fuel management calculation approach. Recently, the equilibrium analysis method has been utilized for designing Accelerator Transmutation of Waste (ATW) [2, 3, 4] cores, in which a scattered-reloading fuel management scheme is used. Compared with the conventional fast reactors, the ATW core is significantly different in several aspects since its main mission is to incinerate the transuranic (TRU) fuels. The high burnup non-fertile fuel has large variations in composition and reactivity during its lifetime. Furthermore, a relatively short cycle length is utilized in the ATW design to limit the potentially large reactivity swing over a cycle, and consequently 7 or 8 -batch fuel management is usually assumed for a high fuel burnup. The validity of the equilibrium analysis method for the ATW core, therefore, needed to be verified. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the validity of the equilibrium analysis method for a Na-cooled ATW core[4], which is an alternative core design of the ATW system under development...|$|E

Second, the limit cycle, to which a dynamic path converges, varies continuously according to the initial distribution of the money holdings.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} simulation tool capable of optimizing advanced nuclear reactors considering the multiobjective {{nature of their}} design. An Enhanced <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>Cycle</b> (EEC) method based on the classic equilibrium method is developed to evaluate {{the response of the}} <b>equilibrium</b> <b>cycle</b> to changes in the core design. Advances are made in the consideration of burnup-dependent cross sections and dynamic fuel performance (fission gas release, fuel growth, and bond squeeze-out) to allow accuracy in high-burnup reactors such as the Traveling Wave Reactor. EEC is accelerated for design changes near a reference state through a new modal expansion perturbation method that expands arbitrary flux perturbations on a basis of lambda-eigenmodes. A code is developed to solve the 3 -D, multigroup diffusion equation with an Arnoldi-based solver that determines hundreds of the reference flux harmonics and later uses these harmonics to determine expansion coefficients required to approximate the perturbed flux. The harmonics are only required for the reference state, and many substantial and localized perturbations from this state are shown to be well-approximated with efficient expressions after the reference calculation is performed. The modal expansion method is coupled to EEC to produce the later-in-time response of each design perturbation. Because the code determines the perturbed flux explicitly, a wide variety of core performance metrics may be monitored by working within a recently-developed data management system called the ARMI. Through ARMI, the response of each design perturbation may be evaluated not only for the flux and reactivity, but also for reactivity coefficients, thermal hydraulics parameters, economics, and transient performance. Considering the parameters available, an automated optimization framework is designed and implemented. A non-parametric surrogate model using the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm is trained with many design perturbations and then transformed through the Physical Programming (PP) paradigm to build an aggregate objective function without iteratively determining weights. Finally, the design is optimized with standard gradient-based methods. Through the power of ACE and the transparency of PP, the optimization system allows users to locate designs that best suit their multiobjective preferences with ease...|$|E
