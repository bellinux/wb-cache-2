5|$|In Ryne Sandberg's {{first full}} season as manager (after {{replacing}} Charlie Manuel {{near the end}} of the 2013 season), he reconfigured the Phillies' staff. Among his first acquisitions were long-time friend Larry Bowa (who managed the Phillies from 2001 to 2004) as bench coach and former bench coach Pete Mackanin as third-base coach. At the same time, the team announced the retention of Steve Henderson as <b>hitting</b> coach. Shortly thereafter, the Phillies announced that Juan Samuel would switch from third- to first-base coach and Wally Joyner would return for a second season as assistant <b>hitting</b> coach. About a month later, the team reported that the Detroit Tigers had lured Joyner away as their <b>hitting</b> coach. Although the most difficult position to fill was pitching coach (vacated by Rich Dubee at the end of the 2013 season), on November 21 the Phillies announced that they had hired Bob McClure and retained pitching-coach candidate Rod Nichols as bullpen coach and Jesús Tiamo as bullpen catcher. Sandberg finished his staffing a week before Christmas by promoting minor-league assistant John Mizerock to assistant <b>hitting</b> coach.|$|E

This was a very {{successful}} relaunch, and once again the <b>Hits</b> series started to rival the success of the contemporaneous Now releases of the time. Unlike the earlier <b>Hits</b> albums, there were up to five compilations a year, and instead of a volume number, the titles of this series had varied titles: <b>Hits,</b> New <b>Hits,</b> Fresh <b>Hits,</b> Big <b>Hits</b> and Huge <b>Hits</b> - this title is then always followed by the year of release; for example, Fresh <b>Hits</b> 1997.|$|R
