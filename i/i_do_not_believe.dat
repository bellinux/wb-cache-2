5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that}} My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He's So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|Although today our {{opponents are}} at the Rhine and at the Oder, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> yet {{that there will be}} a coup brought about by the German people. Without {{assistance}} from outside, such a coup is not even to be considered. Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it. Oh, no, <b>I</b> swear <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it, yet <b>I</b> was frightened, horribly frightened; but I would <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{a single}} word of it.|$|R
60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in {{a special}} Providence, in a {{perpetual}} education of men by evil as well as good, by small things as well as great--if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that--I could believe nothing.|$|R
5000|$|It is not {{absurd to}} assert the past-tense counterpart, e.g. [...] "It was raining, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that it was}} raining." ...|$|R
25|$|Hanson's posthumous works include What <b>I</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Believe</b> and Other Essays (1971) and Constellations and Conjectures (1973). He is {{also known}} for the essays What <b>I</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Believe</b> and The Agnostic's Dilemma, among other {{writings}} on belief systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} symbols and the {{expression}} of the full sovereignty of Australian nationhood can ever be complete while we have a flag with the flag of another country on the corner of it.|$|E
25|$|Nurses {{continue}} to nurse seriously injured {{people who can}} not depend on who the sanitary left behind during the movement of the military. That situation is very serious and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it was a very temporary feeling.|$|E

60|$|As for the jewel, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Captain Leach would {{disclose}} {{the secret of}} it without he had been compelled to do so; wherefore, if he had it still in his own keeping, I entertained a hope that I might by some trick or other snatch the precious stone away from him again. In that event <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> he would say anything, for fear that the pirates might punish him for keeping it a secret from them.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{have heard}} of such things being done by the Turkish hakims at Khartoum, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> them. It is against all reason.' ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} present sombre {{prospect}} in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that belongs to {{the close of the}} 19th century that it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good peoples throughout the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered.|$|E
25|$|I {{conclude}} that the facilities and educational opportunities at No. 107 are substantially inferior in a constitutional sense, to those at No. 29. For the reasons stated in connection with Claymont <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> the relief should merely be an order to make equal. An injunction will issue preventing the defendants and their agents from refusing these plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, admission to School No. 29 because of their color.|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} {{of this would be}} very easy. The politics would be, {{to be one of the}} lads, the safest way in Ireland. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the interests of this State, or our Constitution and of this Republic, would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this. There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that I stand by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.|$|E

25|$|From {{beyond the}} boundary, it is {{difficult}} to gauge Snow's pace as Lindsay Hassett conceded. He appears to bowl his bumper appreciably faster than most of his fuller-length deliveries, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> even his faster bumper knocks {{at the door of the}} pace of bowlers I have named. His top pace, I consider, lies somewhere between that of Statham and Trueman...Snow's loping, almost lazy run, of course, is sinisterly deceptive. It is in that last stride, or last two strides, when that long, straight powerful arm gathers its impetus and either whips or coasts through, that the potential is born.|$|E
500|$|Gentlemen. Everything is lost. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> [...] Canadians {{will manage}} to help us. We have only 110 men left, with 50 rounds per gun and 5 rounds per tank... Fight to the end! To {{surrender}} to the SS is senseless, you know it well. Gentlemen! Good luck – tonight, we will die for Poland and civilization. We will fight to the last platoon, to the last tank, then to the last man.|$|E
500|$|The {{cry of the}} {{condemned}} men was {{the inspiration for the}} song [...] "God Save Ireland", which became Ireland's unofficial national anthem until officially replaced by [...] "Amhrán na bhFiann" [...] ("The Soldier's Song"). The executions were also [...] "incalculable" [...] in their influence on the [...] "political awakening" [...] of Charles Stewart Parnell. Speaking in the House of Commons ten years later, Parnell told the House: [...] "I wish to say as directly as I can that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe,</b> and never shall believe, that any murder was committed in Manchester." ...|$|E
50|$|Peter <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{the letter}} and {{beheaded}} them both. Later when the Tsar {{realized that they were}} correct, they were reburied near the Refectory Church in Kiev Pechersk Monastery.|$|R

60|$|There are so {{many stories}} told about the Elephant that I can allude to but few, even if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that you were {{familiar}} with {{a great many of}} them.|$|R
500|$|After {{leaving the}} church Keable and Sybil {{moved back to}} England, {{settling}} at West Wratting, Cambridgeshire, where both began to explore the Roman Catholic Church. Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know. But I'm inclined to think that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it is anything which the old concept of God really covers." ...|$|E
500|$|Black took an absolutist {{approach}} to First Amendment jurisprudence, believing {{the first words}} of the Amendment that said [...] "Congress shall make no law..." [...] Black rejected the creation of judicial tests for free speech standards, such as the tests for [...] "clear and present danger", [...] "bad tendency", [...] "gravity of the evil," [...] "reasonableness," [...] or [...] "balancing." [...] Black would write that the First Amendment is [...] "wholly 'beyond the reach' of federal power to abridge... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that any federal agencies, including Congress and the Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are 'more important interests.'" ...|$|E
500|$|He {{published}} the travel book [...] in serial form before a book edition {{was released in}} 1835. Shortly after the book's publication, Longfellow attempted to join the literary circle in New York and asked George Pope Morris for an editorial role at one of Morris's publications. He considered moving to New York after New York University proposed offering him a newly created professorship of modern languages, though {{there would be no}} salary. The professorship was not created and Longfellow agreed to continue teaching at Bowdoin. It may have been joyless work. He wrote, [...] "I hate the sight of pen, ink, and paper... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I was born for such a lot. I have aimed higher than this".|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, first, I {{believed}} {{that you knew}} that I was Lieutenant Poinsett. Because, secondly, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that you knew that Arthur Poinsett and Philip Ashley were {{one and the same}} person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] she continued, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that any}} one, who was truly in love, {{would want to}} send other people about, to propose for him, as you did." ...|$|R
60|$|Although <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{a word of}} this speech, I {{affected}} to be {{very much}} moved by it, and of course swore eternal gratitude to the Captain for his kindness to the poor Irish castaway.|$|R
500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that it would be very easy to find anything better... I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E
500|$|The boycott was {{supported}} by some of Alabama's Congressional delegation, including both senators and Representative Spencer Bachus (R-AL), who represents Mountain Brook. Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) voiced {{his support for the}} boycott {{in a letter to the}} American Society of Travel Agents. Shelby stated, [...] "For the safety, security and well-being of our citizens, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba." [...] Prime Minister Oduber stated that Aruban investigators have done their best to solve the case, and responded to the call for boycott, [...] "This is a preposterous and irresponsible act. We are not guerillas. We are not terrorists. We don't pose a threat to the United States, nor to Alabama." ...|$|E
500|$|The species' unique {{life cycle}} {{in such a}} harsh {{environment}} has been described in print and visual media. Apsley Cherry-Garrard, the Antarctic explorer, said: [...] "Take it all in all, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> anybody on Earth has a worse time than an emperor penguin". Widely distributed in cinemas in 2005, the French documentary La Marche de l'empereur, which was also released with the English title March of the Penguins, {{told the story of}} the penguins' reproductive cycle. The subject has been covered for the small screen four times by the BBC and presenter David Attenborough: first in episode five of the 1993 series on the Antarctic Life in the Freezer, again in the 2001 series The Blue Planet, [...] once again in the 2006 series Planet Earth, and finally Frozen Planet in 2011.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{but that}} she can still be," [...] said the old lady. [...] "She will turn back again, my dear. Never fear. I don't think I could die easy if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> she would!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard some}} news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was {{entered into a}} wolf pack, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe.</b> Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, why shouldn't you {{get tired}} of that or any other--company? You aren't like anyone else, and--and the thought of it made me unhappy suddenly; but indeed, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{anything}} bad of you. I--" ...|$|R
