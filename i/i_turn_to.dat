2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about calling upon the love of that special one when times get tough. For Aguilera, the song [...] "is about that sort of perfect love, which we all dream. This kind of song {{can make you feel}} safe and warm anytime of the year. And there's no one better to turn to for that than my own mother," [...] she claimed. [...] "For a shield, from the storm for a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> you/For the {{strength}} to be strong, for the will to carry on/For everything you do, for everything that's true, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] she sings in the chorus.|$|E

It was followed {{a year later}} by <b>I</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>to</b> You, a contemporary Christian music album released via Stroudavarious Records (later known as R Records).

2500|$|Governor General Michaëlle Jean {{stated that}} [...] "what is {{happening}} right now {{is part of the}} possibilities in our democratic system and I think that people can be reassured that, as <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> what is happening, I am myself looking at my constitutional duties." [...] Jean was faced with three possible outcomes {{as a result of her}} planned meeting with the prime minister on December 4, 2008: dissolving parliament, proroguing parliament, or asking him to resign and inviting the opposition parties to form a government.|$|E
2500|$|Jesus was {{instrumental}} [...] {{in changing the}} Torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside God. But it is beyond the human mind to fathom the designs of our Creator, for our ways are not God's ways, neither are our thoughts His. All these matters relating to Jesus of Nazareth, and the Ishmaelite [...] who came after him, only served {{to clear the way}} for the Jewish Messiah to prepare the whole world to worship God with one accord, as it is written 'For then will <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the peoples a pure language, that they all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.' (...) [...] Thus the Jewish hope, and the Torah, and the commandments have become familiar topics of conversation among those even on far isles, and among many people, uncircumcised of flesh and heart. (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, XI.4.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Zakaria self-identifies as a [...] "centrist", {{though he}} has been {{described}} variously as a political liberal, a conservative, a moderate, or a radical centrist. George Stephanopoulos said of him in 2003, [...] "He's so well versed in politics, and he can't be pigeonholed. I can't be sure whenever <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> him where he's {{going to be coming}} from or what he's going to say." [...] Zakaria wrote in February 2008 that [...] "Conservatism grew powerful in the 1970s and 1980s because it proposed solutions appropriate to the problems of the age", adding that [...] "a new world requires new thinking". He supported Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign and also for president. In January 2009 Forbes referred to Zakaria as one of the 25 most influential liberals in the American media. Zakaria has stated that he tries not to be devoted to any type of ideology, saying [...] "I feel that's part of my job... which is not to pick sides but to explain what I think is happening on the ground. I can't say, 'This is my team and I'm going to root for them no matter what they do.'" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> her directly. If I had {{received}} a musket-ball in the heart, and she had stood there, I almost believe <b>I</b> should have <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> her before <b>I</b> dropped.|$|R
60|$|From these {{memories}} of the old villagers <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the newspapers {{of the day to}} make a few citations.|$|E

6000|$|Cleon [raising and {{clasping}} Ion to his breast]. Here, on my heart, dear one. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> meet my executioners, and see thee, my boy. Great Heaven, I bless thee! [They embrace tenderly and weep.] Thou camest thither--how? ...|$|E
60|$|Having cleared {{this issue}} {{out of the}} way as briefly as possible, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the broader issues of the future {{relations}} between the parties to the late war, by which the present proposal must primarily be judged.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> my {{botanist}} almost reprovingly. [...] "You know, she won't {{be quite}} the same lady here that you knew in Frognal," [...] I say, and wrest myself from a subject {{that is no longer}} agreeable by rising to my feet.|$|E
60|$|We {{heard him}} close the outer door and depart. Then <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Louis.|$|R
60|$|I walked {{rapidly to}} the gate. When {{challenged}} by the sentinel, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> summon my instructor.

60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> meet my new foe it {{was with}} a heart {{considerably}} lightened.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hob, {{what about}} that River-bit?' <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> him again [...] With Fabricius and Ogier and William of Warenne. [...] 'Hev it jest as you've a mind to, but'--and so he takes command. [...] For whoever pays the taxes old Mus' Hobden owns the land.|$|E
60|$|Gladly, then, did <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{follow the}} Duke and Madonna Paola into the {{adjoining}} chamber to which Cesare led the way, even as Don Miguel's voice {{was raised to}} command his men to clear the hall, to the end that he might conduct his examination in private.|$|E

60|$|Lord, my dear Cerjat, when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> that page of {{your letter}} where you write like an ancient sage in whom the fire has paled into a meek-eyed state of coolness and virtue, I half laugh and half cry! You old! You {{a sort of}} hermit? Boh! Get out.|$|E
6000|$|Now I turn my {{argument}} {{to the other}} side of the field, to the other quarter, from which we are subject to attack; I turn in my appeal from Trade Unionists, from the Labour men, who ought in all fairness to recognise the work this Government is doing and back them in their sore struggle; <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the rich and the powerful, to Unionist and Conservative elements, who, nevertheless, upon Free Trade, upon temperance, and upon other questions of moral enlightenment, feel a considerable sympathy with the Liberal Party; <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> those who say, [...] "We like Free Trade and we are Liberals at heart, but this Government is too Radical: we don't like its Radical measures. Why can't they let well alone? What do they mean by introducing all these measures, all these Bills, which," [...] so they say, [...] "disturb credit and trade, and interfere with the course of business, and cause so many class-struggles in the country?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> those who complain we are too Radical in this and in that, and that we are moving too quickly, and I say to them: [...] "Look at this political situation, not as party men, but as Britons; look at it in the light of history; look at it in the light of philosophy; and look at it in the light of broad-minded, Christian charity." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eliz. I know it--so speak not of them.
