40|$|AbstractThe {{accumulation}} of activated leukocytes in the pulmonary circulation {{plays an important}} role in the pathogenesis of lung dysfunction associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Animal studies have demonstrated that the elimination of leukocytes from the circulation reduces postoperative lung injury and improves postoperative pulmonary function. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate whether postoperative lung function could be improved by use of a leukocyte filter during cardiopulmonary bypass. Elective coronary artery bypass grafting was done with a leukocyte-depleting arterial blood filter incorporated in the extracorporeal circuit (14 patients, leukocyte <b>filter</b> <b>group)</b> or without the filter (18 patients, control group). Blood samples collected at intervals before, during, and after operation were used for analysis of blood cell counts, elastase concentrations, and arterial blood gases. The use of the leukocyte filter caused no significant reduction in leukocyte count (p = 0. 86). There were no differences in postoperative lung function between the groups, as assessed through (1) oxygenation index (290 for leukocyte <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> compared with 329 for control group, 95 % confidence interval, 286 to 372, p = 0. 21), (2) pulmonary vascular resistance (p = 0. 10), and (3) intubation time (16. 6 hours for leukocyte <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> versus 15. 7 hours for control group, 95 % confidence interval, 12. 1 to 19. 1 hours, p = 0. 72).

Using leukodepleted blood components can decrease some of these adverse effects. Among the various methods to remove leukocytes in blood components, prestorage leukoreduction has been most efficient, but the evidence of clinical side effects awaits further studies. We evaluated changes of electrolytes in prestorage leukocyte-reduced red blood cells. Materials and MethodsIn this case-control study, one hundred twenty eight packed cells were studied: 64 unfiltered packed cells and 64 prestorage filtered packed cell. Two groups were matched as sex and age. Electrolytes such as Calcium, Sodium, and Potassium of two groups were measured, and compared during preparation. ResultsIn this study, mean of Calcium in unfiltered and <b>filtered</b> <b>group</b> were 6. 16 ± 1. 09 mg/dl and 5. 57 ± 2. 21 mg/dl, respectively (P-value< 0. 055).

40|$|ObjectiveCardiopulmonary bypass elicits {{systemic}} inflammation. Depletion of circulating leukocytes might alleviate inflammatory response. We {{studied the}} effects of a leukocyte-depleting filter on phagocyte activation during cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsFifty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly allocated into an arterial line leukocyte <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> (n = 25) with a Pall LeukoGuard 6 leukocyte-depleting filter (LG 6; Pall Biomedical, Portsmouth, United Kingdom) and a control group without any filter (n = 25). Blood sampling took place from arterial line at predetermined time points. In the <b>filter</b> <b>group,</b> the sample was taken immediately before the filter; to evaluate activation at the site, an additional sample was taken immediately after the filter. CD 11 b/CD 18 and L-selectin expressions and basal production of hydrogen peroxide were determined with whole-blood flow cytometry, and plasma lactoferrin level was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsNeutrophil CD 11 b expression was higher in the <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> than in the control group (P <. 001). Likewise, monocyte CD 11 b expression, neutrophil hydrogen peroxide production, and lactoferrin plasma levels were all significantly higher, whereas neutrophil and monocyte counts and neutrophil L-selectin expression were all significantly lower in the <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> (all P <. 001). At 5 minutes of CPB, CD 11 b expression increased across the filter on neutrophils (median difference 197 relative fluorescence units, range 45 – 431 relative fluorescence units, P <. 001) and monocytes (median difference 26 relative fluorescence units, range − 68 – 111 relative fluorescence units, P <. 001).

This study compares the technical difficulties encountered using {{these two types of}} EPD. MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing CAS using a balloon occlusion EPD (balloon group: PercuSurge GuardWire) or filter EPD (filter group: Accunet, AngioGuard, or FilterWire). Complications were defined as minor stroke, National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale 80 % stenosis in 61 %. Primary lesions were treated in 83 % vs restenosis in 17 %. The 30 -day event rate was 1. 4 % major stroke, 2. 1 % minor stoke, 1. 4 % myocardial infarction, and 0. 7 % death. The overall combined 30 -day stroke, death, and myocardial infarction rate was 5. 6 %. The 30 -day stroke and death rate was 4. 0 % in the balloon group (n = 99) and 4. 6 % in the <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> (n = 42, P =. 51). EPD-related technical difficulties occurred in 15 % of the balloon group and 31 % of the <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> (P <. 05). Technical difficulties included a 10 % incidence of reversible neurologic compromise during balloon deployment compared with 0 % in the <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> (P =. 002) and 12 % incidence of inability to cross the lesion before predilation in the <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> compared with 0 % in the balloon group (P =. 001). ConclusionsDuring CAS, both balloon occlusion and filter devices provide acceptable results and appear complimentary. Filters can be used preferentially to avoid a 10 % incidence of reversible neurologic compromise associated with balloon occlusion, except in critically narrowed or tortuous lesions when balloon occlusion may be preferred because of a 12 % need for unprotected predilatation with filters...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bushfire smoke {{contains}} {{a range of}} air toxics. To prevent inhalation of these toxics, fire fighters use respiratory equipment.

Experimental trials in a smoke chamber demonstrated that, the particulate/organic vapor/formaldehyde (POVF) filter performed best under simulated conditions. This article reports on the field validation trials during prescribed burns in Western Australia. Methods: Sixty-seven career fire fighters from the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia were allocated one of the three types of filters. Spirometry, oximetry, self-reported symptom, and personal air sampling data were collected before, during and after exposure to bushfire smoke from prescribed burns. Results: Declines in FEV and SaO were demonstrated after 60 and 120 min exposure. A significant higher number of participants in the P <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> reported increases in respiratory symptoms after the exposure. Air sampling inside the respirators demonstrated formaldehyde levels significantly higher in the P <b>filter</b> <b>group</b> compared to the POV and the POVF <b>filter</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: The field validation trials during prescribed burns supported the findings from the controlled exposure trials in the smoke chamber. Testing the effectiveness of three types of different filters under bushfire smoke conditions in the field for up to 2 hr demonstrated that the P filter is ineffective in filtering out respiratory irritants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ex vivo lung {{perfusion}} (EVLP) {{has improved}} {{the process of}} donor lung management. Cytokine accumulation during EVLP {{has been shown to}} correlate with worse outcome after lung transplantation. Our objective in this study was to test the safety and efficacy of cytokine filtration during EVLP in a large animal model. METHODS: Pig donor lungs were preserved for 24 hours at 4 °C, followed by 12 hours of EVLP, according to the Toronto protocol. The perfusate was continuously run through an absorbent device (CytoSorb) via a veno-venous shunt from the reservoir in the <b>filter</b> <b>group.</b> EVLP was performed according to the standard protocol in the control group (n = 5 each). EVLP physiology, lung X-ray, perfusate biochemistry, inflammatory response and microscopic injury were assessed. RESULTS: Cytokine filtration significantly improved airway pressure and dynamic compliance during the 12 -hour perfusion period. Lung X-rays acquired at the end of perfusion showed increased consolidation in the control group. Electrolyte imbalance, determined by increased hydrogen, potassium and calcium ion concentrations in the perfusate, was markedly worsened in the control group. Glucose consumption and lactate production were markedly reduced, along with the lactate/pyruvate ratio in the <b>filter</b> <b>group.</b> Cytokine expression profile, tissue myeloperoxidase activity and microscopic lung injury were significantly reduced in the <b>filter</b> <b>group.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Continuous perfusate filtration through sorbent beads is effective and safe during prolonged EVLP. Cytokine removal decreased the development of pulmonary edema and electrolyte imbalance through the suppression of anaerobic glycolysis and neutrophil activation in this setting.

40|$|We propose an {{extension}} of the BM 4 D volumetric filter to the denoising of data corrupted by spatially nonuniform noise. BM 4 D implements the <b>grouping</b> and collaborative <b>filtering</b> paradigm, where similar cubes of voxels are stacked into a four-dimensional “group”. Each group undergoes a sparsifying four-dimensional transform, that exploits the local correlation among voxels in each cube and the nonlocal correlation between corresponding voxels of different cubes. Thus, signal and noise are effectively separated in transform domain. In this work we take advantage of the sparsity induced by the four-dimensional transform to provide a spatially adaptive estimation of the local noise variance by applying a robust median estimator of the absolute deviation to the spectrum of each <b>filtered</b> <b>group.</b> The adaptive variance estimates are then used during coefficients shrinkage. Finally, the inverse four-dimensional transform is applied to the <b>filtered</b> <b>group,</b> and each individual cube estimate is adaptively aggregated at its original location. Experiments on medical data corrupted by spatially varying Gaussian and Rician noise demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in volumetric data denoising.

Methods: Tc- 99 m-Antimony sulfide colloid was used for axillary sentinel node mapping of 45 breast cancer patients. The prepared kits were turbid and were used for the first 15 patients. For the remaining 30 patients, we used a filter (GyroDisc CA-PC Cellulose Acetate Membrane; 30 mm; Pore size: 0. 2 µm) after labeling to remove the possible large particles of the prepared kits.
