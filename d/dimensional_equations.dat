40|$|Dispersive {{shock waves}} (DSWs) in the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) {{equation}} and two dimensional Benjamin-Ono (2 DBO) equation are considered using parabolic front initial data. Employing a front tracking type ansatz exactly reduces {{the study of}} DSWs in two space one time (2 + 1) dimensions to finding DSW solutions of (1 + 1) <b>dimensional</b> <b>equations.</b> With this ansatz, the KP and 2 DBO equations can be exactly reduced to cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries (cKdV) and cylindrical Benjamin-Ono (cBO) equations, respectively. Whitham modulation equations which describe DSW evolution in the cKdV and cBO equations are derived in general and Riemann type variables are introduced. DSWs obtained from the numerical solutions of the corresponding Whitham systems and direct numerical simulations of the cKdV and cBO equations are compared with excellent agreement obtained. In turn, DSWs obtained from direct numerical simulations of the KP and 2 DBO equations are compared with the cKdV and cBO equations, again with remarkable agreement.

The unsteady two dimensional momentum and energy equations of the incompressible fluid are modelled {{in the form of}} partial differential equations with initial and oscillating boundary conditions. The governing equations are transformed into non <b>dimensional</b> <b>equations</b> by using the corresponding non dimensional variables. The Laplace transform method is applied into non <b>dimensional</b> <b>equations</b> in order to obtain the analytical solutions of velocity and temperature profiles. Computations are carried out and presented graphically to analyse the effect of second grade fluid parameter, rotation parameter, Grashof number, phase angle, Prandtl number and time on the profiles. It is found that, when Grashof number increases, the velocity increases in primary and secondary velocities. Both velocity and temperature are observed decrease when phase angle and Prandtl number increase. It can be concluded that, the velocity profiles in rotating flow obtained in this study is lower to compare with non-rotating flow. Whereas, the temperature profiles are remain the same for both cases.
