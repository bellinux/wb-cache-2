500|$|The AV-8A entered {{service with}} the Marine Corps in 1971, {{replacing}} other {{aircraft in the}} Marines' attack squadrons. [...] The service became interested in performing ship-borne operations with the Harrier. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt promoted {{the concept of a}} Sea <b>Control</b> <b>Ship,</b> a 15,000-ton light carrier equipped with Harriers and helicopters, to supplement the larger aircraft carriers of the US Navy. An amphibious assault ship, , was converted into the Interim Sea <b>Control</b> <b>Ship</b> and operated as such between 1971 and 1973 with the purpose of studying the limits and possible obstacles for operating such a vessel. Since then the Sea <b>Control</b> <b>Ship</b> concept has been subject to periodic re-examinations and studies, often in the light of budget cuts and questions over the use of supercarriers.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Rush {{proposes a}} means of tuning the shields to improve their {{efficiency}} against the <b>Control</b> <b>ship</b> drone attacks; they use this maneuver to gain time while they try to resupply on a nearby planet through the Stargate while resisting the <b>Control</b> <b>ship</b> attack. The drones, finding their weapons ineffective, begin to perform kamikaze attacks on Destiny, causing minor damage. On return to faster-than-light speed, the crew agree that while the idea worked, they would not survive for many more attacks.|$|R
50|$|Obi-Wan's Jedi {{interceptor}} is hit by enemy laser fire, and {{his right}} wing is destroyed. However, he uses the Force to dissassemble several droid fighters to their individual pieces and attaches them to his craft. He pilots his y-wing towards the Trade Federation <b>control</b> <b>ship</b> and fires a few well-placed shots at it, causing a giant explosion. Anakin's ship escapes from an access tunnel just in time as the <b>control</b> <b>ship</b> spectacularly explodes, and Obi-Wan and Anakin head down to Kashyyyk.|$|R
2500|$|Shikari {{was laid}} down on 15 January 1918, but {{construction}} was slowed {{by the end}} of the First World War in November 1918, and she was not launched until 14 July 1919. After launching, Shikari was towed to Chatham Dockyard for fitting out. It was decided to use Shikari as a <b>control</b> <b>ship</b> for the old battleship and target ship [...] As a <b>control</b> <b>ship,</b> Shikari was unarmed, with a large deckhouse for the radio-control equipment fitted between the ship's funnels. She was finally commissioned in February 1924.|$|R

40|$|Homeland security, transportation, {{and city}} {{planning}} depend upon well-designed evacuation routes. You can’t {{wait until the}} day of to realize your plan won’t work. Designing successful evacuation plans requires an in-depth understanding of models and control designs for the problems of traffic flow, construction and road closures, and the intangible human factors. Pedestrian Dynamics: Mathematical Theory and <b>Evacuation</b> <b>Control</b> clearly delineates the derivation of mathematical models for pedestrian dynamics {{and how to use}} them to design feedback <b>controls</b> for <b>evacuations.</b> The book includes: * Mathematical models derived from basic principles * Mathematical analysis of the model * Details of past work * MATLAB® code * 65 figures and 400 equations Unlike most works on traffic flow, this book examines the development of optimal methods to effectively control and improve pedestrian traffic flow. The work of a leading expert, it examines the differential equations applied to conservation laws encountered in the study of pedestrian dynamics and <b>evacuation</b> <b>control</b> problem. The author presents new pedestrian traffic models for multi-directional flow in two dimensions. He considers a range of control models in various simulations, including relaxed models and those concerned with direction and magnitude velocity commands. He also addresses questions of time, cost, and scalability. The book clearly demonstrates what the future challenges are and provides the tools to meet them...|$|R
