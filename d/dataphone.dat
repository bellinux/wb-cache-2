25|$|Bruce and Dr. Harold T. Dodge {{initiated}} the Seattle Heart Watch program in 1971. This program involved community physicians in hospitals, offices, {{and the medical}} department of the Boeing Company. It tested the feasibility, utility and reproducibility of results of symptom-limited exercise testing in ambulatory cardiac patients and apparently healthy subjects. A database of more than 10,000 individuals was developed over the next 10 years. Signals from the treadmill monitors were sent by <b>dataphone</b> from 15 different test sites to the University Hospital research lab for analysis, and follow-up questionnaires from thousands of patients were accumulated for years. This database was used to develop normal standards based on age, sex and habitual pattern of activity. The duration of exercise became the principal measurement for the estimation of what Bruce termed functional aerobic impairment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dataphone</b> Sweden AB {{was founded}} in 1994 {{and was one of}} the pioneers of Internet services. Since then <b>Dataphone</b> has been an ISP and offered related services. Citylink AB {{was founded in}} 2001 and offered {{telephony}} and data communication based on a national powerful network and switch. The two companies merged in December 2005 under the name <b>Dataphone</b> Scandinavia AB. The official name is now DPH Scandinavia but the brand <b>Dataphone</b> is still used. Since December 2009 the company is a part of IP-Only Telecommunication AB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dataphone</b> Scandinavia AB is a Swedish {{national}} and independent telecom operator and ISP that offers data communication solutions to businesses. <b>Dataphone</b> {{has its own}} national network for data and telephony.|$|E
50|$|A special {{configuration}} of the G-20, a dual processor G-21, was used to support campus computing at Carnegie Institute of Technology in the 1960s. Usually the two processors ran independently, one CPU handling card-based input, and the other handling jobs submitted through one of 16 AT&T <b>Dataphones</b> connected to telephone lines, usually via Teletype Model 35 KSR, Model 35 ASR and Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinters. The G-21 had 32k words of memory for each processor, but could be reconfigured for 64k mode for large programs, usually as a single processor. A true dual processor operating system was developed late {{in the life of}} the G-21, but never reached production status.|$|R
40|$|One of the scarcest {{resources}} in today's computing devices is screen space. This is particularly {{evident in the}} emerging pocket-sized devices such as PDAs, cellular tele- and <b>dataphones,</b> twoway pagers and wireless web browsers. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, called the event horizon user interface model {{that allows us to}} overcome some of the limitations. The key idea of the proposed model is that the display can be compressed and expanded by moving objects radially farther away or closer to an event horizon {{in the middle of the}} screen. In order to study the proposed model in detail, we have built an implementation called Radius for the Palm^TM connected organizer. The current Radius implementation will be illustrated and some future directions outlined...|$|R
5000|$|Commonly, microfilters {{are only}} {{low-pass}} filters, so beyond them only low frequencies (voice signals) can pass. In the data section, a microfilter {{is not used}} because digital devices that are intended to extract data from the DSL signal will, themselves, filter out low frequencies. Voice telephone devices {{will pick up the}} entire spectrum so high frequencies, including the ADSL signal, will be [...] "heard" [...] as noise in telephone terminals, and will affect and often degrade the service in fax, <b>dataphones</b> and modems. From {{the point of view of}} DSL devices, any acceptance of their signal by POTS devices mean that there is a degradation of the DSL signal to the devices, and this is the central reason why these filters are required.|$|R
50|$|The {{data network}} {{produces}} IP VPN over MPLS and Internet access. <b>Dataphone</b> delivers PSTN telephony and IP-telephony through its own network. The network also allows <b>Dataphone</b> to offer wholesale and carrier services to other {{national and international}} operators. <b>Dataphone</b> also provides collocation and hosting from its server facilities in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional offerings include antispam from IronPort, web hotel, e-mail services and more. Headquarters are in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
50|$|Leased lines {{services}} (or {{private line}} services) became digital in the 1970s with {{the conversion of}} the Bell backbone network from analog to digital circuits. This allowed AT&T to offer <b>Dataphone</b> Digital Services (later re-branded digital data services) that started the deployment of ISDN and T1 lines to customer premises to connect.|$|E
50|$|Dataspeed was the Bell System {{name for}} a family of high speed paper tape systems used with <b>DataPhone</b> modems. Type 1was 5-level, 1050 wpm. Type 2 was 5-8 level, 1050 wpm. Type 4 was 8 level with {{automatic}} error detection and correctionby retransmitting blocks of data received in error. Type 5 was 8 level 750 wpm using a modem that was very inexpensiveas a transmitter; hence the system was popular for data collection applications.|$|E
50|$|Quotron’s success {{attracted}} the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T <b>Dataphone</b> at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using <b>Dataphone</b> transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by <b>Dataphone</b> to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.|$|E
50|$|In June 1970, the Applied Dynamics Division of Reliance Electric in Saline, Michigan was {{contracted}} to build three Communication Computers or CCs. Each {{would consist of}} a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11 computer, <b>dataphone</b> interfaces, and interfaces that would attach them directly to the mainframe computers. The cost was to be slightly less than the $300,000 ($, adjusted for inflation) originally budgeted. Merit staff wrote the software that ran on the CCs, while staff {{at each of the}} universities wrote the mainframe software to interface to the CCs.|$|E

50|$|Intec {{was started}} in the UK in 1997 to sell {{interconnect}} billing systems. From this point the company expanded both organically and through acquisition. Intec became a public company in 2000, following its IPO on the London Stock Exchange. The following year it completed its first acquisition, with the purchase of Computer Generation Inc (CGI) and <b>Dataphone</b> UK Ltd. In 2002 Intec further consolidated the interconnect billing market with acquisitions from ICL and Ericsson. In 2003 Intec entered the IP services mediation and charging market with the acquisition of Digiquant (the assets of which were subsequently sold to Volubill). The Digiquant acquisition was followed in 2004 with the acquisition of the Singl.eView product line from ADC. In 2006 Intec acquired EUR systems, a USA based provider of bureau services, which has been integrated with Intec’s other managed services and outsourcing facilities.|$|E
50|$|Scantlin Electronics reacted {{immediately}} to the Ultronic threat. In early 1962 they began work on their own computer-based system {{and put it into}} service in December, 1962. It used four Control Data CDC 160A computers in New York which recorded trading data in magnetic core memory. Major cities hosted Central Office equipment connected to newly designed Quotron II desk units in brokerage offices on which a broker could request, for any stock, price and net change from the opening, or a summary which included highs, lows, and volumes (later SEI added other features like dividends and earnings). The requests went to a Central Office, which condensed and forwarded them to the New York computer. Replies followed the sequence in reverse. The data was transmitted on AT&T's <b>Dataphone</b> high-speed telephone service. In 1963 the new system was accepted by many brokers, and was installed in hundreds of their offices.|$|E
40|$|A {{version of}} LISP 1. 5 for the PDP- 6 Computer has been {{extended}} to include IO through the <b>dataphone.</b> This makes possible communication between programs running in Project MAC time sharing and LISP programs running on the PDP- 6. The method of handling input-output for the <b>dataphone</b> {{is similar to that}} for the typewriter, paper tape punch, and paper tape reader. Three useful LISP functions are presented as examples of <b>dataphone</b> programming...|$|E
40|$|Data {{conferencing}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} commercially successful examples among conferencing applications, because of its effectiveness and relatively modest resource requirements. Existing data conferencing applications are built almost exclusively on IP-based packet switched networks. While they are very effective in improving office communications, their use in the households is still quite limited because data conferencing end-points are mostly personal computers and are thus not particularly friendly to a majority of the population in the world. In contrast, more than 95 % of the population in the United States are quite comfortable with conventional telephones. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an information appliance, called <b>DataPhone</b> that can be used both as a regular phone and a data conferencing device. A <b>DataPhone</b> consists of a touch sensitive screen, a SVD modem and a microcontroller-based single board computer. <b>DataPhone</b> allows two parties to have a regular voice communications channel, as well as a shared whiteboard for sketching and for document sharing. Typical applications of <b>DataPhone</b> include annotating an engineering design while discussing its technical details, drawing a map to a person's house for a friend, and scribbling random information down for future reference. One of the key design decisions of <b>DataPhone</b> is that it runs directly on PSTN, and does not required any additional infrastructural support, such as ISP subscription, domain name service, routing gateway, etc., thus avoiding their associated configuration headaches. We have successfully built a fully functional <b>DataPhone</b> prototype and evaluated its usefulness through end user testing. Initial responses are both favorable and encouraging...|$|E
