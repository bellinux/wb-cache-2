40|$|The {{analysis}} of unknown integrated circuits (ICs) {{has become very}} important over the last decade. In this context different invasive and non invasive procedures have been developed. However, destructive procedures are not suitable because they always damage the IC under investigation. Non invasive analysis procedures have the disadvantage that ICs are analysed using very complex and time consuming algorithms. This paper presents the first novel non invasive procedure to determine nonlinear binary multi input multi output (MIMO) ICs only by its <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The algorithm {{presented in this paper}} solves unknown ICs by the abstraction of automata theory. The overall identification procedure was simulated and fully tested on IEEE ISCAS benchmark models as well as user defined models of real ICs. This paper will show that for every circuit under test the function has been successfully determined by the proposed identification procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} of instance based function learning are presented. In IBFL one {{is given a}} set of positive examples of a functional predicate. These examples are true ground facts that illustrate the <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the predicate. The purpose is then to predict {{the output of the}} predicate given a new input. Further assumptions are that there is no background theory and that the inputs and outputs of the predicate consist of structured terms. IBFL is a novel technique that addresses this problem and that combines ideas from instance based learning, first order distances and analogical or case based reasoning. We also argue that IBFL is especially useful when {{there is a need for}} handling complex and deeply nested terms. Though we present the technique in isolation, it might be more useful as a component of a larger system to deal e. g. with the logic, language and learning challenge. ...|$|E

40|$|By {{the rising}} {{complexity}} and miniaturisation of the device's dimensions, {{the density of}} the conductors increases considerably. Referring to this, locally transient interactions between single physical values become apparent. Therefore, for the investigation and optimisation of integrated circuits it is essential to develop suitable models and simulation surroundings which allow for memory and time-efficient calculation of the behaviour. By means of the dynamic reconstruction theory and the radial basis functions nets the so-called black box models are provided. The description of black box models is derived from the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>behaviour</b> or so-called time series of a dynamic system. Concerning the time series, the black box model adapts its parameters via the extended Kalman filter. This paper provides a modelling approach that enables fast and efficient simulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multilingual Natural Language Generation system that produces technical instruction texts in Bulgarian, Czech and Russian. It generates {{several types of}} texts, common for software manuals, in two styles. We illustrate the system's functionality with examples of its <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>behaviour.</b> We discuss the criteria and procedures adopted for evaluating the system and summarise their results. The system embodies novel approaches to providing multilingual documentation, ranging from the re-use of a large-scale, broad coverage grammar of English {{in order to develop}} the lexico-grammatical resources necessary for the generation in the three target languages, through to the adoption of a 'knowledge editing' approach to specifying the desired content of the texts to be generated independently of the target languages in which those texts finally appear...|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} -calculus is a typed {{version of}} the asynchronous -calculus in which the types, in addition to constraining the input/output behaviour of processes, have security levels associated with them. This enables us to introduce a range of typing disciplines which allow <b>input</b> or <b>output</b> <b>behaviour,</b> or both, to be bounded above or below by a given security level. We define typed versions of may and must equivalences for the security -calculus, where the tests are parameterised relative to a security level. We provide alternative characterisations of these equivalences in terms of actions in context; these describe the actions a process may perform, assuming the observer is constrained by a given typing environment. Using these alternative characterisations we prove non-interference results with respect to may and must testing. These show that information flow between security levels can be controlled using our typing systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{theory is}} an {{explicit}} {{reaction to the}} currently dominant cognitivist paradigm, which states that cognitive systems are essentially computational-representational systems (like computer software), processing <b>input</b> and generating <b>output</b> (<b>behaviour)</b> {{on the basis of}} internal information processing. In cognitivism, the causal root of behaviour lies in the 'virtual' processes governed by the software that runs on our brains. The brain is purely the hardware on which the software is implemented. The body (sensors and actors) are purely input-output devices that are in service of the brain. The world is merely the play-ground (the object) in which the cognitive agent acts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{security}} π-calculus is a typed {{version of}} the asynchronous π-calculus in which the types, in addition to constraining the input/output behaviour of processes, have security levels associated with them. This enables us to introduce a range of typing disciplines which allow <b>input</b> or <b>output</b> <b>behaviour,</b> or both, to be bounded above or below by a given security level. We define typed versions of may and must equivalences for the security π-calculus, where the tests are parameterised relative to a security level. We provide alternative characterisations of these equivalences in terms of actions in context; these describe the actions a process may perform in a given typing environment, assuming the observer is constrained by a related, but possibly different, environment. The paper also contains non-interference results with respect to may and must testing. These show that certain form of non-interference can be enforced using our typing systems...|$|R

Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher Ideal, and Törnqvist-Theil index number procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91.

Although the discussion of this study is confined to simple regression with one <b>input</b> and one <b>output,</b> it can be generalized to cope with cases of multiple <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> For future studies, more general fuzzy <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs</b> and weights such as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers could be handled with our FRBF Network approach and it could be applied to different FR models.|$|R
