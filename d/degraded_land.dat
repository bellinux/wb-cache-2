40|$|Experiences {{worldwide}} {{reveal that}} <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> restoration projects achieve little success or fail. Hence, understanding the underlining causes and accordingly, devising appropriate restoration mechanisms is crucial. In doing so, the ever-increasing aspiration and global commitments in <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> restoration could be realized. Here we explain that Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) biotechnology {{is a potential}} mechanism to significantly improve the restoration success of <b>degraded</b> <b>lands.</b> There are abundant scientific evidences to demonstrate that AMF significantly improve soil attributes, increase above and belowground biodiversity, significantly improve tree/shrub seedlings survival, growth and establishment on moisture and nutrient stressed soils. AMF have {{also been shown to}} drive plant succession and may prevent invasion by alien species. The very few conditions where infective AMF are low in abundance and diversity is when the soil erodes, is disturbed and is devoid of vegetation cover. These are all common features of <b>degraded</b> <b>lands.</b> Meanwhile, <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> harbor low levels of infective AMF abundance and diversity. Therefore, the successful restoration of infective AMF can potentially improve the restoration success of <b>degraded</b> <b>lands.</b> Better AMF inoculation effects result when inocula are composed of native fungi instead of exotics, early seral instead of late seral fungi, and are consortia instead of few or single species. Future research efforts should focus on AMF effect on plant community primary productivity and plant competition. Further investigation focusing on forest ecosystems and carried out at the field condition is highly recommended. Devising cheap and ethically widely accepted inocula production methods and better ways of AMF in-situ management for effective restoration of <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> will also remain to be important research areas.

Remote sensing satellites provide timely, accurate and reliable data on <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> at definite time intervals in a cost effective manner. Experiments {{have been carried}} out to map and monitor the areas with erosion and shifting cultivation and salt-affected soils, using remotely sensed data from Landsat MSS, TM and Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS) sensors. The details of the methodology employed to derive information from remotely sensed data on above mentioned <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> and the results of the experiment are discussed in this paper. The salt-affected soils of India have been mapped for the whole country at 1 : 250, 000 scale by the National Remote Sensing Agency (Hyderabad) in association with National organisations like National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use planning, All India Soil and Land use Survey and provincial soil survey organisations and Agricultural Universities. The changes in the spatial extent of eroded and shifting cultivation areas and salt-affected soils are also studied using multi-temporal satellite data.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{environmental}} degradation is becoming very real in Nigeria. It is also becoming {{a major source of}} insecurity locally. In recent times, flooding which affects most parts of the country has resulted in displacement of communities in most states of the federation. While flooding is largely a natural phenomenon, the upgrading of environmental infrastructure should be complemented with bamboo plantation in areas susceptible to flooding. Other precursors {{of environmental degradation}} in Nigeria are deforestation, unwholesome agricultural practices and minerals exploitation. These have led to large tracts of <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> inform of gully and sheet erosion, degradation of arable land, vegetation and landscape. Bamboo in view of its special characteristics which includes high growth rate, high rate of carbon sequestration, strong potentials for poverty alleviation, its ability to grow on marginal and <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> and its erosion control potentials imbued by widespread rooting system has great potentials for reclaiming <b>degraded</b> <b>lands</b> in the country.
