500|$|Florida still {{receives}} a thousand new residents daily and lands slated for restoration and wetland recovery are often {{bought and sold}} before {{the state has a}} chance to bid on them. The competitive pricing of real estate also drives it beyond the purchasing ability of the state. Because the State of Florida is assisting with purchasing lands and funding construction, some of the programs under CERP are vulnerable to state budget cuts. In June 2008 Governor Crist announced that the State of Florida will buy U.S. Sugar for $1.7billion. The idea came when sugar lobbyists were trying to persuade Crist to relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water into the Everglades. According to one of the lobbyists who characterized it as a [...] "duh moment", Crist said, [...] "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're paying to clean the Everglades, why don't we <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> sugar?"

40|$|Abstract. The {{discrete}} {{wavelet transform}} (DWT) technique {{has been proposed}} for detecting and localizing transient disturbance in the power systems. The disturbance is detected by comparing the transformed signal with an empirically-given threshold. However, as the signal under analysis contains noises, especially the white noise with flat spectrum, the threshold is difficult to give. Due {{to the nature of}} flat spectrum, a filter cannot <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the noise without removing the significant disturbance signals together. To enhance the WT technique in processing the noise-riding signals, this paper proposes a noise-suppression algorithm. The abilities of the WT in detecting and localizing the disturbances can hence be restored. Finally, this paper employed the actual data obtained from the practical power systems of Taiwan Power Company (TPC) to validate by digital implementation on an FPGA-based digital device for real-time de-noising function of the monitored PQ DWT data...|$|E
40|$|For most {{philosophers}} today {{reason is}} no longer an issue. On the contrary, "Farewell to Reason" seems to be a motto of the age. Reason - once the center and hallmark of philosophy - has become the victim of two strategies. On the one side there is the open postmodern attack on reason; on the other side we find a creeping rationalistic abolishment of reason. Ever since the Dialectic of Enlightenment of the fourties and the postmodern and poststructuralist critique throughout the last few decades, reason has been openly accused of being dominating, oppressive, destructive, downright male, class-based, Eurocentric or merely irrelevant. Striving for the general and universal, reason cannot do justice to the singular, but is always oppressive; and since no version of reason is ever in fact comprehensive and universal, as all of them claim - and for reason's sake must claim - to be, the concept of reason seems to be unrealizable and flawed in itself. Why not <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it? A second, more subtle, way of doing away with reason comes from the partisans of ever more consummate rationality. They say: we don't need reason any more, all we need is rationality, and throughout modernity we have developed a comprehensive range of rationalities, able to cover all conceivable questions. Amidst these highly differentiated versions of rationality, no room and no issue remains for reason any more. - Analytic philosophers, for example, often practice this kind of abolishment of reason. If you dare to use the expression `reason' when talking to them, they leave you in no doubt that they haven't the faintest idea of what you might mean...|$|E
40|$|Does {{bureaucracy}} have a function? People {{in organizations}} constantly report their {{frustration with the}} bureaucracy. There is a fantasy {{that if we could}} <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> bureaucracy and hierarchy we could finally get something done. The real problem is that people don't know what bureaucracy is for, and see it as a left over vestige of an authoritarian past. While levels in organizations are generally seen as pointing out who gets to tell who what to do, {{there is some evidence that}} each level actually specializes in a different type of thinking, just as different departments specialize in thinking about different things. If this is true, managers must be careful about which level makes which decisions. In the book A general theory of bureaucracy, Elliott Jaques discusses his intensive research into military, government and industrial organizations which found differences in the planning horizon and the types of thinking used at each level. (Summarized in the table below.) While some organizations may have more than one level of managers in one of these levels, they do seem to describe some of the differences in the ways different levels think. Meaning of Levels These levels can be seen both as developmental levels for people and as descriptions of certain kinds of jobs. Over a lifetime, a person moves from level I up. Some people rise more quickly than others, some people plateau out at a final level before others do. Part of management is to match the level of the manager with the level of the position, either by selecting people at the right level, or by helping those in a position to shift the focus of their thinking to the next level. Planning Horizon This time span is the amount of time you might expect someone to act without input from a higher level. It is the amount of time it takes for results to come from actions at that level. For example, a machinist can immediately see how a part matches specification, but a corporate LV...|$|E
