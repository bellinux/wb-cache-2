An Accident happen'd which gave Caraccioli a fair Opportunity to put his Designs in Execution, and he laid Hold of it; they went off Martinico on a Cruize, and met with the Winchelsea, an English Man of War of 40 Guns, commanded by Captain Jones; they made for each other, and a very smart Engagement followed, the first Broadside killed the Captain, second Captain, and the three Lieutenants, on Board the Victoire and left only the Master, who would have struck, but Misson took up the Sword, order'd Caraccioli to act as Lieutenant, and encouraging the Men fought the Ship six Glasses, when by some Accident, the Winchelsea blew up, and not a Man was saved but Lieutenant Franklin, whom the French Boats took up, and he died in two Days.

Current flight separation standards generally take excessive interval margin, resulting in unnecessary waste of airspace resources and runway resources. Wake accidents still <b>happended</b> even with strictly wake separation standards compliance, which is mainly due to the imperfect separation standards affected by the wake complexity and modeling imperfections.

In these models object functionality is separated form non-functional propertiers, and composed later at compile or runtime.

The models mentioned above achieve this goal at implementation level, but what <b>happends</b> at design level? Why we don´t take advantage of separation of aspects at design time? Our work introduces separation of aspects at design time. UML is used as the modeling language and its semantic has been extended in order to represent object functional design separated from other non-functional designs. The main goal of our work is to generate code for different separation models starting from the same design. In this way a generator application has been developed. This application can generate code for AspectJ, Composition Filters and Disguises Model starting from a UML design. The introduction of separation of aspects at design level provides two basic advantages: the generated code is not affected by inheritance anomaly, and a higher degree of reusability is achieved, due to designs being reused in different domains...|$|R

Before filopodia contact a substrate, they perform a rapid "scanning" motion. Therefore, we suggest that the filopodia of a spreading 3 T 3 cell serve as organs which explore the nonfluid environment and react to a certain quality of the substrate that is presently unknown.

The emerging spatial arrangements of new power relations is an expression of urban class struggles in the context of neoliberal economic social framework of post-apartheid urban landscape. The empirical evidence suggests that the post-apartheid spatial urban landscape reflects not only resilience of apartheid spatial-social imprint but a spatial reconfiguration of power relations. This <b>happends</b> in the context of declining significance of racial divisions and increasing urban social stratefication albeit along racial lines. In neoliberalised post-apartheid urban space, social class struggles have become more prominent and ideological raced spatial division has declined in significant. Although the public sector plays an important role as a developer, neoliberalisation of the state has substantially compromised its ability to reduce social and economic inequalities. Economic and financial forces operating at different geographical scales have become dominat factors in a property driven urban development environment. However Post-apartheid urban patterns reflects that these spatial rearrangements involve much more than just production of space, as they sustain and support novel ways of asserting new urban social identities. Empirical research revelas that these spatial processes are complex and fraught with ambivalence. This research is based on the view that neoliberalism, democratization, globalization, urbal inequalities and social class struggles, integration, desegregation are key instruments to understanding post-aparthied urban landscape.

This ditinguishes the process in South Africa from that which has <b>happended</b> in other African liberalisations. A seconddistinction (an the two are in in all liklihood conected) is that South Africa was not pressured into making changes as part of conditions attached to a loan; trade policy has evoloved in response to the perceived needs and problems of the economy, and has had the commitment of government and the support of the perceived beed and problems of the economy, and has had the commitment of government and the support of the businesss community, virtually eliminating the credibility problem. A third noteworthy difference is that South Africa was the first African country with a GATT offer, signifying its new commitment to a more outward-oriented growth strategy. The reintergration of South Africa into Southern African poses a dilema. South African manufacturing firms are felt by other regional manufactueres to be a threat, All countries in the region ar afraid of being swamped by South African trade and investment, or of losing foreign investment to South AFrica. Ob the other hand, South Africa us both a large market for regionally produced goods (including manufactures) and a reliable (though not necessarily cheaper) source of imports which is closer than Europe and North America.

The original sources and ethnological literature have discussed until now some themes with sporadic analyses of historical transformations. This is why the author, in addition to the ethnological specificalities in the framework of individual traditional specificalities, tried to encompass both the prehistoric and linguistic dimensions. Using the most significant scientific literature concerning the individual problems (Celebration, Wedding, Šibenik costumes), he projected each of these phenomena on the whole events of life. The wide span of these phenomena on the whole events of life. The wide span of the applied ethnologic and lexic materials have made certain logical conclusions possible. This is best expressed in the detailed analysis of the customs at the Festival in Šibenik which abounds in materials and other comparative data, on the basis of which the author tried to give a well documanted conclusion referring to the transformation of customs, beliefs, and continuing it under different historical, religious, ethnic and cultural conditions. In the same way the specific qualities – social, cultural, ritual – are emphasized in the wedding rites, and in maintaining the Old-Balkanic Illyrian influences in the elements of the attire in the Šibenik region preserved until the present days.

The study area is the power line in Imsroa in Stor-Elvdal municipality and covers 516 trees in total 12 stands. The result shows that there is an edge effect in the forest beside the power line, the edge trees are more stable than the rest of the trees for both the main tree species and other species. Although the edge effect is not found to be significant. There is a large variation in the edge effect between all 12 stands for both the main tree species and other species. With a storm at 22 m/s uprooting and stem breakage <b>happends</b> in a proportion of 18. 3 % of the edge trees. If the forest beside the powerline was broaden with 3 meters the proportion of uprooting and stem breakage will be 2 % more to the edge trees...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} and microelectronics technologies are developing very quickly nowadays. In the mean time, the modern integrated avionics systems are burgeoning unceasingly. The modern integrated modular architecture {{more and more}} requires the low-latency and reliable communication databus with the high bandwidth. The traditional avionics databus technology, such as ARINC 429, can not provide enough high speed and size for data communication, {{and it is a}} problem to achieve transmission mission successfully between the advanced avionic devices with the sufficient bandwidth. AFDX(Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet) is a good solution for this problem, which is the high-speed full duplex switched avionic databus, {{on the basis of the}} Ethernet technology. AFDX can not only avoid Ethernet conflicts and collisions, but also increase transmission rate with a lower weigh of the databus. AFDX is now adopted by A 380,B 787 aircraft successfully. The avionics data must be delivered punctualy and reliablely, so it is very essential to validate the real-time performance of AFDX during the design process. The simulation is a good method to acquire the network performance, but it only <b>happends</b> in some given set of scenarios, and it is impossible to consider every case. So a sophisticatd network performance method for the worst-case scenario with the pessimistic upper bound requires to be deduced. The avionic design engineers have launched many researches in the AFDX simulation and methods study. That is the goal that this thesis is aimming for. The development of this project can been planned in the following two steps. In the first step, a communication platform plans to be implemented to simulate the AFDX network in two versions – the RTAI realtime framework and Linux user space framework. Ultimately, these frameworks need to be integrated into net-ASS, which is an integrated simulation and assessment platform in the cranfield’s lab. The second step deduces an effective method to evaluate network performance, including three bounds(delay,backlog and output flow), based on the NC. It is called Network Calculus. It is an internet theory keeping the network system in determistic way. It is also used in communication queue management. This mathematics method is planed to be verified with simulation results from the AFDX simuation communication platform, in order to assure its validity and applicability. All in all, the project aims to assess the performance of different network topologies in different avionic architectures, through the simulation and the mathematical assessment. The technologies used in this thesis benefit to find problems and faults in the beginning stage of the avionics architecture design in the industrial project, especially, in terms of guarantee the lossless service in avionics databus...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{is natural}} {{resources}} occupying very strategic position in life of nation and state. Important {{value of the}} sumberdaya increase because forest {{is the source of}} intention live throng. To race growths of economics improved foreign exchange, hence government to doing development various sector. This activity is done opened forest area become energy kindness area which in course of the execution of gristle the happening of wild hewing (Illegal Logging). Circulation of forest result of ilegal wild hewing and in Indonesia is to act organizational badness (crime organized) because entangling many actors by various network and importance, either in Department Forestry, and other institution and also market network at home affairs and beyond the sea. The Formula of problem this research (1) How local government effort in overcoming Illegal Logging in National Park Mount Palung? (2) Constraints what is faced by local government in overcoming Illegal Logging in Area National Park Mount Palungr? While his target (1) To know done effort is local government in overcoming Illegal Logging in Area National Park Mount Palung. (2) To know constraints any kind of faced by Local Government in overcoming Illegal Logging in Area National Park Mount Palung. In this research the researcher use descriptive method with analysis qualitative, taken research location in National Park Mount Palung which is have place at District of Ketapang Province West Kalimantan. Source of the data of is (1) primary data (2) data of sekunder. Technique data collecting pass (1) interview (2) observation and (3) documentation. Technique analyse data have the character of descriptive with analysis qualitative. Pursuant to research result and solution which have been explained before all can be pulled conclusion as follows: (l). From identifying problems of Illegal Logging which was <b>happended</b> in District of Ketapang can be seen that there are some actors causing the temperature of that Illegal Logging happened. One of them is society about and forest of aparatur governances of itself. Where the people which ought to do isn't to wild hewing is not as runway. Problem of loging illegal the difficultness finished because disability of society about forest of economic facet very base on forest pickings. (2) The effort to doing local government in overcoming Illegal Logging that happened in this National Park Mount Palung in the form of passed to socialization and counselling is society about forest and also local governances aparatur utilize to give knowledge which many to societies concerning forest. (3) Apart from activity of done counselling is local government in overcoming Illegal Logging in this National Park Mount Palung is with effort of memperketat isn't punish either through preventif and by refrensif. By preventif that {{is in the form of}} enableness of society about forest and enableness of wild hewer become formal hewer. By refrensif that is in the form of doing wild hewing razia and air patrol. (4) Execution of operation of wanalaga this is done by team aliance of Mabes Polri is effort to fight against Illegal Logging that happened do not only in just National Park Mount Palung but to all forests which in Ketapang. : (5) Lack of human resource which in BTNGP make performance set of governmental becoming not optimal caused works which to double so that make government officer become difficult to run the function and duties of better and also the understanding of less society concerning forest also become resistor of continuation of TNGP, because in Illegal Logging to surpass do not only just government but society about forest have to follow to share and also...|$|R
