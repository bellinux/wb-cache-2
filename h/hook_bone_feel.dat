50|$|According to the International Miniature Cattle Breeders Society of Registry (who do not {{recognize}} Miniature Texas Longhorns) miniature cattle should not exceed the height of 42 inches measured at the hip, or <b>hook</b> <b>bone.</b> Cattle between the sizes of 42 to 48 inches should be considered mid-sized miniatures. However, since Texas Longhorns are a large breed {{in general and the}} miniatures are still a new concept, it is believed that the height limits should reflect that. Miniature Texas Longhorns should stay under the height of 45 inches when measured at the <b>hook</b> <b>bone</b> (hip). Their horns should be longitudinal with a forward and upward sweep and the total horn measurement should be longer than the height of the animal.|$|R

50|$|Hunting {{the buffalo}} was a {{critical}} part of Mandan survival and rituals. They called the buffalo to “come to the village” in the Buffalo Dance ceremony {{at the beginning of each}} summer. In addition to eating the meat, the Mandan used all parts of the buffalo, so nothing went to waste. The hides were used for buffalo-fur robes or were tanned, and the leather used for clothing, bags, shelter and other uses. The Mandan were known for their painted buffalo hides that often recorded historic events. The bones would be carved into items such as needles and fish <b>hooks.</b> <b>Bones</b> were also used in farming: for instance, the scapula was used as a hoe-like device for breaking the soil. Besides buffalo, the Mandan trapped small mammals for food and hunted deer. Deer antlers were used to create rake-like implements used in farming. Birds were hunted for meat and feathers, the latter used for adornment.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} two locomotion {{traits in}} dairy cows from overhead 3 D video to observe lameness trends. Detecting lameness -particularly {{at an early}} stage- is important {{in order to allow}} early treatment which maximizes detection benefits. The proposed physical setup is covert, non intrusive and it facilitates full autonomy; therefore, it could be implemented on a large-scale or daily-basis with high accuracy. The algorithm automatically tracks features to key regions (i. e. spine, <b>hook</b> <b>bones)</b> using shape index and curvedness measure from the 3 D map. The gait asymmetry trait is analysed {{in the form of a}} dynamic novel proxy derived from the pelvic height movements, as the animal walks. We have found this proxy sensitive to early lameness trends. The back arch trait is analysed using a fitted polynomial in the extracted spine region. The proposed methods in this paper could be implemented on other cattle breeds, equine or other quadruped animals for the purposes of locomotion assessment...|$|R
40|$|Lameness is a {{major issue}} in dairy cattle and its early and {{automated}} detection offers animal welfare benefits together with potentially high commercial savings for farmers. Current advancements in automated detection have not achieved a sensitive measure for classifying early lameness; it remains to be a key challenge to be solved. The state-of-the-art also lacks behind on other aspects e. g. robust feature detection from a cow's body and the identification of the lame leg/side. This multidisciplinary research addresses the above issues by proposing an overhead, non-intrusive and covert 3 -Dimensional (3 D) video setup. This facilitates an automated process in order to record freely walking Holstein dairy cows at a commercial farm scale, in an unconstrained environment. The 3 D data of the cow's body have been used to automatically track key regions such as the <b>hook</b> <b>bones</b> and the spine using a curvedness feature descriptor which operates at a high detection accuracy (100...|$|R

50|$|Starting at the {{transition}} between the Middle to Upper Paleolithic period, some 80,000 to 70,000 years ago, some hunter-gatherers bands began to specialize, concentrating on hunting a smaller selection of (often larger) game and gathering a smaller selection of food. This specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools such as; fishing nets, <b>hooks,</b> and <b>bone</b> harpoons. The transition into the subsequent Neolithic period is chiefly {{defined by the}} unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices. Agriculture originated and spread in several different areas including the Middle East, Asia, Mesoamerica, and the Andes beginning as early as 12,000 years ago.|$|R

50|$|Allokotosauria is {{most notably}} {{characterized}} by wrinkled side surface of orbital {{border of the}} frontal <b>bone,</b> expanded and <b>hooked</b> quadrate <b>bone</b> head on the posterior side, and a prominent tubercle developed above to the glenoid fossa of the scapula, although there are other unambiguous traits that differentiate it from other early archosauromorphs.

Ezcurra (2016) also recovered a highly supported Allokotosauria with the same topology (including only Pamelaria, Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis and Trilophosaurus buettneri in his analysis), but noted that Pamelaria is nearly as likely to represent a basal azendohsaurid instead.|$|R

50|$|The Māori of New Zealand, to {{whom the}} fish are known by their name kahawai, koopuuhuri, and kooukauka, fish in {{subsistence}} and customary capacities.

Recreational fishers also seek Australian salmon for their renowned mettle when hooked; the fish are a challenge to land and often jump, occasionally standing on their tails. A significant number are taken for sport. No records of total recreational catches are kept, but the year's estimated catch of Australian herring from Western Australia's Blackwood River estuary beginning May, 1974, was 68,000 individuals.|$|R

50|$|As climates warmed further around 15,000 years, fish {{began to}} {{populate}} rivers, and technology used to harvest them, such as barbed harpoons, {{first appeared on}} the Upper Angara River.

50|$|The stone {{technology}} which Aboriginal {{people had}} been using with little modification for over 40,000 years diversified and specialised in the last 5,000 years. Spear barbs and tips peaked about 2,000 years ago, and then completely disappeared from the archaeological record in southeastern Australia. They were replaced by technologies associated with the exploitation of smaller animals - shell fish <b>hooks</b> and <b>bone</b> points along the coast for fishing, axes for hunting possums across the woodlands, and adzes for sharpening digging sticks {{along the banks of}} the larger rivers where the yams were abundant. The intensive and regular use of fire was an essential component of this late Holocene shift in resource base (Kohen, 1986).
