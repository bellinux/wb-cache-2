5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914 {{the naval}} {{situation}} in the Pacific had eased {{to a large extent}} due to the sinking of the Emden, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that there was no longer a need to maintain guards on many of the less important facilities, and instead <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> to concentrate the home defence network upon maintaining the coastal defences and on guarding ships while they were in port. Nevertheless, in the larger seaports these precautions required the commitment of considerable resources, requiring several hundred men to provide security. The requirement for the militia to undertake these duties was eased, however, when a special corps was raised from men that had been rejected for service with the AIF, to which a corps of garrison military police that had served in the AIF was added later.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{organs of}} {{military}} occupation, and the orders issued by OKH, regulating {{as they did}} {{a wide range of}} administrative, political, economic, cultural and social matters, the Germans still needed to establish a public administrative body that would implement their directives. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> to establish a puppet government for that purpose.|$|E

5|$|For Shaw's Ferrari, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that {{purchasing}} {{an actual}} model of which only 350 exist and would {{cost at least}} $1million would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months {{under the supervision of}} prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> to paint the replicas bright red {{in order to create a}} lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> {{that the}} battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision {{was met with}} some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> {{that the two}} countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that {{the deterioration of the}} Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E

5|$|The Light Division, {{based at}} Vught, {{was the only}} {{manoeuvre}} force the Dutch Army possessed. Its planned withdrawal had been similarly executed a day early. Its regiments had biked over the Maas and Waal bridges and then turned left through the Alblasserwaard when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> in the afternoon to let it counterattack the German airborne landing on IJsselmonde. It reached the Noord, the river separating the Alblasserwaard from IJsselmonde, in the evening. There they discovered that the sector near the only bridge, built in 1939, was not strongly occupied by the airborne troops, as the Germans simply had not known of its existence because of outdated maps. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> to postpone a crossing until the next day, to gather sufficient forces.

5|$|The first {{plans for}} a line through Numedal were {{launched}} after the Sørland Line reached in Kongsberg in 1871. After <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that the Bergen Line would instead follow Hallingdal, the Numedal plans lay dead until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near Rødberg. The plans were passed in 1918, the first trains started running in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927. At first all services were provided with steam locomotives, but from the 1930s diesel multiple units were used for passenger trains. The line was frequented with classes Cmd 16, 86, 87 and 91. The last regular train ran in 1988; since, there has been sporadic freight service and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag. Draisine rental {{is available on the}} section from Veggli to Rødberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members, including producer Minae Matsukawa, director Mitsuru Endo, and character designer Kazuya Nuri. Series creator Shu Takumi, who wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role for the production, had wanted the series to end with Trials and Tribulations, as he felt that Phoenix's character had been explored fully; when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that the game would get made, he wanted it to have a new main character with a new story, and wanted Phoenix to not make an appearance. Despite this, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that Phoenix would be the accused in the first case in the game. Apollo Justice sold around 250,000 copies during the first retail week and 515,417 by the end of 2007, and has been mostly positively received by critics.|$|E

5|$|U-30 {{began her}} first patrol {{operating}} from Lorient and her seventh overall on 13 July 1940.

Three days later, on 24 July, U-30 returned to Lorient, having experienced a malfunction in one of her engines. It then became clear that the boat was suffering a number of mechanical difficulties and as a result <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> that she would need to be used sparingly.
