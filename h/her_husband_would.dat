She decreed in her will that <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> be the regent during the minority of their child. However, no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that Elizabeth was her lawful successor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of his father, Caligula lived with his mother until her {{relations}} with Tiberius deteriorated. Tiberius would not allow Agrippina to remarry for fear <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> be a rival. Agrippina and Caligula's brother, Nero, were banished in 29 AD on charges of treason.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} King family, members {{disagree}} about his {{religious and political}} views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. King's widow Coretta said publicly that she believed <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> have supported gay rights. However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said publicly {{that he would have}} been opposed to gay marriage.|$|E

5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy (1998). Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} letter Hańska made {{arrangements}} for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby {{allow for a}} direct correspondence. Before long she sent him the news that she and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> be traveling Europe, and visiting Vienna, Hanski's childhood home. They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey. Also, sometime in 1833, Balzac wrote his first confession of love to her, despite being {{at that time in}} another relationship.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{look into}} the mysterious {{disappearance}} of a wealthy heiress and college board trustee, Selma Rose (Patty Hearst). The pair eventually find her in hiding {{in order to avoid}} a complex scam in which <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> cheat her out of money in a divorce settlement. Meanwhile, Veronica investigates and eventually finds out some startling information related to the radical feminist Lilith House—that they faked several of the rapes supposedly perpetrated by the Hearst serial rapist. In addition, Logan and Veronica's relationship becomes even more tumultuous, with Logan eventually coming to the realization that they need to break up.|$|E
5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>would</b> be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. <b>Her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E
5|$|In 996 {{when her}} father was posted to a {{four-year}} governorship in Echizen Province, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance on a trip that could {{take as long as}} five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 – c. 1001), a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties {{at the time of their}} marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Accounts of their marriage vary: Richard Bowring writes that the marriage was happy, but Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband.|$|E

60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>husband,</b> however, <b>would</b> {{not agree}} with her here; for besides having a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw things as an eldest son himself.|$|R
50|$|Mary died at Alnwick, Northumberland, England on 1 September 1362, {{where she}} was also buried. <b>Her</b> <b>husband</b> Henry <b>would</b> marry a second time to Joan Orreby, {{daughter}} and heiress of John, 2nd Lord Orreby.|$|R

25|$|Rossini's {{father was}} {{sympathetic}} to the French Revolution and welcomed Napoleon's troops when they arrived in northern Italy. When Austria restored the old regime, Rossini's father was sent to prison in 1799, where he remained until June 1800. Rossini's mother took him to Bologna, making a living as leading singer at various theatres of the Romagna region. <b>Her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> ultimately join her in Bologna. During this time, Rossini was frequently left {{in the care of}} his aging grandmother, who had difficulty supervising the boy.|$|E

25|$|During the war, Frederick {{joined the}} Prussian army and {{was part of}} the {{fighting}} under the command of Field Marshal Friedrich von Wrangel. He distinguished himself with his courageous valour in the Battle of Dybbøl (7–18 April 1864) that marked the defeat of Denmark by the Austro-Prussian coalition. Pleased with the German victory, Victoria expected the military success of <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> encourage people to understand that she was the wife of the heir apparent. In a letter to Frederick, she complained of the constant criticism and being considered too British in Prussia and too Prussian in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|In July 1879, Langtry {{began an}} affair with the Earl of Shrewsbury; in January 1880, Langtry and the earl were {{planning}} to run away together. In the autumn of 1879, rumours were published in Town Talk that <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> divorce her and cite, among others, the Prince of Wales as co-respondent. Adolphus Rosenberg was the journalist. He wrote separately about Mrs Cornwallis-West, which resulted in her husband suing him for libel. At this point, the Prince of Wales instructed his solicitor George Lewis to sue. Rosenburg pleaded guilty to both of the charges brought against him {{and was sentenced to}} 2 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama {{had clearly}} forged a good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside, and was careful to make sure that neither she nor <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>would</b> upstage him. He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches. She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as Condoleezza Rice with George W. Bush, James Baker with George H. W. Bush, or Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon. Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions.|$|E
