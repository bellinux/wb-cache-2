5|$|In Massena, {{the forests}} along NY420 subside {{slightly}} {{as it passes}} by industrial warehouses and residences. The route curves back to the northwest as it enters the village of Massena. Just past the village line, NY420 crosses the St. Lawrence Subdivision, a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation. The highway continues on, curving northward to cross the Raquette River. It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY37 south of the village center. NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village as Main Street.|$|E
5|$|NY424 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY380 {{in the town}} of Stockton. The route headed northeast, passing by forests and homes as it ascended Stockton Hill. Here, it intersected with Nelson Hill Road, a short alternate route of NY424. After reaching the top of the hill, NY424 became known as Stockton Hill Road and went through fields {{on its way to the}} village of Cassadaga. Once in the village limits, the highway intersected Putnam Road (CR71) in an area of Cassadaga known as Burnhams. NY424 continued on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, passing by homes and the southern end of Lower Lake before coming to an end at an intersection with NY60.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major {{firefighting}} technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City.|$|E

5|$|The {{region that}} became Glacier National Park was first {{inhabited}} by Native Americans. Upon {{the arrival of}} European explorers, it was dominated by the Blackfeet {{in the east and}} the Flathead in the western regions. Under pressure, the Blackfeet ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government; it later became part of the park. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway. These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, which provided greater accessibility for automobiles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park.|$|E
5|$|West of Mitchell Road, NY96 takes a more southerly {{alignment}} {{than the}} canal as {{it enters the}} densely populated village of Pittsford and meets the northern and eastern termini of NY64 and NY252, respectively, {{at the intersection of}} Jefferson Road and South Main Street. NY64 heads to the south along South Main Street and NY252 continues along Jefferson Road to the west while NY96 turns north, proceeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village along South Main Street. In the village center, NY96 intersects Monroe Avenue and State Street, which carry NY31 east–west through Pittsford. The route continues on, becoming North Main Street as it crosses the Erie Canal and passes under the CSX Transportation-owned West Shore Subdivision. Just north of the railroad overpass is a junction with the southern terminus of NY153, the most direct route between Pittsford and nearby East Rochester.|$|E
5|$|West to east {{trending}} canyons provide {{easier access}} by foot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is {{south of the}} park. Carved {{by a combination of}} glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen U-shaped valleys throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, Paintbrush, Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.|$|E

5|$|Just {{past the}} Capital Beltway, the route heads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Greenbelt, having an {{interchange}} with MD193 (Greenbelt Road). The {{headquarters of the}} U.S. Park Police, which patrol {{this portion of the}} parkway, is located off this exit along MD193. MD193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the Wright Brothers taught the U.S. Army how to fly an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture. The parkway's only interchange within the center is at Powder Mill Road, south of Capitol College.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1944 Specht {{was awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his 30 {{victories}} on the Western Front. On 15 April after his commander, Hermann Graf was injured, he gave up his command of II./JG 11, {{and moved to the}} Geschwaderstab (Wing Command flight) as Kommodore-in-training, under Herbert Ihlefeld. Promoted to major on 1 May, he was given full command of JG 11 on 15 May, replacing Ihlefeld who was himself transferred to command JG 1. But little could be done as the Allied bombing offensive stepped up a gear. His units were decimated over the skies of Normandy in June and July. He himself was injured in July, suffering head injuries in yet another crash-landing. Despite severe pain from his injuries, Specht remained on combat duty. His wing was retired to the Rhineland to be rebuilt, but they were crushed again {{in the latter half of}} 1944. The Allies were now sending overwhelming numbers of bombers to destroy the German industrial and military factories and now protected by the advent of the P-51 Mustang, providing fighter cover right <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reich and back.|$|E
5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It {{had been}} two years since the Marcommani refused to help Roman {{against the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and {{that it was a good}} time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E

5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} the throne, Ivan Vladislav immediately sent a delegation to Basil II, which arrived {{five days after}} the fall of Maglen. In his letter, Ivan Vladislav notified Basil that he had personally murdered Gavril Radomir and had seized all the power in the country and promised Basil deep humility and obedience, an act of submission which some in the nobility supported. After Ivan Vladislav firmly secured his hold on the throne, however, he openly declared to be against any kind of compromise with the Byzantines and quickly began to follow the determined policy of his predecessors against the ongoing Byzantine conquest. Basil II soon understood that Ivan Vladislav's letter was a ruse and plotted a retaliatory action, bribing the kavkhan Theodore, who was in Byzantine captivity, to murder the Bulgarian ruler. Theodore in turn paid a trusted man in Ivan Vladislav's employ to commit the murder, but in the event the assassin actually killed Theodore himself. In the meantime Basil II continued his march, forcing the Bulgarian emperor to retreat to the Albanian mountains, and advanced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian state. The Byzantines took the capital Ohrid and burned the imperial palaces; news, however, arrived that Ivan Vladislav had laid siege to Dyrrhachium and that to the south the Bulgarian general Ibatzes had defeated the Byzantine rear army near Bitola. With his supply routes cut, Basil II had to retreat back to Thessalonica leaving a small garrison in Ohrid, which was swiftly retaken by the Bulgarians. Back in his base at Mosynopolis, Basil divided the Byzantine army to harass the areas of Strumitsa and Sofia. In January 1016 the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople.|$|E

This force consisted of 8,000 men, including his Majesty's 24th foot of 907 strong; there was a train attached to it of four 18-pounders, eight 6- and 3-pounders, and fourteen mortars and howitzers.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{automobile}} in the 1910s and 1920s had a twofold effect on the University-Cultural Center area. The prosperous automotive trade increased the population of Detroit by nearly a factor of four between 1900 and 1920. This pushed the city limits far to the north, making what once had been a suburban, open area <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.
