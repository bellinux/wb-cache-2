40|$|Conventionally, {{efforts of}} combating climate change mainly focus on {{reducing}} emissions at production sources, such as factories, offices or other organizational-based entities. While {{this approach has}} served its purposes for years, {{the environmental impacts of}} consumer goods, which cause cross-border carbon emission are very difficult to be managed. This study investigated the <b>feasibilities</b> of an alternative solution to combat climate change using the concept of product carbon footprint (PCF) labelling in Hong Kong. PCF describes the total set of greenhouse gases caused by a product over its whole life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. The concept of PCF is prevalent in regions such as Europe, Japan and Taiwan, where PCF information is shown as labels on productsâ€™ packaging to help consumers distinguish more eco-friendly products. These PCF labels, based on overseas pioneer experience, have shown enormous market potential and environmental benefits. Hong Kong has yet to establish such labelling system despite these benefits. The aim of the study is to investigate the <b>feasibilities</b> of introducing PCF labelling in Hong Kong and identify the opportunities and difficulties lie ahead. Five main types of <b>feasibilities,</b> namely technical, economic, legal, operational and scheduling <b>feasibilities</b> were considered in the study and in-depth review was carried out on each one. Literature review, questionnaire for general public and interviews with stakeholders were undertaken to understand existing PCF labelling schemes and obtain first-hand information from stakeholders of different perspectives. By analyzing the questionnaire and interview results, the study revealed that short-term <b>feasibilities</b> of introducing PCF labelling in Hong Kong is medium. Recommendations were made in accordance to each type of <b>feasibilities</b> to promote the wider adoption of PCF labelling in the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first <b>feasibility</b> study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 <b>Feasibility</b> Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 <b>Feasibility</b> Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} <b>feasibility</b> of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The <b>feasibility</b> of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{research}} {{the issue of}} functional properties of curves of manufacturing <b>feasibilities</b> and demand. Settlement of the problem, and its connection with important scientific and practical tasks. According to its nature, the market economy is unstable and is in constant movement. Economy has an effective instrument for explanation of changes in economic environment; this tool is called the modelling of economic processes. The modelling of economic processes depends first and foremost on the building of economic model which is the base for the formalization of economic process, that is, the building of mathematical model. The effective means for formalization of economic process {{is the creation of}} the model of hypothetic or imaginary economy. The building of demand model is significant for the market of goods and services. The problem includes the receiving (as the result of modelling) definite functional properties of curves of manufacturing <b>feasibilities</b> and demand according to which one can determine their mathematical model. Another problem lies in obtaining majorant properties of curves of joint demand on the market of goods and services. Analysis of the latest researches and publications. Many domestic and foreign scientists dedicated their studies to the researches and building of the models of curves of manufacturing <b>feasibilities</b> and demand. In spite of considerable work of the scientists, such problems as functional properties of the curves and their practical use in modelling. The purpose of the article is to describe functional properties of curves of manufacturing <b>feasibilities</b> and demand on the market of goods and services on the base of modelling of their building. Scientific novelty and practical value. The theoretical regulations (for functional properties of curves of manufacturing <b>feasibilities</b> and demand) received {{as a result of the}} present research, that is convexity, give extra practical possibilities in a microeconomic analysis and in the construction of models of curves according to statistical data. The methods of the study can also be applied to determine the functional properties for curves of supply. ...|$|R

A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E

The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Democrat Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first {{introduced}} legislation for a <b>feasibility</b> study {{to survey the}} area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 <b>feasibility</b> study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted {{that it was not}} designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough <b>feasibility</b> studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan, another Senator from Idaho, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's members of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{recommendations}} are collected to expedite, simplify and harmonize the proceedings for the required permits used to operate soil treatment plants. One {{of them is}} the method of licensing the construction. For this approach legal and technical requirements have been developed by the project at the first time. <b>Feasibilities</b> and limits of only one reviewing site independent determinants are characterized for site remediation plants with identical construction and plants consisting of different operation units. Based on the new defined term, permission of construction for soil treatment plants, a five-stage plant hierarchy from structural parts to facility is developed to allow a correct differentiation. Finally the <b>feasibilities</b> are described to integrate the permission of construction into law in force. (orig.)
