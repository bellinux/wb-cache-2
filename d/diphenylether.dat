40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{challenges}} in analytical chemistry has been the deter-mination of polybrominated-dibenzodioxins (PBDD) and polybrominated di-benzofurans (PBDF) in resin matrices containing brominated <b>diphenylethers</b> as flame retardants. This is mainly because brominated <b>diphenylethers</b> se-verely interfere with PBDD/PBDF analyses. A new method which eliminates this problem is described below. This new procedure effectively removes the brominated diphenyl ethers in the sample, or reduces them to a level where mathematical corrections can be made. In addi-tion, a new approach is used which allows isomer-specific determination of PBDD/PBDFs {{without the need for}} a complete set of analytical standards. Re-sults from the use of this method in the analysis of PBDD/PBDF in flame re-tarded ASB resins and processing fumes are presented...|$|R

By substituting 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl heteroaryl at C-4’ of the <b>diphenylether</b> segment to accomplish MMP-13 selectivity over MT-1 MMP, made the compound 420121-84-2. The compound has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 1 nM for MMP-13.I125-radioable pyrimidinetriones that have similar structure {{have been made to}} be used in MMP-9 elevated atherosclerosis and elevated MMP-2 and MMP-9 cancers. This class of MMP inhibitors is easy to synthesize and are potent enough for clinical valuation. Compound 544678-85 is the latest pyrimidine based inhibitor, the compound is a pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxamide that is very potent and MMP-13 selective. The compound has a specificity loop that within the S1’ pocket and its 3-methyl-4-fluoro group is proximal enough to the zinc to change the water entity. These compounds have good oral bioavailability and properties that promote them to be a good candidate for a subtype inhibitor of MMP-13 based diseases and future development.Pyrimidine dicarboxamides are highly selective MMP-13 inhibitors. In the S1’ pocket of MMP-13 is an S1’ side pocket that is unique to the matrix metalloproteiase. Pyrimidine dicarboxamides bind to this side pocket, which increases the selectivity. The role of MMP-13 is cleaving fibrillar collagen at neutral pH and higher mRNA levels of MMP-13 is detected in breast carcinoma and osteoarthritis joints.|$|E

40|$|Capillary gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{is a very}} useful technique for the determination of complex mixtures of halogenated contaminants. Initially, this technique has shown its merits for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides. In addition, it has also broken new grounds towards the identification and quantification of relatively unknown halogenated compounds, often complex mixtures, such as toxaphene, polychlorinated naphthalenes and paraffins and brominated flame retardants. Capillary GC is, however, not the final solution for the determination of all these mixtures. For some of them, with a relatively simple constitution or {{with only a few}} major components, such as chlordanes and brominated <b>diphenylethers,</b> a reliable congener-specific analysis may be carried out by single-column capillary GC. For others more advanced techniques will be required. Multi-dimensional (MD) GC techniques, such as heart-cut MDGC or comprehensive MDGC, are still under development or have only been applied for non-routine analyses. Given the importance of some of these complex mixtures, such as several brominated flame retardants, which are still produced and used daily and world-wide, it may be expected that next to the use of GC-MS, these more advanced GC techniques will be used more frequently in the near future. The current state-of-the-art of capillary GC with regard to the different compounds classes indicated below is described. Also, attention is given to the sample preparation.

50|$|The {{pioneering}} hydroxamate-based inhibitors {{were followed}} {{by a set of}} 'new generation' molecules with features including a substituted aryl, a sulfonamide and a hydroxamate zinc-binding group.In MMI-270 there is also an amino acid sidechain-type substituent on the carbon that is α to the hydroxamate, along with a sidechain on the sulfonamide (which was later shown to be unnecessary). The N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminoacid hydroxamate of MMI-270 mimics the marimastat succinate motif. Cipemastat, which was developed as an MMP-1, -3 and -9 collagenase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis, also has the marimastat succinate motif. Its clinical trial was terminated prematurely.MMI-166 has an N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminocarboxylate zinc-binding group, different from the hydroxamate-zinc binding group seen in MMI-270 and Cipemastat. It also has a triaryl substitution that the other structures didn‘t have. ABT-770 and Prinomastat also have an aryl substitution. In ABT-770 the two phenyl rings are directly connected but in Prinomastat the two phenyl rings are connected by an oxygen atom, forming a <b>diphenylether.</b> These three permutations direct the SAR away from MMP-1 and toward the „deep pocket“ MMPs such as the gelatinases. ABT-770 shows anticancer activity in animal models, but it is easily metabolised to an amine metabolite that causes phospholipidosis. MMI-166 has shown anticancer activity in numerous animal models, but there is no data available of its clinical performance. Prinomastat on the other hand, {{is one of the best}} studied MMP inhibitors. It showed excellent preclinical animal anticancer efficacy, but a recurring limitation to these hydroxamates (Prinomastat in particular) is drug metabolism including loss of the hydroxamate zinc-binding group.These inhibitors {{were followed by}} the next group of hydroxamate-based inhibitors, which focus on the suppression of metabolism, minimization of MMP-1 inhibitory activity and the control of subtype selectivity, by structure-based design. The tetrahydropyran in RS-130830 introduces a steric block that suppresses metabolism, which would fix the problem that the the previous generation of inhibitors showed. The outcome of its clinical evaluation has not yet been disclosed. 239796-97-5 has improved ADME and MMP-1 selectivity properties and has shown excellent oral efficacy in an animal model of osteoarthritis. Although, the therapeutic objectives for these inhibitors is not cancer, like it has been for most of the MMP inhibitors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preparation}} of PBI(IV) {{can be achieved}} by condensation reaction of diphenyl isophthalate (I) and 3,3’,4,4’-tetraaminodiphenyl (II) (Figure 1). The spontaneous cyclization of the intermediately formed animo-amide (III) to PBI (IV) provided a much more stable amide linkage.This synthetic method was first used in the lab and later developed into a two step process. In a typical condition, starting materials were heated at 270 degree for 1.5 h to form the PBI prepolymer and later the prepolymer was heated at 360 degree for another 1 h to form the final commercial-grade product. The reason for the second step is due to the formation of the by-product phenol and water in the first step creating voluminous foam, which leads to the volume expansion of several times of the original. This is the issue that must be considered by the industrial manufacturers. This foam can be reduced by conducting the polycondensation at a high temperature around 200 °C and under the pressure of 2.1-4.2 MPa. The foam can also be controlled by adding high boiling point liquids such as <b>diphenylether</b> or cetane to the polycondesation. The boiling point can make the liquid stay in the first stage of polycondesation but evaporate in the second stage of solid condensation. The disadvantage of this method is that there are still some liquids which remain in PBI and it is hard to remove them completely.While changing the tetramine and acid, a number of different aromatic poly benzimidazoles have been synthesized. The following table (Table 1) [...] lists out some of the combination possibilities that have been synthesized in the literature. Some of the combination have actually been translated into fibers on a small scale. However, the only significant progress have been made to date is PBI.The most common form of PBI used in industry is the fiber form. The fiber process following polymerization is shown in the figure. The polymer is made into solution using dimethylacetamide as solvent. The solution is filtered and converted into fiber using a high temperature dry-spinning process. The fiber is subsequently drawn at elevated temperature to get desired mechanical properties. It is then sulfonated and made into staple using conventional crimping and cutting techniques.|$|E

Although both compounds produce the same light-dependent symptoms of desiccation and chlorosis indicative of a common primary mechanism of action, this study is concerned with a more broadly based investigation of different effects on the electron transport system. Comparisons have also been made with other compounds interacting with the chloroplast. Unlike nitrofluorfen, fomesafen has little effect as an inhibitor of electron flow or energy transfer. Both compounds have the ability to stimulate superoxide production through a functional electron transport system, and this involves specifically the p-nitro substituent. The stimulation, which {{is not likely to be}} an essential part of the primary herbicidal effect, is diminished under conditions that remove the coupling factor.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of xenobiotics {{in the soil}} was studied in a model experimental system using pentachlorophenol (PCP), an enzyme, and a potential humic precursor. It {{has been shown that}} potential humic precursors such as p-coumaric acid greatly accelerated the peroxidase-catalyzed reaction of PCP (Morimoto K. and Tatsumi K, 1997. Eect of humic substances on the enzymatic formation of OCDD from PCP. Chemosphere 34, 1277 – 1283). About 90 % of the PCP reacted but almost no transformation products were detected by GC/MS analysis. Most of the transformed PCP was detected in the polymeric products by the determination of the adsorbable organic halide (AOX) in gel permeation chromatography (GPC) fractions. Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) of the polymers showed that tetrachlorophenol (TeCP) was the major pyrolysis product. This accords with the ion chromatography observation that about 20 % of the PCP chlorine was released as chloride ion. However, nitrobenzene oxidation produced only a small amount of PCP and no TeCP. Based on the selectivity of the two degradation methods, it is concluded that TeCP is bound to the polymer by a <b>diphenylether</b> linkage, and PCP by an ether linkage to the aliphatic side chain. Thus, it was concluded that the major part of the PCP was incorporated into the polymer from p-coumaric acid by the release of a chlorine atom from the PCP molecule to form a <b>diphenylether</b> linkage with the p-hydroxyl group of the p-coumaric acid polymer. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
