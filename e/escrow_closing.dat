The closing date of the relinquished property escrow is Day Zero of the exchange, and that is when the exchange clock begins to tick. Written identification of the address of the replacement property must be sent within 45 days, and the identified replacement property must be acquired by the taxpayer within 180 days. [...] Step 5. The taxpayer sends written identification of the address or legal description of the replacement property to the Qualified Intermediary, on or before Day 45 of the exchange. The document must be signed by everyone who signed the exchange agreement.

50|$|In March 2013 the {{district}} <b>closed</b> <b>escrow</b> on the building's sale and approved the environmental studies. The City of El Segundo {{objected to the}} sale.

The city cannot make taxes off of public schools.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} sales, {{a promotion}} was held later that summer in which five buyers received free BMW convertible vehicles, worth $37,000 each.

40|$|Clark County (“the County”) {{wanted to}} sell the {{remnants}} of two parcels of land after finishing constructing five lanes at the Desert Inn Arterial. The combined acreage of the two parcels totaled. 49 acres. At a public auction, the County advertised the land under the former legal description, which described the property as being. 92 acres. Neil Ohriner, the sole owner of Nolm, LLC, realized the legal property description was incorrect. He then bid on the parcels, winning them for $ 340, 000. 00. The Grant, Bargain, and Sale Deed delivered to escrow likewise incorrectly described the property as. 92 acres. After <b>escrow</b> <b>closed,</b> Ohriner subsequently transferred the deed to Nolm. After the sale, the County taxed Ohriner $ 1, 050, 480. 00 on one parcel and $ 81, 310. 00 on the other, taxes based on the full. 92 acres. When Ohriner brought {{the issue of the}} tax amounts to the County’s attention, he was given two options: either voluntarily reform the deed to describe the appropriate parcel sizes, or rescind the entire contract for the full purchase price plus taxes. Ohriner instead filed a complaint against the County for trespass, inverse condemnation, and private nuisance. The County filed a counter-suit, seeking reformation of the deed, or rescission of the contract, plus attorney’s fees and costs. The district court considered the fact that although Ohriner was aware before purchasing the property that the legal description was incorrect, he intended to use the County’s error as a “bargaining chip” if the County opposed his application for an adult use permit for the property. The district court ordered Ohriner to reform the contract to reflect the true legal description of the property,. 49 acres. Ohriner filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification, arguing that the purchase price and property taxes should have been abated. His motion was denied, after which Ohriner filed an appeal...|$|R

50|$|Despite concerns, {{particularly}} from Las Vegas police, the City Council approved Signorelli {{for a permanent}} liquor license in April 2007.

50|$|In November 2000, the California Coastal Commission, which regulates {{development}} {{along the}} state's coastline, ruled that development {{had to be}} limited to the upper half ("upper bench") of the Bolsa Chica mesa because the lower half ("lower bench") was too valuable as habitat. Koll—now called Hearthside Homes—sued. The case was eventually dismissed. The developer contributed to the campaign of bond measure Proposition 50, which included specific language to purchase land at Bolsa Chica. Proposition 50 passed, and the state ended up purchasing 118 acre of the lower bench, <b>closing</b> <b>escrow</b> in December 2005. Hearthside was free to develop the upper bench, and their 379-unit project (whittled down from the 5,000+ plan of the 1960s) broke ground in 2006.|$|R

Bart, who {{had come from a}} career in home building and mortgage banking, and Daphne, who had a background in landscape architecture, had been interested in acquiring an historical vineyard property. When they purchased the Eisele Vineyard from Milt and Barbara Eisele, they decided to build a winery on the property. Daphne stated [...] "Our intent was to have a vineyard. But before we even <b>closed</b> <b>escrow,</b> Bart realized {{that it was important to}} also make the wine, to control the whole process from beginning to end."

40|$|With {{equitable}} {{key escrow}} mechanisms {{the control of}} society over {{the individual and the}} control of the individual over society are shared fairly. In particular, the control is limited to specified time periods. We consider two applications: limited time-span escrow and limited time-span auctions with closed bids. In the first the individual cannot be targeted outside the period authorized by the court. In the second the individual cannot withhold his/her closed bid beyond the bidding period. We propose two protocols, one for each application. These protocols do not require the use of tamper-proof devices. Furthermore, our limited time-span escrow scheme is proven secure (the security is reduced to two problems which are believed to be hard).

50|$|On May 16, 2013, the Maloof family reached {{agreement}} {{to sell the}} Sacramento Kings to a group led by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadivé for a then-record NBA franchise valuation of $535 million. Ranadivé, 55, named Raj Bhathal, 71, founder of Tustin-based Raj Manufacturing, {{one of the largest}} swimwear companies in the nation, as one of the investors in a consortium to buy a majority stake in the Kings from the franchise's longtime owners, the Maloof family, for a reported $348 million. The group fought off a rival bid that would have moved the team to Seattle after the NBA's Board of Governors rejected investor Chris Hansen's bid to relocate the team. The new owners intend to keep the team in Sacramento. On May 28, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale, ending several years of efforts by other cities to take possession and move the Kings out of Sacramento. On May 31, 2013, the Kings <b>closed</b> <b>escrow,</b> finalizing the sale to the Ranadivé group at a record valuation of $534 million, beginning a new era for the franchise. Plans were already underway to move forward on an arena, as the Downtown Plaza was reportedly being sold to the Sacramento ownership group.

5000|$|A Flat-fee listing on the MLS {{would provide}} the seller with a listing {{just like any other}} listing with the {{difference}} being they maintained freedom to sell on their own and had to deal directly with inquiring agents all the way through contract and closing. At first, there was an uprising by full service Real Estate companies because this service would surely cut their ability to monopolize the MLS and the ability to get Exclusive Right of Sale Listings where no matter what they would get a commission. The FTC eventually stepped in and ruled that the Flat-fee model be able to remain in place because it gave the home sellers another option which would save them money and introduce more competition to the marketplace. In addition, the seller benefits from being syndicated to other site feeds like Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com and around 100 other web sites which is automatic once it is on the MLS. [...] Traditionally real estate brokerage services in the United States have been delivered as part of a bundled package including such services as (i) assisting the seller in setting a list price for the property; (ii) marketing and advertising a property for sale, including listing the property in the MLS; (iii) handling buyer inquiries and scheduling and arranging showings of the property to prospective home buyers; (iv) holding [...] "Open Houses" [...] to allow the public to preview a property for sale; (v) handling contract preparation and negotiation on behalf of the seller; (vi) management of the real estate transaction to final settlement (or <b>closing</b> <b>escrow).</b> The fee structure for this bundled package of services in the United States and Canada has generally been to pay a commission on the gross sales price of the property of between 5-7%.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the first {{fifty years of}} a modest 1950 housing tract of one hundred thirty-nine houses and five commercial lots in Santa Ana, California. I analyzed deeds, maps, newspapers, powers of attorney, building permits, city directories, and promotional material and interviewed nearly one hundred former and current residents to determine who came to Santa Ana in the mid-twentieth century, why they came, and why they stayed or left. Contrary to what contemporary Los Angeles boosters might have thought, mid-century Santa Ana {{was not simply a}} suburb of Los Angeles. In 1950 Santa Ana, with 45, 533 residents and forty manufactories, was the urban hub for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) and for growing Orange County. By {{the end of the century}} the city’s housing units were the most densely populated in the U. S. My research suggests that between 1950 and 2000 most new residents, including the hundreds of thousands of Marines who transferred to and through El Toro MCAS, followed their jobs to Santa Ana; others came in search of cultural community. My analysis of deeds and interviews indicates that high numbers of active-duty military homeowners altered the community landscape by stimulating frequent housing turnover and a high number of absentee-landlord rental properties that continued through the end of the century. Historians Becky Nicolaides, Andrew Wiese, Greg Hise, and others who reexamine Kenneth Jackson’s 1985 Crabgrass Frontier identify alternate forms of postwar suburbs that differ from the Levittown model of popular imagery. The Santa Ana tract in this study represents one such variation that was integrated into the city through mixed land use and public through-traffic. In The Suburb Reader (2006) editors Nicolaides and Wiese call for historians to investigate the extent to which the postwar suburban nuclear family accurately reflected the ideal image. Although the Santa Ana developer originally sold houses only to white married couples, most families in this tract did not fit the traditional nuclear family model in several ways. Notably, the tract’s military families with often-absent husbands and fathers deviated significantly from the traditional ideal. However, death, marriage, divorce, migration, and economics affected nuclear family structure and homeownership for most families within the small tract from 1950, before the new houses <b>closed</b> <b>escrow,</b> through 2000, by which time the demographic and built profiles of the tract and the city had changed...|$|R
