A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there.

Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E
