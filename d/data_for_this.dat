25|$|Nitrofurantoin is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with decreased renal function (CrCl < 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests the <b>data</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl < 40 ml/min would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are {{more common in the}} elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers criteria.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the key}} {{drivers of}} the IoT is data. The success {{of the idea of}} {{connecting}} devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage & processing of <b>data.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> purpose, companies working on IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems. The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data and how it is used. Presently the regulators have shown more interest in protecting the first three issues identified above.|$|E
25|$|Cormorants {{seem to be}} a very ancient group, {{with similar}} {{ancestors}} reaching back to the time of the dinosaurs. In fact, the earliest known modern bird, Gansus yumenensis, had essentially the same structure. The details of the evolution of the cormorant are mostly unknown. Even the technique of using the distribution and relationships of a species to figure out where it came from, biogeography, usually very informative, does not give very specific <b>data</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> probably rather ancient and widespread group. However, the closest living relatives of the cormorants and shags are the other families of the suborder Sulae—darters and gannets and boobies—which have a primarily Gondwanan distribution. Hence, at least the modern diversity of Sulae probably originated in the southern hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} the rapid {{improvement}} in microcomputers, {{and especially the}} introduction of the graphical user interface and data-rich application programs like Lotus 1-2-3 led to an increasing interest in using personal computers as the client-side platform of choice in client-server computing. Under this model, large mainframes and minicomputers would be used primarily to serve up data over local area networks to microcomputers that would interpret, display and manipulate that <b>data.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> model to work, a data access standard was a requirement – in the mainframe field it was highly likely that all of the computers in a shop were from one vendor and clients were computer terminals talking directly to them, but in the micro field there was no such standardization and any client might access any server using any networking system.|$|E
500|$|Rankings [...] {{based on}} {{attributes}} other than standardized test scores, salary of graduates, and similar attributes also exist. The Beyond Grey Pinstripes ranking, {{compiled by the}} Aspen Institute and published biannually, is based entirely on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. <b>Data</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> survey is solicited from university administrators at accredited colleges, and audited by teams of Ph.D. scoring fellows. Rankings are calculated {{on the amount of}} sustainability coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%). The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.|$|E
500|$|In late June 2014, {{details of}} {{the next phase of}} the search were announced; {{officials}} have called this phase the [...] "underwater search", despite the previous seafloor sonar survey. Continued refinement of analysis of Flight 370's satellite communications identified a [...] "wide area search" [...] along the arc where Flight 370 was located when it last communicated with the satellite. The priority search area within the wide area search is in its southern extent. Some of the equipment to be used for the underwater search operates best when towed [...] above the seafloor {{at the end of a}} [...] cable. Available bathymetric <b>data</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> region was of poor resolution, thus necessitating a bathymetric survey of the search area before the underwater phase began. Commencing in May, the bathymetric survey charted around [...] of seafloor through 17 December 2014, when it was suspended for the ship conducting the survey to be mobilised in the underwater search.|$|E
