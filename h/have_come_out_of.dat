25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had not {{wanted to do a}} sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time.

500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background.

Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> soaps {{in the past few}} years.

He noted [...] "things <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the air for me...I'm grateful; that's why I work with kids. I've had a blessing in my career, to have gone as far as I've gone." [...] A 1995 piece in The Plain Dealer described Taylor as [...] "A jolly giant of a man, he looks like a natural force – a mountain, perhaps, who can tell great stories." [...] Taylor was a Christian.|$|E

500|$|... 1992 saw {{the release}} of Maarg, her third {{appearance}} under Mahesh Bhatt's direction. The film was delayed for several years. She {{played the role of}} a prostitute, working by choice. Bhatt called her performance [...] "stunning" [...] and reported that when shooting ended, she was [...] "on the point of a breakdown" [...] as she was [...] "exhausted battling with the nitty-gritty of a whore's character". She next played Barkha, a single woman who abandons her premarital daughter upon birth, in Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai. In Shashilal K. Nair's Angaar, a crime drama based on the life of an underworld don, she played Mili, a homeless orphan collected by an unemployed man, played by Jackie Shroff. Angaar received positive reviews from critics, as did Kapadia's performance, but it was financially unsuccessful, which Meena Iyer of The Times of India—who called it [...] "one of the most engaging mafia films to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bollywood"—attributed to its dark proceedings.|$|E
500|$|For the HBO {{television}} film Wit (2001), however, Thompson happily {{took the lead}} role in what she felt was [...] "one of the best scripts to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> America". Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focusses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right. [...] She was greatly drawn to the [...] "daredevil" [...] role, for which she had no qualms about shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by [...] "the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work. Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as [...] "one of her most brilliant performances", adding [...] "we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body." [...] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have focused}} on the {{parallels}} between E.T.'s life and Elliott, who is [...] "alienated" [...] by the loss of his father. A.O. Scott of [...] The New York Times wrote that while E.T. [...] "is the more obvious and desperate foundling", Elliott [...] "suffers in his own way from the want of a home". E.T. is the first and last letter of Elliott's name. At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter Pan {{from the perspective of a}} Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; government scientists take the place of Neverland's pirates. Vincent Canby of The New York Times similarly observed that the film [...] "freely recycles elements from [...] Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz". Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. According to A.O. Scott, [...] "The suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a Raymond Carver story." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote, [...] "Spielberg's movies, despite the way they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann Marling called 'the marks of hard use'." ...|$|E

Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> soaps {{in the past few}} years. There is a fantastic amount of talent on those shows." [...] This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former Brookside actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, Star Wars actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and Family Affairs star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later roles were awarded to comedian Adrian Edmondson, former film actress Patsy Kensit, and Jesus of Nazareth star Powell. When Jane Asher was cast in the recurring role of Lady Byrne in 2007, Inside Soap magazine asked Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out [...] "well-known-names". She responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best – which is why we go for them." ...|$|E
500|$|An oboe triplet figure then {{reveals the}} warm theme in G major of the Adagio non troppo section, a {{contrast}} to the prior cold landscape. The texture expands contrapuntally for the first time, culminates {{to a point where}} the tonality brightens to B major and, after a climax, wanes to G major again. The full strings are soon disturbed by an [...] "evil" [...] motif on woodwinds, playing the shivering element in Tempo giusto; tension between wind and strings intensifies as tonality shifts within instrumental groups in their respective directions. With a further clash, the music is menaced by the snare drum at a tempo (quarter note ♩=116) faster than that of the orchestra, and at its climax comes the instruction to the snare drummer by the composer to improvise [...] "as if at all costs he wants to stop the progress of the orchestra". (This instruction is not included in the 1950 edition of the score, being replaced by a written rhythmic line and instruction [...] "cad. ad lib." [...] after a few bars.) The warm theme eventually triumphs in a sustaining grandeur, as is affirmed by the snare drum actually joining the orchestral fanfare. When all subsides, echoes in woodwinds are heard and a solitary clarinet is left to mourn in a tragic atmosphere, recapturing ideas from the whole movements: [...] "Who would have thought that so much could <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a gently waving viola line in empty space?" ...|$|E
500|$|Levi's {{performance}} has garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who enjoyed the actor's comedic delivery and singing voice. Praising the directors' decision to [...] " [...] big-name stars {{in favor of}} lesser-known talent", TV Guide described Levi's performance as [...] "charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough". Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi [...] "comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters", complimenting the fact that [...] "the cast's names are less than household stature". Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as [...] "terrific". ABC Online appreciated the fact that [...] "the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable", concluding, [...] "Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do {{a really good job}} on the voices". Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi [...] "creates a significant amount of range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a heart of gold Flynn pop on the screen". Hucks went on to call Flynn [...] "one the better [...] that <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Disney stable in quite a while". Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's [...] "quick-tongued delivery", while Rolling StonesPeter Travers wrote that the actor [...] "does a nice job" [...] as Flynn. James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore [...] "adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds described Levi as [...] "excellent as the rogueish hero". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi [...] "a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn". Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that [...] "Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest". Praising the actor's singing voice, Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as [...] "impressive".|$|E
