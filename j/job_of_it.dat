5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had {{changed his name to}} Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E

The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a bang up <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed."

500|$|Robert Koehler of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn't {{enough to get}} Saw II out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor". Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, saying [...] "Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw" [...] and that both films are [...] "more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling". He praised Bell's performance as Jigsaw, saying [...] "As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, Saw II sturdiest horror, a Terence Stamp look-alike who calls to mind a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair". [...] He ended his review: [...] "Where Saw II lags behind in Saw's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> than the original's cheat finish".|$|E

500|$|An {{officer in}} one of the 38th Division's {{infantry}} battalions, who met Cubitt in early June, shortly after he took command, described him as [...] "a very large and fierce-looking major-general, with two rows of ribbons, and a gleam in his eye", who proceeded to interrogate a subaltern about the exact type and position of his unit's trench latrines, apparently something of a pet topic. A [...] "fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language", it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely [...] "a magnificent gush of language". A colleague from his early days in the artillery described him as a [...] "perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion", but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they [...] "damn well had to do the raid over again, and damn well see that [...] made a proper <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> or, by God, damn well go on raiding until [...] damn well did." [...] To the officers on the receiving end, already tired and dissatisfied, this was seen as a [...] "contemptible exhibition" [...] for a senior officer to make.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 she starred as TV {{journalist}} Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar's war drama Lakshya, alongside Hrithik Roshan. The {{film was}} based on the historical events of the 1999 Kargil War; Zinta's character was modelled after TV journalist Barkha Dutt, the only female reporter who covered the conflict. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; Namarata Joshi of Outlook likened her to [...] "a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest" [...] and Rediff.com concluded, [...] "Zinta has quite a good role and a good deal of footage in the film, and she does a fairly decent <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> without ever being spectacular." [...] Later that year, Yash Chopra cast her opposite Shahrukh Khan as the female lead in the love saga Veer-Zaara, the top-grossing Hindi film of that year both in India and abroad, with revenues of over [...] worldwide. The film, which relates the love story of an Indian officer, Veer Pratap Singh, and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Haayat Khan, had a strong international release, including a screening at the Berlin Film Festival, and won several Best Movie awards at major Indian award functions. For her portrayal of Zaara, a role which required her to master the fine nuances of the Urdu language, Zinta received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Variety hailed her as [...] "the most interesting young actress of her generation," [...] writing that she [...] "is her usual lively self as thewillful Zaara." [...] Veer-Zaara was Zinta's second highest-grossing film and third major success in two consecutive years. It marked the beginning of her work with Yash Raj Films, one of the largest production houses in Bollywood.|$|E

[...] The band took the advance and used it to build a {{recording}} studio in Watford in July 2013. A friend of the band had a lease on a few rehearsal rooms. The band initially wanted the room as a storage area for their equipment, but this soon changed into a storage and rehearsal area, then into a storage, rehearsal and recording studio. Sansom spent a week looking up studio equipment on Gumtree, which the band would drive to pick up. Two items of gear the band acquired was a tape machine and a 1980s recording console.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the turn}} of the century, the Oxford team {{included}} the three Nickalls brothers, two of whom went on to represent England. Their contribution at university level saw the Dark Blues romp to a 15–0 victory in 1898. Five years later, an American arrived at Oxford who was to become another 10-goal player and more famous than any of his predecessors – Devereux Milburn. Not content with gaining a rowing Blue and being on the swimming team, Milburn guided the polo team to victory in successive Varsity matches, winning by a margin of 14 goals on both occasions. Even swimming and playing polo against the same university on one day was no problem for him. He soon graduated to international level, playing number four for his country in every match between 1909 and 1927. Universally described as ‘the greatest back there has ever [...] been’, in his prime he had no equal. He was a pivotal member of the mighty ‘Big Four’, the greatest side to play during that era, and one that changed the way the back position is played. Previously, the English regarded the back’s role as similar to a goal-keeper in football, [...] i.e. to stay by the goal and defend. Whereas before, polo was a gentleman’s preoccupation. Milburn made a <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hollyoak's series {{producer}} Jo Hallows described Tony as a [...] "fantastic" [...] {{character and}} opined that Pickard {{had made the}} role his own.

Hallows opined that Pickard is [...] "probably the person I've cried at the most, some of the more difficult stories he's done, even though you know the story that's coming up, you can't help but have a lump in your throat". Another series producer Bryan Kirkwood praised Pickard's acting skills, stating that he felt Pickard is a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. He said he was [...] "particularly pleased in moving Tony away from the buffoon he had become over the years into heartbreaking stories such Grace's death and his relationship with Jacqui. He's a touching and sensitive actor who's always over-looked". Series producer Paul Marquess praised Pickard, saying he felt that [...] "there's only so many daft Tony stories you can do. He's so key to the show and so able and adept". Pickard's colleague Gemma Merna praised Pickard saying Pickard has [...] "had some great storylines", adding that if she was [...] "half as successful as Nick is on the show and liked as much then I would love to stay".|$|E

Similarly, IGN's Ahsan Haque felt that Jackie 's [...] "attention seeking attraction towards Elton was handled extremely well." [...] Burk and Smith? identify Jackie's [...] "because it's hard" [...] speech as [...] "Coduri's best acting in the series, bar none" [...] opining that the actress [...] "infuses her scenes with comic brilliance, wistful reflection and raw anger, all {{in the space of}} several minutes". They felt that Davies keeps [...] " [...] humorous elements intact and shows us the bittersweet pain that underpins it." [...] In his review of [...] "Army of Ghosts" [...] Arnold T Blumberg, writing for Now Playing magazine, observes that the character [...] "gets to be a companion for a little while" [...] and [...] "does a damn fine <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> too." [...] Burk and Smith? list the simultaneous reunion and first meeting between Jackie and Pete in [...] "Doomsday" [...] as one of the episode's poignant moments, stating that the scene [...] "sings joyously" [...] through the performances of Coduri and Dingwall. Commenting on Jackie's involvement in [...] "Journey's End" [...] Travis Fickett observed that having the Doctor tell her {{to stay away from the}} TARDIS console was [...] "a fun moment", although he felt that having so many characters present in the episode was [...] "a bit awkward."

2500|$|In 2004, Hanson gave {{a mostly}} {{favorable}} review {{to the book}} Colossus by the British historian Niall Ferguson, where Ferguson argued that the United States should be an imperial power {{in the sense of}} preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership {{in the same way that}} people in 19th century Britain did. Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: [...] "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, given our wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive." [...] Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principle problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are. Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the British Empire as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: [...] "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a bad rap as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a pretty good <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as well." [...] Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the European Union as being both [...] "busy triangulating with our enemies" [...] and [...] "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." [...] He cites appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the US, a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the US.|$|E
