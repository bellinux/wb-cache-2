2500|$|The {{classic example}} of [...] "long-tail" [...] {{insurance}} risks is asbestosis/mesothelioma claims under employers' liability or workers' compensation policies. An employee at an industrial plant may {{have been exposed to}} asbestos in the 1960s, fallen ill twenty years later, and claimed compensation from his former employer in the 1990s. The employer would report a claim to the insurance company that wrote the policy in the 1960s. However, because the insurer did not fully understand the nature of the future risk back in the 1960s, it and its reinsurers would not have properly reserved for it. In the case of Lloyd's, this resulted in the bankruptcy of thousands of individual investors who indemnified <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> written from the 1940s to the mid-1970s for companies with exposure to asbestosis claims.|$|E

50|$|Many small {{businesses}} do not secure <b>general</b> or professional <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> {{due to the}} high cost of premiums.

50|$|<b>General</b> <b>Liability</b> <b>Insurance</b> is {{the kind}} of {{coverage}} that provides an individual with protection against variety of claims which may include bodily injuries, physical damage to car, property damage etc arising from business operations. <b>General</b> <b>Liability</b> <b>Insurance</b> (GP) covers a number of businesses and the norms of insurance may vary from company to company as well as area to area. Many of the public and product liability risks are often covered together under a general liability policy. These risks may include bodily injury or property damage caused by direct or indirect actions of the insured.|$|E
5000|$|Negligence on {{the part}} of {{insurance}} brokers can have severe effects upon clients when they discover their insurance coverage is worthless, which in turn illustrates why retaining a competent insurance broker is so important. In one case, Near North Entertainment Insurance Services provided alternative rock band Third Eye Blind with a commercial <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> (CGL) <b>insurance</b> policy that excluded coverage for the [...] "entertainment business." [...] After insurance coverage for a lawsuit was denied because Third Eye Blind was and is, after all, in the entertainment business, the California Court of Appeal ruled in a published opinion that the broker had a duty to advise the band it needed something more than a basic CGL policy.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} guest {{editorial}} is {{to place}} the issues discussed at the Seminar 1 —and specifically those concerning the insurance coverage of corporate liability risks—in context. I {{would like to do}} this by discussing some of the history of corporate <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> in the United States, and comparing the manner in which insurance problems and challenges developed in the past to what is happening today. Of course, history never exactly repeats itself. But {{it is also true that}} almost nothing is ever entirely new. Therefore, what I find is that there are both parallels between the current situation and the past, and differences between the past and the present. The first part of this editorial looks at the history of corporate insurance in the United States over the past 30 years. This is a history of both <b>insurance</b> against <b>liability</b> for bodily injury and property damage, and of <b>insurance</b> against <b>liability</b> for corporate wrongdoing that results in financial losses. Thus, the two main subjects are Commercial <b>General</b> <b>Liability</b> (CGL) <b>insurance</b> and Directors & Officers (D&O) insurance. Three factors causing instability in the pas...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{businesses}} insure against myriad risks, patent {{litigation is}} often excluded from their <b>general</b> commercial <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policy. Companies understand that patent litigation {{is an expensive}} ordeal, and some opt for specialized patent insurance. However, most businesses do not carry such protection because it is too costly. This is unfortunate because some studies suggest that patent insurance fosters research and development among small-to-medium sized enterprises. Following this finding, the European Commission called on CJA Consultants to study the feasibility of a mandatory, EU-wide patent insurance scheme in early 2003. In 2006, CJA Consultants concluded that such a scheme was feasible. This Note analyzes the mandatory patent insurance scheme proposed by CJA Consultants and considers whether a similar scheme could be implemented in the United States. First, the Note provides a background on patent insurance. Then, actual policy specimens from a patent insurer are analyzed to explain the differing types of insurance, their costs, and their shortcomings. Ultimately, the CJA Consultants’ proposal is analyzed and compared to the identified shortcomings. The Note concludes that a mandatory U. S. patent insurance scheme would fail...|$|R
5000|$|An owner {{controlled}} {{insurance program}} (OCIP) is {{an insurance policy}} held by a property owner during the construction or renovation of a property, which is typically designed to cover virtually all liability and loss arising from the construction project (subject to the usual exclusions). The policy package usually contains, at a minimum, Commercial <b>General</b> <b>Liability</b> (CGL), excess <b>insurance,</b> workers compensation (WC) and employers liability (for regular civil actions arising from WC injuries). Depending on the project, there may be endorsements providing additional coverage such as Contractors Pollution Liability (CPL), Builders Risk Insurance, terrorism insurance and umbrella insurance. OCIPs are also frequently referred to as [...] "wrap-up insurance" [...] or [...] "wrap policies" [...] in the insurance industry.|$|R
50|$|A {{business}} owner’s policy (also businessowner’s policy, {{business owners}} policy or BOP) {{is a special}} type of commercial insurance designed for small and medium-sized businesses. By bundling <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> and property insurance into a single policy, BOPs typically offer a reduced premium, often making them a more cost-effective option than separately purchased policies.|$|E

5000|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} {{over whether the}} damage will be covered under the {{insurance}} policies for home insurance or <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> In March 2010, a New Orleans judge ruled that the damage was covered under a home insurance policy. It is unknown whether the <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> will cover the claims. The standard policy contained an exception to an exclusion for pollution which allowed coverage if the pollution came from {{the products of the}} insured, but insurers had revised the policies to incorporate a [...] "total pollution exclusion" [...] which has no exception. Even without a total pollution exclusion, around 2005 insurers began inserting another provision to deny construction defect claims. Whether or not insurance coverage will be granted generally depends on state law and a state court's interpretation, but in this case may be determined for multiple states under the Louisiana multiple district litigation (MDL) overseen by a federal court.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{personal}} {{injury in the}} sense of [...] "bodily injury" [...] to others is often covered by <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> Most businesses carry commercial <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> policies. Different states have different rules regarding auto insurance, but generally, a driver's <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is available to compensate others whom that driver may inadvertently injure, and uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is available to compensate the driver for injuries inflicted upon the driver by someone else. Therefore, an insurance company will provide a legal defense to the defendant and may settle with the plaintiff (victim).|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} fifteen years there has been {{substantial}} insurance coverage litigation as employers have attempted to secure coverage under their <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> program for employment-related practices liabilities. In recognition of this significant development of a body of law, and growing out of an American Bar Association Annual Meeting panel discussion in which I participated, the Western New England Law Review published a Symposium in 1996 entitled, Insurance Coverage of Employment Disputes. Employers continue to seek insurance coverage for these liabilities under their traditional <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policies, but the situation has dramatically changed in the past several years. On the one hand, insurers have almost uniformly adopted exclusionary language in <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> policies to preclude coverage for these claims; on the other hand, approximately eighty insurance companies are now aggressively competing to market an insurance product designed specifically to cover this risk: Employment Practices <b>Liability</b> <b>Insurance</b> (‘EPLI‘). Therefore, only three years later it is necessary to revisit this area of law with another Symposium issue...|$|R
5000|$|Whether or not <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> covers {{construction}} defects or [...] "faulty workmanship" [...] is {{a matter}} of some debate, as some insurers have viewed poor workmanship as a risk that is covered by a surety bond rather than an insurance policy given that a construction professional may have some influence (through attention to detail, skill, and effort) over whether such a defect occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1984 and 1986, <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> {{premiums}} increased 200 {{percent or}} more for {{one out of four}} charitable nonprofit organizations in California. During that same period, insurance companies canceled or refused to renew the general liability policies of one out of five California charitable nonprofits. Some important human service programs, such as childcare, foster care, group homes and health service were forced to dramatically cut services or close because they couldn’t find affordable insurance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary reason}} for {{professional}} liability coverage is that a typical <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policy will only respond to a bodily injury, property damage, personal injury or advertising injury claim. Other forms of insurance cover employers, public and product liability. But various professional services and products can give rise to legal claims without causing any of the specific types of harm covered by such policies. Common claims that professional liability insurance covers are negligence, misrepresentation, violation of good faith and fair dealing, and inaccurate advice. Examples: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} 2 ̆ 2 {{advertising}} injury 2 ̆ 2 coverage in <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> policies has been shrinking {{in response to}} the proliferation of liabilities caused by the growth of the cyber-economy. In response to this shrinking coverage under <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> policies, insurers have been quick to develop new endorsements and specialized products to fill the gaps in coverage. The author argues that significant commercial risks relating to unfair competition claims have been eliminated from coverage under <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> policies, but that there also appears to be no corresponding development of specific endorsements or stand-alone products to deal with this gap in coverage. Specifically, claims against former employees who establish a competing enterprise are unlikely to be covered under the newest revisions of language in <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> policies. The author notes that these liabilities can be crippling to a new enterprise, and suggests that these new enterprises may be surprised to find that these commercial liabilites are not covered by their <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> package...|$|R

40|$|A {{continuing}} {{dispute is}} occurring regarding {{the definition of}} 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 in the 2 ̆ 2 sudden and accidental 2 ̆ 2 exception to the pollution exclusion clause of the standard Comprehensive <b>General</b> <b>Liability</b> (CGL) <b>insurance</b> policies of the 1970 s and early 1980 s. One prevailing {{view is that the}} term 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 is not ambiguous, has a temporal aspect meaning 2 ̆ 2 abrupt, 2 ̆ 2 and thus the potential application of the exception is limited. Another prevailing view is that the term 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 is ambiguous because it has more than one meaning and therefore under insurance law doctrines requires the issue be resolved in favor of the plaintiff insured. A third still developing view has asked the courts to not rely on the definition of 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 but to determine the issue through regulatory estoppel. The New York Court of Appeals in Northville Industries v. National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, a case of first impression, inadequately determined the meaning of 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 in the pollution exclusion clause by not providing guidance for future legislation. Thus the case thwarts the very purpose of the clause: limiting environmental liability...|$|R
5000|$|Excess of loss contracts, {{like those}} {{commonly}} used for umbrella and <b>general</b> <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> or to insure against property losses, will typically {{have a low}} ratio of premium paid to maximum loss recoverable. This ratio (expressed as a percentage), commonly called the [...] "rate on line" [...] for historical reasons related to underwriting practices at Lloyd's of London, will typically be low for contracts that contain reasonably self-evident risk transfer. As the ratio increases to approximate {{the present value of}} the limit of coverage, self-evidence decreases and disappears.|$|E
50|$|Workers' {{compensation}} {{also does}} not cover intangible torts that merely cause emotional distress. During the 1980s, as U.S. employees began to obtain jury verdicts against their employers more frequently {{on the basis of}} such torts, ISO revised the Commercial <b>General</b> <b>Liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policy form to exclude coverage for torts related to the employer-employee relationship like racial or gender discrimination in the workplace, as well as liability for negligent supervision of midlevel managers who committed such torts. It soon became evident that U.S. employers were strongly interested in obtaining some kind of insurance coverage for such torts, which resulted in the development of Employment Practices Liability (EPL) insurance in the U.S. market.|$|E

40|$|Newspapers, magazines, and {{academic}} journals have focused public {{attention on the}} <b>general</b> crisis in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> The medical malpractice insurance crisis has polarized {{the positions of the}} insurance and legal communities.
