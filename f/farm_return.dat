Furthermore, beef farms have a larger marginal effect compared to grain farms on the probability of the farmer being highly creditworthy.

40|$|Due to {{a rising}} {{interest}} in natural fibres for textiles {{as well as}} environmental concerns, the demand for fibre flax has increased in recent decades. It was, therefore, with great enthusiasm that Canadian farmers welcomed, in 1997, {{the opening of a}} flaxprocessing unit in the region of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the economic viability of fibre flax contracting as an alternative activity for field-crop producers in Quebec. A risk-programming model called minimization of total absolute deviation (MOTAD) was developed to better approach this issue. The MOTAD takes into account the variability in income that stems from uncertainty in commodity-market prices and yields. In addition, five different marketing strategies for pricing grain corn and soybeans were included in the model. These pricing techniques combined the use of futures and options markets. In a global agricultural system, where international commitments force governments to cut subsidies, reducing income variability for risk-averse farmers becomes a critical challenge. This study offered to assess the contribution of both contracting and futures markets as alternative market instruments for risk management. Five portfolio farm plans were identified for 200 - and 300 -hectare farm sizes. The results showed that gains through fibre flax contracting, in terms of risk reduction, exist only for the farm plans with lower levels of income and risk.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analytical}} model able {{to represent the}} decisions of an individual risk averse farmer facing variability in both prices and yields. A comprehensive set of stylised risk reducing policy measures is represented. A calibration of the model is used to run Monte-Carlo simulations and to obtain optimal responses. The main focus is the interaction between policy measures and market strategies in terms of impacts on production, welfare and risk. Risk reducing strategies that cover different sources of risk, such as price and yield variability, may be complementary for the farmers. Counter-cyclical area payments create incentives to bring land into production and their capacity to reduce farming risk is mitigated by the potential crowding out of substitutive market strategies. They {{are found to be}} more transfer efficient in terms of profit, but the impact on the farmer's welfare depends on the trade-off between optimal <b>farm</b> <b>return</b> and farm income variability reflected in the farmer's risk aversion. The policy package set up by the government matters because measures interact between each other, particularly when market mechanisms are available. In general, it is found that market mechanisms are better suited for reducing the relevant risk of farmers. Optimal policy mix crucially depends on the government objective, and there can be a trade off between risk reduction and farmers' welfare. risk, welfare, policy, insurance, counter-cyclical, Agricultural and Food Policy, Risk and Uncertainty, D 81, Q 12,...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Approaches to {{reducing}} irrigation inputs to crops {{have been studied}} for the past 50 to 60 years in research settings. Fewer efforts {{have been made to}} document limited irrigation responses over a number of seasons on commercial fields. This study compared farm−based irrigation management (FARM) with best management practices (BMP), late initiation of irrigation (LATE), and a restricted allocation (ALLOC). These irrigation management strategies each occupied 1 / 8 of a center pivot system in southwest Nebraska in continuous corn production, on four cooperating farms, which were replicated at the same sites for 3 to 6 years. Irrigation variables were achieved by irrigating or not irrigating, or by speeding up or slowing down the center pivot. When the grain yields and irrigation amounts were normalized each year using the FARM treatment as the basis, on average for three of four locations, the BMP treatment yielded equal to the FARM treatment, the LATE treatment yielded 93 % of the FARM treatment and the ALLOC yielded 84 % of the FARM treatment. At the same time, it took 76 % and 57 % of the water for the LATE and ALLOC treatments, respectively, to achieve these yields. The adjusted gross returns (yield price – irrigation treatment costs) of the irrigation treatments were analyzed for each location. When the gross returns were normalized using the FARM treatment as the basis, FARM and BMP returns were equal across combinations of high and low input commodity prices and pumping costs. The LATE treatment gross return was 95 % of <b>FARM</b> <b>return.</b> The gross return for the ALLOC treatment was 85 % to 91 % of the FARM treatment.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} the cause of most weather related externalities. Its effects are more evident on the environment, food security, human health, human settlements, {{economic}} activities, natural resources and physical infrastructure. This study assessed the economic impacts of climate change with a special focus on maize production. It examined the role of socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics in determining maize net revenue, the marginal impact of changes in climate variables and projected climate change impact on net revenue from maize enterprise due to future changes in climate in the sub-humid and semi-arid areas of Tanzania. The study utilized cross-sectional household data collected by the National Bureau of Statistics under its National Panel Survey in 2011 / 2012 from which 323 households were randomly sampled. Both descriptive and econometric methods were used to analyze the data. The Ricardian model was employed {{to assess the impact of}} climate change on maize production and in the model net revenue per hectare was regressed against a set of climate variables, socio-economic and biophysical variables using a two stage least square estimation method so as to address the problem of correlation between the dependent variable error term and the independent variables for the sub humid and semi-arid areas and across all farms. Results from the analysisindicated that household size and education of the household headpositivelyimpacted net <b>farm</b> <b>return</b> from maize production. Also it revealed that temperature and rainfall (p < 0. 01) will negatively impact net revenue. Basing on the CMIP 5 for Tanzania using the Mid-Century Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8. 5 the predicted future climate change will adversely impact net revenue from maize production in the sub-humid and semi-arid areas of Tanzania by the year 2050. Therefore investing in new technologies and adequate extension information services are recommended from this study so as to increase farmers‟ adaptive capacity to reduce the impact of climate change on maize production.

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} develop and apply a model to optimally allocate a limited water supply throughout one irrigation season. ^ The study was developed for the Al Kharj District which is representative of other parts of the country. Large, medium, and small representative farms in this district were used to analyze the various production scenarios. The farms were assumed to be comprised of 755, 60, and 6. 9 hectares. Linear programing models were developed using each representative farm as the economic unit, and maximization of net <b>farm</b> <b>return</b> as the objective function. Information obtained from the representative farms were then expanded to determine the optimum allocation of water resources for the whole area. The results represent the short-run response of farmers to the prevailing production constraints. This farm-level optimization model was developed to maximize net returns through the selection of crop mix. The effect of growing wheat on farmers net returns was evaluated using parametric programing. Sensitivity analysis on base line solutions indicated that net returns may be sensitive to the irrigated area cultivated by wheat. The most pervasive response of reducing wheat irrigated areas was the increase in the high value product irrigated areas. ^ Results of this research indicated that significant opportunities exist for conserving water in irrigated agriculture. In the setting of this analysis, large reductions in water use can be obtained by constraining irrigated wheat land and farmers net returns increased by growing high value products like tomatoes, cucumbers and onions. Results derived from this analysis provide recommendations to policy makers and planners as well as farmers and farm managers in the Al Kharj District specifically and in Saudi Arabia in general. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} restoration required by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan calls for more water-storage on lands south of Lake Okeechobee in order to restore the natural water flows of the Everglades watershed. The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) can be used for increased water storage in order to relieve coastal estuaries of excess water in the rainy season. This water storage can deliver additional ecosystem services of soil retention and reduced CO 2 emissions that could compensate farmers for the cost of water storage by increasing long term farm profitability. The goals of this study were 1) to quantify the environmental and economic trade-offs of different water storage scenarios using water-tolerant sugarcane cultivars, and 2) to quantify the amount of water storage possible in the EAA under different water storage scenarios. A mathematical model was developed to calculate soil depth, soil subsidence, depth to the water table, sugarcane production, <b>farm</b> <b>return,</b> water storage and carbon loss for three different sugarcane cultivars with different water-tolerances. A GIS tool is also developed to estimate the amount of water storage possible in the EAA. The study found that even though water-tolerant sugarcane cultivars experience higher yields and net returns than non-water-tolerant cultivars the water storage costs with these water tolerant cultivars was greater. Raising water tables on farm lands did have the environmental benefits of reduced soil subsidence, extended farm life and increased years of water storage. However total CO 2 emissions rise from 14 to 136 %. Results of the GIS analysis revealed that water storage capacity for a DWT of 61 cm is 1, 404, 562 ac-ft, 1, 417, 400 ac-ft for DWT 45 cm and 1, 474, 692 ac-ft for DWT 20 cm. The GIS analysis was also able to identify flow ways that could possibly carry water south from Lake Okeechobee and ultimately to the WCAs south of the EAA. These results show that raising water tables in the EAA to deliver the ecosystem service of expanded water storage is overall more costly, but yearly costs are very low. Therefore water storage on farmlands is an affordable interim method of water storage...|$|E

40|$|Differences in farm returns were {{analysed}} technically and economically. The {{study was}} of 29 arable farms of about 33 ha in the North-East-Polder {{in the area}} Lake IJssel. The farms there are very similar in size, soil, field layout and original farm building. The remarkable difference was in the farmers themselves. Each farmer made his own decisions, and differences in them were responsible for differences in annual returns up to ƒ 50 000 in 1968 and up to ƒ 110 000 in 1969. The differences in returns were examined by factor analysis. An approach from economic theory and from practical considerations (Chap. 2) demonstrated that previous studies based on farm accounts gave only a rough indication of causes, {{because of a lack}} of detailed technical information on the farms. It also showed that the farmer himself plays an important role and may even determine the farm returns. The research was therefore based on two principles. First very detailed information was needed on differences in growth and development of crops and on environmental conditions on each farm. Second the search was concentrated on the relation between the differences in farmer's decisions and the corresponding differences, for instance, in physical yields per ha and in work organization. The data were sampled in 1968 / 1969 and 1969 / 1970. The weather in both years was roughly the 'normal average'. The analysis of the farm returns (Chap. 3) shows that in 1968 61 % and in 1969 76 % of the variance in net revenue per ha has a positive relationship with that of the gross returns per ha. In both years, there was a positive relationship of the net revenue per ha with the physical yields of ca 30 - 36 % and with the product prices of 25 - 31 % in 1968 and of 44 % in 1969. The variance in cropping plan 'explained' in 1968 9 % and in 1969 15 % of the variance in net revenue per ha. The variance in the costs, especially of labour, was in 1968 connected with 17 % of the variance in net revenue per ha. In the extremely good (prices!) year 1969, no connection was found between costs and net revenue. Net returns were not so much related to factors characterizing farm organization (e. g. costs, cropping plan), but rather to factors in the day-to-day management. Thus the farmer was the determining factor in the circumstances of the farm. For this first analysis, only farm accounts were used. Since very detailed technical information had been sampled differences could he analysed in work organization of each farm and in physical yield per ha of each of four crops winter wheat, sugar-beet, seed potatoes, and ware potatoes (Chap. 5). For the whole group of farms, the variance in costs of work organization (labour, machinery, contract operators) showed only a slight relationship with <b>farm</b> <b>return.</b> Work organization formed a large part in the total costs of a farm so it was analysed in detail. The efficiency of work organization was expressed in the operational costs per work unit (which are the real costs per farm of labour, machinery and contract operators related to standard costs). The operational costs per farm differed up to about f 20 000 (av. ca f 47 500). Four factors 'explain' about 95 % of the variance in efficiency of work organization in both years. Two factors in long-term decisions characterize farm organization: (1) supply of labour in relation to an amount of manual work required, (2) amount of farm equipment in relation to a norm for machine use. They 'explain' 60 - 65 % of the variance in operational costs per work unit. On most farms, too much labour and machinery were available for the work that had to he done. Two other factors in short-term decisions were the intensity of use of the labour supply and of the equipment. These 'explained' 30 - 35 % of the variance in operational costs per work unit. There was only a little difference in factor pattern between years of the differences in work organization. Thus most of the farmers had difficulty in balancing work organization on their farm, especially in long-term decisions. For the four crops the physical yields per ha differed in both years up to ca 1800 kg per ha for winter wheat (av. ca 5350 kg/ha), up to ca 18 000 kg per ha for sugar-beet (av. ca 60 000 kg/ha) and also up to ca 19 000 kg per ha for ware potatoes (av. ca 52 500 kg/ha) and even for seed potatoes (av. ca 32 000 kg/ha). The analyses show that of each crop (Chap. 5) about 90 % of the variance in physical yield per ha is 'explained' by 10 or 12 factors'. Of these 10 or 12 factors per crop there is a group of 8 or 10 factors occurring in both years. The pattern of factors was therefore similar between years. This group of 8 or 10 factors 'explains' ca 60 - 85 % of the variance in physical yields of each crop. In both years for each crop, the greatest part (ca 55 - 90 %) of the variance in physical yield per ha had already originated in the initial period of growth. Most of the factors separated could be influenced directly by the farmer (e. g. sowing depth, N dressing). Some 'result' factors were separated too. They are the results of recent farmer's decisions and actions or of the field's 'history' (i. e. feed back processes in arable farming such as green manuring, damage to soil structure). The factors separated for winter wheat concerned differences in tillage and cropping, and crop characteristics in the autumn and following spring; for both seed and ware potatoes, factors during sprouting, tillage and cropping in spring (e. g. preparation of seed tubers and seedbed); for sugar-beet factors concerned the decisions and actions in the sowing period (e. g. sowing depth, N dressing). Thus a great part of the variance in physical yield per ha could be ascribed to differences in the farmer's technical competence as expressed in their decisions and actions. The relationship of the farmer's competence with physical yields of his crops is suggested by the similarity of the groups of farmers that had high or low yields in the two Years. A survey of the three elements of the learning process of the farmer [...] knowledge, experience and discernment [...] shows that the farmer's competence is based mainly on his capacity to think about the growth and development processes of the crops (Chap. 6). His ability to regulate crop-growth factors (average growth per day and length of the growing period) against the background of economic, technical and social conditions on and off the farm. The learning process of the farmer is not static. It does not end when he leaves school but is dynamic, continuing through his life as an entrepreneur. Further the critical points in the farmer's decision-making process were analysed, in particular the phases of observation, of assessment and of the final decision in the aspects of management examined in detail: work organization and crop growing. The farmer's role in these phases (establishing goals in relation to observation, assessing alternative strategies and chosing the best alternative) is described. This analysis indicates that the farmer's willingness to criticize his own decisions and actions and to continue learning are fundamental in keeping the enterprise profitable. The analysis of data from the farms and analysis of the learning and decision-making process of the farmer provide elements for a reconsideration of the education and assistance offered to present and future farmers. Some proposals are made for developing and sharpening his ability to observe, assess and make decisions during school education, by visiting the best farmers, for instance, when the critical decisions have to be made in the field. In combination with theoretical lessons in school, the proposals should encourage the development of discernment to practical problems in the budding farmer. After leaving school periodic brief, but intensive, courses on topics concerning the farm itself and its part in the community could equip the modern farmer for his task. The farmer's competence in external management is emphasized, e. g. dealing with tax advisers, bookkeepers and farm cooperatives. A proposal is made for finding the critical points in crop growing in order to provide more selective advice to the farmers. The same procedure can be followed as in this investigation and critical points can be detected in the crop growing methods of farmers in each region. This would provide a basis for the working plan of an advisory service. The importance of advice on these points lies in the improvement most farmers could make in input-output ratios of crops on their farms. In the last section of Chap. 6, the entrepreneurship in a typical Dutch arable farming is analysed. After summarizing the analysis of all aspects of farm management, the conclusions remain as foreseen. Though other elements cannot be ignored, the farmer undoubtly needs to develop his ability at growing crops by taking account of the technical, economic and social conditions...|$|E
40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the impact of wastewater use in agriculture. It mainly focused on three aspects of wastewater use for irrigation and their policy implications: impact on crop production and productivity; its impact on the health of farmers; and the value attached to its safe use for irrigation. The main objectives of the study were, therefore, 1) to define the farming system of wastewater farmers and to analyze the impact of wastewater on crop productivity; 2) to analyze the prevalence of the actual health risks to farmers and estimate the health costs associated with the use of wastewater in irrigation; and 3) to estimate the farmer?s willingness to pay for improved or safe use of wastewater for crop production. This study used mainly primary data collected from a household survey conducted on 415 wastewater and freshwater farm households operating irrigated agricultural activities within and around Addis Ababa, a central region of Ethiopia. A Cobb Douglas production function is specified to analyze the impact of wastewater on crop productivity. The production function was estimated using a Censored Least Absolute Deviation (CLAD) econometric model. To analyze the health impact of wastewater, the probability of illness was estimated based on the theory of the utility maximizing behavior of households subject to the conventional farm household production model modified by adding a health production function. The economic value of safe use of wastewater is estimated from data obtained from a contingent valuation survey administered by in-person interviews. A dichotomous choice model is used to elicit the farmers? willingness to pay. Bivariate probit and interval regression models are used to analyze the factors determining the farmers? willingness to pay for safe use of wastewater for crop production. The study shows that the livelihoods of wastewater farm households depend on the wastewater farm. Income from a wastewater farm accounts for 62 % of total annual household income, ranging from 27 % to 97 %. About 61 % of the vegetable market of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia with more than five million people, is produced from the wastewater farms. Leafy vegetables, which are eaten raw, are mainly produced in less polluted wastewater farms and root vegetables are produced in more polluted wastewater farms. The study revealed that wastewater farm households use significantly less doses of chemical fertilizer compared to the freshwater irrigators. However, they spend three times more on seed and five times more on farm labor. Net <b>farm</b> <b>return</b> per hectare of plots irrigated with wastewater is significantly higher than for plots irrigated with freshwater. The results also indicate that the predicted median output value per hectare is significantly higher in wastewater irrigated plots compared to plots irrigated with freshwater. The CLAD estimation result shows that higher productivity of wastewater plots is explained by investments in inputs (organic fertilizer, improved seed and agricultural extension services), ownership of plots and levels of pollution of the irrigation water. The overall effect of wastewater on crop productivity is negative and insignificant (compared to freshwater). Plots irrigated with less polluted wastewater are more productive than plots irrigated with more polluted wastewater. The implication of the result is that even if wastewater is a reliable source of irrigation water and contains essential plant nutrients such as NPK, the nutrient content exceeds the recommended level of the plant requirement (e. g. nitrogen) or it contains toxic elements (e. g. nickel, zinc) above the recommended limit, and thereby reduce yield. Due to unsafe wastewater irrigation systems, wastewater use in irrigation actually poses health risks to farmers. Apart from working on wastewater farms, different risk factors prevail that can cause wastewater-related diseases in the studied areas. This study shows that major risk factors causing illness are household demographic characteristics, hygienic behavior of farm families and poor access to sanitation services. Lack of awareness on health risk of wastewater as well as working without protective clothing on the farm are also important risk factors in the study area. The distribution of these risk factors varies between the wastewater and freshwater irrigation areas. The most common incidence of illness reported by farm households are intestinal infection due to hookworm and Ascaris, diarrhea and skin diseases, which also varies between the two groups of farmers as well as within the different areas of wastewater. The findings of this study show that the prevalence of illness is not only significantly higher in farmers working on wastewater farms compared to freshwater irrigators, but is also significantly higher in wastewater areas where the pollution level is higher. The probability of being sick with an intestinal illness is 15 % higher for wastewater farmers than for freshwater farmers. Use of protective clothing during farm work and awareness of health risks in working on wastewater farms significantly reduce illness prevalence. In addition, hygienic behavior of farm families including eating safe raw vegetables, compound sweeping, and washing hands before a meal are important determinants of illness prevalence in wastewater irrigation areas. Therefore, use and provision of protective clothing at affordable prices, creating awareness for safe use of wastewater, and reducing the pollution level of irrigation water can significantly decrease the health risk of wastewater use in irrigation. While each of these policy interventions has a significant effect in reducing health risks, combining these measures will result in more significant reduction of health risks to farmers, and thereby maximize the benefit from the wastewater resource as a source of livelihood and vegetable supply to the residents of nearby cities. Farmers are willing to contribute money to improve the existing unsafe irrigation system. Two options were suggested by farmers to improve the existing situation: enforcing laws against polluters who discharge their wastewater without any kind of treatment, and awareness creation of safe use of wastewater for irrigation. Farmers are willing to pay for the improvement programs and there is a welfare gain to the society from safe use of wastewater for crop production. The benefit from irrigated-farming, membership to water users? association, yield value, off-farm income and working on a wastewater farm all significantly determine the farmers? probability of accepting offered bids for the improvement program. In addition to these variables, multi-purpose uses of irrigation water as well as education level determines the farmers? willingness to pay. Irrigation method has no significant effect on the farmers? willingness to pay, implying that introducing water saving and improved irrigation techniques has an important role in improving the situation without affecting the farmers? willingness to pay. Overall, this study shows that wastewater is a means of livelihood for many poor households, but the existing use of wastewater for crop production actually causes health risks both to farmers and consumers. Farmers are willing to contribute to programs designed to improve the existing situation so that it is possible to maximize the livelihood benefit at minimum health risks. However, the results do not necessarily imply that the cost of improving the situation has to be borne by the farmers only. Although the study focuses on the central region of Ethiopia, most conclusions can have a wider application in other parts of the country and in many sub-Saharan African countries where wastewater is used for irrigation. Ziel der Studie ist es, die Auswirkungen von Abwassernutzung in der Landwirtschaft zu analysieren. Die Arbeit richtet ihren Focus dabei hauptsächlich auf drei Aspekte der Auswirkungen von Abwassernutzung: die Auswirkungen auf die Pflanzenproduktion und deren Produktivität, die Auswirkungen auf die Gesundheit der Landwirte, sowie auf den Wert einer sicheren Nutzung des Abwassers zur Bewässerung. Die spezifischen Ziele der Studie sind 1) die Abwasser nutzenden Anbausysteme zu definieren und die Auswirkungen der Abwassernutzung auf die Produktivität zu analysieren; 2) die Auswirkungen der Abwassernutzung auf die Gesundheitsrisiken der Landwirte zu analysieren und die dadurch anfallenden Kosten abzuschätzen; und 3) die Zahlungsbereitschaft der Landwirte für eine verbesserte oder sichere Nutzung von Abwässern in der Pflanzenproduktion abzuschätzen. Die Studie nutzt im Wesentlichen Primärdaten aus einer Haushaltserhebung von 415 landwirtschaftlichen Haushalten bei Addis Ababa (Zentral-Äthiopien), die Abwasser und Frischwasser zur Bewässerung verwenden. Eine Cobb-Douglas-Produktionsfunktion wurde spezifiziert, um die Auswirkungen der Abwassernutzung auf die Produktivität zu analysieren, sie wurde mit Hilfe eines ökonometrischen Censored Least Absolute Deviation (CLAD) Modells geschätzt. Um Auswirkungen auf die Gesundheit abzuschätzen, wurde die Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Erkrankung unter Verwendung einer erweiterten Theorie des nutzenmaximierenden Haushalts durch eine Gesundheitsproduktionsfunktion geschätzt. Der ökonomische Wert der sichereren Nutzung von Abwässern wurde über eine Contingent Value-Analyse von Daten aus persönlichen Interviews geschätzt. Ein Double-Bounded Dichotomes Choice Modell wurde genutzt, um die Zahlungsbereitschaft der Landwirte festzustellen. Bivariate Probit- und Intervall-Regressionsmodelle wurde genutzt, um die Einflussfaktoren auf Zahlungsbereitschaft der Landwirte für eine sichere Nutzung von Abwässern zur Pflanzenproduktion zu ermitteln. Die Studie zeigt, dass das Haushaltseinkommen zu wesentlichen Teilen aus der Landwirtschaft stammt. Für die Haushalte, die Abwasser für die landwirtschaftliche Produktion nutzen, beträgt das aus landwirtschaftlichen Quellen stammende Einkommen ca. 61 % des Gesamteinkommens, mit einer Spannweite zwischen 27 % und 97 %. Ungefähr 61 % des Gemüsemarktes von Addis Ababa, der Hauptstadt Äthiopiens mit mehr als 5 Millionen Einwohnern, werden durch Betriebe bereitgestellt, die Abwässer zur Pflanzenproduktion nutzen. Roh verzehrtes Blattgemüse wird im Gegensatz zu Wurzelgemüse meist in weniger mit Abwasser belasteten Gebieten angebaut. Die Studie ergab, dass Abwasser nutzende Betriebe signifikant geringere Mengen an chemischen Düngern nutzen als Betriebe, die mit Frischwasser bewässern. Jedoch geben sie drei Mal soviel Geld für Saatgut und fünf Mal soviel für Arbeitskräfte aus. Der Nettoertrag pro Hektar auf den mit Abwasser bewässerten Parzellen ist signifikant höher als auf Parzellen, die mit Frischwasser bewässert wurden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass auch der mit Hilfe des ökonometrischen Modells vorausgesagte mediane Ertragswert pro Hektar bei mit Abwässern bewässerten Parzellen signifikant höher ist als auf Parzellen, die mit Frischwasser bewässert wurden. Die Ergebnisse des CLAD-Modells zeigen, dass die höhere Produktivität der Abwässer-Parzellen mit dem Aufwand an Inputs (organischer Dünger, verbessertes Saatgut und landwirtschaftliche Beratungsdienste), mit den Besitzverhältnissen an den Parzellen und der Höhe der Verschmutzung des Wassers erklärt werden kann. Der Gesamteffekt von Abwasser auf die Produktivität ist negativ und nicht signifikant. Parzellen, die mit weniger verschmutztem Wasser bewässert werden sind produktiver als Parzellen mit stärker verschmutzem Abwasser. Daraus lässt sich folgern, dass, auch wenn das Abwasser wichtige Pflanzennährstoffe wie NPK enthält, diese die benötigte Menge jedoch übersteigen (z. B bei Stickstoff) oder, dass toxische Elemente (z. B. Nickel, Zink) oberhalb der empfohlenen Grenzen liegen, so dass das Pflanzenwachstum negativ beeinflusst wird und der Ertrag reduziert wird. Aufgrund gefährlicher Abwasser-Bewässerungssysteme verursacht Abwasser Gesundheitsrisiken für Landwirte. Abgesehen von der Tatsache, dass sie überhaupt auf solchen Betrieben arbeiten, zeigten sich verschiedene andere Risikofaktoren, die mit dem Abwasser zusammenhängende Krankheiten bewirken können. Die Studie zeigt, dass die Hauptrisikofaktoren die demographischen Charakteristika der Haushalte, das Hygieneverhalten der Familien und ein schlechter Zugang zu sanitären Einrichtungen sind. Zudem sind mangelndes Problembewusstsein sowie das Arbeiten ohne Schutzkleidung wichtige Einflussfaktoren im Untersuchungsgebiet. Die Verteilung dieser Faktoren variiert zwischen den Gebieten der Abwasser- und der Frischwassernutzung. Die am meisten auftretenden Erkrankungen sind die durch den Astaris- und den Hakenwurm verursachte intestinale Infektionen, Durchfall- und Hauterkrankungen, die wiederum zwischen den beiden Gruppen der Landwirte sowie den Abwassergebieten variieren. Die Studie zeigt, dass nicht nur Erkrankungen im Bereich abwassernutzender Areale häufiger sind, sondern dass die Zahl der Erkrankungen signifikant höher in Bereichen höherer Verschmutzung ist. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit an intestinalen Infektionen zu erkranken ist bei Abwassernutzern um 15 % höher als bei Frischwassernutzern. Schutzkleidung und verbessertes Risikobewusstsein senken die Krankheitswahrscheinlichkeit signifikant. Zudem sind Hygieneverhalten, das Essen von sicherem rohen Gemüse, das Fegen bzw. Reinigen des Hof-Geländes, sowie das Waschen der Hände vor dem Essen, wichtige Determinanten des Gesundheitsrisikos in abwassernutzenden Gebieten. Daher können das Anbieten und Nutzen von erschwinglicher Schutzkleidung, ein verbessertes Risikobewusstsein sowie Maßnahmen zur Reduzierung der Verunreinigung von Bewässerungswasser das Gesundheitsrisiko signifikant verringern. Während schon jede der genannten Maßnahmen selbst eine signifikante Verbesserung darstellt, würde eine Kombination dieser Maßnahmen das Gesundheitsrisiko noch deutlicher reduzieren und somit den Nutzen der Abwasseressource als Quelle des Lebensunterhalts und der Gemüseversorgung für die Anwohner der nahegelegenen Städte verbessern. Die Landwirte äußerten bei der Befragung die Bereitschaft einen finanziellen Beitrag zu einer größeren Sicherheit der Bewässerungssysteme zu leisten. Zwei Optionen wurden von ihnen zur Verbesserung vorgeschlagen: Die vorgeschriebene Abwasserbehandlung durch die Verursacher, und das Schaffen von Bewusstsein für einen sicheren Umgang mit Abwasser. Die Zahlungsbereitschaft der Landwirte für eine sichere Abwassernutzung bedeutet, dass eine Steigerung der Wohlfahrt möglich wäre. Die Höhe des Nutzens aus der Bewässerungslandwirtschaft, die Mitgliedschaft in Wassernutzungsgemeinschaften, der Wert des Ertrages, das Einkommen außerhalb der Landwirtschaft und die Frage, ob es sich um einen Abwasser nutzenden Betrieben handelt bestimmen signifikant die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Annahme der angebotenen Programme durch die Landwirte. Zusätzlich zu diesen Variablen bestimmt die Frage der Mehrfachnutzung des Bewässerungswassers und der Ausbildungsgrad der Landwirte die Zahlungsbereitschaft. Zusammenfassend zeigt die Studie, dass die Nutzung von Abwasser für viele arme Haushalte bedeutend für den Lebensunterhalt ist, dass jedoch die gegenwärtige Abwassernutzung Gesundheitsrisiken für Landwirte und für Konsumenten birgt. Die Landwirte sind bereit, für Programme zu bezahlen, die die Situation verbessern könnten, so dass es möglich wäre die Lebensbedingungen zu verbessern, bei verringertem Gesundheitsrisiko. Jedoch bedeuten die Ergebnisse nicht zwingend, dass die Kosten allein von den Landwirten getragen werden müssen. Obwohl sich die Studie auf Zentral-Äthiopien bezieht, können die meisten Erkenntnisse auf größere Teile des Landes und auf viele afrikanische Sub-Sahara Länder, in denen Abwasser zu Bewässerung genutzt wird, übertragen werden...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the dynamic relationships among variables including farm real estate values, <b>farm</b> <b>returns,</b> <b>farm</b> program payments, and real interest rates in an income capitalization model. Our analysis is unique in multiple ways: (1) it covers the period beginning with the introduction of the first farm bill in 1933 through 2006; (2) assumes endogeneity of the variables, and (3) develops a dynamic modeling framework. Endogeneity is assumed among farm real estate values, farm program payments, and farm receipts since the direction of causality is unclear from a theoretical standpoint. Results indicate that policy makers are reactive rather than pro-active in making transfers to farmers. Once farm program payments are implemented, payments have positive impacts only in the short run on the value of farm real estate. However, considering endogeneity, the model suggests that it is possible that farm program payments have a lasting positive indirect impact (via <b>farm</b> <b>returns)</b> on the value of farm real estate.
