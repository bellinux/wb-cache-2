A second festival known as Boun khao salak occurs directly after the conclusion of Boun khay padab din. During this period, food offerings are made to the hungry ghosts.|$|E

25|$|Although this {{mechanism}} is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, {{it can cause}} problems when inflammation <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> longer. Since the liver produces hepcidin in response to inflammatory cytokines, hepcidin levels can increase {{as the result of}} non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of anemia of chronic disease, in which not enough iron is available to produce enough hemoglobin-containing red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{most celebrated}} {{traditional}} Azerbaijani holiday is Novruz Bayram, {{which is the}} traditional celebration of the ancient New Year. Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, and contests of national sports. During the Soviet Union, celebration of Novruz was generally unofficial, and at times even prohibited. Since the independence of Azerbaijan, Novruz became an official public holiday. Usually preparation for Novruz begins a month prior to the festival. Each Tuesday of the forthcoming 4 weeks is devoted {{to one of the}} four elements - water, fire, earth and wind.|$|E

Tender goes wandering around, trying {{to meet up with}} Fertility, which he finally does in a men's bathroom where they've taken adjacent stalls. Adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill Tender's agent the same way he killed the caseworker, so that Tender would be suspect for both murders. Fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the Super Bowl, and comes up with a plan for Tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. Adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with Tender and Fertility. Agreed on their course of action, the three part.|$|E

25|$|The colony cycle for D. sylvestris is {{typically}} about 3.5 months and occurs from May through August or September. Colonies are often initiated in mid-May {{by a single}} queen who quickly begins building the nest, and laying eggs in the cells as she builds. She often completes three envelopes in a single week. These workers take about 2.5 to 3.5 weeks to develop to adults from eggs. About 40 worker eggs are produced in the nest at this stage, but some do not mature fully due to limitations in resources provided by the queen. After this stage, known as the queen colony, comes the stage where small cells are built and more workers and the first males are reared. This stage <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a few weeks, typically until late June. Around this time, construction of large cells that house the rearing process of queens and more males begins. These individuals emerge as adults around mid-July. The colony develops until {{around the end of}} August at which time all of the sexuals (reproducing males and queens) have left and the original queen is dead. The social structure of the nest now collapses and the workers that remain typically die soon due to starvation or old age. The queens that leave go into hibernation and begin new colonies the following May. In a single mature tree wasp colony there is an average of nearly 800 cells in the nest and a total of 400 small cell adults and 300 large cell adults.|$|E
25|$|La Réunion capitulates {{almost without}} loss after a landing by Army troops joined by sepoys under the British East India Company, {{all under the}} active and decisive Lieutenant Colonel Harry Keating, with ships of the convoy {{on both sides of}} the island. Their path is eased by Maturin's {{propaganda}} and political meetings to explain why the locals should be happy to accept the British, with Farquhar as interim Governor. Mauritius proves more challenging. Maturin has an accident boarding HMS Néréide, which is part of the force sent to Île de la Passe. He is seriously injured, so he observes Clonfert during this recuperation aboard. The action is successful. Maturin is put down on Mauritius to continue his work. A small group of ships, under the command of Captain Pym, puts soldiers on Mauritius to staff the fort. The French appear with three ships Bellone, Minerve, Victor and two Indiamen Ceylon and Windham. They boldly attack the fort and then sail into the port; the British are caught unprepared but decide to attack. The struggle <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> days with heavy casualties and in the end two British ships run aground. Sirius and Magicienne are burnt to prevent their capture, and Iphigenia and the fort at Île de la Passe are abandoned to be retaken by the French. Néréide is taken and Clonfert is severely wounded in the neck and head by a splinter. A messenger vessel, with Maturin aboard, reaches La Réunion to inform Aubrey of the losses and the failed attack on Port Southeast.|$|E

Krusty appears in a sketch called [...] "The Big Ear Family", and says that the sketch <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> twelve more minutes, even though the joke's punchline has already been established. That was Jon Vitti's way of criticizing Saturday Night Live for having overlong sketches with thin joke premises. The sequence originally had a longer version of the Tuesday Night Live band playing into the commercial break, but it was cut because Vitti, who was a writer on Saturday Night Live during the 1985–86 season along with fellow The Simpsons writers, George Meyer and John Swartzwelder, {{did not want to}} come off as being bitter.|$|E

Emery commented that while voicing the {{character}} of Balthier, he developed a [...] "small crush" [...] on Fran, Balthier's partner. He also commented that the biggest challenge of voicing Balthier was having to stay consistent, adding that he spent {{more than four hours}} in a small booth while doing the voice, which could cause him to [...] "drift away from the character" [...] if he <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> too long. He also described him as being similar to the character. Emery auditioned for Balthier, seeing him after he did this and [...] "instantly {{fell in love with the}} character". He described him as a cross between Han Solo, James Bond, and Jack Sparrow, citing suave yet cocky attitude. He was thankful that he was not aware of Balthier's popularity since his reveal, stating that he would have been [...] "crippled by the fear of not delivering on what the fans expected". He stated that he took no inspiration from anyone else for the role, wanting to ensure that he was unique. Instead, he cited the pictures and animation of the character as his inspiration. Emery cited Jack Fletcher, the voice director, as a great help in voicing the character and setting up the scene for him. To give Final Fantasy XII a Western feel, Balthier's movements were recorded by a Western motion capture actor.|$|E
