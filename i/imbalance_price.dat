40|$|International audienceThe {{ability to}} predict wind power {{production}} {{over the next}} few hours to days is prerequisites for the secure and economic operation of power systems with high wind power penetration. From {{the point of view of}} a producer participating in the day-ahead electricity market, lack of predictability at a wind power production site results in imbalance costs. This paper aims at quantifying the impact on market revenue of, respectively, the predictability and the capacity factor of a wind farm or a cluster of wind farms. This is done through a real-life case study in West Denmark, including wind farm production data and market data. Finally, we make a prospective analysis under the assumption that the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> settlement mechanism will remain the sam...|$|E
30|$|There {{are various}} studies in {{literature}} for hedging {{risks associated with}} wind uncertainty in DA markets. Authors in [1, 3, 8, 9] suggest bidding strategies for multiple short-term markets for wind units alone. In addition to this, coordinating wind units with different generation types are widely suggested in recent studies. In [8, 10, 11], pumped-storage and hydro-power units are proposed to complement the wind generation because of their capability to compensate imbalance power. There are other studies in [5, 12] that combine wind and thermal units to reduce imbalance penalties caused by wind deviations; however, they are not directly applicable to Turkish DA electricity market due to the different <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> mechanism. In addition to this, most of the previous research studied the wind-thermal coordination from an independent system operator (ISO) perspective [13, 14].|$|E

We review the biases of the Pool capacity payments design, the drought of investment following the introduction of NETA, and {{the reaction of the}} market during the first “stress-test” of NETA during the winter 2003. In an energy-only market such as NETA, it is essential that price signals are right and the system operator has a crucial role in contracting ahead for reserve. We recommend that NETA adopt a single marginal <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> as dual imbalance pricing distorts price signals in times of scarcity. The lack of long-term contracting that causes hedging and financing difficulties for power projects can be compensated by vertical and horizontal reintegration at a cost of increased market power. investment, electricity, market design, capacity payments...|$|E

40|$|Power systems {{require a}} {{continuous}} balance {{of supply and}} demand. In Europe, this task is shared between Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) and Transmission System Operators (TSOs). For this purpose, the European electricity sector consists of several markets. Objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate distorted incentives that stem from loopholes in the market design which BRPs can use to undermine electricity balancing principles in favour of gaming opportunities between the domestic <b>imbalance</b> energy <b>pricing</b> and international wholesale markets. These incentives are evaluated using historical data from the Swiss power system which features a typical European <b>imbalance</b> <b>pricing</b> mechanism. The results imply that little effort would have been needed to make a good profit at the expense of system security. The major loophole arises from the interdependence between cross-border trading and national <b>imbalance</b> energy <b>pricing.</b> Bearing in mind the European Union's Third Energy Package, the importance of national balancing mechanisms will increase strongly. In this context, national remedies to cope with distorted incentives are outlined and the importance of harmonising balancing markets on an international level is elaborated...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} {{of a large}} amount of distributed generation (DG) technologies with intermittent output, such as photovoltaic installations and wind turbines, yields an important challenge to the electric grid. It is believed that aggregating them with controllable technologies such as cogeneration devices (CHP) can help to balance fluctuations of renewable energy. This work evaluates the ability of a virtual power plant (VPP) to reduce the imbalance error of renewable generators. The study is undertaken in a VPP that consists of several cogeneration devices and photovoltaic (PV) installations. The virtual power plant operator bids electricity into the day-ahead market using the forecast for solar irradiation and for the thermal demand. During the actual day, the imbalance due to deviations between the forecasted electricity delivered and the real output has to be settled in the balancing market. Thus, in order to compensate these errors and possible economic drawbacks, the operation of the CHP is adjusted periodically in a so called reschedule. Two different rescheduling strategies are compared against a ‘reference scenario’ in which the imbalance error is settled in the market. The first one (‘forced strategy’) aims at reducing the imbalance error every time step regardless of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices.</b> The second (‘economic strategy’) considers the <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> and takes only action if it is economically appropriate and thus intends to reduce the total operational cost. The results show that the rescheduling technique is able to reduce the imbalance error (up to 90 % depending on the season and the strategy). Additionally, the total operational cost is estimated. However, the nowadays <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> only lead to a minor financial advantage that is unlikely to motivate real life operators to perform a rescheduling strategy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the {{potential}} use of electricity storage to smooth fluctuations in supply and demand, we study {{the problem of}} writing American-type call options when the holder’s exercise strategy is of threshold type (so that the time of exercise is known, but random). The writer must provide physical cover by buying and storing the asset before selling the option. We optimise the writer’s strategy for a single option and for an infinite sequence of options, these two strategies being different. The latter is motivated by the lifetime valuation of an energy storage unit when used as reserve capacity in a power system. Our stochastic process is a Brownian motion representing the real-time system imbalance, and which we rescale to represent an <b>imbalance</b> <b>price.</b> The single option leads to an optimal stopping problem in which the principle of smooth fit may be violated and the stopping region may be disconnected.

40|$|The {{smart grid}} {{paradigm}} implies flexible demand and energy storage {{in order to}} cope with the variability of renewable energy sources. Buildings are often put forward as a potential supplier of flexibility services through demand side management (DSM) and distributed energy storage, partly as thermal energy. This paper presents a bottom-up approach for the quantification of this flexibility service. Cost curves are computed from the solution of optimal control problems with low-order models. These curves show the amount of flexibility and their associated cost. The method is generic and can be applied to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) services, thermal energy storage (TES) and local electricity production. A case study is performed on a monitored office building in Brussels, Belgium. The results reveal a large variation in both flexibility and cost depending on time, weather, utility rates, building use and comfort requirements.

40|$|There is no {{academic}} {{consensus on}} which market design provides the least distorting long-term investment incentives.

30|$|DA markets mandate {{participants}} to declare their generation schedules {{for the next}} day several hours {{before the start of the}} operational day. Time difference between the submission of bids and real-time operation ranges from 14 to 38 hours. For example, in Spanish DA market, bids are submitted a day before at 10 : 00 a.m. [5]. It is 11 : 30 a.m. for Turkish DA market case [6]. However, hourly wind power generation can be forecasted with a mean absolute error in the range of 15 %- 20 % for a single plant from one day before; thus, deviations from DA schedule inevitably occur in actual generation [7]. Consequently, wind power producers are exposed to high imbalance penalties in balancing markets because of the uncertain wind forecasts. Likewise wind uncertainty, <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> are also highly volatile and unpredictable. One of the reasons for this is that the amount of energy traded and the number of participants in balancing markets are relatively low compared to DA markets. Secondly, dual pricing mechanism, which Turkish balancing market has been practicing, makes <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> even more difficult to estimate due to almost random nature of the direction of overall imbalances of the producers and the system.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the design of}} {{balancing}} markets in Europe taking into account an increasing wind power penetration. In several European countries, wind generation is so far not burdened with full balancing responsibility. However, the more wind power penetration, the less bearable for the system not to allocate balancing costs to the responsible parties. Given the variability and limited predictability of wind generation, full balancing exposure is however only feasible conditionally to well-functioning balancing markets. On that account, recommendations ensuring an optimal balancing market design are formulated and their impact on wind generation is assessed. Taking market-based or cost-reflective imbalance prices as the main objective, it is advised that: (1) the imbalance settlement should not contain penalties or power exchange prices, (2) capacity payments should be allocated to imbalanced BRPs via an additive component in the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> and (3) a cap should be imposed on the amount of reserves. Efficient implementation of the proposed market design may require balancing markets being integrated across borders. Electricity market design Balancing services Wind power integration...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and renewable-energy sources (RES) are fundamental {{parts of the}} European energy policy. For this reason, efficient distributed generation technologies such as {{combined heat and power}} coupled to district heating (CHP-DH) and RES based electricity are largely promoted. Additionally, the flexibility that CHP-DH offers to the power system is seen as an option to balance the intermittent output of RES-based generation. This could be done by aggregating RES based electricity generation and CHP DH in a virtual power plant (VPP). In this framework, the present work presents a methodology to evaluate the optimal bidding strategy of a VPP composed of a CHP-DH and RES based generators. The objective is to investigate the optimal bidding strategy for a VPP that uses CHP DH to compensate for the uncertainties regarding RES-based electricity generation and market prices. The VPP operator nominates its energy to the day ahead market the day before the actual delivery (D- 1). In real time, any deviation from the day-ahead schedule is settled in the imbalance market. The uncertainties are modeled using a two stage stochastic programming approach. Three different bidding strategies are studied: ‘static’, ‘flexible DA’ and ‘flexible RT’. The major difference between the studied strategies lies in the dispatch decisions. The ’static’ strategy does not adjust the scheduled output of the CHP. Whereas, the ‘flexible DA’ and ‘flexible RT’ strategies differ from each other in terms of the information available at the moment of performing the reschedule (second stage decision). The ‘flexible DA’ reschedules the CHP output for the whole day assuming full knowledge of the RES scenario, but under uncertainty regarding the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price.</b> The ‘flexible RT’ strategy allows the VPP to adjust its position at each time step depending on the RES generation and <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> scenarios. The results show that in comparison with the ‘static‘ strategy, the ‘flexible DA’ operation results in a profit increase during summer (5, 900 €/week), the intermediate season (2, 800 €/week) and winter (2, 700 €/week). This increase is moderate when compared against the total fuel cost in these seasons. Better results are obtained when the ‘flexible RT’ strategy is applied. Using this strategy larger profits are achieved for all seasons. For instance, during winter the difference between the ‘flexible RT’ operation and the ‘static’ case amounts to 22, 600 €/week, approximately 5 % of the fuel cost. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|By using IT-solutions, the {{flexibility}} on the demand {{side in the}} electrical systems could be increased. This is called demand response and {{is part of the}} larger concept called smart grids. Previous work in this area has concerned the utilization of demand response by grid owners. In this thesis the focus will instead be shifted towards the electrical companies that have balance responsibility, and how they could use demand response in order to make profits. By investigating electrical appliances in hourly measured households, the business value from decreasing electrical companies’ power imbalances has been quantified. By an iterative simulation scheme an optimal value was found to be 977 SEK/year and appliance. It could however be shown that the value became larger for energy inefficient households, and that such consumers’ participation in a demand response market would be prioritized ahead of other measures like isolating walls is rather unlikely. Thermal appliance whose load depend on the outdoor temperature are less valuable for demand response during the summer months, and the annual value would increase if less seasonally dependent appliances were used. Additionally, by increasing the market price amplitudes and the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> volatility, it could be shown that the potential for such demand response markets is larger in e. g. the Netherlands and Germany...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{share of}} renewable energy sources is {{likely to lead to}} price effects in Nordic electricity market, resulting especially in increased volatility of spot and <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices.</b> The greater price volatility and amount of required balancing power increase the need for Demand-Side Management (DSM) in the electricity market and may as well increase the financial benefits of DSM participants. In this research I study the DSM in electricity mar-ket and evaluate how large the financial benefits of DSM participants could be. Monte Carlo simulation method is used to simulate <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> with different volatilities for Finland and Sweden. The results show that increasing volatility may in some cases lead to substantial cost savings and additional revenues for the DSM participants. The revenues are higher in Finland compared to Sweden due to higher volatility of prices in the Finnish balancing power market. Lower threshold price (i. e. the lower opportunity cost of shifting or adjusting electricity demand) and higher flexible load capacity will in-crease the revenue obtainable from the DSM participation. However, there is a feedback effect, since the more DSM programs there are in the market, the less volatile the prices are likely to be. The magnitude of this effect, {{as well as that of}} the rebound effect (i. e. increased demand due to lower prices), is hard to quantify. If these feedback effects are large, cost savings and additional revenues for the DSM participants may be considerably smaller than what is documented in this study.

40|$|The {{imbalance}} settlement design {{is the part}} of an electricity balancing market design that stimulates so-called Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) to balance their electricity production and consumption portfolio and to stick to their energy schedules by penalizing any deviations from these schedules with an <b>imbalance</b> <b>price.</b> There are numerous {{imbalance settlement}} design options, each of which gives different incentives to BRPs. The aim of this work is to analyze the impact of the imbalance settlement design on BRP behaviour, and thereby on balancing market performance. For this purpose an agent based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative imbalance settlement designs are analyzed. We conclude from the analysis results that it is generally a better strategy for BRPs to opt for a long position rather than a short position, and to opt for a small imbalance rather than a large one. Furthermore, different imbalance settlement designs will lead to different but still similar results, because of the balancing market equilibrium that emerges {{as a result of the}} dynamic feedback loop between BRP behaviour and balancing market outcomes. An exception is formed by two-price settlement, which leads to much higher imbalance costs. Finally, it was found that the imbalance costs for large BRPs are relatively higher, and that the choice of imbalance settlement design has a greater impact on the behaviour of small BRPs.

40|$|<b>Imbalance</b> <b>PRice</b> is {{the staple}} food {{for more than}} 50 % of the world’s {{population}} 1 - 3. Reliable prediction of changes in rice yield is thus central for maintaining global food security. Here, we compare the sensitivity of rice yield to temperature increase derived from field warming experiments and three modelling approaches: statistical models, local crop models and global gridded crop models. Field warming experiments produced a substantial rice yield loss under warming, with an average temperature sensitivity of - 5. 2 ± 1. 4 % K- 1. Local crop models gave a similar sensitivity (- 6. 3 ± 0. 4 % K- 1), but statistical and global gridded crop models both suggest less negative impacts of warming on yields (0. 8 ± 0. 3 % K- 1 and - 2. 4 ± 3. 7 % 38 K- 1, respectively). Using data from field warming experiments, we further propose a conditional probability approach to constrain the large range of global gridded crop model results for the changes in future yield in response to warming {{by the end of}} the century (from - 1. 3 % K- 1 to - 9. 3 % K- 1). The constraint implies a more negative response to warming (– 8. 3 ± 1. 4 % K- 1) and reduces the spread of the model ensemble by 35 %. This yield reduction exceeds that estimated by the International Food Policy Research Institute assessment (- 4. 2 to - 6. 4 % K- 1) 4. Our study suggests that without CO 2 fertilization, effective adaptation and genetic improvement, severe rice yield losses are plausible under intensive climate warming scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The subject {{addressed}} in this paper is the intra-hour scheduling of a distributed battery energy storage system (BESS). The case study is about a lithium-ion BESS integrated in a low voltage (LV) distribution system with residential customers and photovoltaic (PV) generation in the Netherlands. The BESS has been developed to enable field-testing and research of energy storage technologies in LV distribution grids, with emphasis on network support functions. As part of the research related to electricity markets, a proposal is presented about the economic optimisation of the BESS, whereas the simulation scenario addresses the passive contribution within the Dutch imbalance settlement system. Energy storage solutions can provide an attractive option for the integration of renewable energy sources {{and the establishment of}} efficient generation and delivery of electrical power. In the Netherlands, market parties have an incentive to assist the Transmission System Operator (TSO) in correcting system imbalances, largely attributable to the organisation of the system. The Dutch TSO publishes the system balance position and <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> close to real-time. This information can be used by market participants to voluntary contribute to the system balance by utilising non-contracted control power. This approach is called passive contribution and is believed to result in a substantial reduction in the required control energy. The imbalance settlement in the Netherlands for passive balancing is based on the net volumes of provided control energy per settlement period. Therefore, market participants might try to minimise or maximise the net amount of energy per settlement period when the system state is explicitly short or long. Assuming certain predictions of the system state and imbalance prices, the formulation of the optimisation problem is the maximisation of a profit function, and is solved by utilising an internal model of the BESS to plan the future response of the charging and discharging process over a receding horizon. The results of the optimisation problem are charging and discharging schedules of the BESS, which can be further employed in real-time operations. The main contribution of this work is a proposal for the intra-hour scheduling of the BESS, whereas the outcome of simulations provides an economic evaluation of the specified application based on actual market data of the Dutch TSO...|$|E

40|$|One goal of European Union energy {{politics}} {{is to reach}} a leadership in use of renewable energies. Integrating the weather variable renewable energy in to the present power system requires also flexible resources {{that are able to}} balance the production and consumption of power system also in those situations, when weather conditions are not optimal for weather variable energy sources. In system which is based on market principles, the value of flexibility should be reflected in prices that result from balancing needs. Especially in cases, where {{there is a shortage of}} flexible resources, the price should reflect this scarcity. This thesis surveys, what is meant by scarcity pricing in context of electricity markets and how scarcity pricing could be applied into regulating and imbalance prices in Finland. A look is taken into formation of regulating and imbalance prices in situations, when there is scarcity with the resources that can implement the up-regulation, meaning the regulation that either increases production or decreases consumption. Aim is to find out the mechanisms in present price forming model that prevent the price rise to reflect the value that consumers give for the scarce resource and also propose possible improvements in price formation and discuss the possible impacts of these proposed improvements. The scarcity situation occurs in real-time, when the availability of resources for regulating are low compared to the need for regulating. Surveying the usage of bids that were given to Fingrid’s regulating market during the time interval of 2013 – 2016, there was altogether 18 hours, when 90 % or more of the voluntary bids given by market participants were used. About two of third cases were associated with unplanned unavailability of either production plant or interconnector. Because of the principles of price formatting in cases with network interruption, the cases when there was a loss of interconnection, the regulating and imbalance prices both stayed low being about level of spot-price of the same hour. In these cases called special regulation, the price does not give signal of scarce resources. In other cases the price rose clearly over the average price of years 2013 – 2016. The highest price hit was 3000 €/MWh. In this thesis also the possible implementation of scarcity adder in cases, when transmission system operator needs to use reserve that is meant to keep the power system to stand disturbances is discussed. The scarcity adder would bring the market participants incentive to participate in to the system balancing, which again can bring new business opportunities. The scarcity adder applied to the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> would also allocate the costs of these reserves better to those participants who are creating the need for these reserves...|$|E
40|$|For {{wind power}} to {{participate}} in the short-term power market, forecasts up to 36 hours ahead of the hour of operation are required. These forecasts are never perfect, and the resulting wind power mismatch implies imbalance costs for the participant in the regulation market. Bidding the expected forecast in the day-ahead market is sub-optimal, as the difference between the day-ahead spot price and upward and downward regulation price is different. If the traded volume on the regulation market is low and the mismatched energy is high, this {{will have an impact on}} the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price.</b> This research aims to find a bidding strategy for stand-alone wind power in the day-ahead market that includes the price elasticity of the regulation market. The imbalance costs can be further reduced by teaming the wind power with conventional power that can balance out the mismatches. Hence, a bidding strategy for a mixed portfolio is also proposed. For both bidding strategies the value of the wind forecast service and its accuracy are also simulated. The ethics and social welfare of the bidding strategies are then examined. The bidding strategies were simulated in the Dutch market for 2006. For stand-alone wind power in the day-ahead market the proposed bidding strategy resulted in a profit increase of 3. 5 % compared to the well-known optimal quantile bidding strategy and 7. 5 % compared to bidding the expected generation. Teaming the wind power with gas power to balance out the mismatch gave a profit increase of 9. 6 % compared to separate bidding in the day-ahead market. The profit of teaming is greatly reduced by the capacity reserves that the conventional unit need to withhold in order to balance out the mismatch. In reality, the excess reserve capacity can be bid at the balancing market when the hour of operation approaches and the expected wind power generation can be more accurately estimated. This strategy may increase the mixed portfolio profit substantially. For wind farms bidding alone in the day-ahead market the profits are strongly affected by the level of wind forecast accuracy. For the 200 MW capacity wind farm used in this simulation, the profit increase was 11 million euros for a 10 percentage point decrease in the standard deviation of the wind forecast error, if the initial forecast had 25 % standard deviation. The dependency was greatly reduced when teamed with a 400 MW conventional unit. The same decrease in wind forecast error now resulted in a profit increase of 5 million euros. The bidding strategies do not violate bidding rules and was found to decrease the total amount of regulation power needed. It is not possible to exploit the difference in market price between the day-ahead market and the regulation market, as assumptions the bidding strategy is based upon prevent the possibility of market arbitrage. The cooperation between the conventional unit and the wind farm will create a player in the market that has more power to affect the prices versus participants bidding separately in the market. However, the bidding strategy is based on a price-taking assumption for the day-ahead market and since any involvement in the balancing market is assumed to only decrease the profit, no market power will be exploited using this strategy. 	 Social welfare is unchanged by the bidding strategy. Depending on the regulation state and the traded imbalance value, there is a transfer of surplus between supplier and consumer in the day-ahead market and the regulation market. For the wind farm there is a total gain of surplus, making wind power a more compatible investment option versus other conventional power sources to meet the rising electricity demand. As an environmental energy source this can have a positive impact on the social welfare in the long run. However, examining the environmental benefits is a more complex analysis including analysis of the environmental effects of the balance responsible conventional unit. </p...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} of building energy systems {{is a key}} challenge for the mitigation of climate change. In particular, bad controlnbsp;operation often causes large energy efficiency losses, both in new and old buildings. nbsp;implementation of model predictive control (MPC) in buildings could enable an improved thermal comfort, lower operational costs and lower CO 2 emissions. Moreover, such a controller can offer services to the energy market by using {{the flexibility of the}} building energy system to shift its loads. Unfortunately, MPC has not yet been applied to many buildings. nbsp;The main reason is the large implementation effort, in particular for developing the control model. The objective of this work is to develop and demonstrate a tool chain for automated deployment of MPC innbsp;based on data-driven, grey-box building models. The tool chain serves two purposes in order to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon society: * energy efficient building operation and * optimal use of building flexibility. In {{the first part of this}} work, the multi-disciplinary Modelica library IDEAS hasnbsp;developed in collaboration with researchers of different departments at KU Leuven. The aim of IDEAS is to investigate buildings, thermal and electrical systems at district level. With IDEAS we have quantified photovoltaic curtailing losses in dwellings and proposed simple rule-based controllers to reduce these losses. However, these rule-based controllers have their limits, specifically when larger thermal energy storage capacities are available. A model predictive controller can predict and anticipatenbsp;is expected to outperform rule-based control when the time constants or the degrees of freedom of the system increase. One of the main bottlenecks for the implementation of MPC innbsp;is the development of an appropriate system model. In a second part of this work, a grey-box buildings toolbox is developed with the aim of facilitating and even automating this process. The choice for grey-box models, as opposed to black-box models, results in physical models with interpretable parameters. This is a major advantagenbsp;regard tonbsp;model development and validation. In anbsp;part of this work, a methodology is proposed to quantify the flexibility of a building. The methodology makes use of a grey-box model and returns both the amount of electricity that can be shifted and the associated costs for the building operator. The method is applied to the office building of 3 E in Brussels, the KKnbsp;This building has a hybrid heating system composed of a condensing gas boiler and two air/waternbsp;pumps. The results reveal a high variability of both the amount of flexibility and the associated costs. While most of the day, the KKnbsp;can deliver flexibility at a lower cost than the <b>imbalance</b> <b>price</b> in the Belgian power system, there are several hours where the flexibility is more expensive. Finally, an MPC has been implemented in the KK building. Tonbsp;end, a tool chain is developednbsp;covers all requirednbsp;for applying MPC to real buildings. nbsp;grey-box buildings toolbox is at the core ofnbsp;tool chain. Other elements are the forecasting of disturbances, a state estimation, the configuration ofnbsp;optimal control problem with an appropriate objective function and constraints and the handling of monitoring data and control signals. While many of thesenbsp;can still be substantially improved, this tool chain sets the field for a cost-effective roll-out ofnbsp;in buildings. The MPC for the KK building controls the thermal power of the gas boiler and both heat pumps. nbsp;In comparison with the conventional control system, thenbsp;reduces the operational costs for heating by 30 % to 40 %. The savings are realised by a combination of a much earlier start-up (pre-heating of the building), use of the heat pumps instead of the gas boilernbsp;a drastic reduction of the supply water temperature once thenbsp;has reached its temperature set point. Whilenbsp;of these savings can possibly be realised bynbsp;the conventional control, others cannot. The anticipation of MPC on the buildingnbsp;and expected disturbances makes this conceptnbsp;to beat. With the developed tool chain, this work hopes to bring the implementation of MPC in buildings a significant step closer to reality. nrpages: 161 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{sequential}} decision-making strategy for a demand response aggregator that {{participates in the}} day-ahead market and reacts to <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices.</b> Finding such a participation strategy requires solving a multistage optimization problem under uncertainty that entails both an open-loop (day-ahead market) and a nested closed-loop (imbalance system) problem. Driven {{by the possibility of}} using data-driven models and reinforcement learning techniques, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Standard MDP-based methods, however, often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we use techniques from approximate dynamic programming. Our proposed method applies a cross-entropy method with a simulation-based approximate policy iteration algorithm nested inside. The crossentropy method is compared with a separated planning method, that optimizes the day-ahead and real-time decisions separately. Both planning methods are evaluated for an aggregator with a fleet of electric vehicles using data from the Belgian electricity market. status: accepte...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} housing market <b>imbalances,</b> housing <b>prices</b> and residential investment in Switzerland within a stock-flow framework. In the long run, the desired level of residential capital stock and the existing residential capital stock revert. Empirical results indicate, however, that housing demand can diverge from the existing supply for several years due to the slow adjustment of the residential capital stock to shocks. In the short run, the market therefore has to be cleared by price adjustments. And indeed, it can be shown empirically that changes in prices are significantly and strongly dependent {{on the level of}} stock <b>imbalances.</b> Furthermore, housing <b>prices</b> prove to be an important determinant of residential investment, which in turn drives the adjustment process of the residential capital stock towards its desired level.|$|R
30|$|Uncertainties in {{wind power}} forecast, {{day-ahead}} and <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> {{for the next}} day possess a great deal of risk for the profit of generation companies participating in a day-ahead electricity market. Generation companies are exposed to imbalance penalties in the balancing market for unordered mismatches between associated day-ahead power schedule and real-time generation. Coordination of wind and thermal power plants alleviates the risks raised from wind uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel optimal coordination strategy by balancing wind power forecast deviations with thermal units in the Turkish day-ahead electricity market. The main focus {{of this study is to}} provide an optimal trade-off between the expected profit and the risk under wind uncertainty through conditional value at risk (CVaR) methodology. Coordination problem is formulated as a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming problem, where scenario-based wind power approach is used to handle the stochasticity of the wind power. Dynamic programming approach is utilized to attain the commitment status of thermal units. Profitability of the coordination with different day-ahead bidding strategies and trade-off between expected profit and CVaR are examined with comparative scenario studies.|$|R
40|$|Wind Power Producers (WPPs) seek to {{maximize}} profit and minimize the imbalance costs when bidding into the day-ahead market, but uncertainties in the hourly available wind and forecasting errors make the bidding risky. This paper assumes that hourly wind power output {{given by the}} forecast follows a normal distribution, and proposes three different bidding strategies, i. e., the expected profit-maximization strategy (EPS), the chance-constrained programming-based strategy (CPS) and the multi-objective bidding strategy (ECPS). Analytical solutions under the three strategies are obtained. Comparisons among the three strategies are conducted on a hypothetical wind farm which follows the Spanish market rules. Results show that bid under the EPS is highly dependent on market clearing <b>price,</b> <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices,</b> and also the mean value and standard deviation of wind forecast, and that bid under the CPS is largely driven by risk parameters and the mean value and standard deviation of the wind forecast. The ECPS combining both EPS and CPS tends to choose a compromise bid. Furthermore, the ECPS can effectively control the tradeoff between expected profit and target profit for WPPs operating in volatile electricity markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Imbalance {{settlement}} {{is a vital}} part of the balancing market, i. e. the institutional arrangement that establishes market-based balance management in liberalized electricity markets. We investigate the impact of the imbalance settlement design on the behaviour of Balance Responsible Parties and thereby on balancing market performance by means of a comparison of the German and Dutch imbalance settlement designs and balancing market results for the period May-December 2009. It is found that Germany has much higher activated balancing energy volumes, <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> and actual BRP cost levels than the Netherlands, but these differences are perhaps rather caused by balancing energy market design differences and differences in intermittent generation shares than by imbalance settlement design differences. The real-time publication of balance regulation in the Netherlands enables internal balancing by BRPs, which may reduce the size of system imbalances. Generally, BRPs will over-contract a little, because of the lower risk of having a negative individual imbalance and because of the evening out of imbalance costs over a longer time period.

40|$|This {{research}} proposes {{an economic}} model for wind farm owners and operators {{to predict the}} amount of electricity to sell to the market to optimize revenue. The model takes as inputs predictions of <b>imbalance</b> <b>prices</b> as well as probabilistic predictions of wind generation at the farm. The proposed statistical methodology improves upon current forecasting {{by focusing on the}} accuracy of predictions at extreme events. We decompose the prediction of prices into a baseline and spike component. The mixture model of a seasonal autoregressive component for the daily baseline behavior and a autoregressive conditional duration model for the extreme events, achieves a higher level of accuracy in the prediction and therefore a higher revenue to the wind farm. Through the improved predictions of price as well as a probabilistic forecast of wind output, not only can wind farms maximize revenue, but the independent system operators (IS Os), who control operations of the grid, can also better account for wind generation in the dispatch process, thus allowing wind to become a reliable source of power generation...|$|R
