40|$|Research, media interest, and {{political}} involvement around prisons and families have grown significantly in recent years, {{although there is}} scant evidence within the growing body of related literature of original work that documents the perceptions and experiences of families affected by a member’s imprisonment. This research attempts to redress this, taking a social constructionist perspective which uses unstructured interviews to gain a critical insight into why family members’, and in particular, children’s voices are often absent in this field. The research focuses predominantly on children’s experiences, expressed through their own words, or through the words of an adult. The findings complement and add value to the emerging literature in this relatively neglected area, suggesting that stigma, shame, guilt and frustration are commonplace for prisoners’ families. The findings also reveal that what is significant, but remains largely hidden in research to date, are the reasons why children often {{do not know what}} is happening when a parent is in prison. This thesis presents the results from interviews held with a sample of twenty-four families, including parents, children, prisoners, and practitioners. The interviews took place over a nineteen-month period, and involved, in many instances, a series of interviews with the same respondents. The phenomenon of ‘story telling’ where children are offered <b>fictitious</b> <b>accounts</b> to explain the absence of an imprisoned family member, thereby avoiding the necessity of mentioning ‘prison’ forms an important element of the thesis. Whilst these <b>fictitious</b> <b>accounts</b> were motivated by a desire to protect the children from the social harm and stigma commonly associated with prison, the children themselves often understood more than their parents realised or were prepared to realise. The research exposes parental anxieties and fears, evidenced in their narratives, and played out in their respectable, sometimes implausible, <b>fictitious</b> <b>accounts</b> they concocted for their children. What is uncovered is that, contrary to parental expectations, children can often deal with the imprisonment of a family member when they are presented with the facts, showing resilience, fortitude, and competence. 3 Additionally, the thesis shows how families struggle to navigate and make sense of the criminal justice system, frequently encountering hostility, incompetence, and a lack of empathy and understanding. Events such as the arrest of a family member or visiting a family member in prison can exacerbate the difficulties family members already face. By focusing the research around the experiences of children within these families, the thesis offers an original perspective and a valuable contribution to knowledge. The thesis demonstrates that it is prisoners’ families, and in particular the children in these families who are the real victims of prison...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{credibility}} of a testimony {{is a crucial}} component of judicial decision-making. Checklists of testimony credibility criteria are extensively used by forensic psychologists to assess the {{credibility of}} a testimony, and in many countries they are admitted as valid scientific evidence {{in a court of}} law. These checklists are based on the Undeutsch hypothesis asserting that statements derived from the memory of real-life experiences differ significantly in content and quality from fabricated or <b>fictitious</b> <b>accounts.</b> Notwithstanding, there is considerable controversy regarding the degree to which these checklists comply with the legal standards for scientific evidence to be admitted {{in a court of law}} (e. g., Daubert standards). In several countries, these checklists are not admitted as valid evidence in court, particularly in view of the inconsistent results reported in the scientific literature. Bearing in mind these issues, a meta-analysis was designed to test the Undeutsch hypothesis using the CBCA Checklist of criteria to discern between memories of self-experienced real-life events and fabricated or <b>fictitious</b> <b>accounts.</b> As the original hypothesis was formulated for populations of children, only quantitative studies with samples of children were considered for this study. In line with the Undeutsch hypothesis, the results showed a significant positive effect size that is generalizable to the total CBCA score, δ = 0. 79. Moreover, a significant positive effect size was observed in each and all of the credibility criteria. In conclusion, the results corroborated the validity of the Undeutsch hypothesis and the CBCA criteria for discriminating between the memory of real self-experienced events and false or invented accounts. The results are discussed in terms of the implications for forensic practice...|$|R

The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward [...] "a short, sturdy old fellow, with ashock head of loose, white hair" [...] who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell, a <b>fictitious</b> <b>account</b> of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for The Strand magazine.

60|$|Many {{days had}} passed since the hut was made--how many may not be known, since I notched no stick and knotted no cord--yet never in my rambles in the wood had I seen that desolate ash-heap where the fire had done its work.

But at length, one night, without thinking of Rima's fearful end, it all at once occurred to me that the hated savage whose blood I had shed on the white savannah might have only been practicing his natural deceit when he told me that most pitiful story.

Even now, while I sat there idly musing, she might be somewhere in the wood--somewhere near me; but after so long an absence full of apprehension, waiting in concealment for what tomorrow's light might show.|$|E
6000|$|The {{letters of}} Pope were {{therefore}} {{in his own}} keeping, {{and out of the}} power of Swift, before July 23, 1737. The Dean, however, informed him that [...] "by reading the dates he found a chasm of six years," [...] and that he had searched for the missing correspondence in vain. Pope did not abandon the hope of recovering it, and Swift, apparently in reply to his applications, wrote on August 8, 1738, to acquaint him that every letter received from him for twenty years and upwards had been sealed up in bundles, and consigned to the custody of Mrs. Whiteway, whom he describes as [...] "a very worthy, rational, and judicious cousin of mine." [...] Mrs. Whiteway, who had none of the papers, had a short time before kept Swift from sending a similar <b>fictitious</b> <b>account,</b> but the idea had taken deep root in his mind, and rightly conjecturing that he would reiterate it, she engaged Lord Orrery to inform Pope that she had neither got any of the correspondence herself, nor had the slightest knowledge where it was.[134] On the present, as on the former occasion, Swift showed her what he had written, and on the 24th of August he subjoined a postscript in which, after saying that he would correct, if it were possible, the blunders committed in his letter, he simply added that his cousin had assured him that [...] "a great collection of your/my letters to me/you are put up and scaled, and in some very safe hand." [...] The counter-assurance of Mrs. Whiteway to Lord Orrery that she had no knowledge of the collection, shows that the corrected version was as fanciful as the original statement. Swift's language in 1738 would imply that the chasm in the correspondence no longer existed, and that no part of the series had yet been transmitted to England; but it was the language of a man labouring under the misapprehension and obliviousness produced by disease, and could have little weight in opposition to the testimony that Pope had received back a packet of his letters in the previous year. Any doubt which could have existed on the point is done away by the admission of Pope himself. Mrs. Whiteway had refused in 1740 to send back some of his letters by the mother of the Mr. Nugent, who afterwards became Lord Clare, because the poet had authorised her to entrust them to a Mr. M'Aulay. [...] "I believe," [...] Pope wrote to Mr. Nugent, [...] "they had entertained a jealousy of you, as the same persons did before of my Lord Orrery. They then prevented the Dean from complying to any purpose with my request. They then sent a few just to save appearances, and possibly to serve as a sort of plea to excuse them of being taxed with this proceeding, which is now thrown upon the Dean himself."[135] The [...] "proceeding" [...] was the committing the correspondence to the press, and Pope, on his own part, to avoid being taxed with it, was privately putting forth the plea that the bulk of his letters had not been returned to him. The confession that he had received a few is a complete answer to the delusion of Swift, and they must have been more than a very few, or they would not have been sufficient [...] "to save appearances." [...] Setting aside the representations of the poet, upon which no dependence can be placed, except when he bears witness against himself, there is nothing to oppose, and much to confirm the idea that they were the identical [...] "few" [...] which were published in the quarto of 1741.|$|E

40|$|People often {{disseminate}} fictitious {{information and}} contrived anecdotes, {{some of which}} can be destructive. This paper explores the proposition that most, if not all, fictitious information can be classified into four clusters. Each cluster reinforces one of four underlying determinants of positive emotions-unambiguous duties, moral authorities, extensive capabilities, and stable values over time. This framework is derived from socio-emotional selectivity theory, self-discrepancy theory, and the meaning maintenance model. To assess these propositions, 1500 fictitious claims, derived from snopes. com, were subjected to thematic analysis. To code these claims, all nouns and verbs were translated to broader categories. Then, researchers sorted these abstracted claims into 88 piles of overlapping accounts. These 88 accounts were next sorted into 19 broader piles, each reflecting a distinct theme. All 19 themes aligned to one of the four underling determinants of positive emotions. These findings indicate that, arguably, the need to curb negative emotions and to foster positive emotions motivates these biased and <b>fictitious</b> <b>accounts.</b> The findings also highlight several distinct avenues in which each of these four needs can be fulfilled. The implications of these findings to a range of issues, from violence and mental illness to advertising and marketing, are discussed...|$|R
