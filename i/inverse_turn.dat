50|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} a small triple-stranded beta-sheet stabilized by a disulfide knot, followed by a C-terminal extension comprising three classic or inverse y-turns. The disulfide knot is a ring consisting of two disulfide bonds (1-15 and 8-20) and the connecting backbone, through which a third disulfide bond (14-31) passes. The β-sheet, defined {{on the basis of}} inter-sheet hydrogen bonds, consists of residues 6-8 (strand I), 19-21 (strand II) and 29-32 (strand III), with a topology of +2x, —1. The two hydrogen bonds (one amide of which has a slowly exchanging amide proton) between strands I and III are distorted (NH to CO distance between 2.5 and 3.0 A). There are four hydrogen bonds between strands II and III (all of which have corresponding slowly exchanging amide protons), three being present in most of the structures and one in half of the structures.The structure contains a number of chain reversals. The first is not well defined and is either a type II ß-turn (Lys3-Asn6) or a y-turn centered on Arg5. Chain reversal II is a y turn centered on Gly9. Chain reversal III is not well defined, being either a type I ß-turn (Asnn-Cys14) or an inverse y-turn centered on Asn11. Chain reversal IV (Cys15-Met18) is not stabilized by a hydrogen bond but has a cis peptide bond between Cys16 and Pro17 and resembles a type Via turn. The fifth chain reversal occurs in the region of residues 22-28, which fulfill the criteria for an i2-loop. The C-terminal extension, stabilized by the Cys16-Cys42 disulfide bond, consists of three y-turns, VI-VIII, that are, respectively, an <b>inverse</b> <b>turn,</b> centered on Thr33, a classic turn centered on Ile35 and an <b>inverse</b> <b>turn</b> centered on Phe39. All three of the y-turn hydrogen bonds have slowly exchanging amide protons (although {{this is not the case}} for the other turns). The only slowly exchanging amide proton not accounted for by consensus hydrogen bonds in any secondary structure element is that of Gly37 (which hydrogen bonds to Thr34 in one of the structures).The conformations of the Cys1-Cys15 and Cys8-Cys20 disulfide bonds are well defined and have negative and positive Xss, respectively; the other two bonds have lower order parameters. The hydrophobic core of RBX is limited, consisting of essentially the disulfide knot cystine residues and the buried Met18. However, the 22-28 loop contains one apolar residue, Ala23, and three aromatics, Tyr22, Trp24 and Tyr25, and is flanked by Ile21 at its N-terminus and Trp7 near its C-terminus, so this region represents a significant non-polar surface on the molecule. RBX is highly positively charged, with one Arg (sequence position 5) and six Lys (3, 4, 10, 19, 40 and 41) residues, balanced only by Glu12 and Asp13. These charged residues form three patches on the surface. Patch A consists of the positively charged residues 3,4 and 5, patch B of residues 10, 12, 13 and the N-terminus (including possible salt bridges between Lys10 and Glu12 and Asp13 and the N-terminus), and patch C of 19, 40, 41 and the C-terminus.|$|E

These generalizations are shown to be possible under a certain minimality condition on the negative index of the operators I-T_ 1 ^*T_ 1 and A, respectively; these conditions are automatically satisfied if T_ 1 is contractive or A is nonnegative, respectively. The approach developed in this paper starts by establishing first a generalization of an old result due to Yu. L. Shmul'yan on completions of 2 × 2 nonnegative block operators. The extension of this fundamental result allows us to prove analogs of the above mentioned results of M. G.

Cyclic hexapeptides {{can be made up}} of all possible combinations of 4 : 1 hydrogen bonded types I, I', II and II' turns, giving rise to sym. conformations having two-fold and inversion symmetries as well as nonsym. structures. Conformations having exclusive features of 3 : 1 hydrogen bonded turns were found to be possible in threefold and S 6 sym. cyclic hexapeptides. The cyclic hexapeptides formed by the linking of two turn tripeptide fragments differ mainly in the hydrogen bonding scheme present in the turn tripeptides and the conformation at the -carbon atoms where the two tripeptide fragments link. The different hydrogen bonding schemes found in the component turns are: 1) a turn with only a 4 : 1 hydrogen bond, 2) a type I or I' turn with 4 : 1 and 3 : 1 hydrogen bonds occurring in a bifurcated form and 3) a type II or II' turn having both the 4 : 1 and the 3 : 1 hydrogen bonds with the same acceptor oxygen atom.

40|$|Activation of {{the human}} {{complement}} system of plasma proteins in response to infection or injury produces a 4 -helix bundle glycoprotein (74 amino acids) known as C 5 a. C 5 a binds to G-protein-coupled receptors on cell surfaces triggering receptor-ligand internalization, signal transduction, and powerful inflammatory responses. Since excessive levels of C 5 a are associated with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, inhibitors of receptor activation may have therapeutic potential. We now report solution structures and receptor-binding and antagonist activities {{for some of the}} first small molecule antagonists of C 5 a derived from its hexapeptide C terminus. The antagonist NMe-Phe-Lys-Pro-D-Cha-Trp-D-Arg-CO 2 H (1) surprisingly shows an unusually well-defined solution structure as determined by H- 1 NMR spectroscopy. This is one of the smallest acyclic peptides found to possess a defined solution conformation, which {{can be explained by the}} constraining role of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. NOE and coupling constant data, slow deuterium exchange, and a low dependence on temperature for the chemical shift of the D-Cha-NH strongly indicate an <b>inverse</b> gamma <b>turn</b> stabilized by a D-Cha-NH [...] . OC-Lys hydrogen bond. Smaller conformational populations are associated with a hydrogen bond between Trp-NH [...] . OC-Lys, defining a type II beta turn distorted by the <b>inverse</b> gamma <b>turn</b> incorporated within it. An excellent correlation between receptor-affinity and antagonist activity is indicated for a limited set of synthetic peptides. Conversion of the C-terminal carboxylate of 1 to an amide decreases antagonist potency 5 -fold, but potency is increased up to 10 -fold over 1 if the amide bond is made between the C-terminal carboxylate and a Lys/Orn side chain to form a cyclic analogue. The solution structure of cycle 6 also shows gamma and beta turns; however, the latter occurs in a different position, and there are clear conformational changes in 6 vs 1 that result in enhanced activity. These results indicate that potent C 5 a antagonists can be developed by targeting site 2 alone of the C 5 a receptor and define a novel pharmacophore for developing powerful receptor probes or drug candidates...|$|R

In this new method there exists the flexibility to impose the physical conditions that govern the behavior of residual stress to achieve a meaningful complete stress field. The analysis is also coupled to a least squares approximation and a regularization method to provide stability of the inverse problem. The power of this new method is then demonstrated by analyzing some experimental measurements and achieving a good agreement between the model prediction and the results obtained from residual stress measurement.

In this work, we examined the tendency of a number of Na-acyl dipeptide N’-alkylamides of the type RCO-(aMe) Pro- Xxx-NHR’ or RCO-Xxx-(aMe) Pro- NHR’, in which Xxx is l (or d) -Ala, Aib (a-aminoisoburyric acid), or l (or d) -(aMe) Pro, long enough to fold into intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded g or b turns. The results are compared with those obtained for the corresponding dipeptides based on Pro, a well-known turn-forming residue. For the crystalstate 3 D-structural analysis we used Xray diffraction, whereas our solution conformational analysis was heavily based on the FTIR absorption and 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy techniques. We conclude that (aMe) Pro is able to explore both trans’ and cis’ y areas of the conformational space, but in (aMe) Pro the latter is overwhelmingly more populated, in marked contrast to the Pro preference. This finding is a clear indication that in (aMe) Pro the major 3 D-structural determinant is the Ca-methyl group. The circular dichroism (CD) signature of a peptide type III’ b-turn conformation is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} strong magnetic fields on the QCD phase structure at vanishing density by solving the gluon and quark gap equations, and by studying {{the dynamics of the}} quark scattering with the four-fermi coupling. The chiral crossover temperature as well as the chiral condensate are computed. For asymptotically large magnetic fields we find magnetic catalysis, while we find inverse magnetic catalysis for intermediate magnetic fields. Moreover, for large magnetic fields the chiral phase transition for massless quarks turns into a crossover. The underlying mechanisms are then investigated analytically within a few simplifications of the full numerical analysis. We find that a combination of gluon screening effects and the weakening of the strong coupling is responsible for the phenomenon of <b>inverse</b> catalysis. In <b>turn,</b> the magnetic catalysis at large magnetic field is already indicated by simple arguments based on dimensionality.

40|$|Fields and {{division}} rings are not algebras {{in the sense}} of "Universal Algebra", as inverse is not a total function. Mending the inverse by any definition of 0 (- 1) will not suffice to axiomatize the axiom of inverse x(- 1) · x = 1, by an equation. In particular the theory of fields cannot be used for specifying the abstract data type of the rational numbers. We define equational theories of Meadows and of Skew Meadows, and we prove that these theories axiomatize the equational properties of fields and of division rings, respectively, with 0 (- 1) = 0. Meadows are then used in the theory of Von Neumann regular ring rings to characterize strongly regular rings as those that support an <b>inverse</b> operation that <b>turns</b> it into a skew meadow. To conclude, we present in this framework the specification of the abstract type of the rational numbers, as developed by the first and third authors in [2]...|$|R
