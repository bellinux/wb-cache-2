5|$|A single <b>High</b> <b>Angle</b> Control System {{director}} was fitted {{on the island}} and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and aft of the island.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{properties}} of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It {{was found to}} have a retrograde orbit, at a very <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until Voyager 2 flew by in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated {{the capability to}} droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
50|$|Leading-edge root {{extension}} (LERX): {{generates a}} strong vortex over the wing at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, but unlike vortex generators {{it can also}} increase lift at such <b>high</b> <b>angles,</b> while creating minimal drag in level flight.|$|R
50|$|On {{a modern}} fighter {{aircraft}} LERX induce controlled airflow over the wing at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, so delaying the stall and consequent loss of lift. In cruising flight {{the effect of}} the LERX is minimal. However at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, as often encountered in a dog fight or during takeoff and landing, the LERX generates a high-speed vortex that attaches {{to the top of the}} wing. The vortex action maintains a smooth airflow over the wing surface well past the normal stall point at which the airflow would otherwise break up, thus sustaining lift at very <b>high</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{maneuverability}} is improved, {{especially at}} <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack.|$|R
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished at a very <b>high</b> <b>angle,</b> making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A {{solution to this problem}} would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the {{possibility}} of using tangential blowing to control vortical flow on a missile-like slender body at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. Emphasis is placed on smoke- and surface oil-flow visualization, force measurements, and velocity and pressure measurements using a 5 -hole probe. It is shown that the tangential blowing significantly alters the flow field downstream of the slot and creates large side forces and yawing moments to very <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. Effectiveness of the tangential blowing is discussed in terms of jet momentum, blowing location, slot area, and Reynolds number. The concept proved to be efficient at small blowing rates and at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack...|$|R
50|$|To {{minimise}} {{risks of}} collision, slip lanes can be shaped {{to enter the}} traffic flow at a <b>higher</b> <b>angle</b> than the 45 degrees shown in the first sketch. Such lanes are called <b>high</b> entry <b>angle</b> slip lanes.|$|R
40|$|Engine inlets for subsonic V/STOL {{aircraft}} must operate over a {{wide range}} of conditions without internal flow separation. Experimental and analytical investigations were conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} tangential blowing to maintain attached flow to <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. The inlet had a relatively thin lip with a blowing slot located either on the lip or in the diffuser. The height and width of these slots was varied. Experimentally determined flow separation boundaries showed that lip blowing achieved <b>higher</b> <b>angle</b> of attack capability than diffuser blowing. This capability was achieved with the largest slot circumferential extent and either of the two slot heights. Predicted (analytical) separation boundaries showed good agreement except at the <b>highest</b> <b>angles</b> of attack...|$|R
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for {{blood levels of}} the hormone cortisol—which is used to {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E

5000|$|A 1979 NASA report [...] {{explains}} that at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack the cuff discontinuity generates a vortex {{that acts as}} a fence, preventing the separated flow from progressing outboard. The lift slope has a flatter top and the stall angle is delayed to a <b>higher</b> <b>angle.</b> To reach <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, the outboard airfoil has to be drooped, some experiments investigating [...] "exaggerated" [...] drooped leading edges. The physical reason for the cuff effect was not clearly explained. [...] Some much older reports gave some similar results. A 1932 NACA report [...] about the effect of leading-edge slots of various lengths said, [...] "this is an indication that the slotted portion on each tip of the wing operates to some extent as a separate wing".|$|R

25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and {{flight control computer}} programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.|$|E

They also assist the Sheriff's Office's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team. The units also function as mobile command center on extended operations.|$|E
40|$|An {{introduction}} to, {{and a broad}} overiew of, the aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} airplanes at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack are provided. Items include: (1) some important fundamental phenomena which determine the aerodynamic characteristics of airplanes at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack; (2) static and dynamic aerodynamic characteristics near the stall; (3) aerodynamics of the spin; (4) test techniques used in stall/spin studies; (5) applications of aerodynamic data to problems in flight dynamics in the stall/spin area; and (6) the outlook for future research in the area. Although stalling and spinning are flight dynamic problems of importance to all aircraft, including general aviation aircraft, commercial transports, and military airplanes, {{emphasis is placed on}} military configurations and the principle aerodynamic factors which influence the stability and control of such vehicles at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack...|$|R

25|$|Jumping or leaping {{is a form}} of {{locomotion}} or {{movement in}} which an organism or non-living (e.g., robotic) mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory. Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of initial launch.|$|E
25|$|The CFS {{provides}} {{fire cover}} and cleanup at road accidents. When there are entrapments, the CFS will provide fire cover, and when required will respond with rescue appliances {{with the appropriate}} tools for stabilising and extricating trapped casualties. They also perform other rescue duties, such as rope (vertical / <b>high</b> <b>angle)</b> rescue, confined space rescue, building collapse related rescue, industrial site rescue, water and ice related rescues/emergencies and animal rescues.|$|E
25|$|A {{streamlined}} body {{looks like a}} fish (Tuna, Oropesa, etc.) or an airfoil with small angle of attack, whereas a blunt body looks like a brick, a cylinder or an airfoil with <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack. For a given frontal area and velocity, a {{streamlined body}} will have lower resistance than a blunt body. Cylinders and spheres are taken as blunt bodies because the drag {{is dominated by the}} pressure component in the wake region at high Reynolds number.|$|E
50|$|A Leading edge slat is an {{aerodynamic}} surface running spanwise {{just ahead of}} the wing leading edge. It creates a leading edge slot between the slat and wing which directs air over the wing surface, helping to maintain smooth airflow at low speeds and <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. This delays the stall, allowing the aircraft to fly at a <b>higher</b> <b>angle</b> of attack. Slats may be made fixed, or retractable in normal flight to minimize drag.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStrong {{asymmetrical}} vortices {{appear on}} the leeward of slender body at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, which has very unfavorable effect on the stability {{and control of the}} aircraft. A method is developed to control the side force of slender body at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, and is verified in wind tunnel. A thin-film triangular self-excited oscillation flag is fixed {{at the tip of the}} slender body model whose semi-apex angle is 10 °. Side force is approximately linearly proportional to roll-setting angle of self-excited oscillation flag at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, and the slop of fitting straight line obtained by the least square method is − 0. 158. The linear relationship between side force and roll-setting angle provides convenience for developing side force control law of slender body at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. Experimental data shows that the side force coefficients vary linearly with roll-setting angles when a specific plastic self-excited oscillation flag is used as the control flag. The range of side force coefficient and roll-setting angle are, respectively, − 3. 2 to 3. 0 and − 20 ° to 20 °. The device is simple, effective, and is of great potential in engineering application...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of a high positioned horizontal tail on a wing-body configuration having a thin unswept wing of aspect ratio 3. 09. Lift and pitching-moment coefficients were obtained for Mach numbers from 0. 80 to 1. 40 at Reynolds numbers of 1. 0 and 1. 5 million and for angles of attack to 20 deg. An experimental study of the pitching-moment contribution of the horizontal tail indicated that the marked destabilizing effect of the horizontal tail at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack for Mach numbers of 0. 80 to 1. 00 was associated with the formation of completely separated flow on the upper surface of the wing. Computations of the interference effects of the wing-body combination on the tail for Mach numbers of 0. 80 and 0. 94 and <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack confirmed this conclusion. For a Mach number of 1. 40, and <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, computations disclosed that the destabilizing effect primarily resulted from the trailing vortices of the wing. Two modifications to the basic wing plan form, which consisted of chord extensions, were generally unsuccessful in reducing the destabilizing contributions of the horizontal tail at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack...|$|R
25|$|One {{important}} {{design criterion}} for the J-20 describes high instability. This requires sustained pitch authority at a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack, {{in which a}} conventional tail-plane would lose effectiveness due to stalling. On the other hand, a canard can deflect opposite to the angle of attack, avoiding stall and thereby maintaining control. A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and transonic turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta wing design.|$|E
25|$|Verne Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery is a World War II {{anti-aircraft}} battery, {{also known}} as an ack-ack battery, on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. The battery is situated on the north-east side of the island, south of the Verne Citadel and Verne <b>High</b> <b>Angle</b> Battery.

Although a number of similar batteries were built {{around the same time}} on Portland, this particular battery is the only surviving one of its type on the island.|$|E
25|$|Other {{differences}} include intake ramps for {{the engines}} and two extra wing hard points for payload (for {{a total of}} 11), retaining previous hardpoints on the bottom centerline, wingtips, and two conformal fuselage positions. Among the most significant aerodynamic changes are the enlarged leading edge extensions (LEX) which provide improved vortex lifting characteristics in <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> of attack maneuvers, and reduce the static stability margin to enhance pitching characteristics. This results in pitch rates in excess of 40 degrees per second, and high resistance to departure from controlled flight.|$|E

40|$|Spanwise blowing {{was used}} to test a {{generalized}} wind-tunnel model to investigate component concepts in order to provide improved maneuver characteristics for advanced fighter aircraft. Primary emphasis was placed on performance, stability, and control at <b>high</b> <b>angles</b> of attack and subsonic speeds. Test data were obtained in the Langley high speed 7 by 10 foot tunnel at free stream Mach numbers up to 0. 50 for a range of model angles of attack, jet momentum coefficients, and leading and trailing edge flap deflection angles. Spanwise blowing on a 44 deg swept trapezoidal wing resulted in leading edge vortex enhancement with subsequent large vortex induced lift increments and drag polar improvements at the <b>higher</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. Small deflections of a leading edge flap delayed these lift and drag benefits to <b>higher</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. In addition, blowing was more effective at higher Mach numbers.
