25|$|The natives, whose {{presence}} causes so much disgust to you, often {{take pride in}} {{the fact that they are}} Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> {{you that you are}} not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

500|$|The {{outcome of}} this war will not be decided at Nanking {{or in any other}} big city; it will be decided in the {{countryside}} of our vast country and by the inflexible will of our people ... In the end we will wear the enemy down. In time the enemy's military might will count for nothing. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that the final victory will be ours.|$|E
500|$|Adding to the {{challenges}} facing the 1997 team, Michigan entered the season with the toughest schedule among the 112 NCAA Division I-A schools based on records from the previous year. [...] Days before the season opener, Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest. Carr noted, [...] "It's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest. But Mount Everest has been climbed. And with great preparation and determination, and great attitude, which I think our players have, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you we're looking forward to it." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, Evans {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} have a fairly significant part in the making of the album, stating [...] "I don't know at this point exactly how many songs will be on the CD, but I'm sure we'll have about four or five different-sized orchestras or bands. It'll turn into a giant panic, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you. That's just how this business is." [...] Later that month, Gaga, after her performance with Bennett at the final inaugural ball of President Obama's second inauguration, announced the album formally through her Twitter. [...] "And here's me and my handsome date, I simply cannot wait for our album together, he's my darling!" [...] she wrote as a caption for a photo tweeted of the pair, along with revealing the title of the album as Cheek to Cheek.|$|E

50|$|On his poetry, Mattar said I didn't {{intend to}} make myself a school when I first started writing poetry; I {{just wanted to say}} the truth... and I did. <b>I</b> now <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that readers can tell my poetry without my name been {{attached}} to it.|$|R

500|$|He {{graduated}} in 1960 {{and became a}} research student in the university's Mond Laboratory on the old Cavendish site, where he was supervised by Brian Pippard. American physicist Philip Anderson, also a future Nobel Prize laureate, {{spent a year in}} Cambridge in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Josephson in a class was [...] "a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you, because everything had to be right or he would come up and explain it to me after class." [...] It was during this period, as a PhD student in 1962, that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect; Cambridge unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962, and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled Non-linear conduction in superconductors.|$|E
500|$|Although {{generally}} {{respected by}} London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became. Shy and self-conscious, he was annoyed at repeatedly being {{asked about the}} size of his clothes. [...] In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied [...] "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put you into a method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), Chrystee Pharris (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and Cathy Jenéen Doe (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). The program made history as the first daytime serial to show two women having sex in bed. She is also the first African-American lesbian {{character}} to appear in a daytime serial. When discussing the decision to portray Simone as a lesbian, Kalouria emphasized [...] "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" [...] and [...] "this is where [...] is [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you we're not going to make light of this particular topic." [...] The storyline about Simone's lesbianism, and the representation of her sexuality, received mixed feedback from critics and media outlets, as did Cathy Jenéen Doe's performance. Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality, and her relationship with Rae. Despite the award, Sarah Warn, former editor of entertainment website AfterEllen.com, criticized the lesbian reveal as having [...] "reduced Simone to a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl." ...|$|E

"Sire," [...] said he, prostrating {{himself as}} he spoke, [...] "although I make my {{appearance}} so late before your Highness, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> confidently <b>assure</b> you {{that none of the}} wonders you have seen during the day can be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes upon him." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{character}} {{later became}} the center of disapproval from viewers, who felt Declan was moving on too fast after Bridget's death when he developed feelings for Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Sorensen then backed the storyline, wanting his character to move on stating: [...] "It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was {{one of the lucky ones}} to have found his soul mate early in life, but at the same time, he has to move on and live his life." [...] further adding: [...] "A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Making {{of those}} riots an ethnico-religious affair {{seemed to me}} {{particularly}} disgusting. When railwaymen are blocking France, nobody goes search further as their demands. Take any Norwegian or Swede, inflict the same life conditions [...] on them and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you that they will end up burning cars too..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I have no {{intention}} of being personal, even by unanimous consent. But if Mr. Ferguson will come to me after this meeting I shall have not the least objection to discussing this matter with him in so far as he himself is concerned. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>assure</b> you now that I have not spoken without warrant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Palliser left my service {{a week or}} more ago," [...] Tallente replied. [...] "He left it at a moment's notice, in {{consequence}} of a personal disagreement concerning which I beg that you will ask no questions <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>assure</b> you that it was not political. Since he left no word has been heard of him. The papers, even, have been making capital of his disappearance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Le Breton's a well-meaning young fellow, certainly,' the Progenitor murmured {{gently in}} a voice of graceful concession; 'and I believe his heart's really in the Cause, as you call it; but you know, my dear, he's very far from being sound in his {{economical}} views as to the relations of capital and labour. Far from sound, as John Stuart Mill would have judged the question, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> solemnly <b>assure</b> you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Henri Cartier-Bresson said of Griffiths' [...] "Not since Goya {{has anyone}} portrayed war like Philip Jones Griffiths."

2500|$|On 4 June 2013, Heynckes {{announced}} he would not coach a team during the 2013–14 season. On 21 June, {{in an interview with}} Der Spiegel, Heynckes said, [...] "After everything that's happened over the past two years, I'm ready for some peace and quiet. After this string of successes, I could transfer to just about any club in Europe. I {{have a problem with the}} finality of saying 'never'.

2500|$|The Indian players {{released}} few {{statements about}} the issue. Kumble wrote in his column in the Hindustan Times that Ponting {{was not willing to}} listen to his pleas that the issue should remain on the field. Kumble claimed that he knew through experience that such an allegation would have major ramifications {{both on and off the}} field. Tendulkar reportedly sent a text message to the BCCI saying [...] "Harbhajan is innocent and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you on this... In this hour of crisis, the board should stand by him". Tendulkar has reportedly denied sending an SMS to Sharad Pawar. Both teams have expressed hope that this issue would not overshadow the cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Hart-Davis {{believes}} that Peter Fleming failed {{to consider the}} possibility that Mr. A. had unknowingly transmitted the communications [...] "telepathically and subconsciously" [...] to Vera. Certainly the [...] "slushy" [...] prose in Take Over and the other manuscripts were the sort a man like Mr. A. with his background would perpetrate. The manuscripts frequently used the adjective [...] "pleasurable" [...] as did Mr. A. in conversation; even Mr. A.'s initial letter to Peter Fleming promised [...] "very pleasurable news concerning your late brother Ian." [...] A communication purportedly from Maugham claimed that the deceased authors wished for those still alive to believe life continues after death and that [...] "life goes on and very pleasurably <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> you.".|$|E

While addressing party workers at Congress Bhavan in Raipur he said, [...] "We will pursue the perpetrators of this crime with urgency and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> the nation that the Government is committed to bringing them to justice." [...] President Pranab Mukherjee said the nation will neither be overawed nor intimidated by such actions. Leader of Opposition in Loksabha, Sushma Swaraj condemned the attacks and termed it to be shocking and most unfortunate.|$|E
5000|$|His {{definition}} of his Jewishness was: [...] "Religion? I am an atheist. Jewish nationalism? I am an internationalist. In neither sense am I therefore a Jew. I am, however, a Jew {{by force of}} my unconditional solidarity with the persecuted and exterminated. I am a Jew because I feel the pulse of Jewish history; because I should like to do all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to <b>assure</b> the real, not spurious, security and self-respect of the Jews." ...|$|R
