40|$|The ends of {{prestressed}} concrete beams under expansion joints are often exposed to moisture and chlorides. Left unprotected, the moisture and chlorides {{come in contact}} with the ends of the prestressing strands and/or the mild reinforcing, resulting in corrosion. Once deterioration begins, it progresses unless some process is employed to address it. Deterioration can lead to loss of bearing area and therefore a reduction in bridge capacity. Previous research has looked into the use of concrete coatings (silanes, epoxies, fiber-reinforced polymers, etc.) for protecting {{prestressed concrete}} beam ends but found that little to no laboratory research has been done related to the performance of these coatings in this specific type of application. The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) currently specifies coating the ends of exposed prestressed concrete beams with Sikagard 62 (a high-build, protective, solvent-free, epoxy coating) at the precast plant prior to installation on the bridge. However, no physical testing of Sikagard 62 in this application has been completed. In addition, the Iowa DOT continues to see deterioration in the prestressed concrete beam ends, even those treated with Sikagard 62. The goals of this project were to evaluate the performance of the Iowa DOT-specified beam-end coating as well as other concrete coating alternatives based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) T 259 - 80 chloride ion penetration test and to test their performance on in-service bridges throughout the duration of the project. In addition, alternative beam-end forming details were developed and evaluated for their potential to mitigate and/or eliminate the deterioration caused by corrosion of the prestressing strands on prestressed concrete beam ends used in bridges with expansion joints. The alternative beam-end details consisted of individual strand blockouts, an individual blockout for a cluster of strands, dual blockouts for two clusters of strands, and drilling out the strands after they are <b>flush</b> <b>cut.</b> The goal of all of the forming alternatives was to offset the ends of the prestressing strands from the end face of the beam and then cover them with a grout/concrete layer, thereby limiting or eliminating their exposure to moisture and chlorides...|$|E

2500|$|... "Through-holed and wedged" [...] {{is one of}} {{the primary}} means of joining Windsor chair parts. A {{cylindrical}} or slightly tapered hole is bored in the first piece, the matching cylindrical or tapered end of the second piece is inserted in the hole as a round tenon, and a wedge is driven into the end of this tenon, flaring it tight in the hole. The excess portion of the wedge is then <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> with the surface. This supplies a mechanical hold that will prevail when the glue fails.

In 2008, trees were pruned and inoculated in April. In 2009 and 2010, another experiment {{was conducted with}} pruning and inoculation in March, April, May and post-harvest. Pruned branches averaged 3. 5 cm diameter and cuts left a stub, average 20 -cm-long. In 2008, <b>flush</b> <b>cuts</b> were compared to stub cuts in a separate experiment. Cut surfaces were inoculated with copper-sensitive Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) (10 to the 8 th cfu/ml). In 2010, the impact of natural and induced freeze events on canker progression was examined. Canker progression was assessed during the growing season. In 2008, bacteria were re-isolated from inoculated cuts and Pss identified with biochemical and PCR assays. In 2008, the efficacy of phosphite or copper against leaf scar infections generated by inoculating branches at 80 percent leaf drop was tested and bud blast assessed. In the 2008 - 2009 dormant season, six sweet cherry orchard planting systems and five cultivars were assessed visually for incidence of cankers to rate relative susceptibility. Laboratory experiments with detached shoots and green cherry fruit were conducted to determine pre-infection and post-infection activity of labeled or specified rates of copper hydroxide (standard), phosphite, Pentra Bark, kasugamycin, biological MOI- 106, biological yeast in proprietary buffer, oxytetracycline, urea, Bacillus subtilis, and hydrogen dioxide against Pss, compared to untreated. The isolate of Pss used for inoculum in the field experiments (Ps 34 collected by Burr from sweet cherry, Wayne County, NY) was submitted for genome sequencing. Three naturally-occurring, streptomycin resistant isolates of Pss were recovered from apple buds in Geneva, NY. Events: A 2009 Sweet Cherry Field Meeting and a 2010 Summer Fruit Tour held at NYSAES, Geneva, NY featured our research, reaching over 240 sweet cherry growers, nurserymen, industry personnel, consultants, educators and faculty. Services: We ruled out bacterial canker outbreaks at three orchards and verified bacterial canker at three orchards. Products: Copper and phosphite are essentially ineffective against bacterial infections of pruning cuts, pruning stubs may effectively contain canker infections, and cankers progress least when pruning is done after harvest. Flamout and Kasumin show activity against Pss infection in sweet cherry. We have a collection of contigs for the Ps 34 genome and a physical collection of 420 Pss isolates.

40|$|There is {{debate about}} whether {{distinct}} designs of femoral components {{for men and women}} are needed based on morphologic and size differences between genders. We asked whether anthropomorphic differences exist between the distal femoral dimensions in women and men. We measured the distal femora of 100 women and 100 men intraoperatively after preparation for prosthetic implantation. The measured dimensions included the anteroposterior height from the posterior edge of the medial femoral condyle to the <b>flush</b> anterior <b>cut,</b> the mediolateral width at the transepicondylar axis, the anterior and posterior edges of the anterior chamfer, and the medial and lateral trochlear flanges. These measurements were compared between genders using independent-samples t test. The aspect ratio (a measure of the shape of the distal femur), the ratio between the anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions, was calculated for men and women to determine whether there is a shape difference between genders. The mean aspect ratio was larger for women than for men (0. 84 [range, 0. 57 – 1. 03] versus 0. 81 [range, 0. 066 – 1. 34], respectively). The standard deviation and range of each measurement of size and morphology suggest variability not only between genders but also within genders.

50|$|Fachwerk {{is a type}} of half-timbering {{consisting}} of the erection of a timber structural frame, the walls of which are then infilled with non-structural masonry panels. In this case the infill is face brickwork. The framing, reputed to be grey ironbark, is generally square in section, hand cut and assembled off site prior to the final erection. Roman numerals and runes are inscribed in the timber to identify the position of each structural member. Joints, including cross-halved, checked and mortise and tenon, interlock the timber members giving the frame greater structural rigidity. Each member must be placed into position in the correct sequence during erection due to the complexity of the jointing system. Round timber pegs are used to position and hold joints, instead of nails. Some of these timber pegs are visible, <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> with the face of the posts.|$|R
50|$|Mining and {{quarrying}} industries commonly use a wire saw to cut hard stone {{into large}} blocks that {{can then be}} shipped to processing plants to be further refined (in the case of ore dressing) or shipped to distributors (in the case of granite or marble for building). These wire saws are large machines that use diamond-impregnated beads on a cable. The saws allow {{the bottom of a}} quarry slab to be cut free (after the cable is passed through access drill holes); with the bottom cut, back and side charges (explosives) can cleanly cleave the slab. Quarry saws on this principle date back centuries; before the era of steel cables with diamond cutters, there were fiber ropes that drew sand through the kerf. The sand (<b>flushed</b> with water) <b>cut</b> the stone (albeit more slowly than diamond does today).|$|R
40|$|The proper {{method for}} branch removal is a long-standing {{question}} in forestry.

Both alternatives have implications for tree health and wood quality. A long, international history of forest pruning research generally indicates that a cut parallel {{and close to the}} stem will maximize clearwood production without excessive stem decay. Some exceptions exist for species where potential for stem decay is high. The method recommended in most guidelines for all types of pruning is an outside branch collar approach based primarily on a small number of observational studies. However, maintaining tree health and maximizing clearwood production are not mutually exclusive and a cut close to the stem can meet both objectives. Alternative approaches to branch removal may be useful for other objectives...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{risk factors}} and {{predictors}} of failure of the Hem-o-lok(TM) vascular clip (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) using vessels harvested from a porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vessels of various diameters were harvested from a porcine model, clipped at 90 degrees or 45 degrees using the Hem-o-lok clip and then <b>cut</b> either <b>flush</b> or with a 1 -mm cuff. The vessels were then connected to a burst-pressure device and pressures required to burst the clip or to cause it to leak were measured. RESULTS: The Hem-o-lok clip leaked or burst when the vessel to which it was applied was <b>cut</b> <b>flush.</b> The clip became even more likely to fail if the angle of application of the clip was not at 90 degrees to the vessel surface. CONCLUSION: The Hem-o-lok vascular clip is safe if it is applied at 90 degrees to the vessel surface and, more importantly, if a 1 -mm cuff is left between the clip and {{the point at which}} the vessel is divided. We would therefore discourage the practice of not leaving this cuff of tissue, in an attempt to maximize vessel length during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy...|$|R
40|$|The adult CNS is an {{inhibitory}} {{environment for}} axon outgrowth, severely limiting recovery from traumatic injury. This limitation is due, in part, to endogenous axon regeneration inhibitors (ARIs) that accumulate at CNS injury sites. ARIs include myelin-associated glycoprotein, Nogo, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Some ARIs bind to specific receptors on the axon growth cone to halt outgrowth. Reversing or blocking {{the actions of}} ARIs may promote recovery after CNS injury. We report that treatment with sialidase, an enzyme that cleaves one class of axonal receptors for myelin-associated glycoprotein, enhances spinal axon outgrowth into implanted peripheral nerve grafts in a rat model of brachial plexus avulsion, a traumatic injury in which nerve roots are torn from the spinal cord. Repair using peripheral nerve grafts is a promising restorative surgical treatment in humans, although functional improvement remains limited. To model brachial plexus avulsion in the rat, C 8 nerve roots were <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> to the spinal cord and a peroneal nerve graft was inserted into the lateral spinal cord at the lesion site. Infusion of Clostridium perfringens sialidase to the injury site markedly {{increased the number of}} spinal axons that grew into the graft (2. 6 -fold). Chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that cleaves a different ARI (CSPGs), also enhanced axon outgrowth in this model. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which cleaves oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein and Nogo receptors, was without benefit. Molecular therapies targeting sialoglycoconjugates and CSPGs may aid functional recovery after brachial plexus avulsion or other nervous system injuries and diseases...|$|R
5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water <b>flushes</b> the <b>cut</b> debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|R
40|$|Understanding of flow {{resistance}} of forested floodplains {{is essential for}} floodplain flow routing and floodplain reforestation projects. Although the {{flow resistance}} of grass-lined channels is well-known, flow retention due to flow-blocking by trees is poorly understood. Flow behaviour through tree-filled channels or over forested floodplain surfaces has largely been addressed using laboratory studies of artificial surfaces and vegetation. Herein we {{take advantage of a}} broad, shallow earthen experimental outdoor channel with headwater and tailwater controls. The channel was disused and left undisturbed for more than 20 years. During this time period, small deciduous trees and a soil cover of grass, herbs and leaf-litter established naturally. We measured flow resistance and fluid retention in fifteen controlled water discharge experiments for the following conditions: (a) natural cover of herbs and trees; (b) trees only and; (c) earthen channel only. In the b-experiments the herbaceous groundcover was first removed carefully and in the c-experiments the trees were first <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> with the earthen channel floor. Rhodamine-B dye was used to tag the flow and the resultant fluorescence of water samples were systematically assayed through time at two stations {{along the length of the}} channel. Dilution-curve data were analysed within the Aggregated Dead Zone (ADZ) framework to yield bulk flow parameters including dispersion, fluid retention and flow resistance parameters after the procedure of Richardson & Carling (2006). The primary response of the bulk flow to vegetation removal was an increase in bulk velocity, with depth and wetted width decreasing imperceptibly at the resolution of measurement. An overall reduction in flow resistance and retention occurred as discharge increased in all experiments and flow retention. Retentiveness was more prominent during low flow and for all three experimental conditions tended to converge on a constant low value for high discharges. Reach mean travel times and the advective time delays decreased very slightly from experiments (a) to (b) which is not surprising given the sparse nature of the herbaceous soil cover. Thus in these two initial experiments, the trees provided the majority of the resistance in contrast to the aggregate effect of grass, herbs and litter. Removing the trees leaving an earthen channel further decreased travel times such that the ADZ residence time was more than halved moving from (a) to (c). The overall bulk flow effect of tree cover on retention is here expressed by the dispersive fraction parameter, indicating retention volume and time, which reduced from typically 0. 4 to closer to 0. 2 when vegetation was removed. The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor during low discharges was higher for experiments (a) compared with (b) but the friction factors converged on the low earthen channel value as discharge increased. In conclusion the effect of vegetation on hydraulic retention compared with an unvegetated channel is prominent during low discharges but becomes negligible during high discharges as momentum increasingly dominates the flow...|$|R
