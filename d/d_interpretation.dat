Using recent results on the sum capacity of the Gaussian vector broadcast channel, the optimal number of precoded data streams in a downlink channel is characterized. The main result is the following: the sum-capacity achieving transmission strategy in a random downlink channel with n transmit antennas at the base-station and K receivers each equipped with m antennas involves between n to 1 n(n + 1) 2 data streams in total, with each user receiving between m to 1 m(m + 1) data streams. This gives a dimension count- 2 <b>ing</b> <b>interpretation</b> for multiuser diversity. In particular, {{it shows that the}} throughput maximizing transmission strategy in a downlink channel with n transmit antennas should involve between n to 1 n(n + 1) active users at any time. 2 I...|$|R

The data consist of eleven high resolution surveys over the Manitouwadge greenstone belt of the Superior Province, Ontario. The interpretation was calibrated to the detailed geological mapping of the area by Zaleski et. al. (1995) The study has three components. First, the data and grid quality were maximized to maintain as much of the high frequency component of the flight line data as possible while minimizing levelling errors and gridding artefacts. Second, a number of 3 <b>D</b> <b>interpretation</b> techniques was investigated. Third, the 3 <b>D</b> <b>interpretation</b> techniques were applied to the data over the Manitouwadge study area. Grid improvement techniques, particularly micro-levelling and trend reinforcement, were found to be necessary to maximize grid quality. The 3 <b>D</b> <b>interpretation</b> techniques used included apparent magnetic susceptibility mapping, analytic signal, horizontal gradient of pseudo-gravity, potential field tilt and Euler deconvolution as well as first and second vertical derivatives. Each method enhances a different component of the total field intensity and complemented each other when interpreted in combination. The apparent susceptibility map combined with the horizontal gradient of pseudo-gravity maxima produced an image that approximates the mapped geology. Calibrating the magnetic interpretation to the known geology allowed the extrapolation of supracrustal rock units into areas of limited geological mapping.

This qualitative study is based on semistructured interviewswith 21 Norwegians. The results show the following: (a) only a portion of uncertainty informationwas used, (b) symbolswere sometimes ascribed different meanings than intended, and (c) interpretations were affected by local experiences with wind direction and forecast quality.

The diversity of user approaches makes forecast uncertainty more difficult to communicate and provides possible explanations for why communicating uncertainty is challenging...|$|R
