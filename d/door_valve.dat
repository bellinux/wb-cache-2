This is, however, the most inconvenient form we could choose, as respects the fitting of the valves of the doorway; for the arch-shaped head of the valves not only requires considerable nicety in fitting to the arch, but adds largely to the weight of the door,--a double disadvantage, straining the hinges and making it cumbersome in opening. And this inconvenience is so much perceived by the eye, that a <b>door</b> <b>valve</b> with a pointed head is always a disagreeable object. It becomes, therefore, a matter of true necessity so to arrange the doorway as to admit of its being fitted with rectangular valves.|$|E

Before the facade was erected, the portico {{would be seen}} from afar and would take pilgrims up a large flight of stairs to approach it. Without <b>door</b> <b>valves,</b> the three large arches were decorated with angels and foliage and framed the ciborium and altar {{at the end of}} the nave. Prophets and apostles form the columns and jambs welcoming pilgrims inside the church.Though the portal was originally poly-chromed, the numerous traces of the remaining paint seen today are due to later interventions. Records show that the portico was repainted often with contracts surviving from the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. Two types of paintings are distinguishable now on the structure. On some of the figures, the paint is powdery; the colors are light, soft and clear without any additional ornaments. This dates back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The more enamel-like painting is harsher and darker with ornamental patterns dated back to the 17th century in a similar style to offering boxes in 1656.|$|R
40|$|When localizing mobile {{sensors and}} {{actuators}} in indoor environments laser meters, ultrasonic meters or even image processing techniques are usually used. On the other hand, in smoky conditions, {{due to a}} fire or building collapse, once the smoke or dust density grows, optical methods are not efficient anymore. In these scenarios other type of sensors must be used, such as sonar, radar or radiofrequency signals. Indoor localization in low‐visibility conditions due to smoke {{is one of the}} EU GUARDIANS [1] project goals. The developed method aims to position a robot in front of doors, fire extinguishers and other points of interest with enough accuracy to allow a human operator to manipulate the robot’s arm in order to actuate over the element. In coarse‐grain localization, a fingerprinting technique based on ZigBee and WiFi signals is used, allowing the robot to navigate inside the building in order to get near the point of interest that requires manipulation. In fine‐grained localization a remotely controlled programmable high intensity LED panel is used, which acts as a reference to the system in smoky conditions. Then, smoke detection and visual fine‐ grained localization are used to position the robot with precisely in the manipulation point (e. g., <b>doors,</b> <b>valves,</b> etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis research addresses {{the problem of}} mounting human entities to other non-human entities in the virtual environment. Previous human entities were exercised as individual entities in the virtual environment. Yet there are many applications (i. e. shipboard damage control, amphibious landings, helicopter vertical assaults) where human entities need to mount other vehicles within the virtual environment. The approach taken was to re-engineer the Naval Postgraduate School's Shiphandling Training Simulator (SHIPSIM) and Damage Control Virtual Environment Trainer (DC VET) onto a common virtual environment system (NPSNET). Using a modified potentially visible set algorithm, a ship hydrodynamics model, and a simple data PDU network packet, NPSNET human entities were given the capability to mount ship vehicles. Additionally, a control panel and voice recognition were added to allow the human entities to control and maneuver the ship vehicles in the virtual environment. As {{a result of this}} thesis, NPSNET human entities can mount ship vehicles, move about the ship, and interact with the ship's internal objects (i. e <b>doors,</b> <b>valves,</b> etc.) all while the ship moves within the virtual environment. This technology opens a new paradigm for simulation designers, where users of virtual environment systems can participate as human entities and interact (i. e. mount, control, and maneuver) with other inanimate vehicles as we do in the real world.

5000|$|Aboiteau farming on {{reclaimed}} marshland is a labor-intensive {{method in}} which earthen dykes are constructed to stop high tides from inundating marshland.

5000|$|Maintaining UHV {{conditions}} {{requires the}} use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100 °C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon [...] "cycling" [...] the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an [...] "interlock" [...] is often used. The interlock volume has one <b>door</b> or <b>valve</b> facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a [...] "puff" [...] of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.|$|R

40|$|The Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (TAFLab) at the University of California, Berkeley is {{investigating}} several designs for novel shallow water wave energy converters. The common denominator for these prototypes {{is that they}} operate with a hydraulic power takeoff (PTO) for the secondary power conversion. A critical component of an hydraulic PTO is one or more check valves creating a unidirectional flow. The research goal of this thesis is the flow optimization of these components. Turbulence in the check valves {{was assumed to be}} a major cause for efficiency losses in the current PTO design. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and rapid prototyping through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) were selected as prototyping tools, due to the high customizability and short lead time of components. Experimental analysis and fluid simulations were used to compare and verify the performance of the optimized check valve designs. One of the performance measures for check valves is the head loss coefficient Kv, which is desired to be low in the flow direction, and high in the reverse direction. We observed that the original check valve had a KvD = 57. 2 +- 1. 0 in the flow direction and no flow in the reverse direction (KvR = inf). A minor modification improved KvD to 46. 1 +- 0. 9 in the flow direction but decreased KvR = 8. 7 +- 1. 7. 10 E 7 in the reverse direction. The first double door design brought KvD down to 6. 4 +- 0. 5, but with a reverse loss coefficient of 738 +- 11. The final double <b>door</b> check <b>valve</b> had a KvD of 8. 4 +- 0. 5 in the flow direction and KvR = 1. 4 +- 0. 3. 10 E 6 in the reverse direction, and was selected for a dynamic test. In a direct application in a pumping setup, we however observed an efficiency decrease from 41. 3 +- 0. 5 % to 24. 7 +- 0. 5 %, possibly explained by the closing speeds of the new valve. It is concluded that optimizing losses in a steady state flow experiment cannot guarantee improved results in pulsating or alternating flow...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work we have {{designed}} and implemented a modular, robust and user-friendly Pilot Interface meant to control humanoid robots in rescue scenarios during dangerous missions. We follow the common approach where the robot is semi-autonomous {{and it is}} remotely controlled by a human operator. In our implementation, YARP is used both as a communication channel for low-level hardware components and as an interconnecting framework between control modules. The interface features the capability to receive the status of these modules continuously and request actions when required. In addition, ROS is used to retrieve data from different types of sensors and to display relevant information of the robot status such as joint positions, velocities and torques, force/torque measurements and inertial data. Furthermore the operator is immersed into a 3 D reconstruction {{of the environment and}} is enabled to manipulate 3 D virtual objects. The Pilot Interface allows the operator to control the robot at three different levels. The high-level control deals with human-like actions which involve the whole robot’s actuation and perception. For instance, we successfully teleoperated IIT’s COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN) platform to execute complex navigation tasks through the composition of elementary walking commands (e. g. [walk_forward, 1 m]). The mid-level control generates tasks in cartesian space, based on the position and orientation of objects of interest (i. e. <b>valve,</b> <b>door</b> handle) w. r. t. a reference frame on the robot. The low level control operates in joint space and is meant as a last resort tool to perform fine adjustments (e. g. release a trapped limb). Finally, our Pilot Interface is adaptable to different tasks, strategies and pilot’s needs, thanks to a modular architecture of the system which enables to add/remove single front-end components (e. g. GUI widgets) as well as back-end control modules on the fly...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the investigation {{is to provide a}} physically realistic model describing the movement of liquid phase in an industrial axial compressor during online washing. ln order to achieve this objective, CFD simulations were developed for predicting the water particle trajectories inside an industrial axial compressor, the rate of evaporation of water droplets on axial compressor blades by inertial impaction, turbulent diffusion, pressure and temperature increments. Simulation of water droplet trajectories and evaporation of water droplet content in designed 260 MW gas turbine engine were undertaken. Two types of boundary conditions have been considered for a droplet. The first is the inlet boundary condition, which describes the properties of a droplet at the entry/inlet position. It was assumed that the droplets are evenly distributed at the inlet face. For the droplet inlet boundary, there were 4 main factors considered, namely droplet initial temperature, droplet flow rate, droplet axial slip velocity and droplet average initial diameter. Each factor has at least two levels, namely the base line level and some deviation or deviations to the base-line level. The second boundary condition is the wall boundary condition, which models what happens when a droplet interacts with a solid wall. For this second type boundary condition, all simulations in this study, the coefficient of restitution of all solid walls was set at very low number, coefficient of restitution = 0. 0005. It is assumed that a droplet that hits a solid wall will undergo a non-perfect rebound. Other than mechanical effects due to the impact of particulates during online washing, the main aero thermal effects are due to the flow changes occurring on account of the two phase nature of the working fluid, heat and mass transfer among the two phases, modification in thermal and transport properties, and changes in chemical action and combustion. Practically, it is not possible, in general, to assure that all of the washing fluid, which entered the engine during online washing, would always be converted to the gas phase by the time the working fluid leaves the high pressure compressor, or even the combustor. Thus, both the state of the fluid and the cross-sectional distribution of washing fluid are of concern throughout the engine flow path, especially the first 3 front stages of the axial compressor. It must be noted that the preceding statements take no account of the presence and effects of bypass <b>doors,</b> vents, and <b>valves.</b> This is a set of devices for which there are no reliable data for air-fluid mixture operation, and thus, no guidance in design or installation. They can introduce major changes in the amount and distribution of the discrete phases of fluid along the flow path in compressors. Finally, however {{there is a need for}} at least one set of definitive tests on selected components and engines. At the moment, there is neither clear view nor experimental data available to validate those said objectives. On one hand, there is no validated computational model available to assist with understanding the complex relationship between the injection parameters and the resultant flow pattern and trajectories of the droplet as well as there is no information regarding the droplet build up on the blade surface in a multistage axial compressor during online washing. Nevertheless, even though without experimental validation, this investigation is very important as advancing tools to further understand the axial compressor online washing phenomenon which is still not fully understood even today. Therefore, post-axial-compressor fluid motion is important in understanding the role of air/fluid mixing and fluid evaporations and will be analysed and presented in this study. More precisely, this investigation tries to quantify the effect of injected droplet parameters on generic multistage axial compressor. As this work is focused on the model (droplet parameter) sensitivities rather than the CFD model itself, presented in this investigation herewith are only the main features of the generic droplet trajectories flow pattern in a multistage industrial axial compressor...|$|R
