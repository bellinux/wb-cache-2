40|$|Pregnancy is {{a special}} {{clinical}} state with several normal physiological changes that influence body organs including the liver. Liver disease can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both pregnant women and their infants. Few challenges arise in reaching an accurate diagnosis in light of such physiological changes. Laboratory test results should be carefully interpreted and the knowledge of what normal changes to expect is prudent to avoid clinical misjudgment. Other challenges entail the methods of treatment and their safety for both {{the mother and the}} baby. This review summarizes liver diseases that are not unique to pregnancy. We focus on viral hepatitis and its mode of transmission, diagnosis, effect on the pregnancy, the mother, the infant, treatment, and breast-feeding. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson&#x 2019;s disease, Budd Chiari and portal vein thrombosis in pregnancy are also discussed. Pregnancy is rare in patients with cirrhosis because of the metabolic and hormonal changes associated with cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding can happen in up to 38 % of cirrhotic pregnant women. Management of portal hypertension during pregnancy is discussed. Pregnancy increases the pathogenicity leading to an increase in the rate of gallstones. We discuss some of the interventions for gallstones in pregnancy <b>if</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>arise.</b> Finally, we provide an overview of some of the options in managing hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma during pregnancy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Women {{suffering}} from recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are routinely treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), but {{the consequences of}} this procedure on antibiotic resistance are not fully known. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of AB treatment on antibiotic resistance among women with rUTIs. METHODS: The study population consisted of 2 groups of women who had previously been enrolled in a randomized clinical trial: group A was not treated, and group B was treated. All women were scheduled for follow-up visits every 6 months, or more frequently <b>if</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>arose.</b> Microbiological evaluation was performed only in symptomatic women. All women were followed up for a mean of 38. 8 months to analyze data from urine cultures and antibiograms. RESULTS: The previous study population consisted of 673 women, but 123 did not attend the entire follow-up period. For the final analysis, 257 of the remaining 550 patients were assigned to group A, and 293 to group B.

40|$|Polycystic {{liver disease}} (PCLD, MIM 174050) is a dominantly {{inherited}} condition characterised {{by the presence}} in the liver of multiple cysts of biliary epithelial origin. It must be distinguished from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 1 (ADPKD- 1, MIM 173900) and type 2 (ADPKD- 2). Both disorders may be complicated by polycystic liver disease, but renal involvement is absent in PCLD. PCLD is often asymptomatic, but <b>if</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>arise,</b> they are usually due to the mass effect of cysts. The phenotype is more severe in females and correlates {{with the number of}} pregnancies or estrogen use. The gene for PCLD has been assigned to chromosome 19 p 13. 2 - 13. 1. Two separate large-scale positional cloning efforts have managed to identify PRKCSH as the gene underlying PCLD. Up to now, all mutations found in PRKCSH introduce stopcodons in the m-RNA, resulting in premature termination of translation to protein. This suggests a loss of function of the encoding protein. The protein, designated by us as hepatocystin, is predicted to be localised in the endoplasmic reticulum. Multiple biological roles have been suggested for hepatocystin, such as a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, binding to advanced glycation endproducts, and a function as the non-catalytic beta-subunit of glucosidase-II. The role of hepatocystin in PCLD, however, remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the prevalence and {{factors associated with}} posterior pole and peripheral retinal lesions in Chinese subjects with high myopia. Methods: Three hundred and thirty-seven asymptomatic adults with high myopia of refractive error ≤- 6 D were examined in a cross-sectional community-based study. All subjects underwent cycloplegic refraction, ultrasound biometry and dilated fundal examination. Statistical analysis was performed to assess factors associated {{with the presence of}} posterior pole and peripheral retinal lesions. Results: The mean age of the 337 subjects was 36. 0 years and the mean spherical equivalent refractive error was - 10. 2 D. Thirty-eight eyes (11. 3 %, 95 % CI= 8. 1 - 15. 2 %) were found to have one or more posterior pole lesions and subjects with posterior pole lesion had significantly older age, longer axial length and higher degree of myopia (all P< 0. 001) compared with subjects without posterior pole lesion. After controlling for axial length, both the severity of refractive error and older age were significantly associated with the presence of posterior pole lesion (both P< 0. 001). For peripheral retinal lesions, 189 eyes (56. 1 %, 95 % CI= 50. 6 - 61. 5 %) were found to have one or more peripheral retinal lesions. The presence of peripheral retinal lesion was associated with younger age and higher degree of refractive error (P= 0. 046 and 0. 002, respectively). Conclusion: Posterior pole and peripheral retinal degenerative lesions were found in a considerable proportion of subjects with high myopia. As some of these retinal lesions might predispose to visual impairment, highly myopic individuals should be educated on the symptoms of various eye conditions and seek care immediately <b>if</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>arise.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and pectus excavatum (PE) {{is not well}} understood. We hypothesize that the combined thoracic malformations of AIS and PE {{may lead to a}} “double crush to the thorax” resulting in greater cardiopulmonary impairment than either thoracic malformation in isolation. We evaluated the Haller index (HI) and thoracic volume changes that occur pre- and post-operatively for kyphoscoliosis and PE by examining the case of a 12 -year-old girl who had a “double crush to the thorax. ” Using posterior-to-anterior and lateral standing scoliosis films obtained before and after both operations we determined the PE severity index (HI). Using the same radiographs a Blender based computational model was used to approximate the thoracic volumes. With correction of kyphoscoliosis the HI acutely increased from 1. 9 to 3. 2 with a decrease in thoracic volume of 11 % resulting in shortness of breath and tachycardia. With PE repair the HI was returned to normal (HI =  2. 4) and the thoracic volume increased 18 %, with resolution of her cardiopulmonary symptoms. When severe kyphoscoliosis and PE co-exist consideration should be given to the implication of the “the double crush to the thorax” <b>if</b> cardiopulmonary <b>symptoms</b> <b>arise...</b>|$|R
30|$|PAE is {{typically}} performed as an outpatient procedure, however, {{it is important}} to warn patients about possible complications, and also for the intervetnionalist to {{know how to deal with}} these complications. The most dreaded complications are those of non-target embolization. Non-target embolization affecting the rectum, bladder, and penis have been reported (Pisco et al. 2016 b; Sabharwal and Popert n.d.; Carnevale and Antunes 2013; Moreira et al. 2017; Moreira et al. 2013). While the majority of non-target embolization injuries have resolved with symptomatic treatment, a few have required surgical repair (Pisco et al. 2016 b). If patients present with symptoms of rectal or bladder non-target embolization, such as hematochezia, hematuria, bladder spasms, pain on defecation, etc., they are referred for proctoscopy or cystoscopy for evaluation. Penile non-target embolization is generally seen on the skin and can be followed in that way. It is important to discuss this potential with the patient and ask them to alert you <b>if</b> any <b>symptoms</b> should <b>arise</b> both at the pre-PAE consultation and on the day of embolization.|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} an {{appropriate}} care for children is not only crucial to mother’s health and well-being {{but also for the}} future generations. Antenatal care is actually one of the best forms of preventive medicine. World Health Organization recommended that the expectant mother would be seen by a physician or a midwife ten to thirteen times during pregnancy. More frequent visits <b>if</b> <b>symptoms</b> of danger <b>arise,</b> the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has emphasized the importance of adequate antenatal health coverage of women by recommending specified pattern of visits to antenatal facilities. So, a study of pregnant women to determine the pattern of their attendance at antenatal care clinics and reasons for non-compliance with recommended patterns in Saudi Arabia is highly desirable. The study was conducted at six randomly selected primary health care centers. Two hundred and ten expectant Saudi mothers participated in the study. Data was collected through the interview method. The instrument consisted of three parts sociodemographic data, obstetric data and questions pertaining to factors that hinder pregnant women for completing the recommended patterns of antenatal visits. More than half of the respondents attended the antenatal care clinic on an irregular basis, with the irregularity caused mainly due to insufficient information about the importance of antenatal care, long waiting time, overcrowding (88. 6 %, 71. 9 %, & 74. 6 %, respectively). Therefore, health educational programs related to the importance of antenatal care and re-evaluation of antenatal clinics services are needed.
