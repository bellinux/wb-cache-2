50|$|The fixed bits at bit {{positions}} 1, 3 and 5, and carry, parity, adjust, {{zero and}} sign flags are inherited from an even earlier architecture, 8080. The adjust flag {{used to be}} called auxiliary carry bit in 8080 and <b>half-carry</b> bit in the Zilog Z80 architecture.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} can {{be extended}} to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a <b>half-carry</b> flag to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.|$|E
50|$|Summarizing, if {{the result}} of a binary {{addition}} contains a non-decimal low digit or causes the <b>half-carry</b> flag to be set, the result must be corrected by adding 06 to it; if the result contains a non-decimal high digit, the result must be further corrected by adding 60 to produce the correct final BCD value.|$|E

50|$|Likewise, {{adding the}} BCD values 39 and 48 {{produces}} 81. This result {{does not have}} a non-decimal low nibble, but it does cause a carry out of the least significant digit (lower four bits) into the most significant digit (upper four bits). This is indicated by the CPU setting the <b>half-carry</b> flag. This value must also be corrected, by adding 06 to 81 to produce a corrected BCD result of 87.|$|E
50|$|A <b>half-carry</b> flag (also {{known as}} an {{auxiliary}} flag or decimal adjust flag) is a condition flag bit in the status register of many CPU families, such as the Intel 8080, Zilog Z80, the x86, and the Motorola 68000 series, among others. It indicates when a carry or borrow has been generated out of the least significant four bits of the accumulator register following the execution of an arithmetic instruction. It is primarily used in decimal (BCD) arithmetic instructions.|$|E

60|$|It took but a {{very short}} time to cross the quarter of a mile of water. The lad rushed in up to his chin to meet them, and was quickly hauled into the boat.

He burst into a fit of convulsive sobbing as he found himself among friends. Nat saw that it was useless to question him at the moment, so he told the men to row back at once to the schooner; then he <b>half-carried</b> him down to his own cabin, brought out a glass of wine, and gave it to him.|$|R
60|$|But {{when she}} stood up to walk, the colour went. Paul helped her, <b>half-carrying</b> her. At {{the top of the}} stairs she was gone. He lifted her up and carried her quickly downstairs; laid her on the couch. She was light and frail. Her face looked as if she were dead, with blue lips shut tight. Her eyes opened--her blue, unfailing eyes--and she looked at him pleadingly, almost wanting him to forgive her. He held brandy to her lips, but her mouth would not open. All the time she watched him lovingly. She was only sorry for him. The tears ran down his face without ceasing, but not a muscle moved. He was intent on getting a little brandy between her lips. Soon she was able to swallow a teaspoonful. She lay back, so tired. The tears {{continued}} to run down his face.|$|R
60|$|When Babbie was plucked off the hill, {{she thought}} as little as Gavin that her captor was Rob Dow.

Then, in the moment that power of {{utterance}} was taken from her, she saw the face that had startled her at Nanny's window. <b>Half-carried,</b> she was borne forward rapidly, until some one seemed to rise out of the broom and strike them both. They had only run against the doctor's trap; and huddling her into it, Dow jumped up beside her. He tied her hands together with a cord. For a time the horse feared the darkness in front more than the lash behind; but when the rains became terrific, it rushed ahead wildly--probably with its eyes shut.|$|R

In the third Test of the 1962 Ashes series, Australia's Dud Beattie suffered a broken collarbone, and knowing {{he would have to}} leave the field anyway (Substitutions not being permitted until 1964), Beattie ignited a fight with Turner, it resulted in the referee sending both players from the field. As Beattie was being <b>half-carried</b> from the arena by an ambulance man, Turner prodded and remonstrated with Beattie for his actions. A controversial last-minute Ken Irvine try against the weakened defence, Mick Sullivan having already been sent off, and the subsequent touchline goal resulted in a 17-18 defeat, although a whitewash was denied, Great Britain won the Ashes series 2-1.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then she}} felt very queer, and was {{surprised}} to see Mercedes regarding her with questioning, searching eyes. After that her queerness came on very fast, and she descended into the hell of pain that is given to women alone to know. She was supported, <b>half-carried,</b> to the front bedroom. Many faces were about her--Mercedes, Mrs. Olsen, Maggie Donahue. It seemed she must ask Mrs. Olsen if she had saved little Emil from the street, but Mercedes cleared Mrs. Olsen out to look after Bert, and Maggie Donahue went to answer a knock at the front door. From the street came a loud hum of voices, punctuated by shouts and commands, {{and from time to time}} there was a clanging of the gongs of ambulances and patrol wagon's. Then appeared the fat, comfortable face of Martha Shelton, and, later, Dr. Hentley came. Once, in a clear interval, through the thin wall Saxon heard the high opening notes of Mary's hysteria.

I was confined to my room, terrorized by the most horrible threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit--see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms--and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call from the window. For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together. This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged. In a sort of dream I remember being half-led, <b>half-carried</b> to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the train. Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands. I sprang out, they tried to drag me back, and {{had it not been for}} the help of this good man, who led me to the cab, I should never had broken away.

60|$|And Eustacie signed her acquiescence, {{as indeed}} no {{difficulty}} {{was made in}} her being regarded as the widow of the Baron de Ribaumont, when she further insisted on procuring a widow's dress before she quitted her room, and declared, with much dignity, that she should esteem no person her friend who called her Mademoiselle de Nid-de-Merle. To this the Chevalier de Ribaumont {{was willing to give}} way; he did not care whether Narcisse married her as Berenger's widow or as the separated maiden wife, and he thought her vehement opposition and dislike would die away the faster the fewer impediments were placed in her way. Both he and Diane strongly discouraged any attempt on Narcisse's widow part at a farewell interview; and thus unmolested, and under the constant soothing influence of reciting her prayers, in the trust that they were availing her husband, Eustacie rallied so much that about ten day after the dreadful St. Batholomew, in the early morning, she was half-led <b>half-carried</b> down the stairs between her uncle and Veronique. Her face was close muffled in her thick black veil, but when she came {{to the foot of the}} first stairs where she had found Berenger's cap, a terrible shuddering came on her; she again murmured something about the smell of blood, and fell into a swoon.|$|R
40|$|Key words: black rhinoceros, browser, corticosterone, diet, density dependence, minerals, moisture, {{physiological}} stress, savanna, soil nutrients, woody cover.   Understanding {{the forces}} that cause variability in population sizes is a central theme in ecology. The limiting factor in populations of large mammals which are not controlled top‐down by predation is food, i. e., such populations are controlled by bottom‐up processes. However, {{there is little evidence}} of density dependence in large‐ to mega-herbivores. Yet, conservationists have managed Critically Endangered mega‐herbivores like rhinoceros as if their population growth were density dependent, i. e., following a logistic growth curve, focusing on large growth at population densities presumed to be at <b>half‐carrying</b> capacity (K/ 2). This would enable them to translocate animals at presumed <b>half‐carrying</b> capacity to retain local population densities and to create new populations in areas of suitable habitat, where animals are considered safe against poaching. This study focused on one such mega‐herbivore, the eastern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis michaeli) to re‐consider the density dependence population regulation in a mega‐herbivore and uses the findings to contribute to possible solutions towards conservation challenges facing this species. The expectations were that increases in population density would result in a decrease in reproductive performance, and that physiological stress levels in animals in populations of high density would be higher than in animals in populations of low densities. Nine populations of black rhinoceros across Kenya were studied, with variation in their respective densities, Plant Available Moisture (‘PAM’ i. e., ‘soil moisture’) and Plant Available Nutrients (‘PAN’ i. e., ‘soil fertility’). Data from available records (1993 ‐ 2010) were used to assess reproductive performance. Dietary quality and levels of corticosterone were estimated through faecal analysis from animals sampled in the field and from data on feeding trials of black rhinoceroses in zoos (dietary analysis only). Woody cover estimates were used to assess available browse for black rhinoceros. Two measures of density were used, i. e., absolute density (animals/km 2) and relative density, i. e., absolute density as a ratio to the estimated maximum stocking density or ‘carrying capacity’. The effects of PAM and PAN, and subsets of PAM (rainfall and temperature) were incorporated and controlled in testing expectations. No evidence for density dependence was found. Reproductive performances tended to be better where PAM was high, PAN was low and woody cover was sparse. PAM was found to be directly correlated with quality of dietary browse. Black rhinoceros populations appeared controlled more by bottom‐up processes through key resources, even though their densities were perhaps too low to fully support this alternative view. It was apparent that the density dependence concept still requires more investigation. Deliberate efforts should be made to secure high PAM – low PAN – sparse woody cover areas for conservation of black rhinoceros. Conservation managers are advised to consider set percentage translocations, as opposed to the current translocation of black rhinoceros on the basis of an imaginary ‘carrying capacity’ and density dependence...|$|R
60|$|Not {{only the}} Indian, but many {{indigenous}} insects, birds, and quadrupeds, welcomed the apple-tree to these shores. The tent-caterpillar saddled her eggs {{on the very}} first twig that was formed, and it has since shared her affections with the wild cherry; and the canker-worm also in a measure abandoned the elm to feed on it. As it grew apace, the bluebird, robin, cherry-bird, king-bird, and many more, came with haste and built their nests and warbled in its boughs, and so became orchard-birds, and multiplied more than ever. It was an era {{in the history of}} their race. The downy woodpecker found such a savory morsel under its bark, that he perforated it in a ring quite round the tree before he left it,--a thing which he had never done before, to my knowledge. It did not take the partridge long to find out how sweet its buds were, and every winter eve she flew, and still flies, from the wood, to pluck them, much to the farmer's sorrow. The rabbit, too, was not slow to learn the taste of its twigs and bark; and when the fruit was ripe, the squirrel half-rolled, <b>half-carried</b> it to his hole; and even the musquash crept up the bank from the brook at evening, and greedily devoured it, until he had worn a path in the grass there; and when it was frozen and thawed, the crow and the jay were glad to taste it occasionally. The owl crept into the first apple-tree that became hollow, and fairly hooted with delight, finding it just the place for him; so, settling down into it, he has remained there ever since.|$|R
6000|$|... "Happily I now {{began to}} come to," [...] the major went on, {{continuing}} his story. [...] "The ball was nearly spent, and {{had given me a}} nasty scalp wound, and had stunned me, but I now {{began to come}} round. The instant I was able to understand where I was or what had happened, Dunlop and Manners, who were half-wild with excitement and grief, made me promise to lie quiet, while they went back to see what had become of you all. Of course I consented. They were away about three hours, for they had to make a circle of the cantonments, as our bungalow was quite at the other end. They brought cheering news. They had first been to the house, and found it utterly destroyed as they expected. That told them nothing; for if you had been killed, your bodies would probably have been burned with the house. Then they went out to the tope of trees where it was agreed that you should, if possible, first fly. Here they found a pocket-handkerchief of Rose's; and going round to the other side, found by the marks upon the soil that four of you had started together. With hearts immensely lightened by the discovery that you had, at any rate, all escaped from the first massacre, they hurried back to gladden me with the news. I was past understanding it when they arrived, for the intense pain in my head and my terrible anxiety about you had made me delirious. It would have been certain death to stay so near the road, so they dipped their handkerchiefs in water, and tied them round my head; and then supporting me, one on each side, they half- dragged, <b>half-carried,</b> me to a deserted and half-ruinous cottage, about a mile away.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{never thought}} of it,” Tom said, “and if I had been told so should only have {{answered}} that what {{was good enough for}} others was good enough for me. I came because Will came. We had always been great friends, and more than once joined to thrash a big fellow who put upon us. But the principal thing was that a little while ago he saved me from drowning. There was a deep cut running up {{to the foot of the}} cliffs. One day I was running past there, when I slipped, and in falling hurt my leg badly. I am only just beginning to use it a bit now. The pain was so great that I did not know what I was doing; I rolled off the rock into the water. My knee was so bad that I could not swim, and the rock was too high for me to crawl out. I had been there for some time, and was beginning to get weak, when Will came along on the top of the cliff and saw me. He shouted to me to hold on till he could get down to me. Then he ran half a mile to a place where he was able to climb down, and tore back again along the shore till he reached the cut, and then jumped in and swam to me. There was no getting out on either side, so he swam with me to the end of the cut and landed me there. I was by that time pretty nigh insensible, but he half-helped and <b>half-carried</b> me till we got to the point of the cliff where he had come down. Then he left me and ran off to the village to get help. So you will understand now why I should wish to stick to him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Meanwhile {{he wandered}} about the courtyard, shunned by some, glared at by others, but watched by all, and {{practically}} {{at the mercy}} of the first casual ragamuffin with a chopper, in there. He took possession of a small tumble-down shed to sleep in; the effluvia of filth and rotten matter incommoded him greatly: it seems he had not lost his appetite though, because--he told me--he had been hungry all the blessed time. Now and again [...] "some fussy ass" [...] deputed from the council-room would come out running to him, and in honeyed tones would administer amazing interrogatories: [...] "Were the Dutch coming to take the country? Would the white man like to go back down the river? What was the object of coming to such a miserable country? The Rajah wanted to know whether the white man could repair a watch?" [...] They did actually bring out to him a nickel clock of New England make, and out of sheer unbearable boredom he busied himself in trying to get the alarum to work. It was apparently when thus occupied in his shed that the true perception of his extreme peril dawned upon him. He dropped the thing--he says--"like a hot potato," [...] and walked out hastily, without the slightest idea of what he would, or indeed could, do. He only knew that the position was intolerable. He strolled aimlessly beyond a sort of ramshackle little granary on posts, and his eyes fell on the broken stakes of the palisade; and then--he says--at once, without any mental process as it were, without any stir of emotion, he set about his escape as if executing a plan matured for a month. He walked off carelessly to give himself a good run, and when he faced about there was some dignitary, with two spearmen in attendance, close at his elbow ready with a question. He started off [...] "from under his very nose," [...] went over [...] "like a bird," [...] and landed on the other side with a fall that jarred all his bones and seemed to split his head. He picked himself up instantly. He never thought of anything at the time; all he could remember--he said--was a great yell; the first houses of Patusan were before him four hundred yards away; he saw the creek, and as it were mechanically put on more pace. The earth seemed fairly to fly backwards under his feet. He took off from the last dry spot, felt himself flying through the air, felt himself, without any shock, planted upright in an extremely soft and sticky mudbank. It was only when he tried to move his legs and found he couldn't that, in his own words, [...] "he came to himself." [...] He began to think of the [...] "bally long spears." [...] As a matter of fact, considering that the people inside the stockade had to run to the gate, then get down to the landing-place, get into boats, and pull round a point of land, he had more advance than he imagined. Besides, it being low water, the creek was without water--you couldn't call it dry--and practically he was safe for a time from everything but a very long shot perhaps. The higher firm ground was about six feet in front of him. [...] "I thought I would have to die there all the same," [...] he said. He reached and grabbed desperately with his hands, and only succeeded in gathering a horrible cold shiny heap of slime against his breast--up to his very chin. It seemed to him he was burying himself alive, and then he struck out madly, scattering the mud with his fists. It fell on his head, on his face, over his eyes, into his mouth. He told me that he remembered suddenly the courtyard, as you remember a place where you had been very happy years ago. He longed--so he said--to be back there again, mending the clock. Mending the clock--that was the idea. He made efforts, tremendous sobbing, gasping efforts, efforts that seemed to burst his eyeballs in their sockets and make him blind, and culminating into one mighty supreme effort in the darkness to crack the earth asunder, to throw it off his limbs--and he felt himself creeping feebly up the bank. He lay full length on the firm ground and saw the light, the sky. Then as a sort of happy thought the notion came to him that he would go to sleep. He will have it that he did actually go to sleep; that he slept--perhaps for a minute, perhaps for twenty seconds, or only for one second, but he recollects distinctly the violent convulsive start of awakening. He remained lying still for a while, and then he arose muddy from head to foot and stood there, thinking he was alone of his kind for hundreds of miles, alone, with no help, no sympathy, no pity to expect from any one, like a hunted animal. The first houses were not more than twenty yards from him; and it was the desperate screaming of a frightened woman trying to carry off a child that started him again. He pelted straight on in his socks, beplastered with filth out of all semblance to a human being. He traversed more than half the length of the settlement. The nimbler women fled right and left, the slower men just dropped whatever they had in their hands, and remained petrified with dropping jaws. He was a flying terror. He says he noticed the little children trying to run for life, falling on their little stomachs and kicking. He swerved between two houses up a slope, clambered in desperation over a barricade of felled trees (there wasn't a week without some fight in Patusan at that time), burst through a fence into a maize-patch, where a scared boy flung a stick at him, blundered upon a path, and ran all at once into the arms of several startled men. He just had breath enough to gasp out, [...] "Doramin! Doramin!" [...] He remembers being <b>half-carried,</b> half-rushed to the top of the slope, and in a vast enclosure with palms and fruit trees being run up to a large man sitting massively in a chair in the midst of the greatest possible commotion and excitement. He fumbled in mud and clothes to produce the ring, and, finding himself suddenly on his back, wondered who had knocked him down. They had simply let him go--don't you know?--but he couldn't stand. At the foot of the slope random shots were fired, and above the roofs of the settlement there rose a dull roar of amazement. But he was safe. Doramin's people were barricading the gate and pouring water down his throat; Doramin's old wife, full of business and commiseration, was issuing shrill orders to her girls. [...] "The old woman," [...] he said softly, [...] "made a to-do over me as if I had been her own son. They put me into an immense bed--her state bed--and she ran in and out wiping her eyes to give me pats on the back. I must have been a pitiful object. I just lay there like a log for I don't know how long." ...|$|R
