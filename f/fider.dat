40|$|In his electronmicroscopic {{observations}} {{conducted on}} the red muscle fibers and white muscle <b>fiders</b> {{with the use of}} M. soleus and M. gastrocnemius in rabbits and cats, the author obtained the following results. 1. The source of functional differentiation in the red muscle fibers and white muscle fibers exists only in sarcoplasm, and no marked differences can be seen between the red and white muscle fibers as regards their myofibrils, nuclei, and sarcolemmas. 2. Mitochondria of the red muscle fibers are either round or elliptical in shape and are dense and numerous in the muscle fibers; while mitochondria of the white muscle fibers are slender and extremely less in number. 3. Mitochondrial cristae of the red muscle fibers are projecting like a cog-wheel but few in number, while those of the white muscle fibers are arranged at right angle to the long axis of the mitochondria and forming a dense crease. 4. Judging from the relationship between the shape and number of mitochondria {{as well as from the}} state of cristae, there seems to exist an intermediary type of muscle fibers between the red and white muscle fibers. 5. The sarcoplasmic reticnlum is well developed in the white muscle fibers. 6. The structural differences of sarcoplasm in these two muscle fibers coincide well with the differences in the function and energy metabolism of the two...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to elucidate the intrathalamic fiber connections of the posterior ventral nuclei of the thalamus. Localized stereotaxic lesions were placed {{in various parts of}} these nuclei in 13 cats, and the ensuing terminal degeneration in the dorsal thalamic nuclei were studied by the Nauta and Gygax method. Within the posterior ventral nuclei, the posteromedial and posterolateral ventral nuclei are diffferentiated. The posteromedial ventral nucleus is further divided into the medial parvocellular and the lateral main parts. The posterior ventral nuclei have intrathalamic connections to the surrounding thalamic nuclei, in addition to cortical projections. Regarding the intrathalamic connections from different parts of the posterior ventral nuclei some differences in termination are noted. The medial part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus, regarded as a thalamic relay station in the gustatory paths, sends fibers profusely to the intralaminar nuclei in a wide sense, including the centre median and parafascicular nuclei, and are connected across the midline with the paracentral and lateral central nuclei and the medial part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus on the opposite side. It should be mentioned that the rhomboid and medial ventral nuclei are not only pierced by decussating fibers, but also receive terminal <b>fiders</b> from the medial part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus. This part sends a limited number of fibers to the lateral part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus and the other ventral nuclei, including the submedial nucleus, {{as well as to the}} dorsal medial, posterior lateral and suprageniculate nuclei, but gives off no fibers to the medial and lateral geniculate bodies or the medial and inferior pulvinar nuclei. The lateral main part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus and the posterolateral ventral nucleus are considered to be thalamic relay centers for somatic sensibility. The former sends fibers to the other ventral nuclei, viz. the posterolateral ventral, lateral ventral, medial ventral and submedial nuclei. It also gives off fibers to the intralaminar nuclei in a wide sense, the lateral part of the dorsal medial nucleus and the posterior lateral, suprageniculate and medial pulvinar nuclei, but send scarcely any fibers to the medial and lateral geniculate bodies. It sends no decussating fibers to the contralateral dorsal thalamus. The dorsolateral part of the posterolateral ventral nucleus sends fibers to the posterior lateral, inferior pulvinar, suprageniculate nuclei and the lateral geniculate body, particularly its ventral nucleus. It also gives off fibers to the lateral part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus and the lateral ventral nucleus, but sends no fibers to the medial part of the posteromedial ventral nucleus or the dorsal medial, medial pulvinar, submedial and medial ventral nuclei. In addition, it gives rise to neither decussating fibers to the contralateral side nor terminal fibers to the midline nuclei. The dorsolateral part sends only few fibers to the intralaminar nuclei in a wide sense. The ventromedial part of the posterolateral ventral nucleus sends more abundant fibers to the intralaminar nuclei in a wide sense and the posteromedial ventral, medial ventral and submedial nuclei than does the dorsolateral part, but gives off a lesser amount of fibers to the lateral geniculate body and the inferior pulvinar and lateral ventral nuclei. It sends fibers to the posterior lateral and suprageniculate nuclei, and only few fibers to the medial geniculate and dorsal medial nuclei which receive no fibers from the dorsolateral part...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the years}} the {{profession}} of interior design has struggled with its identity {{and place in the}} professional world of design. Practitioners and educators have conscientiously worked to distance themselves from the seemingly unattractive and `unprofessional 2 ̆ 7 parts of the field, namely decoration and ornamentation. It seems, however, that no matter what steps are taken to redefine the profession and separate out these unwanted elements their implicit association continues to linger. The late 19 th and early 20 th century Western origins of the field are undeniably rooted in the feminine. Interior design at that time was seen as a leisurely activity to keep housewives, who were unwelcome in the professional working world, entertained. This practice was in complete opposition to the field of designs 2 ̆ 7 earlier European predecessors who utilized architecture and interior design as a non-verbal extension and explanation of themselves. Present day design exists as a flawed combination of both of these practices. Modern media and popular culture perpetuate the professions 2 ̆ 7 feminine affiliation while a consumerist society covets the ideals presented to them on the glossy pages of magazines and catalogues. The professional body of interior design attempts to change the position of the field from within, trying to convince (themselves) that it is not concerned with is ornamentation. 1 The endless refusal to acknowledge it 2 ̆ 7 s actual and marginal position in the world of design/architecture hinders any progression towards changing the overall public awareness and recognition of the field. This thesis is concerned with understanding and accepting the position of `other 2 ̆ 7 as a place of deliverance and creative freedom which can advance the profession beyond its current conventional and restrictive placement. 1.

In this paper we conduct impact evaluation of a pro-poor rural development project in Central America that promoted multiple interventions with opt-in. We identify changed behavior − measure as adoption of technologies and practices promoted − as the first step toward long-term impacts on incomes and sustainable production. In order to control for purposive program placement and project participant self selection to project interventions, we use several quasi-experimental panel data techniques − first difference, propensity score matching difference-in-differences estimation, and propensity score weighted regression − to correct for selection bias. We find increases in adoption of agricultural conservation practices, construction of agricultural conservation structures, use of improve storage technologies, and household savings. These are likely to translate into stabilization of annual crop yields and cash flows, further reduction of stored grain losses, and reduction of risk of asset liquidation. Analysis of project impacts by area of cultivated land revealed that adoption of different practices is related to the farm size, suggesting that targeting project interventions by asset level can enhance impacts. ...|$|E
40|$|Accreditation in home {{economics}} as {{done by the}} American Home Economics Association (AHEA) developed with, influenced, and {{was influenced by the}} development of {{home economics}} as a profession. The {{purpose of this study was}} to trace the historical development of home economics accreditation and to ascertain the current status of such accreditation. The research objectives included: (1) to identify the historical forces and events leading to the development of home economics accreditation; (2) to describe the current status of such accreditation, including current attitudes toward AHEA accreditation and demographic and change characteristics of AHEA accredited and non-accredited units; and (3) to identify possible future trends regarding home economics and accreditation. Historical data were obtained by the investigator through a review of published and unpublished materials and from interviews. Conclusions on the current status were based on data provided on a survey questionnaire by administrators of 215 home economics units. Data analysis provided descriptive and comparative data for each research question. Major findings of the study included the following: First, accreditation as a method to establish and maintain standards in undergraduate professional home economics developed primarily through the efforts of home economists in two associations [...] the AHEA and the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC). Second, in their attitudes toward AHEA accreditation, the greatest proportion of administrators view it as an advantage for their unit, especially in respect to standards of educational quality, unity of home economics as a field of study, status of home economics in the eyes of other professions, visibility of the unit, and importance to the field of home economics [...] factors voiced historically in relation to quality standards in home economics. Third, administrators feel that regional accreditation of the institution is not sufficient, and that specialized accreditation by such organizations as AHEA, the American Dietetic Association (ADA), and the Foundation for Interior Design Education Research (<b>FIDER)</b> adds benefits beyond regional accreditation. Though their costs are high, administrators report that they are worth the cost. Administrators recommend AHEA accreditation for public and private, large and small units. Fourth, a majority of administrators reporting changes over the past five years cited increases in such areas as number of majors and non-majors, number of graduates beginning graduate degree programs, and support from institution administrators. However, one-fourth of administrators reported a decrease in home economics enrollment. Fifth, desirable future trends, as reported by administrators, include AHEA accreditation of masters, specialist, and doctoral level programs; no increase in the number of accrediting agencies; and maintaining present agencies but increasing cooperative efforts in accreditation processes. Presently 50. 2 % of home economics units have multiple specialized accreditation. Sixth, self study is a major basis for accreditation and planning for improved education. Ninety per cent of AHEA accredited units and 60 % of non-AHEA accredited units report having an ongoing program of self study. However, most administrators do not appear to see a direct relationship between accreditation and student competency levels. In home economics as in many professions accreditation has historically been important in the development of the profession. AHEA accreditation is likely to have a continuing and even increasing impact on the profession as more home economics units seek and obtain accredited status. This impact will be guided by those in positions of educational responsibility and authority [...] those who believe in the need for ongoing evaluation as a means to continually improving educational quality in home economics...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Bu tez çalışması, elektrik dağıtım sistemlerinin kayıplarının azaltılmasında reaktif güç yönetimi için genetik algoritma temeline dayanan ve hesaplanabilen bir çözüm bulunmasını amaçlamıştır. Son yıllarda elektrik sistemlerinin her alanda kullanılmaya başlanması ve yaygınlaşması ile elektrik enerjisine olan ihtiyaç giderek artmaktadır. Bu büyüyen ihtiyaç bizleri yeni enerji kaynakları bulmaya ve varolan enerji kaynaklarını daha verimli şekilde kullanmaya yöneltmektedir. Günümüz teknolojisinde bile elektrik dağıtım sistemlerinde bertaraf edemediğimiz kayıplar mevcuttur. Bu kayıplar, sisteme bağlı olan yüklerin çalışması için ihtiyaç duyduğu ancak herhangi bir işe yaramayan reaktif gücün getirmiş olduğu kayıplardır. İşte bu kayıpların azaltılması için birçok yöntem geliştirilmiş ve bu yöntemleri dahada ileriye taşımak için çalışmalar devam etmektedir. Bu yöntemlerden bir tanesi olan reaktif güç yönetiminde kapasite yerleşimi bu tez çalışmasında ele alınmıştır. Kapasite yerleşimi, kapasite yerleşiminin yapılacağı noktaların bulunması veya bu kapasitelerin güçlerinin bulunması olarak ifade edilebilir. Kapasite yerleşimi sistemdeli kayıpların azaltılmasında, gerilim kararlılığının sağlanmasında, daha güvenilir bir elektrik sistemine sahip olmamıza, sistemden çekilen akımların azalması sebebi ile yük dengelemelerinin daha kolay yapılmasına ve sistemdeki koruma ekipmanlarının gereğinden büyük seçilmesini önlemede bize faydalı olmaktadır. Dağıtım sistemlerinin büyüklüğünün artması ile karmaşıklaşan kapasite yerleşimi problemlerinin çözümünde yapay zekaya dayalı optimizasyon yöntemleri kullanılmaya başlanmıştır. Bu çalışmada yapay zekaya dayalı optimizasyon yöntemlerinden genetik algoritma tercih edilmiştir. Genetik algoritma belirlenmiş olan kısıtlamara uyarak, çözüm kümeleri oluşturmakta ve her çözüm kümesini birbiri ile karşılaştırarak en iyi olan yaşar mantığına göre karar vermektedir. Bir yandan en iyi çözümleri bir yukarı taşırken diğer yandan sonlandırma şartını kontrol etmekte ve bu şartlar sağlandığında algoritmayı sonlandırıp en iyi sonucu ortaya koymaktadır. Üç <b>fider</b> 16 baradan oluşan test sistemi ilk olarak kapasitesiz sonrasında ise yayınlarda verilmiş olan kapasite değelerine göre kapasiteli olarak incelenmiştir. Örnek verilen hatta yeniden yapılandırma sonrası sistemin almış olduğu yeni hal için genetik algoritmaya dayalı optimizasyon ile MATLAB R 2011 b ve Opendss programlarının yardımı ile çözülmüş ve kayıpların daha ne kadar azaltılabileceği ortaya koyulmuştur. This study proposes an {{efficient}} and computationally feasible solution approach based on genetic algorithm to the distribution system reactive power management for loss reduction. In recent years, demand of electric energy gradually increase {{because of the}} enlargement and development of electrical power systems. As we know electrical energy can not be stored. Because of this {{it has to be}} transmitted and distributed to supplier. Enlargements and developments of electical power system guide us to find new energy sources and using energy sources that are already using nowadays more efficently. Even in todays technology, we can not eliminate some losses and distortions in electrical distribution systems. These losses and distortions effects electrical energy quality. In electrical energy there are some kind of different losses. One cause of the losses is reactive power. Althought reactive power is known as useless power, reactive power is necessary for machines start-up and because of this there will be losses in electrical systems. Some researchers had been introduces some methods for reducing the losses in distribution systems and they are still working to improve these methods. Most knows are capacitor allocation or VAR management and reconfiguration of the system. Capacitor allocation in reactive power management, one of those methods are discussed in this thesis. Reactive power management can be explained to managing reactive needs of distribution system. This management can be done by finding the best capacitor placement and best capacitor sizing for loss reduction in distribution system. Furthermore this management has to provide quick response to power changes. Reactive power management helps us to have system more reliable, more stable and more quality. For reactive power management all systems have capacitor banks. Systems satisfy its reactive power needs from capacitor banks. Hereby system currents and voltage drop rate of the electrical lines will decrease. Along with this reducement, load balancing could be easier and system protection equipments could select more efficiently. Capacitor allocation and sizing in reactive power management problems are getting more complex because of enlargement of the electrical distribution systems. These complex systems are very hard to solve with traditional mathematical methods. Because of this hardship, some new methods, which are based on artificial intelligence are appeared. Most known methods based on artificial intelligence are genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, expert system, simulating annealing and fuzz logics systems etc. xx Our test system, which is wellknown with its reconfiguration research by Civanlar and his colleague. In one chapter of our thesis, effects of capacitors at loss reduction are examined. Test system solved without capacitors by using POWERWORLD program and losses are calculated. Then the same system is solved and losses are calculated again. Results are compared with each other. According to result, benefits of capacitors are shown. We can understand VAR management importance with this comparation. In this thesis, genetic algorithm that based on artificial intellicence is used for solving the problem. Fundamental of genetic algorithm is based on evolution theory, which is presented out by Darwin. According to this thery best solutions live and worst solutions die. Genetic algorithm basically creates new solutions that calls generation in genetic algorithm. It has its own tools for creation new generation like selection, crossover, mutation, mating and elitizm. After creation of new generation, it compare new generation with initial generation. This comparison would be our best generation for solution. Hovewer, {{it is not enough to}} make just solution comparison. All systems have their own criteria. Important thing is while creating new generation, algorithm has to respect systems criteria. Genetic algorithm can work forever but it has to be stop at one point. The other important thing in genetic algorithm is termination conditions. Termination condition basically defines genetic algorithms worktime. If algorithm does not has a termination condition, it can work forever. Hovewer we are using genetic algorithm for finding quick solution. Therefore termination condition has to be choose according to our target. It should be generation number, time or fitness value boundary. In this thesis, genetic algorithm implemented to capacitor sizing problem for finding best solution in short time. Our genetic algorihm generates solution sets using selection, crossover, elitizm and mutation tools and compare the solution sets with each other, while respecting the identified constraints, and finally decide according to best one lives logic. Our constaints are minimum and maximum capacitor sizes and voltage profile of the system in our algorithm. Algorithm gives value to capacitors while solving the algorithm according to minimum and maximum capacitor sizes that defined in algoritm. On the one hand while moving the best solution set to new generation and on the other hand algorithm checks the termination conditions for ending the algorithms. In our algorithm, termination solution is generation number. When terminating conditions are provided, algorithm takes the solution set for solution and shows that as solution. In final chapter of thesis, same test system is solved with genetic algorithm for finding best capacitor sizing with OpenDSS and Matlab program. Solution compared with original test system’s result and improvement on the result is given. Then some changes applied to our test systems. As second application, system’s datas are increased % 25 and new datas are created. Genetic algorithm applied for finding capacitor sizing. Then this system is solved with POWERWORLD program with original capacitor sizes. Results are compared. Gain of capacitor sizing is shown. Then as third application, datas are decreased % 20 and and new datas are created. Genetic algorithm applied for finding capacitor sizing. Then this system is solved with POWERWORLD program with original capacitor sizes. Results are compared. These two application applied for testing response of the algorithm. One of the most important thing in reactive VAR management is response time of system and our proposed system gives us very quick response for solution. Result shows us capacitor sizing is decreases losses of distribution lines. xxi Then a new distribution system is created for testing the algorithm capacity as fourth application. In previous tests, there was 3 feeder and 16 bus, in new created system, we deleted two of three feeder for enlargement of the system. According to result of the new created systems solution, voltage profile was out of boundaries that we decided. Our proposal is adding a parallel line for main feeder lines and decrase the empedans of the systems. We applided four parallel line to four main feeder and decrease empedance of these lines to half of original. As last application, we solved this new system as proposal solution for enlargement systems and it decreased power losses more than expected. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
