A truth, or {{supposed}} truth, which is really {{the result of a}} very rapid inference, may seem to be apprehended intuitively. It has long been agreed by thinkers of the most opposite schools, that this mistake is actually made in so familiar an instance as that of the eyesight. There is nothing of which we appear to ourselves to be more directly conscious than the distance of an object from us. Yet it has long been ascertained, that what is perceived by the eye, is at most nothing more than a variously colored surface; that when we fancy we see distance, all we really see is certain variations of apparent size, and degrees of faintness of color; that our estimate of the object’s distance from us is the result partly of a rapid inference from the muscular sensations accompanying the adjustment of the focal distance of the eye to objects unequally remote from us, and partly of a comparison (made with so much rapidity that we are unconscious of making it) between the size and color of the object as they appear at the time, and the size and color of the same or of similar objects as they appeared when close at hand, or when their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> was known by other evidence. The perception of distance by the eye, which seems so like intuition, is thus, in reality, an inference grounded on experience; an inference, too, which we learn to make; and which we make with more and more correctness as our experience increases; though in familiar cases it takes place so rapidly as to appear exactly on a par with those perceptions of sight which are really intuitive, our perceptions of color.(5) ...|$|E
60|$|If {{the first}} hundred {{quarters}} were all raised {{at the same}} expense (only the best land being cultivated), and if that expense would be remunerated with the ordinary profit by a price of 20s. the quarter, the natural price of wheat, so long as {{no more than that}} quantity was required, would be 20s.; and it could only rise above or fall below that price from vicissitudes of seasons, or other casual variations in supply. But if the population of the district advanced, a time would arrive when more than a hundred quarters would be necessary to feed it. We must suppose that there is no access to any foreign supply. By the hypothesis, no more than a hundred quarters can be produced in the district, unless by either bringing worse land into cultivation, or altering the system of culture to a more expensive one. Neither of these things will be done without a rise in price. This rise of price will gradually be brought about by the increasing demand. So long as the price has risen, but not risen enough to repay with the ordinary profit the cost of producing an additional quantity, the increased value of the limited supply partakes of the nature of a scarcity value. Suppose that it will not answer to cultivate the second best land, or land of the second <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness,</b> for a less return than 25s. the quarter; and that this price is also necessary to remunerate the expensive operations by which an increased produce might be raised from land of the first quality. If so, the price will rise, through the increased demand, until it reaches 25s. That will now be the natural price; being the price without which the quantity, for which society has a demand at that price, will not be produced. At that price, however, society can go on for some time longer; could go on perhaps forever, if population did not increase. The price, having attained that point, will not again permanently recede (though it may fall temporarily from accidental abundance); nor will it advance further, so long as society can obtain the supply it requires without a second increase of the cost of production.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine if {{the quality}} of primary medical care varies with {{remoteness}} from urban settlements. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of publicly available data of 18 process and intermediate outcome measures for people with coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes and stroke. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Populations registered with 912 general practices in Scotland grouped into three categories by level <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> from urban settlements: not remote, remote and very remote. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean percentages achieving quality indicators and interquartile range scores. RESULTS: Remote and very remote practices {{were more likely to}} have characteristics associated with low Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) total points score (smaller, higher capitation income, dispensing practice, and had lower statin prescribing despite higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes). However, in contrast with previous research, there was little evidence that quality of care was lower in more remote areas for the 18 process and intermediate outcome measures examined. The exception was significantly lower cholesterol measurement and control in people with CHD, diabetes and stroke attending very remote practices and beta-blocker prescription in CHD. CONCLUSIONS: Under QOF, there are few differences in {{the quality of}} care delivered to patients in practices with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness.</b> The differences in achievement for cholesterol were consistent with lower rates of statin prescribing relative to disease burden in very remote practices. No differences were found for complex process measures such as retinopathy screening, implying that differences under QOF are more likely to be due to slower adoption of evidence-based practice than access problems.

40|$|Freshwater swamp {{forests are}} wetland {{ecosystems}} of global importance, especially {{because they provide}} very valuable ecosystem services such as regulation of flood and maintenance of water quality, and provide suitable habitat {{for the conservation of}} wetland ecosystems (flora and fauna). Though they are hosts to important biodiversity as in other tropical ecosystems, their ecology, function and contribution to ecosystem services are poorly understood. With poor baseline data on this threatened ecosystem across the Niger Delta region and the entire West African region, this thesis explores its ecology, biogeography and the capacity to which this ecosystem sequester carbon, in a bid to better prioritize and inform effective conservation and management. Floristic compositions of the ecosystem were varied in density, diversity and rarity across undisturbed, disturbed and transition (mangrove-freshwater) zones. A total of 138 species within 100 genera and 41 families of taxa were identified across the 24 one hectare forest plots; with variations in dominance according to each of the zones. With a stem density which ranged from 94 – 506 stems ha- 1, the ecosystem was seen to be comparable with other tropical forest ecosystems, but were poorer in species richness {{as a result of the}} environmental constraints associated with the swamp. Though disturbance (local factors) influenced the pattern of species distribution to a great extent, environmental (regional factors) equally contributed to this variation. Above ground carbon estimates (AGC) were also similar to other African forest ecosystems, with the estimates varying at the plot level mainly due to disturbance gradients. Other variables that contributed to AGC variations included the floristic composition (which were found to be more carbon dense towards the transition zones), tree structure and climatic variables. Other ecosystem services derived from the ecosystem (timber and non-timber forest products) were found to be a major source of sustenance and income generation at varying levels. Household usage and dependence on the forests were mainly influenced by the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> each community, and whether each of the households had other alternative sources of livelihood.

40|$|Extent: 11 p. Introduction: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} in the literature which indicates that the prevalence of depression is similar in both non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. However, it is generally perceived that factors associated with compromised mental health in rural residents include deprivation and {{lack of access to}} healthcare services. This study examines the relationship between depression and possible determinants of mental health among rural adolescents. The determinants identified were <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness,</b> gender, socioeconomic status and the perception of rural community characteristics. Rural community characteristics examined were long waiting lists and lack of mental health professionals. Method: Respondents were 531 South Australian adolescents (55. 7 % female) aged 13 to 18 years, living outside the Adelaide (state capital) metropolitan area. Respondents completed a questionnaire including: demographic questions; the Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale (KADS); and questions regarding individual perceptions of community characteristics. The data were obtained by self-report, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> was measured using the Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia Plus, and socio-economic status was determined from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Socio-Economic Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage and Disadvantage (SEIFA). Results: The rate of depression obtained from this sample of rural adolescents is concerning; 18 % screened positive for depression on the KADS, 41 % reported low mood much of the time or more often, and 20 % experienced occasional or more frequent self-harm or suicidal thoughts, plans or actions. Depression was related to gender, with more females (23 %) screening positive for depression than males (11. 8 %). Prevalence of depression was unrelated to <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> or the socioeconomic status of the participants. This finding is not consistent with other research that identifies socioeconomic status as a psychosocial determinant of mental health. It is noteworthy that the perception of long waiting lists and a lack of mental health professionals were related to depression but that this relationship was only significant for females. This may be because those who experience symptoms of depression {{are more likely to be}} aware of service availability due to help-seeking behaviour. That this finding is significant for females is consistent with research that identifies females as being better able to identify symptoms of depression and more willing to seek help. Conclusion: Efforts to enhance the mental health of rural Australian adolescents should focus on improving the availability of mental health services, improving mental health literacy and promoting help-seeking behaviour for mental health difficulties. Consideration should be given to the gender differences identified when developing future mental health initiatives. G Black, RM Roberts, T Li-Len...|$|E

This research attempts to shed light on the relationship between thermal efficiency and warmth use. Additionally, researched was what implications warmth demand of dwellings in remote areas in particular may have on CO 2 emissions, household expenditure and fuel poverty. The goal is to develop a method to measure domestic warmth use and thermal efficiency from inside temperature data and to find how various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> influence warmth demand for households and to analyze the implications on CO 2 emissions, fuel poverty and vulnerability of households. This research uses inside temperature data reports derived from smart meters in order to identify areas of high warmth use and low thermal efficiency. Identifying these areas by means of improved monitoring may help tackle fuel poverty and decrease warmth demand. Smart meters reporting inside temperature data are uncommon types although the additional information on inside temperatures can add value for monitoring warmth demand, as this research proves. Monitors reporting the inside dwelling temperature at 5 minute intervals were used and proved able to estimate and analyze the warmth use factors heater activity, thermal efficiency, warmth use and comfort temperature in 369 dwellings in Eastern Scotland. The research shows that remote area dwellings tend to have higher warmth demand which is correlated with their lower thermal efficiency. In addition, energy sources used for fulfilling this demand tend to be more costly and CO 2 emitting in rural dwellings than in urban areas. For further research it is proposed higher spatial and temporal resolution of outside temperature recordings could improve the accuracy with which the warmth use factors were measured, and that humidity, wind speed and wind direction should be taken into the equation in addition to outside temperature...|$|R

The program uses a variety of measures to recruit women to the service and, subsequently, encourage them to screen at two year intervals. One of the stated aims {{of the program is}} to provide equitable access to all women in the target age group. This paper analyses the extent to which systematic variation can be observed amongst women in terms of their screening behaviour, focusing on those who have never screened or are irregular screeners. Data on self reported utilisation of breast screening services was obtained from the 2002 / 04 NSW Health Surveys. A multinomial logit (MNL) model was used to examine the role of socioeconomic status, cultural background, education and region of residence on breast screening behaviour. The results show that lower income is associated with a woman never screening or screening irregularly. Region of residence is an important predictor of screening behaviour, although the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> was not influential in determining participation. A higher number of hours worked was associated with women being more likely to screen irregularly. These results provide evidence of persistent and systematic variation in screening uptake and regular participation. The results also point towards targeted recruitment and retainment strategies that may provide the greatest potential benefits. breast screening, mammography, NSW, Australia...|$|E

The notion of responsiveness opens {{the way to}} a different view on some philosophical problems, such as intersubjectivity and self-awareness. Firstly, the sense of reciprocity involved in responsiveness makes manifest that intersubjectivity must be thought in terms of the development of multi-relational bonds with others. Secondly, each and every action of the Self, as well as the concept of self-awareness is built up by some aspects of otherness.

More precisely, experience becomes a lived event penetrated by pathos. The phenomenon of attention reveals the pathetic dimension of experience {{and the fact that we}} are affected by what happens before being able to respond to it. Therefore, in the experience of attention we are confronted with a particular kind of event, which means that paying attention to what happens is not primarily an action of a particular subject.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) during May, June and July of 2010. It focuses on students who study at {{higher education institutions}} (HEIs) in regional parts of Australia, with particular attention paid to their characteristics, motivations, experiences and outcomes, {{both in terms of}} further study and of employment. The study catalogues a number of existing data sources which can be utilised for research into this population and identifies key gaps in the current collections which inhibit some areas of analysis into students at regional HEIs. Many of Australia‘s HEIs are located in regional areas. There are, however, significant variations in their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness,</b> with locations varying from 2 ̆ 7 very accessible 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 very remote 2 ̆ 7 under the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA). Inevitably, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> is strongly correlated with many institutional characteristics, such as the make-up of the student body and the courses which are offered to students. What is clear, however, is that Australia‘s regional HEIs provide the opportunity to gain a higher education to people for whom doing so would otherwise require moving to a metropolitan area. While economies of scale often prevent regional HEIs from offering the full range of opportunities for students provided by their metropolitan counterparts, they are generally highly successful in educating a significant proportion of the population of regional areas, a population which has a marked tendency to remain in regional areas after completing their courses for further study and, most critically, employment. As such, the presence of one or more HEIs in a regional area is likely to mean that its workforce is equipped with greater skills and expertise than would otherwise be the case. Innovation and economic activity are heavily dependent upon these skills, and in many ways regional HEIs contribute directly to the capacity of regional communities to ensure sustainable development into the future. The provision of higher education in regional areas, however, is not without its challenges. Prominent among these are the higher costs associated with the delivery of higher education in areas which are geographically remote, in which campuses are small and in which student bodies differ significantly from their metropolitan counterparts. If funding is to be efficiently targeted to support the activities of HEIs in regional areas it is first essential that there is a clear picture of the students who study in these institutions. This report provides such a picture by synthesizing data from a range of sources. The scale of these sources varies in both depth and breadth. Nation-wide collections such as the 2006 Australian Census and data from the 2008 collection of the Higher Education Information Management System (HESC) provide data of great breadth, enabling the generation of a comprehensive picture of the characteristics which differentiate students who are enrolled at regional HEIs from their metropolitan counterparts. In contrast, targeted data collections including the Graduate Pathways Survey (GPS), the Graduate Destinations Survey (GDS) and the Australasian Survey of Student Engagement (AUSSE) provide greater depth and allow for a detailed analysis of the motivations, experiences and outcomes of students. Taken together, analysis of data collections which provide both broad and deep perspectives enables the creation of a nuanced and precise description {{of the ways in which}} students who are enrolled at regional institutions navigate the higher education landscape, and the pathways they move into. Moreover, submissions by individual HEIs to the Review of Regional Loading provide background details which usefully contextualise these findings. A number of issues in the identification and analysis of students who are enrolled at regional HEIs are raised in this report. Particular difficulties arise from the confusion surrounding the definition of regional areas and the fact that many data sets identify only the institution at which an individual student is enrolled, not the particular campus. Given the large number of HEIs with multiple campuses, often encompassing both metropolitan and regional areas, this causes difficulty in identifying the target population. Consequently, some of the analyses undertaken in this report are based on only those students who are enrolled at HEIs which are solely located in regional areas. Overall, the lack of a targeted study of students who are enrolled at regional HEIs leads to a dearth of information on many aspects of their experiences and pathways. Despite these challenges, a number of conclusions about students who are enrolled at HEIs in regional areas of Australia can be clearly identified. Key findings: 1. Students at higher education institutions (HEIs) in regional parts of Australia are predominantly from surrounding regional areas 2. Students enrolled at regional HEIs are more likely to be female and tend to be older than their metropolitan counterparts. They are more likely to care for dependents and are more likely to be Indigenous. 3. Students from regional areas who wish to attend HEIs are often prevented from doing so by the costs associated with study, and are highly likely to defer the commencement of their courses for financial reasons. 4. Students who complete their studies at regional HEIs tend to remain in regional areas for both further study and employment. 5. Students at regional HEIs in the fields of agriculture and environmental studies, and who undertake further study, are much less likely than metropolitan students to continue in the same field of education...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply a data-compression IR method in the GIRT social science database, {{focusing}} on the monolingual task in German and English. For this purpose we use a recently proposed general scheme for context recognition and context classification of strings of characters (in particular texts) or other coded information. The key point of the method is the computation of a suitable measure <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> (or similarity) between two strings of characters. This measure <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> reflects {{the distance between the}} structures present in the two strings, i. e. between the two different distributions of elements of the compared sequences. The hypothesis is that the information-theory oriented measure <b>of</b> <b>remoteness</b> between two sequences could reflect their semantic distance. It is worth stressing the generality and versatility of our information-theoretic method which applies to any kind of corpora of character strings, whatever the type of coding used (i. e. language) ...|$|R
