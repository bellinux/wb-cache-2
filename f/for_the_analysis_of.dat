5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational tools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> {{nucleic acid}} thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through {{calculation of the}} statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
