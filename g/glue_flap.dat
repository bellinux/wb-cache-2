40|$|Background: Optimal {{placement}} of dacryostoma and minimally invasive non-traumatic bypass surgery that creates an anastomosis between the lacrimal sac and {{the nasal cavity}} are important to prevent the recurrence of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Aim: To develop a simplified technique of bypass creation. Methods: In addition to optic rhinoendoscopy, virtual endoscopy of lacrimal sac and nasal cavity was performed (n = 15). Virtual endoscopy is based on 3 D computer data processing with subsequent reconstruction of nasal cavity and lacrimal sac visualization. This provides 4 D movement effect mimicking optic endoscopy. Nasal mucosal flap was created using radio-wave Jawad tip, lacrimal sac flap was created through the canal using improved radio-wave tip. Flaps were fixed with Tissucol® bioglue. The whole surgery was performed {{under the control of}} video endoscope (Storz). Results: The analysis of virtual endoscopy protocols with visible projection of lacrimal sac on nasal cavity lateral wall enabled to select an optimal place for dacryostoma depending on the size and the {{placement of}} lacrimal sac. The use of curved radio-wave Jawad tip made possible to create mucosal periosteal flap in all patients. Transcanalicular radio-wave formation of the flap from lacrimal sac wall was easier and safer than endonasal one. <b>Glue</b> <b>flap</b> fixation was technologically easier than suturing. Conclusion : Radio-wave endoscopic nasal mucosal flap creation, radio-wave transcanalicular lacrimal sac flap creation, and flap gluing are a simple and safe method of anastomosis formation in endoscopic dacryocystorhinoscopy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Persistent corneal {{epithelial}} defect {{is caused}} by kerato-conjunctivitis sicca, exposure keratitis, neurotrophic keratitis, limbal stem cell failure, and ulcer after infection. 1 Partic-ularly, the deficiency of the essential tear components, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vitamin A, and of neurotrophic factors, such as acetylcholine and substance P, may exacerbate the lesions. 2 Presently, general treatments for persistent corneal epithelial defect are the application of therapeutic contact lenses, medical treatment, such as the instillation of artificial tears, and surgical treatments including cyanoacrylate <b>glue,</b> conjunctival <b>flap,</b> tarsorrhaphy, and amniotic membrane transplantation.

40|$|Persistent {{posttraumatic}} CSF fluid leakage {{may present}} {{a challenge to}} manage. Failure to address the leakage may result in complications such as meningitis, septicemia, radiculopathy, muscle weakness, and back pains. While {{the majority of the}} leakages may be managed conservatively, large dura defects as a result of gunshot wounds or motor vehicle accidents are best managed by surgical interventions. This may range from primary closure of the defect to fascial grafts, adhesive <b>glues,</b> and <b>flaps.</b> We present our experience with the use of flaps in a patient who had sustained such wounds in the thoracic spine. An island latissimus dorsal flap and a perforator fasciocutaneous flap were used to close the defect. Postoperatively the patient recovered well and the wounds healed without any complications...|$|R
40|$|Anal abscesses and fistulas are {{a common}} part of {{surgical}} practice. Most abscesses simply need to be drained and most fistulas can be safely laid open. Excessive probing should not be attempted when draining abscesses as this may lead to iatrogenic fistulas. A small percentage of fistulas are complex and very challenging to manage. Management involves an accurate diagnosis and a balance between eradication of the fistula and maintenance of continence. A decision should be made, based on clinical evaluation and anal ultrasound (if available), whether the fistula can be laid open. If it cannot be laid open, a loose seton is placed and the sepsis is allowed to settle. Once the sepsis is quiescent, a definitive repair can be attempted. There are various techniques available including rectal advancement <b>flap,</b> fibrin <b>glue</b> and cutaneous <b>flaps</b> {{all of which are}} discussed.

40|$|Fibrin sealant {{is used in}} {{many areas}} of surgery. We present a novel aspect of flap {{insetting}} in the ischial region using fibrin spray to seal the transferred tissue. We analyzed 10 patients suffering from decubital ulcers and assessed drainage output, time of drain removal, as well as complications following fasciocutaneous flap surgery. Patients were randomized to receive sprayed fibrin glue (study group) or not (control group) before wound closure. The mean drainage time was 4 +/- 1 days in the study group and 6 +/- 1 days in the control group (P = 0. 06). The mean drainage volume was 100 +/- 20 mL in the study group and 168 +/- 30 mL in the control group (P < 0. 01). Fibrin sealant led to reduced drainage volumes and duration of drainage, indicating a beneficial effect of the application of fibrin <b>glue</b> in fasciocutaneous <b>flap</b> surgery for pressure sore coverage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgery for {{anorectal}} fistula {{may result}} in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. CRITERIA FOR CONSIDERING STUDIES FOR THIS REVIEW: The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5. 1, Silver Platter version 2. 0, 1950 - 2009); Medline (Webspirs 5. 1, Silver Platter version 2. 0, 1950 - 2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4) and the IndMed (Indian Medline, www. indmed. nic. in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials {{for inclusion in the}} review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. MAIN RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the <b>glue</b> plus <b>flap</b> group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin <b>glue</b> and advancement <b>flap</b> procedures report low incontinence rates. In the review of literature of non-randomized trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, {{there seems to be no}} major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned...|$|R

Design: Prospective case series. Study subjects: Seven eyes of seven subjects who had undergone Gundersen flap surgery from 2009 to 2011 at the Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore. Methods: Review of case records for outcomes after Gundersen flap surgery. Main outcome measures: Surgical success was defined as achieving a stable ocular surface. Complications to be noted included flap retraction or exposure of underlying corneal surface. Results: Surgical success was achieved in all eyes with significant reduction in ocular surface inflammation. No retractions were noted and recovery was uncomplicated. Conclusion: Fibrin glue application is {{a viable alternative to}} sutures in Gundersen flap surgery. It reduces surgical downtime, gives faster ocular surface rehabilitation, and offers similar outcomes to conventional conjunctival flap surgery.

500|$|An {{alternative}} {{proof of}} sufficiency {{can be used}} to show that there are many different flat foldings. Consider the smallest angle [...] and the two creases on either side of it. Mountain-fold one of these two creases and valley-fold the other, choosing arbitrarily which fold to use for which crease. Then, <b>glue</b> the resulting <b>flap</b> of paper onto the remaining part of the crease pattern. The result of this gluing will be a crease pattern with two fewer creases, on a conical sheet of paper, that still satisfies Kawasaki's condition. Therefore, by mathematical induction, repeating this process will eventually lead to a flat folding. The base case of the induction is a cone with only two creases and two equal-angle wedges, which can obviously be flat-folded by using a mountain fold for both creases. There are two ways to choose which folds to use in each step of this method, and each step eliminates two creases. Therefore, any crease pattern with [...] creases that satisfies Kawasaki's condition has at least [...] different choices of mountain and valley folds that all lead to valid flat foldings.|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{assess a}} pedicled {{gracilis}} muscle flap pre-laminated with autologous, in vitro-expanded urothelial cells to reconstruct an entire supratrigonal bladder-wall defect in rats. Materials and methods A gracilis muscle flap was harvested from 36 male Wistar rats, transposed into the abdomen and {{wrapped around a}} silicon-block space holder. Urothelial cells were harvested and expanded ex vivo. Cells were then suspended in fibrin glue and seeded into the gracilis muscle pocket. One week later this pre-laminated flap was transposed into a surgically created supratrigonal bladder-wall defect. All animals underwent such a pre-laminated gracilis flap bladder reconstruction and were categorized into three experimental groups. All surviving animals with urothelial-culture pre-laminated gracilis flap bladder reconstruction were killed 12 weeks (group 1) later. Control rats had gracilis flaps with no cell seeding and treated only with fibrin glue (group 2) or a standard culture medium (group 3) before reconstruction. Results Specimens stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and a specific immunohistochemical staining (AE 1 and AE 3 -anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody stain) showed a continuous, multilayered functioning urothelial lining along the transposed pre-laminated gracilis flap in group 1. All animals in group 1 with an intact urothelial lining on the gracilis muscle survived, in contrast to most animals in groups 2 and 3, where eight and all 12 animals died, respectively. The surviving four animals in group 2 had no detectable urothelial lining. Conclusion Successful urinary reconstruction requires a contractile neo-reservoir resistant to resorption over time and a stable, protective urothelial lining. A gracilis muscle flap can be seeded with autologous cultured urothelial cells suspended in fibrin <b>glue.</b> This pre-laminated <b>flap</b> can be safely transposed on its pedicle and be successfully integrated into the remaining bladder wall, with a urothelial lining and the potential to contract. Further studies in larger animals, with a urodynamic assessment, are warranted to determine if this type of bladder-wall replacement technique is suitable for urinary reconstruction in humans...|$|R
