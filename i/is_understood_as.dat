5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} tiling; at other times {{arbitrary}} colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours {{are part of the}} tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E

The typical Igbo sentence displays subject-verb-object (SVO) ordering, where subject <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the agent-like (external) argument of a transitive verb. Igbo thus exhibits accusative alignment.|$|E

25|$|Like Tefillin, Karaites {{interpret}} the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as a metaphorical admonition, specifically, {{to keep the}} Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a metaphor. Therefore, they do not put up mezuzot, although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the Ten Commandments on their doorposts.|$|E
