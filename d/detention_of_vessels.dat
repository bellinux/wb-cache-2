Such data included sightings, boardings, warnings and <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> The creation of the NSC was therefore created as a single point for the processing of all fisheries activity in the Irish EEZ.|$|E
40|$|The {{disputes}} {{relating to}} prompt release constitute {{an important part}} of the case law of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The frequency of the use of prompt release proceedings may be explained by the fact that illegal fisheries have increased owing to the exhaustion of biological resources. Considering that the exhaustion of renewable resources entails a serious problem, conflicts regarding illegal fisheries and the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> and crews will increase. This study examines the procedure for prompt release under Article 292 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea by focusing on the case law of the Tribunal. In particular, this study addresses the issues concerning substantive and procedural requirements provided in Article 292, locus standi, the relation between proceedings of the Tribunal and of domestic courts, and criteria for evaluating 'reasonable' bond...|$|E

Therefore, the crew and the security guards cannot be prosecuted for an offence under the Arms Act."

40|$|The High Court of Australia {{has brought}} to a close one chapter of the various legal {{proceedings}} arising out of Australia’s arrest of the Russian fishing vessel Volga in 2002. The vessel was arrested {{on the high seas}} immediately adjacent to Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surrounding the Heard and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean. It was suspected (and later found as a matter of fact) to have been engaged in unlawful fishing for the prized Patagonian Toothfish within Australia’s EEZ two to three weeks prior to its detection and seizure by Australian authorities. The circumstances of the seizure and <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> and its senior crew led to a number of domestic legal proceedings in the Western Australian District and Supreme Courts and the Federal Court of Australia. There was also a largely successful application by Russia to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) for the prompt release <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b> ITLOS ordered Australia to promptly release the vessel upon the posting of what it considered to be a reasonable bond or other security of A$ 1. 92 million.

60|$|It is a {{well-established}} principle, asserted by the United States {{from the beginning}} of their national independence, recognized by Great Britain and other maritime powers, and stated by the Senate in a resolution passed unanimously on the 16th of June, 1858, that--American vessels on the high seas in time of peace, bearing the American flag, remain {{under the jurisdiction of the}} country to which they belong, and therefore any visitation, molestation, or <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> such <b>vessel</b> by force, or by the exhibition of force, on the part of a foreign power is in derogation of the sovereignty of the United States. In accordance with this principle, the restoration of the Virginius and the surrender of the survivors of her passengers and crew, and a due reparation to the flag, and the punishment of the authorities who had been guilty of the illegal acts of violence, were demanded. The Spanish Government has recognized the justice of the demand, and has arranged for the immediate delivery <b>of</b> the <b>vessel,</b> and for the surrender of the survivors of the passengers and crew, and for a salute to the flag, and for proceedings looking to the punishment of those who may be proved to have been guilty of illegal acts of violence toward citizens of the United States, and also toward indemnifying those who may be shown to be entitled to indemnity. A copy of a protocol of a conference between the Secretary of State and the Spanish minister, in which the terms of this arrangement were agreed to, is transmitted herewith.|$|R
50|$|All {{the missionaries}} were warmly {{received}} by already operating Christians of different denominations in Calcutta, including William Carey, {{one of the}} Serampore Trio. But Carrey's expectations of them were not high; however, they were soon denied residence by the East India Company on ground {{that they were not}} English subjects—and also, United States and United Kingdom being at war, lately. But, they were authorized to go other places that are out of the jurisdiction of the Company. Under these circumstances—Mr.& Mrs.Samuel Newell embarked for the Isle of France, now Mauritius—Judson and Rice got baptized and resigned ABCFM that ultimately resulted in the formation of a Baptist Board for Foreign Missions in the United States—Hall and Nott, though engaged their passage to Isle of France, an unexpected <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> their <b>vessel</b> made them to change their plans to go Ceylon, now Sri Lanka; however, the arrival of Evan Napean, who was friend of missions and a vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society, as the governor of Bombay Presidency opened a better prospect for them. Hence, Hall and Nott evaded and sailed for Bombay(present Mumbai) and arrived the destination in February 1813. Later, they persuaded the Bombay governor and a vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society to allow them to stay, apparently, establishing the first American missionary station overseas on foreign lands at Bombay called Bombay Mission or American Marathi Mission, commencing the first mission to the Mahrattas. In 1816, he married Margaret Lewis, English woman resident of Bombay.|$|R

Although this was at first assumed to be Girl Pat, the next reported sighting, on 9 June, was more than 2000 nmi km to the west, {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. Captain Jones of the Lorraine Cross, an American ship, cabled Lloyds' agents in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast, 47 nmi km north-east of Cayenne. There were apparently four men on board. The boat's name and markings had been painted out, but she claimed to be the [...] "Margaret Harold" [...] bound for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the crew's behaviour suspicious, and when he asked to see the ship's papers, the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away. Jones said the vessel was [...] "undoubtedly a British fisherman", and thought it was Girl Pat. In Grimsby, a Marstrand spokesman expressed little surprise at this new location, and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting. A check with Lloyd's indicated that there was no registered ship named Margaret Harold.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the application of}} the doctrine of frustration under the English private law of contracts to situations of capture of merchant ships for ransom by pirates operating according to the model which has developed in recent years off the coast of Somalia. The examination is centred on the question whether and how contracts of affreightment (or carriage of goods by sea) (including time and voyage charters as well as bills of lading) which may have been concluded by a captured ship would be terminated in the event of capture pursuant to the doctrine. The thesis analyses the wording of standard carriage contract forms and clauses, as well as the provisions of relevant international conventions and statutes, which could deal with the standing of contracts following a capture. The outcome of the research is that standard contract and clauses often leave the question of the fate of the contract in the event of capture untouched with the result that the doctrine of frustration may apply by default. The contract will only be terminated, however, if an elaborately long <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> is anticipated, or the prospects of recovery, either against payment of a ransom or through forceful repossession, are very weak. The thesis equally considers {{the application of the}} concept of self-induced frustration by taking several examples of actions or default by one of the parties to the contract of carriage which may have led to or exacerbated the capture scenario. The main findings are that it will usually be difficult to establish self-induced frustration in the event of capture. An analysis is also made of the application of the concepts of actual and constructive total loss under English marine insurance law to a ship that has been captured by pirates according to the same model of operation. The consequences of termination of the contract are not discussed in this thesis. <br/...|$|R
