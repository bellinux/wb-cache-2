40|$|Geomaterials {{are present}} in nature in many forms : solid soil or rock, soft clay, almost liquid mud, etc. Geomechanics deals with the {{understanding}} the solid behavior of geomaterials. However, solid ground can happen, under specific external conditions, to turn into fluid : as for example during mudflows or debris flows. In such a context, our work concerns, in a general way, solid-fluid transition in geomaterials behavior {{and the development of}} a constitutive model describing both the solid phase, fluid phase, and the transition between the two. In this framework, we chose to carry out calculations with the FEMLIP numerical method (Finite Element Method with Lagrangians Integration Points) which has shown a strong potential to describe a wide variety of behaviors (including history dependent behavior), in a unique model. Having implemented and validated the first <b>elasto-plastic</b> <b>law</b> in Ellipsis (FEMLIP based code), we have introduced in this code the solid-fluid transition model. This last is based on the evolution, at the failure state detected by the second order work criterion, of the solid elasto-plastic behavior towards a viscous fluid behavior, exhibiting a yield stress. After validation of the solid-fluid transition model in homogeneous cases (considering Plasol <b>elasto-plastic</b> <b>law</b> and Bingham viscous one), we applied this model to the modeling of Sarno and Quindici mudflows (Italy, 1998) ...|$|E

To obtain a well-posed boundary problem and a mesh independent solution, conventional constitutive laws with softening require an extension (called regularisation) to describe properly the localisations of deformations.

40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{loadings}} in {{the pipe}} {{wall of the}} residual heat removal systems in pressurized water reactors can be generally regarded as biaxial fatigue loadings, which may lead to multidirectional thermal fatigue cracks on the inner surface of the pipe wall. In this paper, {{the orientation of the}} critical plane defined by maximum damage under biaxial fatigue loading conditions are investigated by analytical and computational approaches. The analytical solutions of the critical plane orientation for the Matake's and Fatemi–Socie's criteria are first derived using an elastic material law. The computational results obtained from Code_Aster are used to validate the analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of the critical plane orientation using an elastic material law appear to be consistent with the computational results obtained from Code_Aster by using an elastic material law or a Chaboche-type <b>elasto-plastic</b> material <b>law.</b> An analytical derivation is performed to investigate the effect of the plasticity on the critical plane orientation by using a simple <b>elasto-plastic</b> material <b>law</b> with one linear isotropic hardening term.

40|$|During {{reservoir}} production, {{the depletion}} usually induces a compaction of the reservoir layers. To enhance oil recovery, waterflooding operations are generally performed but, in the North Sea chalk reservoir, {{they have also}} induced an additional compaction. This latter phenomenon has a positive impact (improve the ‘Compaction drive’ oil recovery) but endangers the offshore platforms and causes huge extra costs. The coupling effects between mechanical behaviour and fluids flow are thus a key issue in petroleum engineering. Pasachalk program I & II have proposed a constitutive model (referred as Pasachalk model), where the suction is the key parameter to explain the water weakening effect. This model {{has been used for}} the modelling of waterflooding experiment on chalk plug and bi-dimensional reservoir. However, as the reservoir modelling is actually a 3 D model, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to present 3 D fully coupled modelling of a simplified Ekofisk reservoir during production and waterflooding phases. In order to exhibit the influence of the constitutive mechanical model, different studies are performed: increasing the complexity of the mechanical model (from an elastic model up to the Pasachalk one with suction effect). The numerical results show the influence of the mechanical law on the oil production and exhibit that only an <b>elasto-plastic</b> <b>law</b> with suction effects succeeds to reproduce compactions during both production and waterflooding.

40|$|This {{survey of}} {{literature}} was undertaken by ARTEP- the French Research Association for Oil Exploration and Production Techniques- {{at the beginning}} of STAR (=STabilité des ARgiles), a project on the influence of clays on borehole stability. Knowledge of theories and laboratory experiments was indeed felt very necessary to help understanding, and thus becoming able to prevent, quite damaging phenomena. During the time spent on this project, ideas and interpretations of all participants underwent some evolution due to the comparison between theories and experiment, and new procedures and interpretations are being proposed elsewhere. The survey is divided in four sections :The first section recalls the specific problems caused by the occurrence of shales during drilling operations for oil or gas : about 90 % of the problems, for about 70 % of the drilled formations. The behaviour of the shales leads to a classification in four different classes : dispersive, swelling, heaving and brittle. They are spread all over the world, not only on the Gulf Coast of the USA and in the North Sea, where they have been more extensively studied, but also in former USSR, in Asia and Africa. Due to deposit conditions and diagenetic history, they occur at different depths, with different properties : reactive shales, at shallow depths, under-, over- or normally-compacted formations, and reservoir caps. Besides their mineralogical and textural properties, due to the large proportion of clays, they have damaging properties as the low permeability (10 to the power of (- 6) to 10 to the power of (- 12) D). The variety of reactions with water extends from a complete dispersion in mud to cavings or swelling of the borehole, with cuttings ranging from less than 1 mm to more than several cm. This has led to use of various empirical solutions to protect the borehole, with mainly mechanical or chemical objectives. However, it is felt that the general solutions can arise only from a synergistic effort of both rock mechanics and physico-chemistry, hence the STAR program. The second section is devoted to a survey of physico-chemical reactions between clays and water. It begins with some definitions of the clays as solids, from the rock to the atomic level. All clays are characterised by their small size, in the range of 1 µm, and thus, their high surface area : from one to several hundred M²/g. Existence of a layer charge, and of compensating cations is the key of the behaviour of the swelling clays (i. e. smectites) versus water, pure or with cations, which deserve particular attention. Description of the various kinds of water associated, more or less energetically, with clays, as a function of relative humidity RH, or water activity a index (w), helps to distinguish their effect on porosity and texture. Hydration and dehydration behaviour, with a particular hysteresis, is described, in solid-gas systems as well as in solid-liquid, closer to field conditions. Two main domains are distinguished : crystalline swelling, up to a water content of circa 50 vol. -%, inducing swelling pressures in the range of several thousand atmospheres, and osmotic swelling, for higher water contents, inducing pressures in the range of several atmospheres. Influence of nature and amount of cations is examined, mainly for calcium, which induces limited swelling, and for potassium which is both less hydratable and proner to irreversible fixation on clay. Little work has already been performed on the influence of temperature and pressure. Mechanisms of water and/or ionic species transport are reviewed: diffusion and osmosis, without applied pressure, and effect of pressure. Behaviour on compaction, always showing hysteresis, depends {{on the nature of the}} clays, and of the cations, but also on the composition of the solution. It is described using suction pressures or mechanical stresses, which induce different properties of the final solid. Experiments in soil literature, generally performed in the presence of a gas phase, cannot be readily compared to the in situ behaviour of the shales, but give insights on the possible artefacts of laboratory experiments. Caution is thus necessary before any application of literature results to real samples, all preliminary conditioning (initial state and composition of the clay and the water, way of hydration/dehydration, or compaction) being able to modify the behaviour of the clay-water system. The third section sets the problem of describing the mechanical behaviour of the rock formation on drilling. This behaviour depends on initial in situ stresses, pore pressure and temperature, and on the constitutive law of the rock, i. e. the relation between stress and strain. As an example, the Cam Clay <b>elasto-plastic</b> <b>law</b> is developed. Then the laboratory experimental sets used to identify mechanical properties are described : triaxial tests, drained or undrained, oedometric tests, and hollow cylinder tests, the first ones being used to calibrate borehole stability, while the latter simulate drilled boreholes. Specific aspects of shales are then recalled : dependence of mechanical properties on the water content, anisotropy and influence of time. Coupling between physico-chemistry and mechanics arises from the lack of chemical equilibrium between the solid and the liquid. This desequilibrium induces a transfer of water and chemical species in solution, modifying the pore pressure, thus the stress on the rock, and leading to chemical reactions, which have been described in section III. Follows a description of stability models, which should be able to predict mud characteristics for the drilling as well as evolution of the borehole with time. Stability models intend to calculate the maximum/minimum mud weight, from a relevant instability criterion, drawn from well data, mechanical data and fluid properties. The choice of the constitutive law is thus important, and elasto-plastic ones seem the more relevant. Taking into account physico-chemistry has been done generally using an osmoticpressure, with the assumption that the shales behave as a semi-permeable membrane. Even if this assumption is too simplistic, it is still used, but more refined models are being studied, which take into account variations in pore pressures and salinities. The fourth section deals with what actually occurs on application to real wellbore. Improvement of mud formulation tries to prevent any problem occurring during drilling. Evolution of formulation is described, from lime, oil, KCI to polymers additions, and to nowadays constraints brought by environment concerns : requirements may be opposite, and thus compromises must be found. Mud monitoring seems a good prospect. In a second part, availability of representative samples, artefacts related to the recovery and storage of samples as well as choice of experimental conditions are reviewed. It is recalled that downhole conditions are rarely taken into account, and problems like drying of the samples, which induces a suction pressure, anisotropy and cohesion of the samples are rarely considered. The conclusion emphasises that if swelling pressures can now be more precisely defined in hydration domains, the effects of physicochemistry on mechanical properties are still to be investigated more thoroughly. Further experiments should be set in conditions closer to downhole ones, and teams must work together to get all the data needed. This will allow proper stability modelling, with coupling of physico-chemistry and mechanics, to become a predictive tool. Cette revue bibliographique a été réalisée dans le cadre du programme STAR (STabilité des ARgiles) entrepris par l'ARTEP (Association de Recherche sur les Techniques d'Exploitation du Pétrole). Elle se divise en quatre sections: La première section rappelle les problèmes spécifiques rencontrés lors du forage des argiles, qui représentent environ 70 % des formations traversées, et sont répandues dans le monde entier, à diverses profondeurs, donc dans des états de compaction et d'évolution diagénétique différents. Leur comportement a conduit à une classification opérationnelle. Des solutions empiriques, destinées à protéger les parois de puits, ont été mises en oeuvre. Toutefois, il apparaît évident que des solutions de caractère général ne peuvent résulter que d'un effort conjoint en mécanique des roches et en physico-chimie : tel est l'objectif du programme STAR. La seconde section est consacrée à la description des réactions physico-chimiques entre les argiles et l'eau. Après avoir décrit les argiles en tant que solides, et plus particulièrement les argiles gonflantesqui ont une charge structurale faible compensée par un cation interfoliaire échangeable, on s'attache au comportement de l'eau qui leur est associée en fonction du degré d'humidité et de la nature et de la concentration des sels dans l'eau. Le gonflement cristallin, limité à une teneur en eau de 50 % environ, et correspondant à des pressions de gonflement de milliers d'atmosphères, est distingué du gonflement osmotique, qui intervient à de plus fortes hydratations, et induit des pressions de l'ordre de la dizaine d'atmosphères au maximum. L'influence spécifique des cations comme le potassium et le calcium est décrite. Des exemples de comportement à la compaction, fonction de la nature des argiles et des cations sont décrits. Il apparaît qu'une description très précise des conditions de départ et du déroulement des phénomènes est indispensable pour l'interprétation, et qu'elle est malheureusement absente dans nombre de publications. La troisième section traite de la description mécanique du comportement des roches argileuses lors du forage. La possibilité de modéliser ce comportement dépend de l'acquisition des paramètres pertinents, et du choix du modèle : le modèle Cam Clay, qui utilise une loi élasto-plastique est donné en exemple. Les tests de laboratoire sont décrits. Dans les argilites, les déséquilibres chimiques entre solide et fluide induisent des transferts d'eau et d'espèces chimiques, modifiant la pression de pore, donc la contrainte à laquelle est soumise la roche, et conduisant à des réactions chimiques décrites dans la deuxième section. Les modèles de stabilité prennent en compte ce couplage par l'usage d'une pression osmotique, avec l'hypothèse simpliste que les argilites se comportent comme des membranes semi-perméables. Des modèles plus affinés sont en cours d'élaboration pour prendre en compte les variations de pression de pore et de salinité. La quatrième section traite des pratiques de terrain, en particulier des améliorations apportées par une formulation de plus en plus élaborée des boues, pour répondre à la fois aux problèmes de forage, et aux exigences de préservation de l'environnement. La question de représentativité des échantillons destinés au laboratoire, et des artefacts liés à la récupération et au stockage est traitée : en particulier les variations de pression capillaire lors du séchage et de la réhydratation imposent des protocoles stricts. Des conditions expérimentales proches des conditions de fond sont rarement employées. En conclusion, si la notion de gonflement, et les conditions dans lesquelles il peut intervenir, apparaissent plus précisément, l'effet sur les propriétés mécaniques reste encore largement à étudier. Une approche multidisciplinaire est indispensable à l'élaboration de modèles de stabilité qui se veulent prédictifs...|$|E

40|$|The unknown {{interaction}} of the cutting tools with geological settings represents an interesting problem for the excavation machinery industry. To simplify the non-linear aspects involved in the numerical analysis of such phenomena a strategy for an accurate soil modelling has to be defined. A possible approach is the discrete one, by considering the soil as an assembly of rigid spheres. In this work this strategy is adopted. The basic idea is to concentrate at the contact level between the spheres the real mechanical behaviour of the soil. For this purpose suitable contact models have been developed, where specific <b>elasto-plastic</b> <b>laws</b> have been implemented in the node-to-segment contact formulation. The framework for the plastic behaviour consists of a failure criterion, a one-dimensional, rate-independent elasto-plastic flow rule for the normal and the tangential force and a non-linear yield criterion.

The model is formulated using concepts of classical and generalised plasticity theories. The integration scheme proposed can deal with the two plastic mechanisms defined in the model and can incorporate the effects of strains, suction and temperature in the stress integration process. A large scale heating test is analysed to check the capabilities of the implemented model to simulate an actual problem involving complex thermo-hydro-mechanical stress paths. The performance of the model has been very satisfactory and the proposed integration scheme has proved to be robust and efficient in solving a highly non-linear coupled problem...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model using the Finite Element Method (FEM) for the nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) beams, plates and shells {{is presented in}} this work. For this purpose, computer programs based on plasticity theory and with crack monitoring capabilities are developed. The static analysis of RC shells up to failure load is carried out using 9 -node degenerated shell finite elements while 20 -node brick finite elements are used for dynamic applications. The <b>elasto-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law</b> for concrete is coupled with a strain-rate sensitive model {{in order to take}} into account high loading rate effect when transient loading is intended. The implicit Newmark scheme with predictor and corrector phases is used for time integration of the nonlinear system of equations. In both cases, the steel reinforcement is considered to be smeared and represented by membrane finite elements. Various benchmark examples are solved with the present {{numerical model}} and comparisons with other published data are performed. For all examples, the path failure, collapse loads and failure mechanism is reproduced with great accuracy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on the elasto-plastic mechanics, {{the damage}} {{analysis}} and dynamic response of an elasto-plastic laminated composite shallow spherical shell under low velocity impact {{are carried out}} in this paper. Firstly, a yielding criterion related to spherical tensor of stress is proposed to model the mixed hardening orthotropic material, and accordingly an incremental elasto-plastic damage constitutive relation for the laminated shallow spherical shell is founded when a strain-based Hashin failure criterion is applied to assess the damage initiation and propagation. Secondly, using the presented constitutive relations and the classical nonlinear shell theory, a series of incremental nonlinear motion equations of orthotropic moderately thick laminated shallow spherical shell are obtained. The questions are solved by using the orthogonal collocation point method, Newmark method and iterative method synthetically. Finally, a modified <b>elasto-plastic</b> contact <b>law</b> is developed to determine the normal contact force {{and the effect of}} damage, geometrical parameters, elasto-plastic contact and boundary conditions on the contact force and the dynamic response of the structure under low velocity impact are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Weak {{intercalated}} rock {{plays an}} important role in the stability of engineering rock mass. It controls the mechanism of deformation and breakage of rocks. Systematic numerical tests have been carried out to study the stability of surrounding rock mass with different distributions of weak intercalated rock has been analyzed by the FEM software ABAQUS. All of the numerical modelings are plain-strain type with <b>elasto-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law</b> and Drucker-Prager failure criterion. Some quantificational results about the influence of weak intercalated rock are summarized, especially the influence on the deformation, stress of surrounding rocks and plastic zone. Because of weak intercalated rock, the stress of surrounding rock appears the character of discontinuity. In addition, the distribution of plastic zone is also affected. When weak intercalated rocks exist in vault, spandrel and bottom, the situation of surrounding rock is comparatively unfavorable. These results have a certain role in guiding significance to the site selection and layout, the majorization of supporting system and the construction of tunnel of the same kind...|$|R

In this paper, the mechanical behaviour of a {{titanium alloys}} is modelised {{for the cold}} forming processes. The <b>elasto-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law</b> is decomposed in an anisotropic plastic criterion, an isotropic hardening and a kinematic hardening. Non quadratic criteria have been developed by Cazacu et al. (Orthotropic yield criterion for hexagonal closed packed metals, Int. J. Plasticity 22 (2006) 1171 - 1194), to model the plasticity of hexagonal closed packed materials. The implementation of this model in a finite element software switches between two bases, the equilibrium is calculated in a reference basis and the anisotropy axes define a local basis, updated by the deformation gradient. An identification procedure, based on tensile tests, allows to define all the parameters needed to model the elasto-plastic behaviour. Simulation of cold forming processes (bulging and deep drawing) have been done to validate this model. Numerical results are compared with experimental data, obtained from speckles analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} the alloy Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V is characterized using uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, simple shear and place strain tests in three orthogonal material directions. The experimental results reveal tension/compression asymmetry, anisotropic yielding and anisotropic strain-hardening. These features are incorporated into an <b>elasto-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law</b> based on the macroscopic orthotropic yield criterion "CPB 06 " adapted to hexagonal metals. A new identification method for the yield criterion parameters is proposed by inverse modeling of the axial strain field compression specimens in the three orthogonal directions of the material. The sensitivity of different sets of material parameters to the identification method is also analysed and {{the capacity of the}} model to accurately predict the forces and displacement field is discussed. A validation of the best set of identified CPB 06 material parameters is performed by comparing the load-displacement curves in different loading directions for tensile tests on notched round bars with different levels of stress triaxiality and for compression tests on elliptical cross-section specimens, both tests involving multiaxial strain fields and large deformations.
