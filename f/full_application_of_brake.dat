50|$|On railways, an {{emergency}} stop is a <b>full</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brakes</b> {{in order to}} bring a train to a stop as quickly as possible. This occurs either by a manual emergency stop activation, such as a button being pushed on the train to start the emergency stop, or on some trains automatically, when the train has passed a red signal or the driver has failed to respond to warnings to check that he/she is still alert, which is known as a dead man's switch. A similar mechanism is the watchdog timer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} use {{case for the}} ATS system was to alert the {{railroad}} engineer of an impending hazard and if the alert was not acknowledged, stop the train by means <b>of</b> a <b>full</b> service <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brakes.</b> When attached to signals the shoe would be energized when the signal was displaying a [...] "Clear" [...] indication. Any other signal indication would de-energize the shoe and trigger an alarm in the cab. If the engineer did not cancel the alarm within 5-8 seconds a penalty brake application would be initiated {{and could not be}} reset until the train came to a complete stop. Unlike mechanical train stops or other train stop systems, IIATS was not generally used to automatically stop a train if it passed a stop signal and in practice could not be used for this purpose as the shoes were placed only {{a few feet from the}} signal they protected and would not present sufficient braking distance for the train to stop.|$|R

40|$|Vacuum brakes {{are first}} used in place <b>of</b> the air <b>brake</b> in railway locomotives. This braking system uses a vacuum pump for {{creating}} vacuum in the brake pipe.

The vacuum braking system was modified from above said reasons and the same was tested for implementation in both light and heavy vehicles. In this work, vacuum is created and used for the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes.</b> The system operation is somehow similar to air braking system. The main difference with air brake system is that vacuum is used instead of compressed air.

2500|$|Electro-pneumatic or EP brakes are a type <b>of</b> air <b>brake</b> {{that allows}} for {{immediate}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes</b> throughout the train instead <b>of</b> the sequential <b>application.</b> EP brakes have been in British practice since 1949 and also used in German high-speed trains (most notably the ICE) since the late 1980s, they are fully described in Electro-pneumatic brake system on British railway trains. [...] Electro-pneumatic brakes are currently in testing in North America and South Africa in captive service ore and coal trains.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{applications}} in the UK have, in conjunction with advanced SPAD protection techniques, used TPWS with outer home signals that protect junctions with a higher than average risk by controlling the speed of an approaching train an extra signal section in rear of the junction.

50|$|The broken rod was {{replaced}} with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached {{at a distance of}} 533 mm from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during manual release and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> and during emergency <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake.</b> The results showed that in addition to the expected direct tensile stresses at gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied {{to such an extent that}} for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for tensile stress. But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable.|$|R
50|$|The Cineston {{controller}} is {{a control}} lever used in mass transit vehicles that combines the accelerator, brake and emergency controls {{into a single}} hand-operated device. The Cineston controller allows smooth operation of the vehicle, avoids the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> and throttle at the same time, and provides a clear visual indication of the current power setting. However, it is only suitable for vehicles {{that do not require}} steering control, as it is hand operated and thus interferes with the presence of any sort of steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} to the reconstruction of Middle Chinese followed by Karlgren and his successors has been to use dialect and Sino-Xenic data in a subsidiary role to fill in sound values for the categories extracted from the rime dictionaries and tables, rather than a <b>full</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the comparative method. All reconstructions of Middle Chinese since Karlgren have followed his approach of beginning with the categories extracted from the rime dictionaries and tables, and using dialect, Sino-Xenic and transcription data to fill in their sound values. Jerry Norman and Weldon South Coblin have criticized this approach, arguing that viewing the dialect data through the rime dictionaries and rime tables distorts the evidence. They argue for a <b>full</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the comparative method to the modern varieties, supplemented by systematic use of transcription data.|$|R
