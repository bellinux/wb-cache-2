40|$|ABSTRACT Small scale farmers, in {{developing}} and in some developed countries, are faced to actual difficulties of applying pesticides accurately and safely on vegetables crops. They mainly use <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> <b>sprayers.</b> As an issue, a small direct injection system based on a five meter's parallel boom layout was designed to improve chemical application. The boom layout was optimised to obtain the same minimal lag time response for the ten nozzles. The dynamic of the system was modelled using SimulinkTM as first order model with delay. Two control strategies were implemented using PID feedback control loops to monitor tracer injection (fluorescing) proportionally to simulated forward speed (from 0. 6 to 1. 2 m/s) and to control the constant operating pressure (constant carrier flow strategy) or the variable operating pressure proportionally to the injected chemical amount (variable total flow strategy). Different forward speed changes were induced using steps up and down, ramps, sine waves and sweeps solicitations to evaluate the control feedback. The system stability was tested {{for its ability to}} maintain the expected concentration and application rate. The results show that the lag time remains less than 3 s (dead time < 2 s, time constant < 1 s) and the syste...|$|R

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the residues of Bispyribac sodium 10 % SC on rice crop during Kharif season 2013 at Kandikai in Thiruvallur District, Tamilnadu, India. Randomized block design was followed withthree treatments forthree replicates. Bispyribac sodium 10 % SC 200 g a. i. /ha, 500 g a. i. /ha and control (water spray) was sprayed using <b>hand</b> <b>operated</b> Maax battery <b>sprayer</b> with a spray volume of 300 litres per hectare at 15 days after transplantation of rice crop (ADT 45). At harvest, samples of grain, straw and soil were collected replicate wise from each treatment along with the control. These samples were stored in icebox and transfer to the laboratory under cooled condition for analysis. All the residues samples were analyzed for Bispyribac sodium content by a validated HPLC method at the minimum detectable concentration of 0. 01 ppm. The result revealed that no detectable level of Bispyribac sodium in straw, grain and soil at harvest. Thepost treatmentand pre-harvest intervalwas 60 days after transplantation...|$|R

A survey was {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficiency and calibration accuracy of ground hydraulic sprayers in Iran. The {{results showed that the}} motorized lance <b>sprayer</b> and manually <b>operated</b> <b>sprayer</b> were the most conventional sprayers, and fenitrothion EC 50 % and deltamethrin EC 2. 5 % were the conventional insecticides against sunn pest in Kermanshah province. The mean efficacy percentage was 88 % and 35 % against nymphs and overwintered adults, respectively. In motorized lance sprayers, there were 5 % and 90 % overdosage of fenitrothion and deltamethrin, respectively; while, in manually carried sprayers, there were 5 % and 25 % overdosage of fenitrothion and deltamethrin, respectively. Applied dosages were 5 - 20 % and 25 - 90 % more than recommended dosages of fenitrothion and deltamethrin, respectively.

40|$|Some of the {{technical}} and operational aspects of using motorised mistblowers on tropical crops such as cocoa are described. Mistblowers are often used in centrally co-ordinated control campaigns in Ghana, with these sprayers currently used for applying pyrethroid, neonicatinoid and remaining stocks of organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides against cocoa mirids (Sahlbergella singularis and Distantiella theobromae). Mistblowers are preferred since cocoa trees in West Africa are often extremely tall, and a high work rate enables timely application. Our current research focuses on optimising delivery systems for alternative microbial control agents (MCAs), such as Beauveria bassiana, and assessing their efficacy. The influence of droplet size on the dose transfer of both chemicals and MCAs to insect pests is discussed, together with the logistics and economics of mistblower use in comparison with manually <b>operated</b> <b>sprayers</b> [...] Clearly, research to update cocoa mirid control techniques is needed, but much {{could be done to}} improve the implementation of known techniques: using established protocols and equipment specifications...|$|R
