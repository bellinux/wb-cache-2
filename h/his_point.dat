5|$|In 2013, Geesin {{produced}} a book, The Flaming Cow, which documented {{his experience with}} working with Pink Floyd, including the making of this album from <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view.|$|E
5|$|Barris {{remained}} {{heavily involved}} in production {{in an attempt to}} portray the film from <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts to lower their salaries. The film was released to respectful reviews from critics and was modestly successful at the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Contested over 160laps, {{it was the}} thirtieth race of the 1998 season. Jeff Gordon of Hendrick Motorsports {{took his}} {{eleventh}} win of the season, while Bobby Labonte finished second and Mike Skinner finished third. Gordon retained <b>his</b> <b>point</b> lead {{on the way to}} his third Winston Cup championship title.|$|E
50|$|Coming off a win at the Brickyard 400, Dale Jarrett {{finished}} fourth to gain twenty-four <b>points</b> on <b>his</b> <b>points</b> lead over Mark Martin. <b>His</b> <b>points</b> lead was at 300 {{points at the}} end of the race.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} pointing gestures in a high-functioning {{boy with}} autism. We analyzed <b>his</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures in <b>his</b> mother's record. nursery nurse's record and VTR records between 0 : 06 and 5 : 10 of age. The observed period was divided 3 levels {{on the basis}} of the functioning of self-regulation. These were non-regulation. regulation-by-others and self-regulation. Based on these levels. <b>his</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures were analyzed. Results were as follows: <b>his</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures showed the change depending on which level of selfregulation was. In non-regulation level (0 : 06 - 3 : 04 yrs), <b>his</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures were tracing movements, that is, synchronized with mother's one. Next level (3 : 05 - 3 : 09 yrs), that was tracing reciprocity of mutual exchanges. Final level (3 : 10 - 5 : 10 yrs), that was intrusion into physical world from representational world. It should be pointed that these characteristics of <b>his</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures suggest universal ones in high-functioning children with autism...|$|R
5000|$|On 31 May, the UCI annulled all results {{obtained}} by then rankings leader Alejandro Valverde, and removed <b>his</b> <b>points,</b> as {{he received a}} suspension due to {{his involvement in the}} Operación Puerto doping case. The two-year suspension was in part retroactive, dating from 1 January 2010. <b>His</b> <b>points</b> were also removed from his team, , and the Spanish national score, both of which had previously been {{at the top of their}} rankings. [...] Valverde's points for final position were reallocated: <b>his</b> <b>points</b> gained in individual stages of stage races were deleted.|$|R
5|$|On November 6, 2009, Eiland-Hall {{wrote to}} Beck, giving him {{control of the}} domain free of charge, and {{providing}} Beck with its username and password. Eiland-Hall wrote {{that he had made}} <b>his</b> <b>point,</b> and the act of filing the complaint exacerbated the situation for the complainant. Eiland-Hall explained his rationale for giving away the domain name, citing his desire to protect the applicability of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been satisfied.|$|E
5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his own childhood, though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt {{to make sense of}} life from <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view.|$|E
5|$|The play is a {{statement}} {{on the idea that}} a man is valued by his position in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end and Miller uses Loman to make <b>his</b> <b>point</b> against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E
50|$|Each {{players will}} be given 10 or 20 points in the {{beginning}} and the game lasts until a player loses all of <b>his</b> <b>points.</b> If a player loses all <b>his</b> <b>points,</b> the player with the highest points will be declared winner. The player with the next higher point will be declared a runner-up.|$|R

5|$|While we did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring <b>his</b> <b>point</b> by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate <b>his</b> <b>point.</b> The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} season, Brewer became a leader on the Cougars' blue line. He {{was named to}} play for Team Orr in the 1997 CHL Top Prospects Game in February 1997 at Maple Leaf Gardens. He doubled <b>his</b> <b>point</b> total from the {{previous}} season, finishing with 29 points in 71 games played. Brewer followed his regular season by helping the Cougars go on a playoff run. After clinching the last spot in the West Division with a losing record, the Cougars defeated the number-one seed Portland Winter Hawks in the conference quarterfinals and the third-ranked Spokane Chiefs in the conference semifinals before finally losing to the second-ranked Seattle Thunderbirds in the Western Conference final. Brewer finished this run with six points in the Cougars' fifteen games.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make <b>his</b> <b>point.</b> He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E

5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating. Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves <b>his</b> <b>point</b> by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance. Once inside the ambulance, Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{versions}} the {{two houses}} had passed were not identical, the bill {{returned to the}} House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment. The Speaker, Champ Clark, felt that {{the title of the}} bill might have to be changed for reasons he did not explain, but Hayden disagreed and Clark did not press <b>his</b> <b>point.</b> The bill passed the House, and was enacted by the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918.|$|E

5|$|The British Admiralty's {{official}} report {{into the}} disaster condemned the defences at Scapa Flow, and censured Sir Wilfred French, Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland, for their unprepared state. French {{was placed on}} the retired list, despite having warned the previous summer of Scapa Flow's deficient anti-submarine defences, and volunteering to bring a small ship or submarine himself past the blockships to prove <b>his</b> <b>point.</b> On Churchill's orders, the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow were sealed with concrete causeways linking Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland. Constructed largely by Italian prisoners of war, the Churchill Barriers, as they became known, were essentially complete by September 1944, though they were not opened officially until just after VE Day in May 1945. They now form part of the transport infrastructure of Orkney, carrying the A961 road between the islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him starting 14th and {{marked the first time}} he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue <b>his</b> <b>point</b> scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino and a lack of grip in Spain meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E
5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting <b>his</b> <b>point</b> of view concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received {{as a result of}} Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to not intervene.|$|E
