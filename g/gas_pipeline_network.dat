25|$|Starting {{from a new}} {{compressor}} station at Felindre near Swansea the pipeline runs to Corse near Tirley, Gloucestershire, where it connects with the existing <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>network.</b> To permit the new pipeline to operate at the intended 94 barg, a Pressure Reduction Installation (PRI) is required before it joins the existing National Transmission System – the 'motorway' of gas distribution in the UK. National Grid applied to Forest of Dean District Council in 2006 for planning permission to construct a PRI at Corse but this was refused by the Council and an appeal against that decision was refused by the Secretaries of State in December 2007. An application to construct a PRI on a second site, 400 metres from the first site, was lodged with Tewkesbury Borough Council in 2008 but was refused unanimously by that Council's Planning Committee on 2 February 2010. National Grid appealed against that decision.|$|E
25|$|In Finland {{district}} heating {{accounts for about}} 50% of the total heating market, 80% of which is produced by {{combined heat and power}} plants. Over 90% of apartment blocks, {{more than half of all}} terraced houses, and the bulk of public buildings and business premises are connected to a {{district heating}} network. Natural gas is mostly used in the south-east <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>network,</b> imported coal is used in areas close to ports, and peat is used in northern areas where peat is a natural resource. Other renewables, such as wood chips and other paper industry combustible by-products, are also used, as is the energy recovered by the incineration of municipal solid waste. Industrial units which generate heat as an industrial by-product may sell otherwise waste heat to the network rather than release it into the environment. Excess heat and power from pulp mill recovery boilers is a significant source in mill towns. In some towns waste incineration can contribute as much as 8% of the district heating heat requirement. Availability is 99.98% and disruptions, when they do occur, usually reduce temperatures by only a few degrees.|$|E

2500|$|Transportation {{and supply}} is an {{important}} aspect of the gas business, since natural gas reserves are normally quite distant from consumer markets. Natural gas has far more volume than oil to transport, and most gas is transported by pipelines. There is a natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>network</b> in the former Soviet Union, Europe and North America. Natural gas is less dense, even at higher pressures. Natural gas will travel much faster than oil through a high-pressure pipeline, but can transmit only about a fifth of the amount of energy per day due to the lower density. [...] Natural gas is usually liquefied to LNG {{at the end of the}} pipeline, prior to shipping.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its low density, it is {{not easy}} to store natural gas or to {{transport}} it by vehicle. Natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many existing pipelines in America are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated, causing significant price differences across countries. [...] In Western Europe, the <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>network</b> is already dense. New pipelines are planned or under construction in Eastern Europe and between gas fields in Russia, Near East and Northern Africa and Western Europe. See also List of natural gas pipelines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{fuel cost}} {{minimization}} problem on steady-state natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks</b> system is addressed. From the optimization perspective, {{this problem is}} modeled as a (non-convex) nonlinear program (NLP), where we consider two types of decision continuous variables: mass flow rate through each arc and pressure value at each node. The proposed method consists of two phases. In phase 1, a set of feasible flows is found by a reduction technique, which makes use of a pre-processing procedure. Then, in phase 2, an optimal set of pressures is found (for the given flow) by applying a non-sequential dynamic programming technique. This method avoids the many numerical difficulties inherent to this very complex while treated with classical nonlinear programming techniques. We work with several different types of topologies, many of those being cyclic structures. A computational study reveals {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed procedure when tested over a wide variety of problem instances.

40|$|Natural gas is {{considered}} {{an important source of}} energy in the world. By increasing growth of urbanization, urban <b>gas</b> <b>pipelines</b> which transmit natural <b>gas</b> from transmission <b>pipelines</b> to consumers, will become a dense network. The increase in the density of urban pipelines will influence probability of occurring bad accidents in urban areas. These accidents have a catastrophic effect on people and their property. Within the next few years, risk mapping will become an important component in urban planning and management of large cities in order to decrease the probability of accident and to control them. Therefore, it is important to assess risk values and determine their location on urban map using an appropriate method. In the history of risk analysis of urban natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks,</b> the <b>pipelines</b> has always been considered one by one and their density in urban area has not been considered. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of several pipelines on the risk value of a specific grid point. This paper outlines a quantitative risk assessment method for analysing the risk of urban natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> <b>networks.</b> It consists of two main parts: failure rate calculation where the EGIG historical data are used and fatal length calculation that involves calculation of gas release and fatality rate of consequences. We consider jet fire, fireball and explosion for investigating the consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> failure.
