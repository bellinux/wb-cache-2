5|$|Bengaluru FC {{began the}} season in good form and {{finished}} the first month {{on top of the}} table. Defeat to the previous season league champions Mohun Bagan in February saw the club slip into second place until the final month of the season. However, the club then went seven games unbeaten to return {{to the top of the}} table by April. The title was secured on 17 April when Bengaluru FC defeated Salgaocar at home. After the I-League season, the club were knocked out of the Federation Cup in the first round of the competition by Aizawl. The club started their AFC Cup campaign slowly, losing their first two group stage matches. Three victories in a row however saw Bengaluru FC qualify for the knockout stages. In the Round of 16 the club defeated Kitchee to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in club history. 26 different players represented the club in three competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers. Bengaluru FC's top goalscorer was Sunil Chhetri, who scored 9 goals in 20 <b>games.</b> <b>This</b> <b>season</b> was also the last that Bengaluru FC would be under their first coach Ashley Westwood.

25|$|Martin Škrtel was {{the first}} signing by Liverpool in the January {{transfer}} window. The undisclosed fee was rumoured to be £6.5 million, {{which would be the}} highest amount paid by the club for a defender. Mohamed Sissoko, who had found himself playing fewer games after the arrivals of Javier Mascherano and Lucas, transferred to Juventus, and Jack Hobbs, who had played some first team <b>games</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> joined Scunthorpe United on loan {{until the end of the}} season.|$|E

He added 6 rebounds, 4 assists and a block {{in one of his}} better {{all-around}} <b>games</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> which all went to naught as they lost another close game. He scored the game-tying baskets in the regulation and first OT period before he fouled out with 12.9 seconds left in the second OT.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{finished}} the 2014–15 season averaging 13.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 61 games. Despite missing 21 <b>games</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> as he successfully rehabilitated a torn left labrum injury instead of opting for season-ending surgery, Gordon {{had the best}} long-range shooting year of his career. He was 141-of-315, 44.8 percent, from beyond the three-point line, besting his career-high by more than five percentage points, finishing second in the league behind Kyle Korver. Gordon helped the Pelicans qualify for the playoffs. In his playoff debut, Gordon recorded 16 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists and was 4-of-7 from the three-point line, ending with a 106–99 loss to the Golden State Warriors. In Game 4, Gordon recorded 29 points, 3 rebounds and 5 assists, but his performance was not enough as the Pelicans were swept by the Warriors in the first round.|$|E
25|$|As he {{had done}} in 1989–90, Malone {{finished}} the 1991–92 season second {{in the league in}} scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year. It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the 1992 NBA Playoffs, the team made the Western Conference Finals {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Malone scored 40 or more points in five <b>games</b> <b>this</b> <b>season.</b> Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a flagrant foul. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the Detroit Pistons, Malone elbowed the Pistons' Isiah Thomas on the head. Thomas needed 40 stitches on his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000. In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz left the playoffs for the second straight season to the Portland Trail Blazers. Malone averaged 29.1 points on 52.1% shooting and 11.9 rebounds in the 1992 playoffs.|$|E
25|$|After {{serving his}} suspension, Green {{returned}} {{to play in}} Game 6. Game 6 was played on June 16, exactly one year after Golden State won Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals, which was also played in Cleveland. Unlike in the 2015 NBA Finals, however, the Warriors failed to clinch the title in Game 6. The Warriors were outscored 11–31 by the Cavaliers in the first quarter, and Cleveland never relinquished their lead as Golden State lost 101–115. This was {{only the second time}} in 105 <b>games</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> (regular-season and postseason) that the Warriors lost at least two straight games in a row. The loss evened the series at three games apiece, forcing a Game 7, the first Game 7 in an NBA Finals appearance in Golden State franchise history. During the fourth quarter of Game 6, Stephen Curry, who set the record for most three-pointers in an NBA Finals series during the game (28), fouled out with his sixth personal foul. Curry angrily responded by throwing his mouthguard into the stands and hit a fan, which resulted in a technical foul and the first ejection of his career. It was the first time in 20 years that a player had been ejected from an NBA Finals game. After the game, Curry received a $25,000 fine for his actions, but was not suspended for Game 7. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr also received a $25,000 fine for his criticism of the officiating, which he felt was biased against Curry, in the post-game press conference.|$|E
