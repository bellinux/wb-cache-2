Without knowing the correct time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches {{on the basis of}} Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E

Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E

5|$|In later years, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> for parishioners {{to travel}} to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church {{eventually}} had many chapels of ease, as {{the population of the}} parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E

5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E

Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first result}} of computability theory <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> in general {{to predict what}} a Turing-complete program will do over an {{arbitrarily}} long time. For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine for every program-input pair whether the program, operating on the input, will eventually stop or will continue forever (see halting problem). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to determine whether the}} program will return [...] "true" [...] or whether it will return [...] "false". For any characteristic of the program's eventual output, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine whether this characteristic will hold. This can cause problems in practice when analyzing real-world computer programs. One way to avoid this is to cause programs to stop executing after a fixed period of time (timeout), or to limit the power of flow control instructions. Such systems are not Turing complete by design.|$|R

40|$|In her article, Michaels (2000) defined {{action as}} "a {{temporally}} bounded, observable, goal-directed movement (or non-movement) that entails intention, {{the detection of}} information, and a lawful relation between that information and the movement" (p. 251). She defined perception as "the detection of information" (p. 244). This forces one to conclude that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to study action separately from perception. We argue that perceptual judgments are communicated by movements and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to distinguish movements reporting perceptual judgments from other movements, so we conclude that the reverse also <b>is</b> true: <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to study perception separately from action...|$|R
5|$|For {{various reasons}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to apply {{some of the}} terms of the Act. Less {{eligibility}} was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E

Joan of Arc's involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned at the stake. The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful Fabian tactics of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.|$|E
