These forward contracts were private contracts between buyers and sellers and became the forerunner to today's exchange-traded futures contracts.

40|$|Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to discover, whether <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds differ from mutual funds for which both employ passive replication strategies and to examine if mutual funds have incurred a decrease in monthly cash flows due to the emergence of <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds. Summary <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds and mutual funds are similar investment vehicles. Due to the existence of passively managed funds of both types, the question arises, whether they provide similar returns with similar risk. The literature explains the differences of both fund types and finally the empirical analysis aims to discover whether there are significant differences in what they provide. Additionally, due to the proliferation of <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds all over the developed capital markets, one would think that due to their similarity with mutual funds, they would eventually replace them. Conclusions No statistical evidence of any differences in <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund and mutual fund returns, risk, risk-adjusted returns or index tracking. Mutual funds have not incurred lower cash flows on a cumulative basis. <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds and mutual funds can possibly coexist because both have their own users depending on the investment horizon, tax structure or the monetary situation of the investor among other factors...|$|R
25|$|A rand {{was worth}} US$1.40 {{from the time}} of its {{inception}} in 1961 until late in 1971. Its value thereafter fluctuated as various exchange rate dispensations were implemented by the South African authorities. By the early 1980s high inflation and mounting political pressure combined with sanctions placed against the country due to apartheid started to erode its value. The currency broke above parity with the dollar {{for the first time in}} March 1982, and continued to trade between R1 and R1.30 to the dollar until June 1984, when depreciation of the currency gained momentum. By February 1985, it was trading over R2 per dollar, and in July that year, all foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> was suspended for three days to try to stop the depreciation.|$|E

25|$|Foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> {{increased}} by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010, {{and has more}} than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an asset class, the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of retail investors as an important market segment. The growth of electronic execution and the diverse selection of execution venues has lowered transaction costs, increased market liquidity, and attracted greater participation from many customer types. In particular, electronic trading via online portals has made it easier for retail traders to trade in the foreign exchange market. By 2010, retail trading was estimated to account for up to 10% of spot turnover, or $150 billion per day (see below: Retail foreign exchange traders).|$|E

Since the introduction of <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds in South Africa, starting with the listing of the Satrix 40 in November 2000, <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds have emerged as a viable investment alternative to unit trust funds. Given that <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds are available at low cost, and that they are likely to outperform active funds of similar risk, the question is: would an investor be better off investing in an <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund than in a unit trust portfolio. The purpose of this research was to compare the performance of an aggregate domestic general equity unit trust fund, to that of the Satrix 40, an <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund, and to determine if an investor {{would have been better off}} investing with the aggregate general equity unit trust manager or in the Satrix 40. Results from the comparative study of performance indicate that, after costs, the cumulative average abnormal returns of the Satrix 40 are significantly more than those for an aggregate general equity unit trust portfolio. This suggests that an investor would have been better off investing with the Satrix 40...|$|R
