5|$|Silver {{was born}} on September 2, 1928, in Norwalk, Connecticut. His mother, Gertrude, was from Connecticut; his father, John Tavares Silver, {{was born on}} the island of Maio, Cape Verde, and emigrated to the United States as a young man. She was a maid and sang in a church choir; he worked for a tire company. Horace had a much older half-brother, Eugene Fletcher, from his mother's first marriage, and was the third child <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> after John, who lived to 6 months, and Maria, who was stillborn.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{opened on}} 14 August 1985. The police gave {{evidence}} {{that it was a}} murder–suicide, and the bodies were released. The Bambers and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried. Bamber's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved. He sobbed during the funeral service <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by his girlfriend. Several family members and friends alleged that, later at the wake, he was smiling and joking.|$|E
5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E

5|$|Louise Nevelson {{was born}} Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Perislav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a {{contractor}} and lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson's relatives {{had begun to}} leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s. The Berliawskys had to stay behind, as Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents.</b> While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father's departure that she became mute for six months.|$|E
5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E
5|$|Verdi paid close {{attention}} to his financial contracts, making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For I Lombardi and Ernani (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); Attila and Macbeth (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on. He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased Il Pulgaro, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> from May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli ({{now known as the}} Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street. In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family. It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the Villa Verdi, where he lived from 1851 until his death.|$|E
50|$|Having {{come through}} the youth system of Lazio, Mancini was sent on loan to Varese in 2009 without having played a senior game <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent</b> club. However, he failed to make a senior {{appearance}} at Varese also and the following season was sent to Lumezzane.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Daniels reprised {{his role}} as Mr. Feeny in the pilot episode of the Boy Meets World spinoff, Girl Meets World. His role was a cameo at the end credits praising the adult Cory Matthews <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parenting.</b> He made two {{additional}} appearances in the second season.|$|R
25|$|After the Mayflower sailed, Katherine {{made another}} attempt to {{challenge}} the decision through the courts. It was this legal action in early 1622 before Chief Justice James Ley {{which led to the}} statement from Samuel explaining where he sent the children and why, the historical evidence <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent's</b> history.|$|R

25|$|As of 1920, Ford {{was still}} living in Los Angeles, as 26-year-old Wallie D. Ford, with his 25-year-old wife, Hazel. In the 1920 United States Census he {{reported}} his race as white, his occupation as a proprietor of a restaurant, and gave his place of birth as New Zealand. He provided no known place of birth <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> nor his date of immigration.|$|E
25|$|A quiet child, Curly rarely caused {{problems}} <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> (something {{older brothers}} Moe and Shemp excelled in). He was a mediocre student but excelled {{as an athlete}} on the school basketball team. He didn't graduate from high school, and instead he kept himself busy with odd jobs and constantly following his older brothers, whom he idolized. He was also an accomplished ballroom dancer and singer and regularly turned up at the Triangle Ballroom in Brooklyn, occasionally bumping into George Raft.|$|E
5000|$|Lawrence (Larry) Roberts {{grew up in}} Westport, Connecticut {{as the son of}} Elliott and Elizabeth Roberts, {{who both}} had earned their doctorates in chemistry. [...] During his youth, he built a Tesla coil, {{assembled}} a television, and designed a telephone network built from transistors <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent's</b> Girl Scout camp.|$|R
50|$|Gospel {{started playing}} the drums {{at the age}} of 7 and the {{keyboard}} {{at the age of}} 9. <b>His</b> love <b>for</b> playing the keyboard and making beats grew as he played and performed in <b>his</b> <b>parent’s</b> church and at different concerts around his community. Gospel’s studio production skill and passion first gained expression at the age of 17 when he produced a ten-track gospel choir album <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent’s</b> church.|$|R

25|$|Joseph Cornell (December 24, 1903 – December 29, 1972) was an American {{artist and}} film maker, {{one of the}} pioneers and most celebrated exponents of assemblage. Influenced by the Surrealists, he was also an avant-garde {{experimental}} filmmaker. He was largely self-taught in his artistic efforts, and improvised his own original style incorporating cast-off and discarded artifacts. He lived most of his life in relative physical isolation, cared <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and his disabled brother at home, but remained aware of and in contact with other contemporary artists.|$|E
25|$|There are variances {{about the}} Momotarō's process of growth; {{one is that}} he grew up to meet the {{expectation}} of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he {{grew up to be}} a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do anything. It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō {{is one of the most}} famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for young kids for his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 1941, {{the draft}} board in Lake County, Indiana, {{announced}} that Harmon had been classified as 1-B and deferred {{as a student}} until July 1, 1941. In July 1941, Harmon was granted a further 60-day deferment based on his claim {{that he was the}} sole support <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents.</b> In September 1941, he appeared in front of the draft board seeking a permanent deferment. His request was denied, and he was classified as 1-A. Harmon, then working as a radio announcer in Detroit, stated that he intended to appeal the ruling. His appeal was denied in October 1941, and he was given until November 1941 to enlist.|$|E

50|$|Gomes {{was born}} in Oeiras, Lisbon District. A product of S.L. Benfica's youth ranks, he spent his first two {{professional}} seasons on loan, only appearing <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent</b> club during pre-season: 2006-07 at C.F. Estrela da Amadora - in the Primeira Liga - where he played with namesake Tiago Filipe Figueiras Gomes, and the following at Poland's Zagłębie Lubin.|$|R

He made his debut on 13 September in a 0-0 home draw with Sheffield Wednesday, {{and went on to}} make three appearances.|$|R
25|$|Karan {{was playing}} {{excessive}} cricket with the tennis ball that {{got into his}} parent's nerves and they finally took a decision to send him back to Nepal. The decision actually got backfired <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> but worked in the well-being of Nepali cricket. For {{a guy who was}} bowling over 130 kmmph, he was already a national team material. They called him for the camps in Kathmandu and now, impressive with the raw pace and the physique he carries, Karan is now expected to be the next generation seamer of Nepali cricket. He has already proved himself many times and is expected to carry Nepal into glory.|$|E
25|$|Esther Stutzman, {{who works}} as a {{receptionist}} in a doctor's office, also experiences a close call with Nazi policies when her friends Richard and Maria Klein, closeted Jews like herself, bring their ailing eight-month-old baby, Paul, in for a checkup. The diagnosis, Tay-Sachs disease, is a disease known to be prevalent among Jews. A subsequent investigation into his family background would spell doom <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and any names they might be forced to reveal under torture. Although Esther's husband, Walther, is able to hack into the Reich's computer network and change the Klein's family history, it is the revelation that Reichsführer-SS Lothar Prützmann has a nephew with Tay-Sachs that brings the investigation to a halt.|$|E
25|$|Despite Louis's lucrative purses {{over the}} years, {{most of the}} {{proceeds}} went to his handlers. Of the over $4.6 million earned during his boxing career, Louis himself received only about $800,000. Louis was nevertheless extremely generous to his family, paying for homes, cars and education <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and siblings, often with money fronted by Jacobs. He invested {{in a number of}} businesses, all of which eventually failed, including the Joe Louis Restaurant, the Joe Louis Insurance Company, a softball team called the Brown Bombers, the Joe Louis Milk Company, Joe Louis pomade (hair product), Joe Louis Punch (a drink), the Louis-Rower P.R. firm, a horse farm and the Rhumboogie Café in Chicago. He gave liberally to the government as well, paying back the city of Detroit for any welfare money his family had received.|$|E

25|$|Boole {{was born}} in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John Boole Sr (1779–1848), a {{shoemaker}} and Mary Ann Joyce. He had a primary school education, and received lessons from his father, but due to a serious decline in business, he had little further formal and academic teaching. William Brooke, a bookseller in Lincoln, may have helped him with Latin, which he may also have learned {{at the school of}} Thomas Bainbridge. He was self-taught in modern languages. In fact, when a local newspaper printed his translation of a Latin poem, a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretense that he was not capable of such achievements. At age 16, Boole became the breadwinner <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and three younger siblings, taking up a junior teaching position in Doncaster at Heigham's School. He taught briefly in Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in psychosexual development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able {{to let go of the}} rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents.</b> At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E
25|$|The tenth {{book in the}} Sweep {{series is}} not from Morgan's point of view. Instead the book is in Hunter's point of view. Hunter was in a search <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> who have been missing since Hunter was a child. Hunter {{receives}} information about the whereabouts of his parents, which inevitably lead him to Canada. There he finds his father, Daniel Niall, and discovers that his mother died just before Yule, when he was training Morgan. Hunter soon discovers that his father is talking to his mother (who is dead) using a Bith Dearc which {{is the use of}} what {{is considered to be a}} form of dark magick, against the wishes of Hunter's mother. Hunter must attempt to stop his father from doing this, while investigating a witch by the name of Justine Courceau, a witch collecting the true names of other witches, on the order of the International Council of Witches. He ends up kissing her, and then is faced with the fact that he has to tell Morgan about it.|$|E
50|$|He {{failed to}} appear <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>parent</b> club {{during the first}} half of the 2008-09 season, and joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan in January 2009, {{remaining}} there until the end of the season.
