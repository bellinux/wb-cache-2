5|$|The first {{structural}} {{relic of}} prehistoric man was excavated in 1973 at Cefn Glas near the watershed of the Rhondda Fach river. The {{remains of a}} rectangular hut with traces of <b>drystone</b> wall foundations and postholes was discovered; while carbon dating of charcoal found at the site dated the structure as late Neolithic.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} at Hen Dre'r Mynydd in Blaenrhondda was dated {{around the}} Roman {{period when the}} discovery of fragments of wheel-made Romano-British pottery were discovered at the location. The site {{is made up of}} a group of ruinous <b>drystone</b> roundhouses and enclosures and is thought to have been a sheep farming community.|$|E
5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving <b>drystone</b> walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick in some places.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, from {{the seventh century}} BCE, {{cellular}} houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a <b>drystone</b> construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the <b>drystone</b> wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{mountain}} sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep {{most likely to}} be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old <b>drystone</b> walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.|$|E
5|$|Housing in Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} built habitation {{in what is now}} Scotland, from the earliest period of human occupation to the present day. The oldest house in Scotland dates from the Mesolithic era. In the Neolithic era settled farming led to the construction of the first stone houses. There is also evidence from this period of large timber halls. In the Bronze Age there were cellular round houses, crannogs (built on artificial islands) and hillforts that enclosed large settlements. In the Iron Age cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a <b>drystone</b> construction. The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular brochs and duns and wheelhouses.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. The chamber was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a <b>drystone</b> wall would have also blocked access.|$|E
25|$|Immense labour {{has been}} {{expended}} {{over the years}} in retaining building walls on either side of many of the rivers and burns. At Chapeltoun on the Annick Water even the Chapel Burn bed is 'cobbled'. This <b>drystone</b> walling was important in reducing the erosion of the river banks.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the wall}} is {{designed}} to retain water, It {{is important to have}} proper drainage behind the wall in order to limit the pressure to the wall's design value. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydrostatic pressure and improve the stability of the material behind the wall. <b>Drystone</b> retaining walls are normally self-draining.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Somalia, pyramidical {{structures}} {{known in}} Somali as taalo were a popular burial style {{with hundreds of}} these <b>drystone</b> monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of dressed stone {{similar to the ones}} in Ancient Egypt, and there are examples of courtyards and large stone walls such as the Wargaade Wall enclosing settlements.|$|E
25|$|This boulder is rugged, unshapely, {{and most}} unusual in height. Other stones were broken up and removed within {{relatively}} recent times; the mounds of stones being carted away for making dikes or <b>drystone</b> walls. In {{or near the}} circle were found a small perforated axe-hammer, portions of 3 bronze armlets, flint chips and a jet button.|$|E
25|$|The Cuff Hill rocking stone (NS 3827 5542) {{is a large}} glacial erratic boulder of basaltic greenstone {{lying on}} {{porphyrite}} that some associate with the Druids, {{part of the old}} Hessilhead Barony. It no longer rocks due to people digging beneath to ascertain its fulcrum. It is in a small wood and surrounded by a circular <b>drystone</b> wall.|$|E
25|$|African {{architecture}} uses a {{wide range}} of materials. One finds structures in thatch, stick/wood, mud, mudbrick, rammed earth, and stone, with the preference for materials varying by region: North Africa for stone and rammed earth, Horn of Africa for <b>drystone</b> and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.|$|E
25|$|Close to the cists site is the Mound Wood on Kennox Moss, an oval shaped {{artificial}} structure made of piled turf {{and surrounded}} by a well constructed <b>drystone</b> wall. It has not been investigated archaeologically. An access track ran up to it at one time and Roy's map of 1747 indicates that a dwelling known as Water House existed in this vicinity at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{northeast}} {{edge of the}} hill, {{where the}} slope is least severe, was disconnected from the adjacent ground by the erection of a massive ditch and bank, perhaps originally forming a promontory fort. The southern and northern edges were also fortified with walls. The walling techniques included <b>drystone</b> walling, the murus gallicus (a typical Celtic technique of wood and stone) and perhaps also mudbrick.|$|E
25|$|From an {{agricultural}} perspective, however, the Geopark {{is simply an}} area of poorly drained grazing that becomes progressively less useful as its altitude increases. Nevertheless, the lower slopes of the inlier are still sufficiently valuable to be enclosed, largely with <b>drystone</b> walling, and are used for grazing sheep and cattle. Fell ponies are also raised here. Immediately above the village, this area is known as Red Carle.|$|E
25|$|The {{adoption}} of Islam in Somalia's early medieval history brought Islamic architectural influences from Arabia and Persia. This stimulated {{a shift in}} construction from <b>drystone</b> and other related materials to coral stone, sundried bricks, and {{the widespread use of}} limestone in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs, such as mosques, were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.|$|E
25|$|The glacial {{deposits}} {{have given}} rise to heavy, fertile soils which are suitable for both arable and livestock farming. The soils also contain many rounded boulders of varying sizes which, because of their hardness provide a valuable building material to augment the softer, easily worked sandstone. The larger boulders are frequently seen in use as building foundations, while the smaller cobbles are widely employed in the <b>drystone</b> field-walls which form another characteristic feature of the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of Islam {{in the early}} medieval era of Somalia's history brought Islamic architectural influences from the Arabian Peninsula and Persia. This stimulated a shift from <b>drystone</b> and other related materials in construction to coral stone, sundried bricks, and {{the widespread use of}} limestone in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as mosques were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.|$|E
25|$|A cleft in the west-front of Cuff hill {{is still}} known as 'St. Inan's Chair' {{and said to}} have been used by the saint as a pulpit. and a crystal clear holy well existed nearby, now sadly covered over (2006). On Cuff Hill were also located a group of four {{standing}} stones, the 'Druids' Graves', rediscovered in 1813, stands nearby surrounded by an enclosing <b>drystone</b> dyke and also located in the area is the likely site of a pre-reformation chapel near Kirklee Green and Lochland's Loch.|$|E
25|$|Around 200 stone monuments (taalos) {{are found}} in the northeastern Botiala site, most of which consist of cairns. The bigger cairns are covered in {{shingles}} and tend to be more sturdily constructed. There are a number of rows of standing stones (menhirs) on {{the eastern side of the}} structures, which are similar to those at Salweyn, a great cairn-held situated close to Heis. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other <b>drystone</b> monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments.|$|E
25|$|The chapel is a plain structure, {{built of}} gritstone with quoins {{at the corners}} and a slate roof. It has a small, {{hexagonal}} bellcote on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of glass. On the south side are two doorways with chamfered surrounds; over one door is a lintel dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house. The building {{is surrounded by a}} <b>drystone</b> wall and the chapel's original cast iron gates survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{peaceful}} {{introduction of}} Islam {{in the early}} medieval era of Somalia's history brought Islamic architectural influences from Arabia and Persia, which stimulated a shift from <b>drystone</b> and other related materials in construction to coral stone, sundried bricks, and {{the widespread use of}} limestone in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as mosques were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries. Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the Horn of Africa region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were minarets.|$|E
25|$|The Cat Craig {{is located}} beside the lane {{running up to}} Cockston farm {{and is one of}} two <b>drystone</b> wall {{enclosed}} crags. The name 'Cat' is applied to many stones, such as the 'Cat Stone' on the Isle of Arran near the village of Corrie and the Cat Stane near Edinburgh Airport. 'Cat' is thought to come from 'Cath', a Celtic word, meaning a 'battle.' The Norwegian term, 'Bauta Stein', means the same thing. The first edition of the OS 6inch maps shows a 'Castle Hill' in line with Cockston Farm {{on the other side of}} the Maich Water and this may make the meaning of the name 'Cat Craig' more plausible. Cockston Farm and sheep fauld date from at least 1827.|$|E
25|$|The nuclei of the Great Moravian {{settlement}} structure were well-defended fortified settlements {{built by the}} local Slavs both on elevated positions and lowland areas like marshes and river islands. Most Great Moravian castles were rather large hill forts, fortified by wooden palisades, stone walls and in some cases, moats. The typical Great Moravian ramparts combined an outer <b>drystone</b> wall with an internal timber structure filled with earth. The fortifications usually formed several contiguous enclosures, with the elite buildings concentrated in the centre and crafts in the outer enclosures. Most buildings were made of timber, but ecclesiastical buildings and residential dwellings were made of stone. In many cases, prehistoric fortifications were also integrated. The Great Moravian towns, especially in Moravia, {{but also in the}} lowlands of Slovakia, were frequently far from the place where the stone was mined and material was transported dozens of kilometres.|$|E
25|$|The tank at {{the head}} of the small road from Pumsaint to Caio was thought to be modern since it still holds water. However, when the level of the water was low in 1970, it yielded large {{quantities}} of Roman pottery which show that it is of Roman origin and built early during their exploitation of the mines. The section shows that it was connected to a smaller tank just below the modern road by a <b>drystone</b> culvert in a cascade. The lower tank also holds water but is in an advanced state of eutrophication. The collection of fragments included Samian ware and coarse ware from over 100 separate pots, and must have fallen into the reservoir when the mines were in full operation. Analysis of the pottery fragments showed a distribution of ages from the late 1st century AD through to the end of the 4th century. Since the fort and fortlet under the present village of Pumsaint ends in the middle of the 2nd century, it shows that mining continued for a long time after the military evacuation.|$|E
25|$|Mugdock Moot Hill – Prior to {{the early}} 18th century, the Moot Hill was an island on Mugdock Loch. The loch was drained between 1710 and 1714 to claim land and {{construct}} avenues for the newly developing Craigend Estate. Gallowhill is nearby. Before 1747 prisoners of Mugdock Castle's barony jail were rowed out to Moot Island for the trial, {{en route to the}} gallows at Gallowhill if they were convicted. Gallowhill is located close to the Visitor Centre. In the SW trench the rock fell away quickly into deep peat deposits. A <b>drystone</b> revetment ran alongside the edge of the mound, which had been interpreted as a landing place or quay. Excavation and survey revealed that this was a stock-proof dyke, probably of 19th-century date. The island was renamed Moot Hill when the loch was drained and became a feature for residents and visitors to Craigend House as it was, and still is, situated close to the main avenue. Excavation work at Moot Hill carried out by Glasgow University in 2003 confirmed that Moot Hill is made of solid rock and has deposits of dark coloured peat covering it.|$|E
500|$|Other remains {{include a}} series of <b>drystone</b> walls near the {{lighthouse}} dating from 1865, and the footings and stay rings of the flagstaff, which has been removed, located south of the lighthouse adjacent to a stone retaining wall. Also at the site are two other timber framed structures, {{one of which is}} a former fuel shed constructed circa 1970s, located south of the lighthouse. An above ground brick fuel bunker with a concrete roof and floor is located approximately [...] south of the lighthouse, on a rock outcrop.|$|E
500|$|The territories {{attached}} to the Frankish Empire were initially governed by royal officers and local chieftains. A Slavic prince named Pribina received large estates along the river Zala around 840. He promoted the colonization of his lands, and also erected Mosaburg, a fortress in the marshes. Initially defended by timber walls, this [...] "castle complex" [...] (András Róna-Tas) became an administrative center. It was strengthened by <b>drystone</b> walls {{at the end of}} the century. Four churches surrounded by cemeteries were unearthed in and around the settlement. At least one of them continued to be used up to the 11thcentury.|$|E
500|$|The most massive constructions {{that date}} from this era are the {{circular}} broch towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. They are <b>drystone</b> hollow-walled structures that {{are unique to}} Scotland. Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed [...] in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland, of which the best preserved include those at South Yarrows near Wick, Midhowe Broch on Orkney and the Broch of Clickimin and the Broch of Mousa in Shetland. Despite extensive research, their purpose {{and the nature of}} the societies that created them are still a matter of debate.|$|E
500|$|The Rhondda {{also has}} the remains of two Medieval castles. The older is Castell Nos which {{is located at the}} head of the Rhondda Fach {{overlooking}} Maerdy. The only recorded evidence of Castle Nos is a mention by John Leland who stated that [...] "Castelle Nose is but a high stony creg in the top of an hille". The castle comprises a scarp and ditch forming a raised platform and on the north face is a ruined <b>drystone</b> building. Due to its location and form it does not appear to be of Norman design and is therefore thought to have been built by the Welsh as a border defence; and must therefore date before 1247 when Richard de Clare seized Glynrhondda. The second castle is Ynysygrug, located close to what is now Tonypandy town centre. Little remains of this motte-and-bailey earthwork defence as much was destroyed when Tonypandy railway station was built in the 19th century. Ynysygrug is dated around the 12th century or early 13th century and has been misidentified by several historians, notably Owen Morgan in his book 'History of Pontypridd and Rhondda Valleys' who recorded it as a druidic sacred mound and Iolo Morganwg who erroneously believed it to be the burial mound of king Rhys ap Tewdwr.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{for human}} {{activity}} {{in the vicinity of}} the barrow from the eleventh through to the thirteenth century [...] during the medieval period [...] appeared in the form of 200 ceramic sherds, 2 hones, and 17 fragments of daub found by archaeologists in the top soil. It was likely in this medieval period that the tomb was heavily destroyed, evidenced by medieval material found in some of the pits created by those damaging the chamber and barrow. The destruction was carried out in a systematic manner. Initially, the barrow around the chamber was dug away, and an entrance into it was forced through the <b>drystone</b> wall at the north-western end. The chamber was then cleared down to the bedrock, with the spoil and contents of the chamber dumped behind the diggers. The medial stone of the chamber was pushed over on to the spoil heap, and covered over with soil. A pit was dug in the centre of the chamber, and against its walls from the outside; the central pit was then ceiled by the collapsing capstones. Finally, several more pits were then dug around the façade stones. Subsequently, the chamber collapsed, with a number of stones breaking on the impact of the fall. At some point after they had fallen, the inner pair of the chamber's tall-stones were further damaged, likely in a process involving heating them with fire and then casting cold water onto them, resulting in breakage.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, from {{the seventh century}} BCE, {{cellular}} houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a <b>drystone</b> construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BCE more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness. The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular broch towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed [...] in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland. Despite extensive research, their purpose {{and the nature of}} the societies that created them are still a matter of debate. Archaeologists since the 1960s have distinguished brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest evidence of the occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they would continue to be used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
2500|$|Mound Wood near Kennox House and moss. An oval mound with <b>drystone</b> walling around it. Gallowayford is {{situated}} nearby on the Glazert Water.|$|E
2500|$|A broch (...) is an Iron Age <b>drystone</b> hollow-walled {{structure}} of a type found only in Scotland. Brochs belong to the classification [...] "complex atlantic roundhouse" [...] devised by Scottish archaeologists in the 1980s. Their origin {{is a matter of}} some controversy.|$|E
