500|$|Because of the {{vigorous}} colour breeding for chestnut {{in the early}} 20thcentury, combined with a genetic bottleneck resulting from the low number of Finnhorses {{that existed in the}} 1980s, colours such as grey and cream dilutions were preserved only by a few minor breeders. In the 1980s there were fewer than ten grey and palomino Finnhorses combined. All Finnhorse carriers of the cream gene today descend from a single maternal line, founded by the palomino mare Voikko (literally, [...] "Palomino") who lived in the 1920s. While both cream dilution and black are rare, there are some known smoky blacks in the breed, the first of which was a filly foaled in 2009, identified as smoky black and confirmed as such by a DNA test in 2010. The filly is considered [...] "if not the first ever, at least the first in a long long time." [...] In April 2010, a filly appearing to be a <b>double</b> <b>cream</b> dilute was born, sired by a buckskin and out of a palomino. She was blue-eyed and had [...] "pink skin and very pale coat", and was later officially recognised as a <b>double</b> <b>cream</b> dilute.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} modern methods for making clotted cream. The [...] "float cream method" [...] includes scalding a floating layer of <b>double</b> <b>cream</b> in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for {{up to an hour}} it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The [...] "scald cream method" [...] is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{single and}} <b>double</b> <b>cream</b> {{can be used}} in cooking. <b>Double</b> <b>cream</b> or full-fat crème fraîche are often used when cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent any problem with it {{separating}} or [...] "splitting". <b>Double</b> <b>cream</b> can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.|$|E

Recent arrivals from Brighton & Hove {{retained}} their former livery with Hedingham fleetnames.|$|R

In ice cream, AFPs allow the production of very creamy, dense, reduced fat ice cream with fewer additives. They control ice crystal growth brought on by thawing on the loading dock or kitchen table which drastically reduces texture quality.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "sabino" [...] {{is seldom}} used among American Quarter Horse breeders, as white {{patterning}} was originally considered undesirable. The American Quarter Horse breed was traditionally solid-colored and minimally-marked. Among Quarter Horse breeders, foals with ineligible amounts of white born to eligible parents {{were referred to}} as [...] "cropouts," [...] and, until 2004, horses that had areas of white hair rooted in pink skin beyond the gaskin on the hindleg, above the halfway point between the knee and elbow in the foreleg, or beyond the eye could not be registered. Due to {{the large number of}} horses that had these patterns, as well as a significant number of <b>double</b> dilute <b>creams</b> also caught up by this rule, the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) formed, allowing these horses to be registered as [...] "Paints." [...] The APHA recognizes sabino as one of the [...] "overo" [...] family of color patterns.|$|R

50|$|One {{traditional}} {{recipe for}} cranachan is 3 oz pinhead oatmeal, 1/2 imppt ml <b>double</b> (or whipping) <b>cream,</b> and 2 tablespoons (35 ml) of whisky.

The oatmeal is soaked in whisky overnight and then added to the whipped cream, {{with a little more}} whisky added to the mixture. Some raspberries are placed {{in the bottom of the}} serving glass before adding the cream mixture. An option is to break up some of the raspberries and gently blend into the mixture. The volume of whisky used may be adjusted to personal taste.|$|R
