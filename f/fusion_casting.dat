In this process a chill bar is inserted into the DC casting mould which permits {{for the first time}} the co-casting of laminate of clad ingots. These ingots can then be rolled down into clad sheet and offer distinct advantages over traditional aluminum clad sheet processing routes (i. e. brazing and roll bonding). The research presented in this Master’s Thesis was done as part of a larger collaborative research and development project with Novelis Inc. The main objective of this research was to investigate the Novelis Fusion Technology and understand it from a scientific viewpoint. The research has been multi faceted and has included: the creation of a thermal fluid model using the commercial software package CFD to model the first the DC and then <b>Fusion</b> <b>casting</b> process, as well as the design and testing of an experimental DC and Fusion caster at the Novelis Global Technology Centre (NGTC) in Kingston, Ontario. This MASc research has been focused on performing both traditional DC (for AA 6111, AA 3004 and AA 4045) and novel Fusion (AA 3004 /AA 4045) casting experiments. First the series of DC casting experiments was performed. During the experiments two arrays of 5 thermocouples were embedded in the ingot during the cast to capture the thermal history of the ingot. Melt poisoning with a zinc rich alloy was also performed as an independent method of determining the sump depth and shape. Other temperature measurements during the experiment (i. e. alloy superheat, mould temperature, cooling water temperature) were done to gather meaningful data for model validation. A series of <b>Fusion</b> <b>casting</b> experiments was performed after the DC casting trials. Three successful <b>Fusion</b> <b>casting</b> trials were performed at NGTC using a lab scale caster with a 152 mm × 381 mm rectangular mould divided in half by a water cooled copper chill bar. For the <b>Fusion</b> <b>casting</b> experiments the AA 3003 -Core/AA 4045 -Clad alloy system was chosen since this alloy system has already been commercially produced using this novel technology. In addition to embedded thermocouples in the Fusion cast ingot, and other temperature measurements as for the DC casting experiments, temperature measurements of the chill bar were performed to gather information for model validation. The effect of melt poisoning as the interface of the composite ingot forms was unknown, so only the core of one experimental ingot was poisoned; this gave enough information about the depth and asymmetrical shape of the AA 3003 -Core sump. The Fusion cast ingots were characterized (both optically and using SEM techniques) at four distinct locations across the width of the ingot, consistent with different thermal histories at the interface and regions where good and poor interfaces were found in the solidified ingot. No clear correlation between thermal history and the quality of the interface could be found indicating that the interface formation during <b>Fusion</b> <b>casting</b> is extremely complicated and other factors such as oxide formation and wetting mechanisms of the AA 4045 on the AA 3004 need to be understood to gain a more in depth understanding of the conditions necessary to form a defect free interface. Comparisons of the measured thermal histories and sump depth and shape measurements to the model predictions were excellent...|$|E

This is probably a reflection of the authors’ interest in spinal deformity. 14 patients had a curve of sufficient magnitude to require an instrumented <b>fusion.</b> <b>Casts</b> and braces were usually found to be ineffective when initiated for clinically evident deformity. In a few cases, night bracing was effective in preventing progression of a minor deformity, enabling achievement of skeletal maturity with a minor curve with no functional deficit.|$|R
50|$|A Bulletin of 1776 {{says that}} the Beloretsk Iron Factory was built in 1762 and had two blast {{furnaces}} and fourteen sledge-hammers. However, the first <b>fusion</b> of <b>cast</b> iron was recorded as being done in 1767. In 1777, the factory produced more iron than any other factory in Russia. Productive capacity of the factory was 122,500 poods (~2,000 metric tons) of cast iron and 80,000 poods (~1,300 metric tons) of iron per year. There were 840 male workers at the factory.|$|R

The weld current is fed to the butt welded parts with little offset during the time shorter than that in the forging process. The tensile strength of the welded part is attained over 80 percents of that of the base metal. For checking the shape memory effect, the recovery from bending deformation for the welded parts is tested in comparison with that for the base metal, and the residual strain after the recovery is experimentally related to the ratio of latent heat of martenstic transformation to that of reverse transformation, measured by the differential scanning caloriemeter...|$|R

The method {{is based on the}} “nonwetting” properties of a Pt/Au alloy towards molten borax, on the favourable composition of the flux and finally on the favourable form of the casting mould. The critical points of the technique are stressed, resulting in a method which could be carried out successfully by inexperienced workers. In general the method compares favourably in speed and accuracy with wet-chemical methods...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{approaches}} to image de-fencing use multiple adjacent frames for segmentation of fences in the reference image and {{are limited to}} restoring images of static scenes only. In this paper, we propose a de-fencing algorithm for images of dynamic scenes using an occlusion-aware optical flow method. We divide the problem of image de-fencing into the tasks of automated fence segmentation from a single image, motion estimation under known occlusions and fusion of data from multiple frames of a captured video of the scene. Specifically, we use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to segment fence pixels from a single image. The knowledge of spatial locations of fences is used to subsequently estimate optical flow in the occluded frames of the video for the final data <b>fusion</b> step. We <b>cast</b> the fence removal problem in an optimization framework by modeling {{the formation of the}} degraded observations. The inverse problem is solved using fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the surface roughness of pearlitic grey cast iron discs on the formation of tribofilms {{and the evolution of}} the friction coefficient during a ring on disc tribotest with the addition of magnetite and magnetite–graphite nanopowders as interfacial media was investigated. The roughness parameters of the cast iron discs were varied by electro discharge machining (EDM) and grinding processes, producing four distinct surface roughness conditions. The evolution of the friction coefficient, however, did not reach the steady state for most of the samples {{and the role of the}} surface roughness on the friction coefficient could not be identified. Focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy on the cast iron discs was carried out to investigate the microstructure of the discs near the tribosurface. These results showed that the EDM process not only varied the surface roughness, but also changed the microstructure of the cast iron discs, promoting the incipient <b>fusion</b> of the <b>cast</b> iron surface, with the formation of ridges and casting defects (pores). As a result, a layer of rapidly solidified metal with a dendritic microstructure was formed near to the surface of the EDMed discs. CAPE...|$|R
