A cryo-transfer system between microtome and microscope offers the possibility of studying fully hydrated sections in the frozen state and subsequently observe the sublimation process up to complete dryness. By freeze-drying sections before microscopic observation one takes the risk of rehydration with its accompanying typical artefacts. Rehydration artefacts are prevented when freeze-dried sections are exposed to vapour fixatives (e. g. formaldehyde, osmium tetroxide). A <b>dry</b> <b>vapour</b> fixation enables the safe conservation of samples for microanalysis and, in addition, offers the possibility for conducting immunocytochemical reactions on serial sections.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} {{the power and the}} carrier gas flow rate on excitation temperature, electron number density, ionic-to-atomic line intensity ratios and departure from local thermal equilibrium has been studied in an axially-viewed plasma with introduction of different amounts of wet aerosols, partially desolvated aerosols or <b>dry</b> <b>vapours,</b> according to empirical modelling and experimental design methods. Under robust conditions (1500 W and a carrier gas flow rate of 0. 7 – 0. 85 L/min), an increase in water loading led to an improvement in the plasma excitation properties, while desolvation caused degradation. In contrast, under non-robust conditions, the plasma was no longer able to tolerate an increase in water loading and desolvation resulted in an improvement in the plasma characteristics. The hydrogen formed during the hydride generation process significantly improved the plasma excitation properties, regardless of the conditions. In this instance, the plasma characteristics were primarily affected by the reductant concentration, which determined the amount of hydrogen generated, and by the carrier gas flow rate, which controlled its residence time within the plasma. In contrast, there was no relevant change in the plasma excitation conditions due to systematic variation of HCl concentration from 0. 1 to 6 M...|$|R

This cycle model contains a detailed thermodynamic model of the twin-screw expander, and the methods used to match {{the operation of the}} expander to the requirements of the cycle are described. The capability of the cycle model has been demonstrated for the case of heat recovery from a source of pressurized hot water at 120 °C. There are two main findings from the paper. Firstly, power output can be increased by up to 50 % by correct selection of the expander inlet and discharge conditions, compared to the case with <b>dry</b> <b>vapour</b> admission. Secondly, the maximum power output occurs at an expander inlet dryness of around 20 %, but for lower dryness fractions the gain in net power output falls off due to the decreasing pressure ratio required to maintain good expander efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{developed}} a complete model designed to stimulate both the behaviour of the reservoir during an eventual eruption, {{and the development of}} the two-phase flow at each instant along the duct which links the reservoir to the ground. The model of the reservoir can contain fluids in different states, including (initially) gas, liquid or even hypercritical fluid. The simulation shows that the nature of the thermodynamic evolution of the feed fluid during the eruption depends upon the conditions of storage (e. g. temperature and pressure) in relation to the thermodynamic critical point. In the particular case of the reservoir which justified the study, a variation of only a few degrees would be sufficient to totally change the nature of the eruption. We {{have developed}} a "drift-flux model" for the duct, which takes account of the 2 phase head loss, and the effects of gravity. The feed fluid can be either saturated or very far from equilibrium (e. g. subcooled liquid, <b>dry</b> <b>vapour</b> or hypercritical fluid). This model alloxs us to determine the flow rate of the eruption and to consider the variation of the temperature, the pressure, the quality, and the velocity along the duct...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out on the {{feasibility}} of using screw expanders, as an alternative to turbines, in three types of binary systems, suitable for recovering power from liquid dominated brines. The maximum power that one machine can generate is of the order of 1 - 3 MW per unit, {{depending on the type of}} system, and the brine and cooling conditions. They are shown to be roughly as efficient as turbines, when expanding <b>dry</b> <b>vapour,</b> and they can be coupled directly to a generator, without an intermediate gearbox. They have similar characteristics as two-phase expanders, when their efficiencies are not much reduced. This latter feature enables improvements to be made in the conversion of heat to power, of the order of 30 % over conventional ORC systems, from brines in the 100 o – 140 oC temperature range. The costs of these machines are very competitive and it is shown that in a cycle designed for power recovery from brines in the 170 o- 210 oC range, the cost per unit output of the first expander stage may be less than 50 % of that of a radial inflow turbine-generator set. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} problem solved in {{this article}} is the calculation of thermodynamic parameters such as final temperature, distribution of the liquid and <b>dry</b> saturated <b>vapour</b> phases of the substance that are considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, and pressure of the system of several reaction products after adding to the system a certain amount of heat or the thermal effect released during rapid exothermic reaction in a closed volume that occurs so fast that it can be considered to be adiabatic, and when the volume of liquid reagents is several orders of magnitude less than the volume of the reactor. The general multi-substance problem is reduced to a theoretical problem for one substance of calculation thermodynamic parameters of system after adding a certain amount of heat that gives theoretically rigorous isochoric calculation. In this article, we substantiate our view that isochoric pass of calculation is more robust compared to seemingly more natural isobaric pass of calculation, if the later involves quite not trivial calculation of the adiabatic compression of a two-phase system (liquid – <b>dry</b> saturated <b>vapour)</b> that can pass itself into another kind of state (liquid – wet saturated vapour), which requires, apparently, more complex descriptions compared with isochoric calculation because the specific heat capacity of wet saturated vapour can be negative...|$|R

Clay remoulded samples were <b>dried</b> using <b>vapour</b> transfer under one-dimensional conditions. Samples underwent an important vertical shrinkage on drying, which progressed along more than one week. To study the time evolution of this phenomenon, simulation aided techniques were used to analyse the progression of suction at local scale and to determine {{the time required to}} equilibrate homogeneously the sample. In this case the fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element code Code_Bright [1] was used to analyse this process. The simulation adequately followed the evolution of sample shrinkage measured experimentally. The determination of the suction equalisation time also agreed with the experimental information. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{performance of}} four cacao clones was examined under three artificial shade regimes {{over the course}} of a year in Ghana. Plants under light shade had significantly higher photosynthetic rates in the rainy seasons whereas in the dry season there was a trend of higher photosynthetic rates under heavy shade. The results imply that during the wet seasons light was the main limiting factor to photosynthesis whereas in the <b>dry</b> season <b>vapour</b> pressure deficit was the major factor limiting photosynthesis through stomatal regulation. Leaf area was generally lower under heavier shade but the difference between shade treatments varied between clones. Such differences in leaf area allocation appeared to underlie genotypic differences in final biomass production in response to shade.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of this technique {{is that it can}} be left {{for a long period of}} time without the need to add more solvent or fear of the reaction vessel boiling <b>dry</b> as any <b>vapour</b> is immediately condensed in the condenser. In addition, as a given solvent will always boil at a certain temperature, one can be sure that the reaction will proceed at a constant temperature. By careful choice of solvent, one can control the temperature within a very narrow range. The constant boiling action also serves to continuously mix the solution, although a magnetic stirring rod mechanism is often used to achieve a uniform solution. This technique is useful for performing chemical reactions under controlled conditions that require substantial time for completion.|$|R

Dry heat treatments were carried out in 1993 using temperatures of 36 and 38 C for 48 h. These treatments all caused rind blackening but extended ripening time after 28 days of cold storage at 6. 5, 5. 5 or 3. 5 °C. In 1994, a wider range of temperatures and treatment durations were tested and ranged from 48 h at 36 °C to 10 min at 48 °C. Fruit in all of the trials was stored at 3. 5 °C for 28 days after heat treatment. Warm water treatments caused severe rind blackening, even before cold storage and inhibited ripening after cold storage. Dry heat treatments did not produce fruit of quality superior to that of untreated fruit after cold storage. Vapour heat treatment for 1. 5 and 3 h at 40 °C produced fruit with less external blackening and pulp spot than untreated fruit, without reducing ripening time after storage. These two treatments show promise, but need to be tested throughout an entire harvesting season to confirm the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Computer {{models of}} clothed {{people are now}} {{at a level of}} sophistication that permit them to be used as tools in {{clothing}} design and evaluation. Thermal models vary from those based upon a simple heat balance equation for the clothed body to models that include both the thermal properties of the body and a representation of human thermoregulation. Supporting models include those for modelling clothing, per se, involving <b>dry</b> and <b>vapour</b> heat transfer, and data-bases of the thermal insulation of clothing garments and ensembles. The availability of these models for micro-computers provides potential for their introduction into procedures for work design and evaluation. Computer models integrate the effects of the six basic parameters of air temperature, radiant temperature, humidity, air velocity, metabolic heat and clothing. They provide predictions of human response, usually in terms of body skin temperatures, core temperature and sweat loss. From the physiological responses, predictions can be made of likely body strain caused by wearing protective clothing, the possible risk involved and its causes and whether it is acceptable. Control measures, to maintain thermal strain within acceptable limits, in terms of environmental parameters and work breaks for example, can also be determined from model predictions. Models are easy to use, and with training and understanding can be applied usefully over a wid...|$|R

40|$|A {{fixation}} regime which combined cryopreservation, freeze <b>drying</b> and <b>vapour</b> {{fixation with}} osmium tetroxide, {{was found to}} preserve the mucous coat of trout skin for ambient temperature scanning electron microscopy. The regime was used to study changes to the mucous coat of trout skin during a spontaneous outbreak of "columnaris" disease [...] a common dermatitis of commercial salmonids associated with the bacterial pathogen Cytophaga columnaris. Infected and damaged regions of skin were covered by a mucous coat which differed from that which covered adjacent unaffected areas. In unaffected areas, the mucous coat topography was smooth and relatively featureless. In contrast, the mucous coat which covered damaged areas was fissured, cratered and contained exfoliated epithelial cells. Nevertheless, {{this study showed that}} even sites of extensive dermal ulceration, in which mucous cells had been destroyed, retained a partial mucous coat. This suggests that mucus, after secretion, flows over the skin surface, rather than functioning only near the site of production. Because of the various protective functions attributed to the mucous coat, its partial presence over areas of skin damage would contribute to defence against secondary pathogens and to the prevention of excess movement of ions and water at these sites. The technical development in mucous stabilization, described in this paper, will provide a means for examining morphological changes to the mucous coat of fish skin in response to a range of stimuli in future studies.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for power generation {{systems have been}} reviewed together with the various energy sources available for them. Geothermal energy has been examined in more detail and the principal methods of recovering power from it which are currently employed are discussed. A novel method for improved power recovery from geothermal sources called the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) system is described which has the special requirement of an efficient two-phase expander. Optimum results are obtained from this cycle if a working fluid is used which leaves the expander as <b>dry</b> saturated <b>vapour.</b> A binary mixture of hydrocarbons was therefore sought which by variation of the constituent proportions, would satisfy this requirement {{for a range of}} inlet temperatures when the condensing temperature is constant. Methods of estimating mixture properties are reviewed and the chosen thermodynamic model, as well as a computational procedure for evaluation of vapour-liquid equilibria of organic binary mixtures at high pressures, are described. This is based on the Redlich-Kwong- Soave cubic equation of state. By this means a mixture of n-pentane and 2, 2 -dimethylpropane (neopentane) was found to be the most suitable for the TFC system for expander inlet temperatures between 150 - 180 'C. Temperature-entropy (T-S) diagrams of this organic binary mixture were obtained for several compositions. Bubble and dew pressures of (n-pentane + 2, 2 -dimethylpropane) have been determined experimentally for five different compositions at six different temperatures, (333. 15 K, 353. 15 K, 373. 15 K, 393. 15 K, 413. 15 K, and 433. 15 K).

The moist formulation for θs is equal to the dry formulation θ if dry air is considered, and it displays new properties valid for the moist air cases, both saturated or unsaturated ones. Exact and approximate versions of θs are evaluated for several stratocumulus cases, in particular by using the aircraft observation datasets from the FIRE-I experiment. It appears that there is no (or only a small) jump in θs {{at the top of the}} planetary boundary layer (PBL). The mixing in moist entropy is almost complete in the PBL, with the same values observed in the clear air and the cloudy regions, including the very top of the entrainment region.

Such exposures were carried out at different ages: 1 - 3 months, 6 - 8 months, and 12 - 13 months. The following reactions were studied: Rectal temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, evaporative loss, skin temperature (Zebu-Hereford only), and behaviour. For air temperatures above 95 °F the rise in rectal temperature was greater and equilibrium was reached more slowly in Illawarra Shorthorns than in the Zebu-Hereford. Increase in humidity at temperatures over 80 ° F produced more stress in the animals than increase of dry-bulb temperature. Pulse rates changed little during heat exposure, {{but there was a}} fall in rate with age under all circumstances. As the calves increased in age the panting rate decreased for a given hot environment (markedly so for the Zebu-Hereford crossbred). Evaporative loss increased as dry-bulb temperature was raised. The Zebu-Hereford showed a high transcutaneous water loss soon after birth with a continued increase up to 12 months. Skin evaporation was relatively small in the Illawarra Shorthorn at 1 - 3 months but increased at 6 - 8 months, although it did not attain the high rate of the crossbred. In the Zebu-Hereford cross, sweat glands became active at a skin temperature of approximately 96 °F. With the onset of sweating a fall in skin temperature was observed. A comparison of the reactions of the Illawarra Shorthorn and the Zebu-Hereford crossbred with four Jersey calves aged 1 - 3 months, exposed to similar conditions by Riek and Lee, shows that the Zebu-Hereford has a better heat tolerance than either of the other breeds. Evidence is presented to indicate that this superiority of the Zebu crossbred is associated with at least two factors, (a) a better sweating mechanism and (b) decreased heat production.

Within any given year, genotype, plant population, and fertilizer had relatively small to no effect on evapotranspiration (ET), but large effects on yield. When high plant population (more or = 20000 hills ha sup(- 1)) was combined with high fertilizer application (more or = 40 kg N ha sup(- 1) and or = 18 kg P ha sup(- 1)) during the wettest year, total ET was increased by c. 50 mm. High fertilizer application tended to slightly increase ET and thereby deplete soil water reserves, but this was not associated with yield decline. Yield and water-use data refute the view that, by maintaining fields at low fertility and low plant populations, farmers reduce risk of crop failure during drought by reducing crop water use. Compared with traditional practices that use plant populations as low as 5000 hills ha sup(- 1) and zero fertilizer input, moderate plant population (10000 hills ha sup(- 1) and fertilizer application (20 kg N ha sup(- 1) and 9 kg P ha sup(- 1)) substantially increased yield and approximately tripled water use efficiency even during 1984, the driest year on record.

In concrete, the transfer of water <b>vapour,</b> <b>dry</b> air, and free water is discussed as well as the evaporation and liquefaction phenomena and the dehydration of concrete and its thermal and mechanical degradation. Within the framework of the third step, a geometrically and materially non-linear mechanical response of the structure is proposed accounting for interlayer slips and uplifts as well as for various material-related phenomena such as the material hardening/softening and creep. The governing equations are solved numerically. An efficient, novel strain-based finite element formulation is introduced for the mechanical analysis. Due to its generality and consideration of several different possible non-linear material, geometrical, and interlayer contact phenomena and their couplings the model can be of a use to a broader fire science community for exploring the impact of different physical parameters on the results of the addressed numerical simulations, thereby providing directions for further research. In the paper a case of such a study is also demonstrated exploring the contribution of the steel sheet and the flexibility of the interlayer connection of a standard trapezoidal steel–RC slab to its ultimate fire resistance. A reasonable contribution of the sheet is proved if the stiffness ratio between the integrated and the external tensile reinforcement of the RC plate is low provided that the contact connection is sufficiently stiff...|$|R
40|$|A moist entropy {{potential}} temperature [...] denoted by θ_s [...] is defined analytically {{in terms of}} the specific entropy for moist air. The expression for θ_s is valid for a general mixing of <b>dry</b> air, water <b>vapour</b> and possible condensed water species. It verifies the same conservative properties as the moist entropy, even for varying dry air or total water content. The moist formulation for θ_s is equal to the dry formulation θ if dry air is considered and it verifies new properties valid for the moist air cases, both saturated or under-saturated ones. Exact and approximate versions of θ_s are evaluated for several Stratocumulus cases, in particular by using the aircraft observations FIRE-I experiment data sets. It appears that there is no (or small) jump in θ_s {{at the top of the}} PBL. The mixing in moist entropy is almost complete in the PBL, with the same values observed in the clear air and the cloudy regions, including the very top of the entrainment region. The Randall-Deardorff CTEI analysis may be interpreted as a mixing in moist entropy criterion. The iso-θ_s lines are plotted on skew T-(p) and conserved variable diagrams. All these properties could suggest some hints on the use of moist entropy (or θ_s) in cloud modelling or in mixing processes, with the marine Stratocumulus considered as a paradigm of moist turbulence.

40|$|One of {{important}} steps in decaffeination process is steaming. The aim of steaming is to expand coffee beans porosity {{in order to}} obtain optimal condition for decaffeination process. Steaming can be done in single column reactor using saturated water vapour as media. The objective of this research is to study physical characteristics of coffee beans after steaming process using single column reactor. Material tested was Robusta coffee with 13 — 14 % moisture content after dry processing. Reactor capacity is 6 kg dried coffee beans and 30 l water to produce water <b>vapour.</b> <b>Dried</b> coffee beans classified in 4 grades, i. e. diameter size (d) d> 7, 5 mm; 6, 5 <d³ 7, 5 mm; 5, 5 <d£ 6, 5 mm; and d£ 5, 5 mm. Period of steaming process varied from 1 up to 3. 5 hours. The result showed that the coffee beans expanded 8. 6 — 9. 5 % in length, 12. 2 — 13. 3 % in width, and 18. 3 — 20. 6 % in thickness. Coffee bean volume increased 30 — 50 %. Coffee bean moisture content increased f. Aritmatic diameter increased 8 — 13 % while geometric diameter increased 9 — 18 %. Sphericity not affected. Surface area increased 18 — 37 %. True density increased 19 — 30 % while bulk density was while. Porosity increased from 13 — 18 % to 24 — 39 % while coffee beans texture decreased from 323 — 384 g/ 1 mm to 212 — 225 g/ 1 mm. Color change increased from 14 — 20 to 38 — 40. The optimum steaming process was 3 hours. Key words : Coffee, steaming, single column reactor, decaffeination. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Lebombo Monocline {{is a large}} flexure of Karroo age {{extending}} from Southern Rhodesia to Natal. It consists mainly of a thick sequence of Karr basalts and rhyolites overlying the Archaean crust. The Karroo strata dip eastwards beneath Cretaceous cover at angles of up to 50 °. Four 1 : 50, 000 detailed maps have been produced of the volcanics in Swaziland. The basalts form a monotonous and poorly exposed succession. They are about 5 km thick but a large dyke swarm and strike-faulting serve to increase the apparent thickness. A few acidic interbeds occur near the base. The rhyolites overlie the basalts with little interbedding. They are also about 5 km thick and {{can be divided into}} 30 flows which are interpreted as rheoignimbritic in origin {{because of the presence of}} characteristic ignimbrite features and flow-folded tops to the flows. A dense dyke swarm intrudes the basalts and is younger than most of the basaltic succession; five granophyre bodies intrude the basalts close to the base of the rhyolites. The monocline is block-faulted in the south but becomes progressively more flexural in the north. The jointing in the rhyolites can be divided into groups related to basement structures, monoclinal flexuring and post-Karroo tectonic activity respectively. Major and trace element analyses for seventy rocks show that the chemical variation in the rhyolites can be explained by Rayleigh fractionation of a dacitic magma produced by fractional crystallisation of a basaltic precursor. The more basic and most acid rhyolites have compositions more compatible with partial melting of a solid basaltic source. The rhyolite magma was nearly <b>dry</b> but the <b>vapour</b> phase was rich in CO 2. The acidic interbeds within the basalts have depleted trace element abundances and relatively radiogenic isotopic chemistry and were produced by crustal anatexis. The tectonics and magmatism of the Lebombo are discussed in relation to the break-up of Gondwanaland. </p...|$|R
