5|$|A newly industrialized country, the Philippine {{economy has}} been {{transitioning}} from one based upon agriculture to an economy with more <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> services and manufacturing. Of the country's total labor force of around 40.813 Million, the agricultural sector employs 30% of the labor force, and accounts for 14% of GDP. The industrial sector employs around 14% of the workforce and accounts for 30% of GDP. Meanwhile, the 47% of workers involved in the services sector are responsible for 56% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|Education {{during the}} college's early history {{was based on}} St Ignatius' Ratio Studiorum, with <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> theology, {{classics}} and science, all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum. The educational practice, observed at the College of St Omer, of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent {{with the task of}} picking up on the other's mistakes in an attempt to score points.|$|E
40|$|Albedo {{and thermal}} {{property}} correlations of the topography of Mars {{were conducted with}} <b>emphases</b> <b>upon</b> the types and origins of materials exposed in the central equatorial region. This area displays a wide variation in color, albedo and thermal properties, and is relatively free of dust and haze. The physical, mineralogical and elemental characteristics of this area are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Kantor's interbehavioral {{psychology}} may {{be characterized}} by its conceptual <b>emphases</b> <b>upon</b> (a) naturalism, (b) scientific pluralism, (c) organism-environment interactions, and (d) integrated event fields of continuously interrelated and interrelating factors. Despite differences between Skinnerian and Kantorian classification schemes, the conceptual features of interbehaviorism are compatible with those of Skinner's behaviorism, and taken together the two provide a firm theoretical foundation for an authenticially behavioristic psychology...|$|R
5|$|La Blanca {{occupied}} a frontier zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions {{and the site}} {{is dominated by the}} acropolis, an especially well built palace complex. The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by the intervention of the distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence to the female line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E

40|$|Practices {{in reading}} {{readiness}} programs vary considerably (Spache & Spache, 1973). In some programs the <b>emphasis</b> is <b>upon</b> language development; in other programs the <b>emphasis</b> is <b>upon</b> perceptual 1 and/or perceptual-motor training. In fact, in some programs (e. g., Kephart, 1960; Frostig, 1961), {{little or no}} attention is given to language development, and even in programs that have a language-development component, some emphasis on perceptual and/or perceptual-motor training is common...|$|R
50|$|His {{literary}} criticism is notable for its <b>emphases</b> <b>upon</b> readability and {{exploration of the}} dominant worldviews of the authors in question. His The Weird Tale looks at six acknowledged masters of horror and fantasy (namely Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Dunsany, M. R. James, Bierce and Lovecraft), and discusses their respective worldviews in depth and with authority. Aside from his biography of Lovecraft, Joshi regards this book as his most notable achievement to date.|$|R

25|$|Robert M. Citino (born June 19, 1958) is an American {{historian}} at the University of North Texas. He {{is a leading}} authority on modern German military history, with an <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> World War II and the German influence upon modern operational doctrine.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, {{the majority}} of cathedrals and great churches are cruciform in shape with the church having a defined axis. The axis is generally east/west with external <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> the west front, normally the main entrance, and internal <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> the eastern end so that the congregation faces {{the direction of the}} coming of Christ. Because it is also the direction of the rising sun, the architectural features of the east end often focus on enhancing interior illumination by the sun. Not every church or cathedral maintains a strict east/west axis, but even in those that do not, the terms East End and West Front are used. Many churches of Rome, notably St Peter's Basilica, face the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|Steel Tiger {{operations}} {{continued down}} the length of the panhandle in 1966, with special <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> the Tiger Hound area. Since most of the communist truck traffic was at night, the Air Force developed and began using special equipment to detect the nighttime traffic.|$|E

25|$|That it is, in fact, {{the same}} story {{is evident in the}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> the love between Jesus and the man who was raised by him (cf. John 11:3, 5, 35-36), {{expressed}} twice in the additions of Secret Mark. Both stories are also located in Bethany.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne's culture {{draws on}} a variety of {{international}} cultures, including that of Australia; however, a number of local traditions and strong Melburnian themes are predominant features in the city's cultural landscape. An <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> the arts (particularly literature, performing arts, culinary arts and visual arts), as well as sport, sporting traditions and recreation is central to this landscape. Melbourne is also a major centre of political activism, including the Australian trade union movement.|$|E
25|$|Numerous Sufi traditions place <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> a meditative {{procedure}} {{which comes}} from the cognitive aspect {{to one of the}} two principal approaches {{to be found in the}} Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means concentration. Meditative quiescence is said to have a quality of healing, and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing creativity.|$|E
50|$|During {{its growth}} into a {{thriving}} network and movement, the Trust {{has developed a}} precise, post-modern, contextual theology of mission praxis, located within a series of instructions and teachings subtly scattered throughout the DCI website. This informal mission theory is supplemented by reference to developed, detailed teaching contained with the schools material. DCI stands firmly within the evangelical ‘faith mission’ heritage, with <b>emphases</b> <b>upon</b> faith; prayer; recognition and development of spiritual gifting; engagement in elements of ‘spiritual warfare’; motivation focussing upon God’s glory, rather than escape from hell and a cultural sensitivity that places {{a strong emphasis on}} indigenous leadership and strategy.|$|R

50|$|The Centre aims to run {{economically}} viable projects related to waste management, organic farming, recreation and other ecologically focused activities. There {{is a particular}} <b>emphasis</b> placed <b>upon</b> social inclusion, involving and employing the disadvantaged and people with disabilities.|$|R
25|$|According to {{international}} relations scholar Michael Foley, paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration, a rollback of multicultural programmes, the decentralization {{of the federal}} policy, the restoration of controls upon free trade, a greater <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> economic nationalism and non-interventionism {{in the conduct of}} American foreign policy, and a generally revanchist outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race. Practitioners of this philosophy identify themselves as the legitimate heirs to the American conservative tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Islander {{was designed}} with an <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> providing ease of access within the short haul sector to remote locations as a safe, efficient, and profitable transport aircraft. It has been regularly used by such operators, including the {{frequent use of}} unprepared rough airstrips and from challenging terrain; the Islander being capable of short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations. The low load height and wide side doors provide for easy access for passenger and cargo operations, while the aircraft's ability to maintain a high takeoff frequency {{has led to the}} type's use for parachuting. For operating within noise-sensitive environments, silencers can be equipped on both the aircraft's engine and propellers.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Worker Movement is {{concerned}} with both social justice and pacifist issues, and voiced consistent opposition to the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Many of its early members were imprisoned for their opposition to conscription. Within the Roman Catholic Church, the Pax Christi organisation is the premiere pacifist lobby group. It holds positions similar to APF, and the two organisations are known {{to work together on}} ecumenical projects. Within Roman Catholicism there has been a discernible move towards a more pacifist position through the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popes Benedict XV, John XXIII and John Paul II were all vocal in their opposition to specific wars. By taking the name Benedict XVI, some suspected that Joseph Ratzinger would continue the strong <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> nonviolent conflict resolution of his predecessor. However, the Roman Catholic Church officially maintains the legitimacy of Just War, which is rejected by some pacifists.|$|E
50|$|This was an {{alternative}} fueled class with the <b>emphasis</b> placed <b>upon</b> {{the environmental impact}} of racing. A car from the previous year's Class 1 entry could be re-entered and re-engineered allowing the students to concentrate on the low carbon aspect of the competition without having to redesign a new chassis and ancillaries. Cars in Class 1A were judged in the same events alongside Class 1 however the cost category was replaced by one for sustainability and the endurance event had a greater <b>emphasis</b> placed <b>upon</b> measured emissions. Class 1A cars were scored and ranked independently of Class 1. Since 2012, both Petroleum and Alternative fueled cars have competed for places in the same rankings.|$|R
5000|$|Revivalism {{had been}} a {{significant}} force in religion since the 1740s and the First Great Awakening, but {{in the days of}} the camp meeting, [...] "revivalism became the dominant religious culture." [...] These sorts of meetings contributed greatly to what became known as the Second Great Awakening. A particularly large and successful revival was held at Cane Ridge, Kentucky in 1801, led by some ministers later active in what became the Restoration Movement. Some scholars suggest that this was the pioneering event in the history of frontier camp meetings in America. What made camp meetings successful and multiply quite rapidly [...] "were their <b>emphases</b> <b>upon</b> revivalism and morality, de-emphasis upon formal theology, clergy sharing the worldview of the frontier dwellers, and respect for common people.|$|R

25|$|In 2011, as the world's {{population}} {{passed the}} seven billion mark Ehrlich {{has argued that}} the next two billion people on Earth would cause more damage than the previous two billion because we are now increasingly having to resort to using more marginal and environmentally damaging resources. As of 2013, Ehrlich continues to perform policy research concerning population and resource issues, with an <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> endangered species, cultural evolution, environmental ethics, and the preservation of genetic resources. Along with Dr. Gretchen Daily, he has performed work in countryside biogeography; that is, the study of making human-disturbed areas hospitable to biodiversity. His research group at Stanford University examines extensively natural populations of the Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis). The population-related disasters Ehrlich predicted have largely failed to materialize, with population growth rates slowing and new food production technologies increasing the food supply faster than the population. Ehrlich endorses his general thesis that the human population is too large, posing a direct threat to human survival and the environment of the planet.|$|E
25|$|Below {{the level}} of the shire each county was divided into areas known as {{hundreds}} (or wapentakes in the north of England). These were original groups of families rather than geographical areas. The Hundred Court was a smaller version of the shire, presided over by the hundred bailiff, formerly a sheriff's appointment, but over the years many hundreds fell into the private hands of a local large landowner. We are not well-informed about Hundred Court business, which must have been a mix of the administrative and judicial, but they remained in some areas an important forum for the settlement of local disputes well into the post-Conquest period. The Anglo-Saxon system put an <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> compromise and arbitration: litigating parties were enjoined to settle their differences if at all possible. If they persisted in bringing a case for decision before a Shire Court then it could be determined there. The suitors of the court would pronounce a judgment which fixed how the case would be decided: legal problems were considered to be too complex and difficult for mere human decision and so proof or demonstration of the right would depend upon some irrational, non-human criterion. The normal methods of proof were oath-helping or the ordeal.|$|E
500|$|In his interest-based rights approach, Cochrane {{draws upon}} {{a number of}} {{normative}} theories, but most particularly utilitarianism and liberalism, and the framework has been presented by commentators as a possible middle-ground between the rights theory of Regan and the utilitarian account offered by Peter Singer. Cochrane {{is not the first}} theorist to advocate an interest-based account of animal rights. Garner identifies Joel Feinberg, James Rachels and Steve Sapontzis as three philosophers who have previously used the language of interest rights, while Cochrane identifies R. G. Frey and Regan as two others who have addressed the possibility. Interest-based approaches to animal ethics have become significant in recent academic literature; Milligan identifies [...] "a strong <b>emphasis</b> <b>upon</b> animal interests but {{in the context of a}} rights theory rather than a Singer-style consequentialism" [...] as one of the key components of the political turn.|$|E
