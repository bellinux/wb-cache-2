50|$|After initial {{investigation}} in 2013, {{and later in}} 2014, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority issued a statement that <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> should never be used to extinguish a Boilover such as a chip pan fire, even if the icons or text on the blanket indicates the blanket {{may be used in}} such a case. This includes <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> which have been tested according to BS EN 1869. In the investigation out of the 22 tested <b>fire</b> <b>blankets,</b> 16 of the <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> themselves caught <b>fire.</b> In the other 6 the fire reignited when the blanket was removed after 17 minutes. The Dutch Fire Burn foundation reported several accidents involving the use of <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> when extinguishing boilovers. Consumers may send in their existing <b>fire</b> <b>blankets,</b> which will then receive a sticker stating 'niet geschikt voor olie- en vetbranden' ("not suitable for oil- and fat fires"). New products will have this text printed, rather than stickered.|$|R

50|$|Fire blankets, {{along with}} fire extinguishers, are fire safety items {{that can be}} useful in case of a fire. These {{nonflammable}} blankets are helpful in temperatures up to 900 degrees and are useful in smothering fires by not allowing any oxygen to the fire.

50|$|Small <b>fire</b> <b>blankets,</b> such as {{for use in}} {{kitchens and}} around the home, are usually made of {{fiberglass}} and sometimes kevlar, and are folded into a quick-release contraption for ease of storage.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} a fire to burn, all three {{elements}} of the fire triangle must be present: heat, fuel and oxygen.The <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> must be sealed closely to a solid surface around the fire. Whether the blanket is placed on top, or surrounding it, {{the job of the}} blanket is to cut off the oxygen supply to the fire, thereby putting it out.|$|E
50|$|Performing {{with fire}} has many {{inherent}} {{risks to the}} health and safety of the practitioners. Fire breathing has a wider range of risks due to the required technique to create the effect. Having an actively spotting trained safety assistant with an appropriate <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> and fire extinguisher is an appropriate best practice when fire breathing and is a mandatory clause in most insurance policies for professional fire breathers.|$|E

50|$|Fire {{performance}} {{skills are}} inherently dangerous and only careful {{use of the}} props, storage of the fuel and performance in appropriate spaces will mean that the risks are minimised. Fire insurance policies all require fire performers to carry <b>fire</b> extinguishers, <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> or other <b>fire</b> safety equipment.|$|R
50|$|Larger <b>fire</b> <b>blankets,</b> {{for use in}} {{laboratory}} and industrial situations, are often made of wool (sometimes treated with a flame retardant fluid). These blankets are usually mounted in vertical quick-release container {{so that they can}} be easily pulled out and wrapped round a person whose clothes are on fire.|$|R
50|$|The {{triangle}} {{illustrates the}} three elements a fire needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen). A fire naturally {{occurs when the}} elements are present and combined in the right mixture, meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing. A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing {{any one of the}} elements in the fire triangle. For example, covering a fire with a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire. In large fires where firefighters are called in, decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area.|$|E
50|$|In such cases, it is {{necessary}} to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires {{and in the absence of}} other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there.|$|E
50|$|In a more {{domestic}} setting, steam explosions can be {{a result}} of trying to extinguish burning oil with water. When oil in a pan is on fire, the natural impulse may be to extinguish it with water. However, doing so will cause the water to become superheated by the hot oil. Upon turning to steam, it will disperse upwards and outwards rapidly and violently in a spray also containing the ignited oil. It {{is for this reason that}} the correct course of action for dealing with such fires is to either use a damp cloth or a tight lid on the pan; both help deprive the fire of oxygen, and the cloth also serves to cool it down. Alternatively, a non-volatile purpose designed fire retardant agent or simply a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> can be used instead.|$|E
40|$|Smoke from forest <b>fires</b> <b>blanketed</b> the Indonesian {{islands of}} Kalimantan and Sumatra in late 1997. Population-based {{longitudinal}} survey data are combined with satellite measures of aerosol levels {{to assess the}} impact of the fires on adult health. To account for unobserved differences between haze and non-haze areas, we compare changes in health of individual respondents. Between 1993 and 1997, individuals exposed to haze experienced greater increases in difficulties with activities of daily living than their counterparts in non-haze areas. Results for respiratory and general health, though more complicated to interpret, suggest the haze had a negative impact on these dimensions of health...|$|R

Also inside the room were <b>fire</b> <b>blankets,</b> and supplies to sustain the occupants for 24 hours. Charts on the wall gave guidance to the occupants as to when to light oxygen candles to replenish breathable oxygen, and when to change the CO2 scrubbers to remove excess carbon dioxide from the air. A radio link was available for communication with rescuers and responders. A toilet was installed behind one of the seats.|$|R
5000|$|Fires {{that involve}} cooking oils or fats are {{designated}} [...] "Class K" [...] under the American system, and [...] "Class F" [...] under the European/Australian systems. Though such fires are technically a subclass of the flammable liquid/gas class, the special characteristics {{of these types}} of fires, namely the higher flash point, are considered important enough to recognize separately. Water mist can be used to extinguish such fires. Appropriate fire extinguishers may also have hoods over them that help extinguish the <b>fire.</b> Sometimes <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> are used to stop a fire in a kitchen or on a stove.|$|R

30|$|Seven items {{including}} individual {{fire prevention}} awareness and individual fire response awareness and knowledge were tested (Table  4). The {{results show that}} the intervention was effective in enhancing subjects’ knowledge on fire blankets after 17  months. Household representatives who had participated in the 2015 intervention demonstrated significantly better understanding on what a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> is (OR[*]=[*] 3.79, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1.39 – 10.34) and understood that a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> can fight a blaze if used appropriately (OR[*]=[*] 3.56, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1.34 – 9.49). No significant differences were observed for other items (Table  4). Of note, among the 29 household representatives that participated in the 2015 health education intervention session, more than half (n[*]=[*] 19, 65.5 %) reported that they did not keep the <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> they received.|$|E
30|$|This was {{the first}} study to examine the {{effectiveness}} of a face-to-face community-based health education intervention on risk perceptions, specifically the Health-EDRM knowledge of fire risks among high-risk ethnic minorities in rural China. The 17 -month post-intervention evaluation showed that the awareness of the use of a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> among people who had participated in the 2015 intervention was significantly higher (compared to non-participants in the 2015 intervention) while overall fire responses awareness among people who did not participate in the 2015 intervention remained low. However, fire risks perception continued to remain low in the community after the interventions. Previous experience of fire accidents did not show statistically significant association with risk perception and fire risks knowledge/awareness. Despite the high risk and repeated fire incidents in the study community, only a small proportion of respondents recalled the correct emergency number for fire services. This finding indicates low awareness of help seeking options from formal fire and relief agencies. Significant improvements were observed after the intervention in recalling the correct emergency number for fire services and in fire response awareness, especially in using a <b>fire</b> <b>blanket</b> and managing new hazards like electrical fires. Slight improvement in fire prevention awareness was also observed after intervention but the changes were not statistically significant. Villagers of younger age and higher education level were more likely to recall the accurate emergency number for fire services. These findings are consistent with other studies that knowledge and awareness level varies by age and education in both rural China and, for example, Ethiopia (Liao 2013; Wei 2013; Hajito et al. 2015).|$|E
50|$|Newer {{electric}} blankets have a shutoff mechanism {{to prevent the}} blanket from overheating or catching <b>fire.</b> Older <b>blankets</b> (prior to about 2001) {{may not have a}} shut-off mechanism; users run the risk of overheating.

5000|$|The {{boat was}} in the news again in March 2016, still moored at Hurst Park. The BBC {{secretly}} filmed {{the inside of the}} boat, and asked a Chartered Surveyor and Member of the Association for Specialist Fire Protection to spend a night on board and give his views on the vessel. He described it as a [...] "bonfire", and [...] "timber with loads of holes waiting for a match". He noted that the boat had no firestops at all. The owner responded to the concerns by saying that the boat had been fitted with fire alarms, fire exits, CO2 alarms, <b>fire</b> <b>blankets</b> and <b>fire</b> extinguishers, that no smoking was permitted on the boat at all, and that the onboard coal stoves had concrete-and-steel surrounds.|$|R
