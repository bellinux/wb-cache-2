40|$|AbstractDuring {{gastrulation}} in Drosophila, ventral cells change shape, undergoing synchronous apical constriction, {{to create}} the ventral furrow (VF). This process is affected in mutant embryos lacking zygotic function of the folded gastrulation (fog) gene, which encodes a putative secreted protein. Fog is an essential autocrine signal that induces cytoskeletal changes in invaginating VF cells. Here we show that Fog is also required for nervous system <b>development.</b> <b>Fog</b> is expressed by longitudinal glia in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), and reducing its expression in glia causes defects in process extension and axon ensheathment. Glial Fog overexpression produces a disorganized glial lattice. Fog has a distinct set of functions in CNS neurons. Our data show that reduction or overexpression of Fog in these neurons produces axon guidance phenotypes. Interestingly, these phenotypes closely resemble those seen in embryos with altered expression of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP 52 F. We conducted epistasis experiments to define the genetic relationships between Fog and PTP 52 F, and the results suggest that PTP 52 F is a downstream component of the Fog signaling pathway in CNS neurons. We also found that Ptp 52 F mutants have early VF phenotypes like those seen in fog mutants...|$|E

The CCZ concept defines a transition zone in which warm dry continental air converges with cool moist marine air and denotes the seaward extent of coastal influence. The location of the transitory CCZ is dependent upon the strength of offshore flow of continental air from the coastal region.

The study focuses on a 48 -hour period when atmospheric conditions are highly variable: relative humidity changes between 50 and 100 %, visibility ranges between 65 and 35 000 m, the site is either downwind the Paris area either under maritime influence. A dense and homogeneous fog formed during the night by radiative cooling. In 6 h, visibility decreased down from 30 000 m in the clear-sky regime to 65 m within the fog, because of advected urban pollution (factor 3 to 4 in visibility reduction), aerosol hydration (factor 20) and aerosol activation (factor 6). Computations of aerosol optical properties, based on Mie theory, show that extinction in clear-sky regime is due equally to the ultrafine modes and to the accumulation mode. Extinction by haze is due to hydrated aerosol particles distributed in the accumulation mode, defined by a geometric mean diameter of 0. 6 Œºm and a geometric standard deviation of 1. 4.

A trajectory analysis examined {{the evolution of the}} wind, air-sea interaction, and thermodynamic properties of the air column prior to the sea fog formation; a time variation of similar properties at fixed locations investigated the evolution of the fog for the entire life cycle of the fog event; and a vertical cross-section through Kunsan AB revealed the spatial variability and the effects of coastal circulations. Finally, evaluation of a current forecast tool, Fog Stability Index (FSI), was conducted to determine its adequacy. Results from this analysis indicated strong influence of the adjacent sea on the <b>fog</b> <b>development</b> and maintenance at Kunsan AB. For the fog event studied in this research, fog initially developed as nocturnal fog over land, but was later maintained by advection from the sea. Strong cooling within the fog layer was present resulting in significant surface-air temperature difference, likely associated with radiation cooling. Radiative cooling, however, did not result in turbulent mixing due to the shallowness of the fog layer and the stable thermal stratification. The presence of the fog layer along the coast appeared to modify the coastal circulation, which was also an important component in introducing moisture into Kunsan AB for fog formation/maintenance. Dissipation of the fog was dominated by synoptic changes. A modified version of FSI is suggested based on results from this study. Captain, United States Air Forc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of aerosol {{properties}} on the formation and the <b>development</b> of radiation <b>fog.</b> Simulations were performed using the Meso-NH meteorological model including the ORILAM aerosol scheme coupled with a two-moment microphysical cloud scheme (number concentration of cloud droplets and cloud water content). The activation scheme used {{was taken from the}} work of Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2004). "Off-line" sensitivity analysis of CCN (Cloud Condensation Nuclei) activation was performed on number, median diameter and chemical compounds of aerosols. During this "off-line" study, the interactions with the other physical processes (e. g. radiative) were not taken into account since the cooling rate was imposed. Different regimes of CCN activation and a critical value of aerosol number concentration were found. This critical aerosol number corresponds to the maximum of activated cloud droplets for a given cooling rate and given aerosol chemical properties. As long as the aerosol number concentration is below this critical value, the cloud droplet number increases when the aerosol number increases. But when the aerosol number concentration exceeds this critical value, the cloud droplet number decreases when aerosol number increases. A sensitivity study on aerosol chemical composition showed that the CCN activation was limited in the case of hydrophilic aerosol composed of material with a solubility in the 10 % range. An event observed during the ParisFOG field experiment was simulated. This case took place in the polluted sub-urban area of Paris (France) characterized by particle concentrations of 17 000 aerosols per cm 3. 1 D simulations successfully reproduced the observed temporal evolution of the fog layer. Beyond the initial fog formation at the surface, cloud droplet formation occurred {{at the top of the}} fog layer where the cooling rate was maximum, reaching more than ‚àí 10 K h ‚àí 1. These simulations confirm that the aerosol particle number concentration is a key parameter for the accurate prediction of the microphysical properties of a fog layer and also influences the vertical <b>development</b> of <b>fog.</b> The important of the interaction between microphysical and radiative processes is illustrated, showing how the life cycle of a fog layer is determined by the CCN number concentration and chemical properties...|$|R

Using a GATA 1 -dependent committed erythroid cell line, select MC genes were found to be occupied by NuRD, suggesting a direct mechanism of repression.

Despite growing {{evidence suggesting that}} FOG in PD {{may be associated with}} cognitive dysfunction, the relationship between regional brain atrophy and FOG has been poorly investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimized VBM was applied to 3 T brain MR images of 24 patients with PD and 12 HC. Patients were classified as either FOG or FOG (n 12) based on their responses to a validated FOG Questionnaire and clinical observation. All patients with PD also underwent a detailed neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: The VBM analysis in patients with FOG showed a reduced GM volume in the left cuneus, precuneus, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex compared with both patients with FOG and HC. We did not detect any significant change of GM volume when comparing HC versus all patients with PD (FOG and FOG).

40|$|The {{acceptance}} and processing of fats, oils, and grease (FOG) wastes at municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) is of increasing interest {{because of the need}} to keep these materials out of wastewater collection systems, as well as the added energy recovery potential when FOG wastes are anaerobically digested. Adding FOG waste to anaerobic digesters is particularly attractive over other feedstocks such as food waste because of the high volatile content that can yield over one cubic metre of methane per kg and high degradation with minimal extra solids requiring disposal. The addition of FOG wastes to a WWTP usually requires combining the FOG waste with sludges from the WWTP, in a process that utilises the energy from FOG, such as anaerobic digestion.

Regarding the long-term develop-ment of fog, two 20 -year time slice simulations for a control (1981 to 2000) and a future (2081 to 2100) period following the A 1 B emission scenario were conducted. The model generally projects a slight increase in the number of fog days for the coastal areas and a slight decrease for the regions located further inland. Especially the latter has the potential to exacerbate the existing water scarcity in the region. Zusammenfassung: Nebelniederschl√§ge spielen eine bedeutende Rolle f√ºr die Wasserversorgung der K√ºstenregionen des s√ºdwestlichen Afrikas. Es ist in dieser Region daher von gro√üer Bedeutung, die zuk√ºnftige Entwicklung des Wassereintrag...|$|R
40|$|A Lagrangian {{model has}} been {{developed}} to study acidic deposition due to radiation fog. The model couples submodels describing the development and dissipation of radiation fog, the gas-phase chemistry and transfer, and the aqueous-phase chemistry. The model is applied to a radiation fog episode in Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley of California over the period January 4 ‚Äì 5, 1985. Model predictions for temperature profile, <b>fog</b> <b>development,</b> liquid water content, gas-phase concentrations of SO_ 2, HNO_ 3, and NH_ 3, pH, aqueous-phase concentrations of SO_ 4 ^(2 ‚àí), NH_ 4 ^+, and NO_ 3 ^‚àí, and finally deposition rates of the above ions are compared with the observed values. The deposition rates of the major ions are predicted to increase significantly during the fog episode, the most notable being the increase of sulfate deposition. Pathways for sulfate production that are of secondary importance in a cloud environment may become significant in a fog. Expressing the mean droplet settling velocity {{as a function of}} liquid water content is found to be quite influential in the model's predictions...|$|R
