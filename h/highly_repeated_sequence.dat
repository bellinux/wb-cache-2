Restriction mapping of cloned Physarum M+ DNA segments, and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using subcloned segments of M+ DNA as a probe, provide evidence for sequence variation within different copies of the dominant highly repeated element, and possibly the other associated repeats in M+ DNA, and additionally that almost complete tandemly repeated copies of the major repeat are found in some M+ DNA segments...|$|E

However, in the presence of the E 1 A gene products of either adenovirus type 5 or 2, the GT element activated expression from the MLP. The stimulatory activity of the GT element in the presence of E 1 A had the properties of an enhancer element, and the trans-activating effect on the GT element was additive in conjunction with the E 1 A-responsive BK virus enhancer. We also have demonstrated that a specific nuclear factor(s) binds to the GT element. However, the E 1 A protein(s) do not affect the initial factor interaction(s) with the GT element.

40|$|Because {{they usually}} {{correspond}} to unique sequences, RFLP markers {{are used in}} genomic mapping, variety distinction, variety homogeneity and in reconstruction of phylogenies. Nevertheless, {{they are not the}} most suitable markers for all these applications. Their use in taxonomy is not always straightforward, since these sequences may be highly conserved as in the genus Beta L. The analysis of genetic variability allows calculation of genetic distances and enables the construction of phenograms, but not phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees are constructed using other methods based on parsimony analysis and, hence, they do not always fit within taxonomic groups. Therefore, we have turned to other molecular markers which have already been found in sections Beta, Corollinae and Procumbentes, and, therefore, fit well into the main taxonomic divisions. RFLPs with <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> are generally not used, although they offer a wide range of potential applications.

40|$|Repeats or Transposable Elements (TEs) are <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequence</b> stretches, {{present in}} {{virtually}} all eukaryotic genomes. We explore the distribution of representative TEs from all major classes in entire chromosomes across various organisms. We employ two complementary approaches, the scaling of block entropy and box-counting. Both converge {{to the conclusion that}} well-developed fractality is typical of small genomes while in large genomes it appears sporadically and in some cases is rudimentary. The human genome is particularly prone to develop this pattern, as TE chromosomal distributions therein are often highly clustered and inhomogeneous. Comparing with previous works, where occurrence of power-law-like size distributions in inter-repeat distances is studied, we conclude that fractality in entire chromosomes is a more stringent (thus less often encountered) condition. We have formulated a simple evolutionary scenario for the genomic dynamics of TEs, which may account for their fractal distribution in real genomes. The observed fractality and long-range properties of TE genomic distributions have probably contributed to the formation of the “fractal globule”, a model for the confined chromatin organization of the eukaryotic nucleus proposed on the basis of experimental evidence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{sensitive}} and specific detection of cercariae of human schistosomes {{is required for}} better definition of risk of infection. In the present study, we have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay {{for the detection of}} cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni in water. A simple DNA preparation was adapted for this purpose, and PCR primers were designed based on the 121 -basepair <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequence</b> we previously identified in the genome of S. mansoni. The PCR assay detected as little as 1026 ng of S. mansoni DNA, and the high sensitivity enabled the detection of a single cercaria. For trapping of cercariae we adapted a filtration apparatus previously used for separating schistosome eggs from turbid enzymatic digests of tissues. A single cercaria could be detected in repeated tests of water filtrates. Since the target DNA is tandemly arranged, a ladder pattern of the PCR products was demonstrated. A direct relationship was demonstrated between the number of ladder bands of the amplification products, and DNA concentration or number of cercariae. The feasibility of semiquantitation of schistosome larvae in natural water was thus suggested. The potential of the procedures described here for epidemiologic studies is discussed.

40|$|We suggest {{hypotheses}} {{to account}} for two major features of chromosomal organization in higher eukaryotes. The first {{of these is the}} general restriction of crossing over in the neighborhood of centromeres and telomeres. We propose that this is a consequence of selection for reduced rates of unequal exchange between <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> for which the copy number is subject to stabilizing selection: microtubule binding sites, in the case of centromeres, and the short <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> needed for terminal replication of a linear DNA molecule, in the case of telomeres. An association between proximal crossing over and nondisjunction would also favor the restriction of crossing over near the centromere. The second feature is the association between <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> of no obvious functional significance and regions of restricted crossing over. We show that <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> are likely to persist longest (over evolutionary time) when crossing over is infrequent. This is because unequal exchange among <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> generates single copy sequences, and a population that becomes fixed for a single copy sequence by drift remains in this state indefinitely (in the absence of gene amplification processes). Increased rates of exchange thus speed up the process of stochastic loss of <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, we adapted a {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) assay, previously shown by us to be very sensitive for detecting cercariae in water, for the sensitive detection of Schistosoma mansoni DNA in infected snails from early prepatency. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed based on the 121 -basepair <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequence</b> we previously identified in the genome of S. mansoni. The DNA was prepared from the snails by a simple alkaline extraction procedure, and the PCR assay enabled a clear differentiation between infected and normal snails. Infected snails were detected as early as one day after penetration of a single miracidium. The high sensitivity of the test enabled identification of a single infected snail even when its DNA was pooled with material from up to 99 uninfected snails, thus demonstrating the possibility of mass diagnosis in pools of snails. The assay {{has the potential for}} large-scale determination of prepatent infection prevalence in snails, thus offering new possibilities for the eval-uation of schistosomiasis transmission and for schistosomiais control, as discussed. Schistosomiasis, is caused in humans by three main spe-cies of blood flukes (Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum) and is transmitted by freshwater snails.

Genome-wide profiles and analyses of small RNAs, particularly the large class of 24 -nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), were done for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and silencing pathway mutants with defects in three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) and four Dicerlike (DCL) genes. The profiling involved direct analysis using a multiplexed, parallel-sequencing strategy. Small RNAgenerating loci, especially those producing predominantly 24 -nt siRNAs, {{were found to}} be highly correlated with repetitive elements across the genome. These {{were found to be}} largely RDR 2 - and DCL 3 -dependent, although alternative DCL activities were detected on a widespread level in the absence of DCL 3. In contrast, no evidence for RDR 2 -alternative activities was detected. Analysis of RDR 2 - and DCL 3 -dependent small RNA accumulation patterns in and around protein-coding genes revealed that upstream gene regulatory sequences systematically lack siRNAgenerating activities. Further, expression profiling suggested that relatively few genes, proximal to abundant 24 -nt siRNAs, are regulated directly by RDR 2 - and DCL 3 -dependent silencing. We conclude that the widespread accumulation patterns for RDR 2 - and DCL 3 -dependent siRNAs throughout the Arabidopsis genome largely reflect mechanisms to silence <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequence...</b>|$|E

40|$|A goal of {{molecular}} genetics {{is to understand}} the relationship between basic nuclear processes, epigenetic changes and the numerous proteins that orchestrate these effects. One such protein, ATRX, contains a highly conserved plant homeodomain (PHD) -like domain, present in many chromatin-associated proteins, and a carboxy-terminal domain which identifies it {{as a member of the}} SNF 2 family of helicase/ATPases. Mutations in ATRX give rise to characteristic developmental abnormalities including severe mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, urogenital abnormalities and alpha-thalassaemia. This circumstantial evidence suggests that ATRX may act as a transcriptional regulator through an effect on chromatin. We have recently shown that ATRX is localized to pericentromeric heterochromatin during interphase and mitosis, suggesting that ATRX might exert other chromatin-mediated effects in the nucleus.

These elements spawn smaller parasitic versions (generally > 100 nt) that propagate through proteins encoded by the full elements. <b>Highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> smaller than 100 nt have been described, but they are either nonmobile or their origins are not known. We have surveyed the genome of the multicellular cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme, and its relatives for small dispersed <b>repeat</b> (SDR) <b>sequences</b> and have identified eight families in the range of from 21 to 27 nucleotides. Three of the families (SDR 4, SDR 5, and SDR 6), despite little sequence similarity, share a common predicted secondary structure, a conclusion supported by patterns of compensatory mutations. The SDR elements are found in a diverse set of contexts, often embedded within tandemly <b>repeated</b> heptameric <b>sequences</b> or within minitransposons. One element (SDR 5) is found exclusively within instances of an octamer, HIP 1, that is highly over-represented in the genomes of many cyanobacteria. Two elements (SDR 1 and SDR 4) often are found within copies of themselves, producing complex nested insertions. An analysis of SDR elements within cyanobacterial genomes indicate that they are essentially confined to a coherent subgroup. The evidence indicates that some of the SDR elements, probably working through RNA intermediates, have been mobile in recent evolutionary time, making them perhaps the smallest known mobile elements...|$|R
40|$|Cercarial {{shedding}} tests do {{not provide}} species identification of the shistosomes concerned and cannot detect prepatent schistosomal infections. We have demonstrated that both immunodetection by ELISA of schistosomal antigens in snail hemophlymph, and dot hybridization of snail extracts by DNA probe representing <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences,</b> proved suitable for detecting infected snails during prepatnecy as well as patency. A group-specific monoclonal antibody {{was found to be}} suitable for detecting Schistosoma mansoni infection in Biomphalaria sp., but not for positive identification of S. haematobium in Blulinus sp. Comparative evaluation of the diagnostic qualities, and technical aspects and cost of these tests, point to the superiority of the immunodetection approach for large scale detection of snails prepatently infected with S. mansoni. This approach is potentially useful for providing extended information on schistosome-snail epidemiology that may facilitate rapid evaluation of the danger of post-control reinfection, and help make decisions on the time and place of supplementary control measures. In this context the potential usefulness of the immunodetection or DNA probing approach for facilitating catalytic model representation of schistosome-snail epidemiology warrants further evaluation. Specific identification of S. haematobium in Bulinus by either of these approaches may be possible depending on the development of suitable antibodies or DNA probes...|$|R
40|$|Cytological {{localization}} {{of one of}} the <b>highly</b> <b>repeated</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> of Vicia faba, the FokI <b>repeat</b> <b>sequence</b> family, {{was determined}} by in situ hybridization. This sequence family was described in our previous paper (Kato et al. 1984) as tandem arrays of 59 bp unit sequences. The distribution pattern of silver grains showed that the FokI family sequences are exclusively localized in certain median regions in the long arms of all five pairs of the subtelocentric (S) chromosomes, but are not found in any portions in the metacentric (M) chromosomes. These median regions in the S long arms correspond closely to the positions of C-band heterochromatin revealed by preferential Giemsa staining. Since M chromosomes also possess C-bands, the absence of the FokI <b>repeat</b> <b>sequences</b> in the M chromosomes indicates that V. faba C-band heterochromatin consists of at least two different DNA sequences. V. faba chromosomes also contain other repetitive sequences, which have been characterized as the 250, 850, 900, 990, 1150, 1500 and 1750 by BamHI sequence families (Kato et al. 1985). In situ hybridization with nicktranslated 250 and 1500 bp BamHI family sequences indicated that these <b>repeated</b> <b>sequences</b> are generally spread all over the chromosome...|$|R
