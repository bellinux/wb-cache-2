The author explores the complex interactions between journalists, <b>journalism,</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> with different social actors in the Colombian armed conflict. She questions notions of journalism that regard the media solely as creators of public opinion whose role is to give different visions and versions of the armed conflict. She analyzes the complex forms of interaction between journalists, different sectors of society, and armed actors (the guerrillas, the paramilitary, and the armed forces) that go far beyond the media itself and involve different symbolic, political, and military processes in the struggle of hege-mony over information. The author calls {{for a return to}} a type of journalism that allows for the making of critical connections between events, social actors, and political contexts...|$|E
40|$|The borders {{between the}} media genres <b>journalism</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> or PR are blurring, and this {{development}} is especially noticeable among freelance journalists. How does this affect freelance journalists, particularly their ethical reasoning? Thirteen interviews with freelancers {{living in a}} peripheral northern county in Sweden were analyzed, using a com - bination of discourse analysis and narrative theory methods and a virtue ethics theoretical framework. It was found that 11 out of 13 informants worked occasionally or regularly with information-type assignments. To sustain the informants’ professional roles and self- identities of integrity and impartiality, having boundary settings between, first, informa - tion/PR and journalist roles and, second, information and journalist type assignments was crucial. It was evident that individual ethics had replaced professional principles. The freelancers reflexively process media industry constraints, together with their everyday working conditions, {{in a situation where}} the ideals and norms of the profession constitute the background for their individual action ethic...|$|E

40|$|The {{boundaries}} of ‘literature’ {{have always been}} blurred, and oratory has always lurked on the fringe. In ‘literature’ of a narrower definition, Milton’s Satan, ‘like some huge ammiral’, looms large as an imaginative creation. Hitler is the greatest demagogue of recent history. Milton himself was, of course, a great polemicist and rhetorician and, in good seventeenthcentury fashion, not always a particularly savoury one. Was Blake right in his canonical statement that Milton was of the devil’s party without knowing it? What is rhetoric {{and what are the}} techniques which can make its creative use of language a fiendish art? Why are some speeches pernicious, others great? Are there principles underlying malign rhetoric that literature and history can be used to illustrate?
