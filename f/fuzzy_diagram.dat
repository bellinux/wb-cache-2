The diagram provides a basis from which decisions can be made, or patterns discerned. Information flows through the <b>fuzzy</b> inference <b>diagram</b> as shown below.

This paper describes {{a new approach}} to detect obstacles for serpentine robot. It captures the image sequence and analyzed the optical flow modules to estimate the deepness of the scene. This avoids one or higher order differential in the traditional optical flow calculation. The data of ultrasonic sensor and attitude transducer sensor are fused into the algorithm to improve the real-time capability and the robustness. The detecting results are presented by <b>fuzzy</b> <b>diagrams</b> which is concise and convenient.

40|$|When {{no expert}} {{knowledge}} is available, fuzzy if-then rules may be extracted from examples of {{performance of a}} system. For this, an a priori decision {{on the number of}} linguistic terms of the linguistic variables may be required. This may induce a "rigid granularity", usually finer than that actually required by the system. <b>Fuzzy</b> Decision <b>Diagrams</b> are introduced as an efficient data structure to represent fuzzy rule bases and to systematically check their completeness and consistency. Moreover if the hypothesis of rigid granularity holds, reordering of the variables of a <b>Fuzzy</b> Decision <b>Diagram</b> may lead to a compacter and more precise rule base. The concept of reconvergent subgraphs is introduced to support the search for effective reorderings. 1. Foreword This paper is meant for fuzzy logicians using approximate reasoning or fuzzy control.

40|$|The {{practice}} of stochastic sensitivity analysis {{described in the}} decision analysis literature is a testimonial {{to the need for}} considering deviations from precise point estimates of uncertainty. We propose the use of Bayesian fuzzy probabilities within an influence diagram computational scheme for performing sensitivity analysis during the solution of probabilistic inference and decision problems. Unlike other parametric approaches, the proposed scheme does not require resolving the problem for the varying probability point estimates. We claim that the solution to <b>fuzzy</b> influence <b>diagrams</b> provides as much information as the classical point estimate approach plus additional information concerning stochastic sensitivity. An example based on diagnostic decision making in microcomputer assembly is used to illustrate this idea.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to define a fuzzy based {{prediction}} system, that will accept the patient basic information as well as the symptoms as input and identify the chances of heart disease. The fuzzy basedsystem is defined on multiple parameters based on which the patient disease analysis can be performed.

These fuzzified parametric information is maintained in the database. The fuzzification process is here presented in the form of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>diagrams</b> also. Once the patient fuzzified information is maintained in the database, patient or the Doctor can perform a query to identify the patients at different criticality level. For this, we have designed a user friendly input environment where a fuzzy query can be performed by specifying the parameter and the criticality level of the parameter. We have also defined the fuzzy engine by performing the different fuzzy operators while working with these all parameters...|$|R

40|$|Unified Modeling Language (UML) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the most popular techniques to describe static and dynamic aspects of software systems. One of the primary issues in designing software packages is the existence of uncertainty associated with such models. Fuzzy-UML to describe software architecture has both static and dynamic perspective, simultaneously. The evaluation of software architecture design phase initiates always help us find some additional requirements, which helps reduce cost of design. In this paper, we use a fuzzy data model to describe the static aspects of software architecture and the <b>fuzzy</b> sequence <b>diagram</b> to illustrate the dynamic aspects of software architecture.

A possible way to alleviate this difficulty is to present to the decision maker a subset of a small number of solutions representatives of the Pareto Front characteristics. In this paper, a two-steps procedure is presented, aimed at identifying a limited number of representative solutions to be presented to the decision maker. Pareto Front solutions are first clustered into "families", which are then synthetically represented by a "head-of-the-family" solution. Level Diagrams are then used to represent, analyse and interpret the Pareto Front reduced to its head-of-the-family solutions.

The fuzzy rough relational database is formally de®ned, along with a fuzzy rough relational algebra for querying. Comparisons of theoretical properties of operators in this model with those in the standard relational model are discussed.

For this purpose, we develop a country-level decision support framework to determine maturation stage of e-Commerce in a country. At first, e-Commerce maturity scores of local e-Markets in each regional e-Market are calcu lated using a fuzzy bi-level Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Then, e-Commerce maturity scores of regional e-Markets in the country are determined based on a <b>fuzzy</b> bi-level fishbone <b>diagram.</b> After that, national e-Commerce maturity level is assessed using a three-level decision making model. The contribution of the proposed decision support framework is four fold s : 1) it develops a fishbone <b>diagram</b> to a <b>fuzzy</b> bi-level environment; 2) it presents a country-level decision making model with three levels of local, regional, interna tional e-Markets to assess country’s e-Commerce maturity level; 3) it considers interdependencies between local, re gional and international e-Markets; and 4) it synthesizes qualitative judgments and quantitative data of maturity criteria and sub-criteria. The results of this self-assessment can be used to analyze national e-Commerce strengths, weaknesses in e-Commerce development and move to the next level of e-Commerce maturity.

40|$|AbstractApproximately 25 {{per cent}} of all {{congestion}} on motorways {{is caused by}} incidents. By virtual patrolling, incidents e. g. queues, accidents and car breakdowns on a road network, can be predicted or detected in an early stage. This early detection and prediction of an incident likely to happen, offers the opportunity to act faster and therefore reduce congestion compared to current practice. A module is developed capable of virtual patrolling and based on four key features: data fusion, real-time estimation of the fundamental <b>diagram,</b> <b>fuzzy</b> traffic state estimation and artificial neural networks. In CHARM, the cooperation between the Highways England (UK) and Rijkswaterstaat (NL), the potential of this module has been demonstrated in a simulation environment and in 2015 further developed, deployed and tested in real life. Extended Kalman filtering and traffic flow theory algorithms are used to fuse data from loop detectors with FVD (floating vehicle data) to provide detailed traffic state data (i. e. flow and speed for 10 seconds for every segment of approximately 200  meters). For the prediction of the future traffic state, information on the actual road capacity is necessary. Road capacity varies for weather, lightness, number of heavy vehicles et cetera. A self-adapting module is {{used to make a}} real time estimation of the fundamental diagram and road capacity. The traffic state estimation itself is based on fuzzy logic to determine to what extent the traffic state is free flow or congested. If only speed data is available, alternative simplified fuzzy logic rules are applied. The fuzzy traffic state estimations for separate segments is combined into a combined traffic state estimation. This traffic state estimation is used as input for artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict whether it is likely that a queue will form within the short-term future (within 10 minutes) on a relevant segment. This is defined as a segment that suffers from queues on a frequent basis. The results of these estimations will be used for virtual patrolling to distinguish between normal and expected congestion and other situations. Information from the modules can also be used for the detection of prediction of shockwaves. This can be of help to act faster when incidents happen and to prevent or solve shockwaves by giving (in-car) advices on speed and lane choice to car users...|$|R
