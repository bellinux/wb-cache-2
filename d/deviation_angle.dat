However, there {{does not seem to be}} any valid studies that address a comparison between the different types of wrist rests. The objective of this study was to compare four different mouse wrist rests, chosen as a representation of the ones on the market, and try to determine which mouse wrist rests characteristics are better to avoid CTS risk factors and more comfortable based on flexion/extension and ulnar/radial <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> measurements, anthropometric measurements, and perceived subject 2 ̆ 7 s strain and discomfort. ^ A group of twenty-two Industrial Engineering Undergraduate Students (12 males and 10 females) participated in a laboratory study to compare the mouse wrist rests. The participants performed a 5 minute computerized task with each mouse wrist rest. Throughout the tests, wrist angles were measured with a twin axis electrogoniometer. ^ The wrist rest that presented lower flexion/extension mean angle was the Easy Glide Gel Filled Wrist Rest and Mouse Pad™ but was also the wrist rest with the highest mean ulnar/radial <b>deviation</b> <b>angles.</b> The one that showed the highest flexion/extension average angle is the SoftSpot Vantage Economy Mouse Pad and Wrist Rest™. The Gel Crystals Flex Rest Wrist Rest™ had the lower ulnar/radial <b>deviation</b> <b>angles.</b> ^ The Easy Glide Gel Filled Wrist Rest and Mouse Pad™ was the one with the higher scores related to strain severity; also this wrist rest was scored by the participants as the least comfortable. The most comfortable wrist rests were the Gel Crystals Flex Rest Wrist Rest™ and the SoftSpot Vantage Economy Mouse Pad and Wrist Rest™ both with the same scores. ^ Based on these results it is impossible to pinpoint exactly one wrist rest as the best because some characteristics are better to avoid radial/ulnar <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> and others to avoid flexion/extension angles. ...|$|R

In this study, we quantify earlier observations that reported distortions in the perceived shape of bilinear trajectories and in the perceived positions of their deviation. Our results show that bilinear trajectories with <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> smaller than 90 deg are perceived smoothed while those with <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> larger than 90 degrees are perceived sharpened. The sharpening effect is weaker in magnitude than the smoothing effect. We also found a correlation between the distortion of perceived trajectories and the perceived shift of their deviation point. Finally, using a dual-task paradigm, we found that reducing attentional resources allocated to the moving target causes an increase in the perceived shift of the deviation point of the trajectory. We interpret these results in the context of interactions between motion and position systems...|$|R

Methods: Thirty four patients who underwent recession and resection (R&R) were divided into two groups: atracurium usage (group A, n= 18) and no atracurium usage (group B, n= 16). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to the amount of resection of the medial rectus (MR) : less than 5 mm (group 1, n= 13) or 5 mm and greater (group 2, n= 21). <b>Deviation</b> <b>angles</b> were compared between groups and subgroups. Surgical outcome was defined as successful if distant <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> were equal to or less than 10 prism diopters. Results: The overall postoperative <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> did not show statistically significant differences between groups A and B. However, in patients with larger MR resections (≥ 5 mm), the 1 week postoperative distant deviation was significantly larger in group A (1. 8 ± 2. 6 PD) than in group B (- 1. 6 ± 4. 6 PD, p= 0. 048 by t-test). The overall undercorrection rate at 3 months postoperatively for group A was 16. 7 %, which was higher than that of group B (6. 3 %), and the difference was even larger in subgroups with larger MR resections (≥ 5 mm) : 18. 2 % in group A and 0 % in group B.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{incidence}} of secondary wrist injury among manual wheelchair users, recent emphasis has been placed on the investigation of wheelchair propulsion biomechanics. Accurate representation of wrist activity during wheelchair propulsion may help to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the development of wrist injuries. Unfortunately, no consensual wrist biomechanical model has been established. In order to determine if different methodologies obtain similar results, this investigation created and compared three different wrist models: 1) a fixed joint center placed between the styloids (midstyloid joint center); 2) a joint center with 2 ° of freedom computed from de Leva's joint center data; and 3) a floating joint center. Results indicate that wrist flexion and extension angles are highly consistent between models, however, radial and ulnar <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> vary considerably. Mean maximum right flexion angles were found to be 3. 5 °, 2. 2 °, and 5. 0 ° for the midstyloid, de Leva, and floating joint center models, respectively.

Mean maximum right radial <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> for the midstyloid, de Leva, and floating joint center models were 26. 0 °, 26. 9 °, and 45. 1 °, respectively, and ulnar <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> were found to be 30. 5 °, 38. 8 °, and 10. 2 °, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} predicting the reference minimum-loss incidence and <b>deviation</b> <b>angles</b> of a blade arrangement with splitter vanes, which is probably a solution for future ultra-highly loaded axial compressor designs. The motivation of the modeling is to guide the blading design in splittered compressor design processes where the additional splitter vanes must be specially considered. The development of the model {{is based on a}} blade performance database from systematic numerical simulations. Basic correlations of the model are firstly proposed, which consider dominant blade geometry parameters related to blade loading, including camber angle and solidity. Secondly, geometric and aerodynamic corrections about orientation parameter, blade maximum thickness, inlet Mach number, and three-dimensional (3 D) effects are empirically incorporated into the basic correlations. Eventually, a subsonic 3 D splittered rotor is designed using the correlations coupled with the corrections obtained from the validation of the model. The results indicate that the model is able to achieve a good agreement within an error band of ± 1. 0 ° for the predictions of both reference minimum-loss incidence and <b>deviation</b> <b>angles,</b> and the rotor designed using the model accomplishes the desired work input and flow deflection...|$|R
