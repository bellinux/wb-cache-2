The locomotive was operated by design from the outside (side of engine) and wasn't equipped with a dead man device to stop the locomotive automatically in case of incapacity of the operator. There were two manual brakes: a handle and a foot brake. As the handle could be moved by <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> while dead-heading it was required to be fixed by a nut and bolt. Upon taking the locomotive into service again, it was necessary to loosen the nut and bolt.

Longitudinal train dynamics results and computing time of four simulation cases are presented and compared. The results show that all simulators had basic agreement in simulations of locomotive forces, resistance forces and track gradients. The major differences among different simulators lie in the draft gear models. TABLDSS, UM, CRE-LTS, TDEAS, TsDyn and CARS had general agreement in terms of the in-train forces; minor differences exist as reflections of draft gear model variations. <b>In-train</b> <b>force</b> oscillations were observed in VOCO due to the introduction of wheelâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 rail contact. <b>In-train</b> <b>force</b> instabilities were sometimes observed in PoliTo and BODYSIM due to the velocity controlled transitional characteristics which could have generated unreasonable transitional stiffness.

With the ever increasing of tonnage and length of heavy haul trains, lateral <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> generated by longitudinal <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> and coupler rotations have become a more and more significant safety issue for heavy haul train operations. Derailments caused by excessive lateral <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> are frequently reported. This article studies two typical coupler systems used on heavy haul locomotives. Their structures and stabilizing mechanism are analyzed before the corresponding models are developed. Coupler systems models are featured by two distinct stabilizing mechanism models and draft gear models with hysteresis considered. A model set which consists of four locomotives and three coupler systems is developed to study the rotational behavior of different coupler systems and their implications for locomotive dynamics. Simulated results indicate that when the locomotives are equipped with the type B coupler system, locomotives can meet the dynamics standard on tangent tracks; while the dynamics performance on curved tracks is very poor. The maximum longitudinal in-train force for locomotives equipped with the type B coupler system is 2000 kN. Simulations revealed a distinct trend for the type A coupler system. Locomotive dynamics are poorer for the type A case when locomotives are running on tangent tracks, while the dynamics are better for the type A case when locomotives are running on curved tracks.

Both rail systems have developed different train designs {{to meet their}} specific haulage needs. The reasons for these differences are examined {{using a combination of}} simulated and measured data. The first part of the investigation is focused on existing train systems. The trains compared are the head end powered COALlink train of 21, 500 gross tonnes and the distributed power Coal and Mainline Freigt train of 7900 gross tonnes. The advantaes of distributed power are explored for the 21, 500 tonne COALlink train using the configuration of two equal wagon rates. The paper also explores by simulation the scope for each system to operate even larger trains, COALlink extending to 32, 300 gross tonnes and Coal and Mainline Freight to 18, 500 tonnes. To enable some method of normalised comparison using simulation the experimental technique of applying the same set of driving rules to each simulation was used. This allowed simulations to be completed over the full length of the haulage system. This technique imediately highlights the differences and similarities of the two systems.

Improvements were {{achieved in the}} development of deterministic white-box draft gear models to enable direct use of the results in product design. Draft gear model parameters such as spring stiffness, wedge angles, and preloads were used as optimisation variables. Two optimisation algorithms were used: Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation. All draft gear designs in the optimisations were constrained by impact tests to ensure the optimised designs also comply with current draft gear acceptance standards. Draft gear performance was assessed using whole-trip Longitudinal Train Dynamics (LTD) simulations and coupler fatigue damage calculations. Each simulation covered about 640 km of track and had about 10 hours of operational time.

40|$|As {{heavy haul}} trains become longer and heavier, the {{resulting}} <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> {{are also being}} increased. However, locomotive dynamics studies are commonly focused on the dynamics of individual locomotives, which means that <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> are not attached to the locomotive or, in other words, external forces due to train configuration are not fully considered.

This {{is very important for}} the analysis of locomotive dynamics given the significant variations in coupler forces when transiting a curve. However, this approach does not fully depict the real situation because it is necessary to also take account of vertical components of coupler forces along with locomotive pitch dynamics in order to correctly analyse the outcomes. One of the techniques to investigate such behaviour in vehicle dynamics studies is to use a cosimulation approach.

The angling behavior of the braking-induced coupler under compressed <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> was analyzed. A dynamic model for the train and draft gear system was developed considering accurate boundary limitations and braking characteristics.

40|$|Heavy haul trains up {{to several}} {{kilometers}} long, as illustrated in Fig. 1, are widely used to transport minerals in South Africa. The cost of train scheduling and human resources can be reduced when long and heavy haul trains are used instead of short trains. Energy consumption, running time, and <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> are the main concerns relating to the control of long heavy haul trains [1]. Braking control is a fundamental issue in heavy haul train operations when <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> and safe operation are considered. As an improvement of the older pneumatic braking systems, electrically controlled pneumatic braking systems developed in the 1990 s provide various benefits, for instance, instantaneous response to the engineer’s commands on all vehicles, graduated release of brakes, and continual replenishment of braking air reservoirs [2].

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{quantity}} of literature available on longitudinal train dynamics and risk assessment but nothing that combines these two topics. This thesis is focused at assessing derailment risks developed due to longitudinal train dynamics. A key focus of this thesis is to identify strategies that can be field implemented to correctly manage these risks. This thesis quantifies derailment risk and allows a datum for comparison. A derailment risk assessment on longitudinal train dynamics was studied for a 107 vehicle train consist travelling along the Monto and North Coast Lines in Queensland, Australia. The train consisted of 103 wagons and 4 locomotives with locomotives positioned in groups of two in lead and mid train positions. The wagons were empty hopper wagons on a track gauge of 1067 mm. The scenarios studied include: the effect of longitudinal impacts on wagon dynamics in transition curves; {{and the effects of}} longitudinal steady forces on wagon dynamics on curves. Simulation software packages VAMPIRE and CRE-LTS were used. The effects of longitudinal impacts from <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> on wagon dynamics in curves were studied using longitudinal train simulation and detailed wagon dynamics simulation. In-train force impacts were produced using a train control action. The resulting worst-case <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> resulting from these simulations were applied to the coupler pin of the wagon dynamics simulation model. The wagon model was used to study the effect of these <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> when applied in curves and transitions at an angle to the wagon longitudinal axis. The effects of different levels of coupler impact forces resulting from different levels of coupling slack were also studied. Maximum values for wheel unloading and L/V ratio for various curve radii and coupler slack conditions were identified. The results demonstrated that the derailment criteria for wheel unloading could be exceeded for a coupler slack of 50 mm and 75 mm on sharper curves, up to 400 m radii. A detailed study of the effect of steady <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> on wagon dynamics on curves also was completed. Steady <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> were applied to a three wagon model using VAMPIRE. Maximum and minimum values of wheel unloading and L/V ratio were identified to demonstrate the level of vehicle stability for each scenario. The results allowed the worse cases of wheel unloading and L/V ratio to be studied in detail. Probability density functions were constructed for the occurrence of longitudinal forces and coupler angles for the Monto and North Coast Lines. Data was simulated for a coupler slack of 25, 50 and 75 mm and force characteristics were further classified into the occurrences of impact and non-impact forces. These probability density functions were analysed for each track section to investigate the effects of coupler slack, track topography and gradient on wagon dynamics. The possible wagon instability in each of these scenarios was then assessed to give a measure of the potential consequences of the event. Risk assessment techniques were used to categorise levels of risk based on the consequences and likelihood of each event. It was found that for the train configuration simulated, the Monto Line has a higher derailment risk than the North Coast Line for many of the scenarios studies in this thesis. For a coupler slack of 25 mm no derailment risks were identified, 50 mm coupler slack derailment risks were only identified on the Monto track and the majority of derailment risks were identified for a 75 mm coupler slack.

The work performed included a significant instrumented wagon based in-train force measurement program, combined with theoretical analysis achieved through computational simulation models. Aurizon’s coal wagons are operated in tandem pairs, each pair having a drawbar connection between the wagons and auto-coupler connections at the outermost ends. A significant change in recent times has been the introduction of short pack draft gears (polymer/elastomer springs without friction wedges) at the drawbar connections.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{closed-loop}} cruise controller to minimise the running {{costs of the}} heavy-haul train is proposed. The running costs of a heavy-haul train are dependent on its travelling time, maintenance costs and energy consumption during the trip. The Coallink train with the new train technologies, Distributed Power (DP) traction and Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brake system, is {{the centre of the}} study. A literature study on existing train control, both passenger and heavy-haul trains, is carried out to build up a knowledge base. Many different techniques for train handling were observed, their features in relation to heavy-haul ECP trains are discussed. From these backgrounds, a comprehensive longitudinal train model is proposed and successfully validated with real-life data from Spoornet. In the model, both static and dynamic <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> are studied, as well as energy consumption. This is possible by modelling each locomotive and wagon as an individual unit. The equations of motion for the train with coupled units and additional non-linearities, such as traction power limits, are considered. An open-loop controller for maintaining equilibrium velocity is designed. During transient velocity changes, a transient controller for calculating the required additional acceleration and deceleration is designed and validated. Because locomotive traction settings are only available in discrete notches, quantisation conversion from force into notches results in input chattering. In addition, during brake to traction transitions, the locomotives receive a sudden traction demand which results in spikes in <b>in-train</b> <b>forces.</b> To avoid these problems, input filtering is performed for these inputs. Closed-loop controllers based on LQR method, optimised for <b>in-train</b> <b>forces,</b> energy consumption and velocity regulation respectively, are designed and compared. To overcome the communication constraints, a fencing concept is introduced whereby the controller is reconfigured adaptively to the current track topology. Different train configurations in terms of availability of additional control channels for both traction and braking are compared, as well as their effects on dynamic and static in-train force. These configurations are unified, distributed and individual traction and brake controls. The results from these different configurations are compared to recorded train data and given in this study. From the results, it is found that the closed-loop controller optimised for in-train force is able to provide the best overall improvement out of the three controllers.

30|$|The in-train {{stability}} {{problems have}} been reported in the area of long freight cars and locomotives. The signal synchronization, <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> and rotational angles of couplers are the main indicators to train derailment accident. A large number of scholars has focused on the theoretical and testing studies of longitudinal train dynamics. In Australia, Cole [3, 4] studied the in-train stability problems of freight cars. It was indicated that the lateral and vertical rotational behavior of coupler occurred during compressed <b>in-train</b> <b>forces,</b> which further arose train derailment accidents. Similar safety issues due to coupler jackknifing behavior had also been reported in Canada [5]. In China, the investigation of derailment accident in Da-Qin heavy haul railway showed that the coupler lateral rotations occurred under compressed forces. The lateral force components lead to a dramatic increase in wheel axle lateral forces which even causes the rail shift and rollover phenomenon [6, 7, 8]. The Association of American Railroads stipulates that the freight car should be able to pass the curve with a radius of 175  m under the buffer force of 890  kN [9]. According to UIC 530 - 2 [10], the allowable coupler force of freight cars is determined on the S-shaped curve with a radius of 150  m. Normally, the longitudinal impacts of EMUs in normal operations are not noticeable. However, according to previous studies, the in-train stability problem for train to train rescue scenarios cannot be neglected. Significant in-train force occurs due to the braking applied by the assisting train. The combination of coupler force and pitch motion leads to a vertical force component, which further causes the destruction to coupler yoke and the interference of in-train equipment. Based on theoretical and dynamic calculations, the coupler length, free rotational angle, braking level, train configuration as well as suspension clearance will affect the longitudinal train dynamic performance [11, 12].|$|E

The accelerometers were also installed on the carbody to measure the braking deceleration. The indirect method for the wheel–rail force measurement was adopted to obtain the wheel unloading ratio [15]. It was indicated that the pitch motion of train and couplers only occurred under compressed coupler forces. Consequently, the pitch motion of the carbody generated a vertical displacement between adjacent carbodies, which further led to geometric interference of in-train devices.|$|E

The ever developing heavy haul transport environment requires further or new understanding of friction draft gear behaviour and its implications for train dynamics as well as fatigue damage of rolling stock. However, modelling of friction draft gears is a highly nonlinear question. Especially the poor predictability, repeatability and the discontinuity of friction make this task more challenging.

40|$|Heavy haul {{trains are}} used to {{transport}} mineral resources from inland mines to harbours in South Africa. It is believed that the cost is less with a larger load per car or per train. This {{has resulted in the}} use of long heavy haul trains. The increase in train length has posed unprecedented technical challenges. For heavy haul trains, energy consumption, running time and <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> between neighbouring cars are of much concern to transportation corporations. The objective of the study is to find optimal driving methodologies for the implementation of a desired speed profile with energy consumption and <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> considered. Firstly, three control strategies are proposed in this study for train handling. In view of the characteristics of traditional pneumatic braking systems and the new Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) braking systems, a simulation study of optimal open loop controllers was undertaken. The result shows that the ECP braking systems demonstrate superb performance compared with pneumatic braking systems, especially together with independent distributed power (iDP) control. Thus, the main focus of the study was the control of heavy haul trains equipped with ECP braking systems. It is shown that there are redundancies in designing an open loop controller. An optimization procedure is applied to schedule cruise control by taking the <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> into initial design consideration. Optimal open loop scheduling presents a better starting point for a closed-loop controller design. A type of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller with state feedback is simulated to verify the above result. However, the closed-loop control law is designed based on full state feedback, which is not practical since not all the states can be measured. An observer could be designed to supplement the LQR controller if partial states are measured. This is, however, not the approach taken in this study. Instead, the application of output regulation of nonlinear systems with measured output feedback to the control of heavy haul trains is considered. This approach to design is practically feasible and manageable, and by its nature, is also easily integrable with human drivers. In this study, the existing result of output regulation of nonlinear systems is extended. The output regulation problem of nonlinear systems with measured output feedback is formulated in this study and solved for the local version and global version. For its application to train control, some application issues are discussed. Based on the proposed theory, a speed regulator for train control is designed. Simulation results show its applicability. Lastly, this study concentrates on the fault-tolerant capacity of the speed regulator. Two kinds of fault modes are considered. Fault detection and isolation for the sensor fault and braking system fault are exploited. Controller redesign is also given. Simulation results show that such a speed regulator has a fault-tolerant capacity to the corresponding faults. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

The train simulator was controlled in two ways, via a time series of power and brake controls and via a fuzzy logic cruise control.

Initial work on longitudinal train dynamics was aimed towards reducing longitudinal oscillations in passenger train. Work done in this context involved measurement and simulation of <b>in-train</b> <b>forces</b> to reduce longitudinal oscillations [3]. The relation between lateral coupler force components and wheel unloading were studied by El-Sibaie [4] and a new method was proposed for evaluating the curving stability of any freight railway car under buff and draw conditions.

Then these interactions were simulated using NUCARS, ADAMS/Rail and a train-wagon interaction model. Cole and Sun [7] evaluated fatigue life of autocoupler systems with and without self-locking features of the draft gear for three types of wagon connection coupling systems.

The neural network model is 'trained' using a combination of measured and simulated data. A new network is required for each wagon position and each train type. Trained networks are stored as matrices of weights in data files and can be quickly loaded for use as required. The networks, when trained, offer a mathematical model {{that can be used to}} take on-board instrumentation a step further. The paper presents early results and details of progress in the developments of both software and in-cabin hardware...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{expansion of}} coal mining in the Central Queensland Region is requiring more rail services to transport coal from the mine to port. Rail services have been expanding {{to meet this}} need with more rail routes, duplication of rail lines, increased number of trains and longer trains. When the length of trains are increased {{there is a need}} to review that these longer trains can be driven satisfactorily on the current rail lines. The driving strategies of longer trains need to consider the increased mass and length of the trains to ensure the coupling forces within the trains are within reasonable levels. Driving strategies have to consider multiple parameters such as operating the train safely, efficiently in terms of energy, in a timely manner and with minimal wear and damage to coupling components. This paper presents the use of computer based methods to determine optimal driving strategies for long trains. A number of computer based methods already exist but tend to be based around energy efficiency methods. Energy efficiency methods fail to completely consider the longitudinal coupling forces that are generated within the train. Research at the Centre for Railway Engineering, CQUniversity is gradually investigating the use of a computer based searching method based on ‘Genetic Algorithms’ to determine optimal driving strategies for long trains considering energy, time and longitudinal forces. Initial results have shown energy optimisation is possible by using Genetic Algorithms and a similar method is being developed to optimise for both energy and <b>in-train</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the passive}} and active {{steering}} developments of traction bogies have been directed towards {{high speed rail}} or light rail and commuter rail applications. Previous studies ignored coupler forces and often assumed the wheel rail profiles have ample conicity for the curving task. There is little work directed towards high adhesion rates which is a critical area for freight locomotive performance. In heavy haul train operations ruling grades are often associated with tight curvatures, and steering tasks of hauling locomotives are affected by lateral components of longitudinal train forces. Haul locomotives also have a significant yaw moment from coupler forces making uneven longitudinal creeps useful in balancing these yaw forces. The use of larger diameter wheels on locomotives reduces effective steering conicity such that contact profiles may become insufficient to negotiate tight curves. The large diameter wheels make longitudinal creepage or slip inevitable and Goodall et al. [1] definition of perfect steering unattainable. A new criteria for ideal steering in these conditions is proposed. For hauling locomotives, ideal steering is defined as when the lateral rail creep and contact loads of each axle in one bogie are equal and longitudinal creeps are positive to the applied traction. This definition is applicable to all curving tasks that a hauling locomotive encounters whilst still applying low wheel rail creep forces. In {{most of the cases}} ideal steering can be achieved with zero lateral creep forces. The paper describes equations for quasi-static curving forces including traction and <b>in-train</b> <b>forces.</b> An analysis of curving forces for locomotives with three axle bogies is made with the equations for various curvatures and with haulage locomotives in different train configurations including pusher configuration...|$|E
