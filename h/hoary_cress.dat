50|$|Lepidium draba (whitetop or <b>hoary</b> <b>cress)</b> is a rhizomatous {{perennial}} {{flowering plant}} in the cabbage family Brassicaceae. It is native to western Asia and southeastern Europe and widely introduced elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} a wildlflower meadow, coppiced woodland, {{grassland}} and a pond. Flowers {{in the meadow}} include <b>hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> charlock and ox-eye daisy, {{and there are many}} species of butterflies. The woodland has birds such as dunnock and song thrushes.|$|E
50|$|It is {{native to}} western Asia and southeastern Europe and is an {{invasive}} species in North America, introduced by contaminated seeds in the early 1900s. Also known as Cardaria draba, <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> is a weed in much of south-east and south-west Australia as well.|$|E
5000|$|Other common {{or country}} names include lamb's <b>cress,</b> land <b>cress,</b> <b>hoary</b> bitter <b>cress,</b> spring cress, flick weed, and shot weed (or lambscress, landcress, hoary bittercress, springcress, flickweed, and shotweed). Some of these common names may {{be shared with}} other plants in the Brassicaceae family and are {{therefore}} of limited usefulness since they may be shared. As Old English stune, the plant is cited {{as one of the}} herbs invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th century.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine {{allelopathic}} effect of parsley (Petroselinum crispum Mill.) on germination and growth parameters of weed species <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (Lepidium draba (L.) Desv.). Cogermination of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> with parsley seeds, water extracts from fresh and dry parsley biomass in concentrations of 5 and 10 % (50 and 100 g per litre of distilled water) were evaluated in Petri dishes. Effect of water extracts from fresh parsley biomass in aforementioned concentrations as well as effects of fresh and dry parsley residues in two rates (10 and 20 g/kg of soil) were examined in pots with soil. Cogermination of seeds stimulated root length, but decreased shoot length and fresh weight of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> seedlings. In the Petri dish assay, extracts from fresh and dry parsley biomass reduced germination of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> but had both stimulatory as well as inhibitory effect on other parameters. The highest concentration of dry biomass extract completely reduced germination rate of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (by 100 %). In the pot experiment, extracts from fresh parsley biomass had stimulatory effect on weed growth parameters except for root length which was inhibited with higher concentration by 4. 2 %. Fresh parsley residues reduced germination, root and shoot length of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> while dry parsley residues promoted measured parameters, with the exception of root length...|$|E
40|$|In Europe, Ceutorhynchus turbatus Schultze and Ceutorhynchus typhae (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) feed on {{seeds from}} <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> and shepherd's purse (Cardaria draba (L.) Desv. and Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.); both plants are {{invasive}} in North America. In North America, C. turbatus {{is a candidate}} for biological control of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> C. typhae is adventive, and both are sympatric with cabbage seedpod weevil (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham)), an invasive alien pest of canola (Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L., Brassicaceae). We investigated host associations among C. turbatus, C. typhae, and their parasitoids in Europe. Of particular interest was host specificity of Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) and Mesopolobus morys (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), candidates for biological control of C. obstrictus in North America. We found no evidence that T. perfectus attacks C. turbatus or C. typhae; however, M. morys was the most common parasitoid associated with C. turbatu...|$|E
40|$|Different cruciferous weeds were {{drilled in}} autumn 2011 and 2012 {{in a field}} near Münster. Beside common species like hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale Scop.), shepherd`s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), pennycress (Thlaspiarvense), tall hedge mustard (Sisymbrium loeselii) and {{flixweed}} (Descurainia sophia), we tried to establish weeds that are not common on arable land in Germany until now. These were: Yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris), <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (Lepidium draba) and Turkish rocket (Bunias orientalis). In autumn 2011 emergence of the sown weeds was poor. In {{the second year of}} experiment we got good emergence of the named weeds excluding <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (Lepidium draba). In autumn 2011 and 2012 different herbicidecombinations were applied across the stripes. The best results were achieved with Colzor Trio (clomazone + dimethachlor + napropamid) which was applied in pre-emergence state, a spray sequence Butisan Gold (metazachlor + quinmerac + dimethenamid-P) applied in pre-emergence followed by Salsa (ethametsulfuronmethyl) + Trend (adjuvant) in post-emergence and Clearfield-Vantiga (metazachlor + quinmerac + imazamox) + Dash (adjuvant), also applied in post-emergence state of the weeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to quantify the density and abundance of weeds in wheat fields of South Khorasan province during 2010 and 56 species of weed form 16 plant families were identified in 240 farms of eight towns around this province. The most families in number of species were pertaining to Poaceae, Asteraceae and Chenopodiaceae with 15 (26. 79 %), nine (16. 7 %), six (10. 71 %) and six (10. 71 %) species, respectively. The most frequencies were related to yarrow (Achilla biberstinii L.) by 37. 38 % from the Asteraceae family, <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (Cardaria draba L. (form Bressicaseae family by 28. 3 % and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) from Chenopodiaseae family by 37. 47 %. <b>Hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> common lambs quarters, bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon L.), camelthorn and prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare L.) were allocated the highest average density of the weeds with 1. 38, 1. 31, 1. 29, 1. 27 and 1. 04 plant. m- 2, respectively. The most abundant of weeds were camelthorn, common lambsquarters and yarrow.

40|$|Of two {{natural product}} phytotoxins, maculosins- 1 and- 2, {{produced}} by Alternaria alternata on spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), only maculosin- 2 appeared active against intact knapweed plants. Furthermore, unlike host specific maculosin- 1, macu-losin- 2 exhibited phytotoxicity {{to a wide}} range of weedy plants including Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), hound’s tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens), rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), broad-leaved plantain (Plantago major), lamb’s-quarters (Chenopodium album), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), whitetop or <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (Cardaria draba), common mallow (Malva neglec-ta), sulfur (erect) cinquefoil (Potentilla recta), and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). As such, maculosin- 2 and its synthetic analogs are good candidates for development as tar-get specific post-emergence herbicides. One measure of herbicidal activity is detection in the etiolated wheat coleoptile (Triticum aestivum L. cv Wakeland) bioassay. In common with greenhouse tests on whole knapweed plants, maculosin- 1 (cyclo-TyrPro) and pyric...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Cucumber mosaic virus {{naturally}} infecting <b>hoary</b> <b>cress</b> (Lepidium draba) in Shiraz, Iran (designated CMV-Ld), induces vein clearing and mosaic on {{the leaves of}} naturally infected plants. Datura metel, D. stra-monium, Lens culinaris, Lycopersicon esculentum, Nico-tiana rustica and N. tabacum “Turkish ” showed line pat-tern after mechanical inoculation with the virus. These symptoms were different from those induced by a cu-cumber strain of CMV (CMV-Cu). CMV-Ld was sero-logically similar to the cucumber strain in gel immunod-iffusion tests using homologous and heterologous antis-era. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified virus preparation yielded a protein band with molecular weight of 25 kDa. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the coat protein (CP) gene showed that CMV-Ld, CMV-Cu and other CMV strains could be assigned to subgroups {{on the basis of}} EcoRI restriction site. The full length sequences of the CP gene of both strains showed that CMV-Ld and CMV-Cu belong to subgroups II and IA, respectively. Key words: Lepidium draba, CMV subgroups, CM...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{biocontrol}} {{by using}} Eriophid mites {{could be a}} safe and efficient strategy. In order to find an ecological non-chemical approach for controlling of weeds, and studying {{the possibility of using}} Eriophyid mites, field surveys were conducted in Razavi Khorasan and North Khorasan Provinces during spring 2010. Collecting of mites was carried out at all of the vegetative and reproductive stages of these target weeds. Twenty plants of each species were selected and transferred to laboratory after each sampling. The results showed that gall mite (Aceria drabae Nalepa 1890) (Acarina: Eriophyidae) is a suitable biocontrol agent for controlling <b>hoary</b> <b>cress.</b> It decreased shoot growth and seed number. Gall mite (Aceria chondrillae (G. Can.)) (Acarina: Eriophyidae) was able to prevent seed set and reproductive buds of rush skeletonweed, it could be considered as a potential promising biocontrol agent. Since, Eriophyid mites were able to reduce vegetative and reproductive characteristics of studied weed species, these could be considered as a potential promising biological control agents for using in ecological agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Four {{species of}} Mesopolobus Westwood were reared as parasitoids of Ceutorhynchinae hosts in Europe during surveys in 2000 - 2004. An {{illustrated}} key {{is given to}} differentiate the four species, M. gemellus Baur & Muller sp. n., M. incultus (Walker), M. morys (Walker) and M. trasullus (Walker), plus M. moryoides Gibson, a parasitoid of the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham), in North America. Pteromalus clavicornis Walker is recognized as a junior synonym of M. incultus syn. n., and Pteromalus berecynthos Walker (also a junior synonym of M. incultus) is considered a correct original spelling. For Disema pallipes Förster (a junior synonym of Mesopolobus morys), a lectotype is designated. Mesopolobus morys is {{for the first time}} accurately associated with the seed weevil Ceutorhynchus turbatus (Schultze), a potential agent for classical biological control, of <b>hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaceae), in North America. Mesopolobus gemellus is associated with another seed weevil, Ceutorhynchus typhae (=C. floralis) (Herbst), in pods of shepherd's purse, Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik. (Brassicaceae). Implications of the host-parasitoid associations are discussed relative to the introduction of species to North America for classical biological control of the cabbage seedpod weevi...|$|E
40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, <b>hoary</b> <b>cress,</b> the knapweeds, biennial thistles (musk, plumeless, bull and scotch), the toadflaxes, field bindweed, absinth wormwood and common mullein. All of these and others are on South Dakota’s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the vervains, common sunflower, horseweed or marestail, golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|E
