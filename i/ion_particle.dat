5000|$|Highly charged ions (HCI) are ions in {{very high}} charge states {{due to the}} loss of many or most of their bound {{electrons}} by energetic collisions or high-energy photon absorption.

40|$|A {{measurement}} {{campaign was}} conducted from 3 to 19 December 2012 at an urban site of Brisbane, Australia. Size distribution of <b>ions</b> and <b>particle</b> number concentrations were measured {{to investigate the}} influence of particle formation and biomass burning on atmospheric <b>ion</b> and <b>particle</b> concentrations. Overall <b>ion</b> and <b>particle</b> number concentrations during the measurement period {{were found to be}} (- 1. 2 x 103 cm- 3 | + 1. 6 x 103 cm- 3) and 4. 4 x 103, respectively. The results of correlation analysis between concentrations of ions and nitrogen oxides indicated that positive and negative ions originated from similar sources, and that vehicle exhaust emissions had a more significant influence on intermediate/large ions, while cluster ions rapidly attached to larger particles once emitted into the atmosphere. Diurnal variations in ion concentration suggested the enrichment of intermediate and large <b>ions</b> on new <b>particle</b> formation event days, indicating that they were involved in the particle formation processes. Elevated total ions, particularly larger <b>ions,</b> and <b>particle</b> number concentrations were found during biomass burning episodes.

40|$|Irradiation of Arabidopsis thaliana by carbon ions {{was carried}} out to {{investigate}} the mutational effect of <b>ion</b> <b>particles</b> in higher plants. Frequencies of embryonic lethals and chlorophyll-deficient mutants {{were found to be}} significantly higher after carbon-ion irradiation than after electron irradiation (11 -fold and 7. 8 -fold per unit dose, respectively). To estimate the mutation rate of carbon ions, mutants with no pigments on leaves and stems (tt) and no trichomes on leaves (gl) were isolated at the M 2 generation and subjected to analysis. Averaged segregation rate of the backcrossed mutants was 0. 25, which suggested that large deletions reducing the viability of the gametophytes were not transmitted, if generated, in most cases. During the isolation of mutants, two new classes of flavonoid mutants (tt 18, tt 19) were isolated from carbon-ion-mutagenized M 2 plants. From PCR and sequence analysis, two of the three tt 18 mutant alleles were found to have a small deletion within the LDOX gene and the other was revealed to contain a rearrangement. Using the segregation rates, the mutation rate of carbon ions was estimated to be 17 -fold higher than that of electrons.

Up/down electron temperature asymmetries due to recycling are weak for attached plasmas because the magnetic connection length is shorter than for comparable single-null plasmas.

40|$|In this work, we {{evaluated}} the differential effects of low- and high-LET radiation on 3 -D organotypic cultures {{in order to}} investigate radiation quality impacts on gene expression and cellular responses. Current risk models for assessment of space radiation-induced cancer have large uncertainties because the models for adverse health effects following radiation exposure are founded on epidemiological analyses of human populations exposed to low-LET radiation. Reducing these uncertainties requires new knowledge on the fundamental differences in biological responses (the so-called radiation quality effects) triggered by heavy <b>ion</b> <b>particle</b> radiation versus low-LET radiation associated with Earth-based exposures. In order to better quantify these radiation quality effects in biological systems, we are utilizing novel 3 -D organotypic human tissue models for space radiation research. These models hold promise for risk assessment as they provide a format for study of human cells within a realistic tissue framework, thereby bridging the gap between 2 -D monolayer culture and animal models for risk extrapolation to humans. To identify biological pathway signatures unique to heavy <b>ion</b> <b>particle</b> exposure, functional gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used with whole transcriptome profiling. GSEA has been used extensively as a method to garner biological information {{in a variety of}} model systems but has not been commonly used to analyze radiation effects.

40|$|The average {{human body}} {{contains}} {{tens of thousands}} of miles of vessels that permeate every tissue down to the microscopic level. This makes the human vasculature a prime target for an agent like radiation that originates from a source and passes through the body. Exposure to radiation released during nuclear accidents and explosions, or during cancer radiotherapy, is well known to cause vascular pathologies because of the ionizing effects of electromagnetic radiations (photons) such as gamma rays. There is however, another type of less well-known radiation – charged <b>ion</b> <b>particles,</b> and these atoms stripped of electrons, have different physical properties to the photons of electromagnetic radiation. They are either found in space or created on earth by particle collider facilities, and are of significant recent interest due to their enhanced effectiveness and increasing use in cancer radiotherapy, as well as a health risk to the growing number of people spending time in the space environment.
