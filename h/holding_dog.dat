500|$|While the barnstorming {{tour was}} under way, Ruppert began {{negotiating}} with Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. The Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing {{fourth in the}} National League in both 1933 and 1934, but the team drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at Braves Field, Fuchs had considered <b>holding</b> <b>dog</b> races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated {{that he would not}} release Ruth to go to another team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper Bill McKechnie. In a long letter to Ruth {{a few days before the}} press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal [...] "the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had".|$|E

He and Scooby go down {{to see the results}} of the auditions. Without them knowing, it is a trick to get Scooby back on the show once again. C.J. hires a dog with no talent to take Scooby's role, leaving Scooby and Shaggy in shock. Later, Shaggy shows C.J. a new film, Scooby and Cherie where Scooby is a magician and Cherie, his assistant. The next film is The Love Ship where Captain Scooby forgets to untie the rope from the piers, taking all the people on it with the cruise. To confirm his new career, Scooby is {{featured}} on The Jackie Carson show, saying he's leaving his cartoon series, upsetting his fans.|$|E

40|$|Greyhound racing using a {{mechanical}} hare {{arrived from the}} United States in 1926. It was first commercially introduced at Belle Vue Stadium in Manchester and then spread to Liverpool and London. By the mid 1930 s it had become Britain’s third biggest commercial leisure activity, only exceeded by the cinema and by association football. The bulk of spectators came from the working classes. Middle-class interest in the sport has however been less noticed. The middle classes attended as spectators and betters at the leading, more elite courses, especially in London. Furthermore, they {{played a key role}} in terms of share ownership, organization, office <b>holding,</b> <b>dog</b> ownership, and training. While men were in the vanguard, there was evidence of interest from some middle- and upper-class women as well. So in wider debates in Parliament, local authorities, the press and elsewhere, the middle classes proved to be split in their attitudes, and as such the study is revealing in terms of British class, culture, and respectability between the wars...|$|E
40|$|Stowaway {{transport}} {{rates were}} obtained from behavioral observations of 14 house mice (Mus domesticus) and 14 deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus) during commercial transport. One house mouse escaped during unloading and flaking of 2, 500 kg 2 -year old oat hay. Three house mice and two deermice were hand-caught on trucks during unloading of 51, 110 kg transported barley straw and grass hay. One house mouse was hand-caught after being buried alive in grain. Two house mice escaped during unloading of a semitruck <b>holding</b> <b>dog</b> food. House mice (one live, six recently-dead) and deermice (two recently-dead) were taken from a feedmill screen over which had passed 940, 313 kg grain. Ten deermice were trapped in a pickup truck cab. In conclusion, multiplying these transport rates, (7 (102 ̆ 2 s) house mice per transported kg hay and 7 (1 O 6) house mice per transported kg grain, by the worldwide volume of transported hay and grain implies thousands of stowaway house mice occur. Deermice have comparable transport rates. Experiments (N= 82) were done {{to determine if a}} particular sex or age predominates among stowaways. For each experiment, I put one to five hand-caught or trapped house mice in a haybale, let them remain in the haybale for 1 to 13 days, put the haybale in a wheelbarrow, pushed the wheelbarrow for 15 minutes, and then searched for transported mice. Stowaways, mice remaining during transport, included 74 of 115 mice (64...|$|E

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite, {{which is}} the cause of toxoplasmosis and can infect a wide variety of warm-blooded animals, including dogs and humans. The present study evaluated the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in pet dogs in Ahvaz, southwest city of Iran, and investigated the related possible risk factors. A total of 180 serum samples were collected from dogs referred to Veterinary Hospital of Ahvaz. The samples were then tested by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The prevalence of T. gondii antibodies were 46. 67 %. Logistic regression and chi square tests were used for evaluating of risk factors. The positivity increased statistically significantly with dogâs gender (56 % females and 39 % males, PÂ =Â  0. 001), age (18 % in < 2 Â years old, 96 % in â¥ 4 Â years old, PÂ =Â  0. 001) and place of living (47 % outdoor dogs 38 % house <b>hold</b> <b>dogs,</b> PÂ =Â  0. 025). However, no statistically significant association was found with dogsâ breed, deworming, food ingestion or contact with cats. Overall, the results showed a relatively high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in dogs in southwest Iran (Ahvaz) and proved association of T. gondii prevalence rates with the dogâs age, gender and place of living.
