5|$|<b>Electricity</b> {{generators}} {{will not}} receive allocations, however a firm may receive allocation for <b>electricity</b> use if it conducts an 'emissions intensive' and 'trade exposed' activity (EITE).|$|E
5|$|<b>Electricity</b> is {{distributed}} by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking in the island city, and by Reliance Energy, Tata Power, and the Maharashtra State <b>Electricity</b> Distribution Co. Ltd (Mahavitaran) in the suburbs. Consumption of <b>electricity</b> is growing faster than production capacity. Power supply cables are underground, which reduces pilferage, thefts and other losses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electricity</b> {{supply to}} Mannargudi is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Tamil Nadu <b>Electricity</b> Board (TNEB). The town and its suburbs forms the Trichy <b>Electricity</b> Distribution Circle.|$|E
5|$|For {{merchant}} {{solar power}} stations, where the <b>electricity</b> is being sold into the <b>electricity</b> transmission network, the levelised cost of solar energy {{will need to}} match the wholesale <b>electricity</b> price. This point is sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, solar <b>electricity</b> was not cost {{competitive}} with bulk, baseload power. However, it does provide <b>electricity</b> {{when and where}} power is most limited and most expensive, which is a strategic contribution. Solar <b>electricity</b> mitigates the risk of fuel-price volatility and improves grid reliability. Since then costs have decreased to make solar <b>electricity</b> increasingly competitive.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{amounts of}} Scotland's <b>electricity</b> are {{generated}} through solar power and wind power, a sizable proportion of Scotland's <b>electricity</b> is generated that way.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess <b>electricity.</b> With grid-tied systems, excess <b>electricity</b> {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid <b>electricity</b> can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any <b>electricity</b> they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more <b>electricity</b> than it consumes. If the net <b>electricity</b> use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure <b>electricity</b> consumed vs. <b>electricity</b> produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991 Somalia has {{lacked a}} {{functioning}} central <b>electricity</b> grid, but private entrepreneurs have offered <b>electricity</b> generation on a localised basis, typically offering {{a choice of}} daytime, evening or 24-hour <b>electricity.</b> Gaalkacyo, a desert town in central Somalia, was provided with streetlights by local entrepreneur Abdirizak Osman, who expanded his enterprises from telecommunications to power generators, not only lighting the town but also supplying free <b>electricity</b> to the local hospital.|$|E

5|$|<b>Electricity</b> is used within telecommunications, {{and indeed}} the {{electrical}} telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, <b>electricity</b> had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken {{a share of the}} market for communications systems, but <b>electricity</b> can be expected to remain {{an essential part of the}} process.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{concerns}} with <b>electricity</b> generation {{have led to}} an increased focus on generation from renewable sources, in particular from wind and hydropower. While debate {{can be expected to}} continue over the environmental impact of different means of <b>electricity</b> production, its final form is relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|Feed-in tariffs are {{designated}} prices {{which must be}} paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable <b>electricity</b> produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid. These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale <b>electricity</b> prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project.|$|E

5|$|Following deregulation, the {{consumer}} has {{a choice of}} energy supplier. <b>Electricity</b> is provided by CE Electric UK, trading as NEDL. Natural gas was (and still is) supplied by British Gas. Distribution and, as with <b>electricity,</b> transmission, {{is the responsibility of}} the National Grid, having been demerged as Transco in 1997. These industries are regulated by OFGEM.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{distributed}} {{copies of}} the electrostatic machine to many of his close associates {{to encourage them to}} study <b>electricity.</b> Between 1747 and 1750, Franklin sent many letters to his friend Collinson in London about his experiments with the electrostatic machine and the Leyden jar, including his observations and theories on the principles of <b>electricity.</b> These letters were collected and published in 1751 in a book entitled Experiments and Observations on <b>Electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to <b>electricity</b> generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total <b>electricity</b> and 70% of all renewable <b>electricity</b> and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic <b>electricity</b> use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable <b>electricity.</b> The average cost of <b>electricity</b> from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use <b>electricity</b> to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of <b>electricity.</b> The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating <b>electricity.</b> The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{a public}} company was formed to provide an <b>electricity</b> supply for Cullompton which merged with the Bradninch <b>Electricity</b> Company in 1927 to form the Culm Valley <b>Electricity</b> Supply Co. Ltd. A {{gasworks}} {{was set up in}} Cullompton in 1865 for the Cullompton Gas Light and Coke Co. This was taken over by the Devon Gas Association and nationalised in 1949. The gasworks was closed in 1956 and Cullompton was then supplied from Exeter.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 {{households}} {{were connected}} to <b>electricity</b> through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, <b>electricity</b> came from private generators. Today, {{the majority of the}} inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, 70% of {{oil shale}} mined in Estonia {{was used for}} power generation, and about 85% of Estonia's <b>electricity</b> was {{generated}} from oil shale. About 29% of produced <b>electricity</b> was exported to Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, over 40 {{per cent}} of Scotland's <b>electricity</b> came from {{renewable}} energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40 per {{cent of the}} UK's renewables output. At the end of 2012, there was 5,801 megawatts (MW) of installed renewables <b>electricity</b> capacity in Scotland, an increase of 20.95 per cent (1,005 MW) {{on the end of}} 2011. Renewable <b>electricity</b> generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3 per cent on 2011, the previous record year for renewables output. The bulk of <b>electricity</b> production is derived from gas and oil. 2002 figures used in RSPB Scotland et al. (2006) are gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and nuclear (17%), with renewables 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output. It should be borne in mind that <b>electricity</b> production {{is only part of the}} overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of <b>electricity</b> by end users, the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).|$|E
