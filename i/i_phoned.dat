500|$|In July 1991, Creation {{agreed to}} {{relocate}} the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records {{was unable to}} pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, [...] "I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out." [...] Shields' unexpected and random behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect both on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later admitted being desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown around this time. Green later recalled, [...] "It was two years into the album, and <b>I</b> <b>phoned</b> Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'." [...] During this time, both Shields and Butcher became affected with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for a further number of weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows. Shields dismissed these concerns as [...] "Ill-informed hysteria." [...] Although Alan McGee was still upbeat and positive about his investment, the 29-year-old Green, who by this time was opening the label's morning post [...] "shaking with fear," [...] became a concern to his co-workers. Publicist Laurence Verfaillie, aware of the label's inability to cover further studio bills, recalled Green's hair turning grey overnight. [...] "He would have not gone grey if it was not for that album," [...] Verfaillie said.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} describes two key ways {{in which}} a new product may encroach on an existing market. In high-end encroachment, the new product first sells to high-end customers and then diffuses down-market; in low-end encroachment, the new product enters {{at the low end}} and encroaches up-market. This paper focuses on high-end encroachment, which can further be broken down into three subtypes, which are called the immediate, the new-attribute, and the new-market forms of high-end encroachment. This paper makes three key contributions. First, it provides a sound theoretical underpinning for the three distinct subtypes of high-end encroachment-a linear reservation price curve model (LRPCM) is used to establish this theoretical foundation. Second, this paper delineates and illustrates four different ways the high-end new-market diffusion process may progress over time. These four are: (1) the traditional type, where the new product diffuses relatively slowly and methodically over time; (2) the fad scenario, where the new product opens a new market but then fizzles out after {{a relatively short period of}} high sales; (3) the rapid diffusion outcome, where the new product opens a new market and then rapidly diffuses down-market; and (4) the prolonged-niche type, where the new product purposefully restricts itself to its own niche rather than diffusing down-market. The third key contribution of this paper is to offer managerial insights into the new-market high-end encroachment process by discussing two short case studies; namely, a retrospective look at the introduction of the <b>i</b> <b>Phone,</b> and a prospective look at Tesla's challenges in growing the market for its electric car. With regard to the <b>i</b> <b>Phone,</b> it helps explain why Apple precipitously dropped the price of the <b>i</b> <b>Phone</b> by one third only 68 days after its introduction. With regard to Tesla, it discusses how Tesla must leverage the revenues that stem from its current high-end pricing power. Tesla must be able to progress down the learning curve fast enough so that it can create a virtuous cycle; a cycle in which cost reductions and technology improvements lead to price reductions and increased sales, which in turn lead to further cost reductions. At the conclusion of the paper, a step-by-step approach is offered to aid in determining which type of encroachment should be pursued and in determining how the encroachment pattern will eventually develop. The encroachment framework and the step-by-step approach are intended to help managers better assess and mitigate the risks inherent with a new product introduction...|$|R
