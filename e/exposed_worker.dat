Nondestructive sample cleanup and multidimensional gas chromatography-electron capture detection (MDGC-ECD) techniques were applied. Special attention was given to the toxicologically relevant congeners CB- 77, CB- 126, CB- 169, CB- 105, CB- 114, CB- 118, CB- 156, CB- 167, and CB- 189 (IUPAC). Lipid-based tissue contents of sigma CBs were higher in the occupationally/accidentally <b>exposed</b> <b>worker</b> (adipose = 7, 000 ng/g; whole blood = 11 ng/g) than in the general population (adipose = 300 ng/g; whole blood = 1. 9 ng/g). Among the non-ortho Cl CBs, CB- 77 was below detection limit (< 1. 0 pg/g). The contents of CB- 126 for the capacitor manufacture worker were 2, 000 and 3 pg/g, and in the general population were 100 and 2 pg/g for adipose and whole blood, respectively. The corresponding data for CB- 169 were 3, 500 and 4 for adipose and whole blood, respectively, in the <b>exposed</b> <b>worker,</b> and 40 and 2 for adipose and whole blood, respectively, in the general population. Congeners with highest contents were CB- 153, CB- 138, CB- 180, CB- 170, and CB- 187. These congeners possess chlorine substitution patterns, making them resistant to metabolism.

The concentration of Cr in urine (U-Cr), serum total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), high sensitive C reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and peripheral white blood cells count (WBC) were measured. The {{results show that the}} U-Cr, serum tPSA, Hs-CRP and WBC were significantly higher in Cr <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> when compared to the controls. Contrastively, the serum fPSA level in Cr <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> was lower than controls. A significant positive correlation between U-Cr and serum tPSA was observed. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that serum tPSA and fPSA level was statistically associated with the serum Hs-CRP and U-Cr concentration in Cr <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> These observations suggested that chronic Cr exposure could produce potential prostate injury and the nonspecific inflammation at least might be one of the reasons to explain the elevated concentration of tPSA in chronic occupational chromate <b>exposed</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Current {{evidence}} {{related to}} the carcinogenic potential of ethylene- oxide (75218) (EtO) is presented. Major uses of EtO are in the chemical industry and as a sterilant and fumigant. In its 1977 Special Occupational Hazard Review on EtO, NIOSH recommended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 8 hour time weighted average exposure level of 50 parts per million (ppm) be observed, and that occupational exposure be limited to a ceiling concentration of 75 ppm. Studies in Fischer- 344 -rats exposed by inhalation to 10, 33, or 100 ppm EtO for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for about 2 years showed dose related excesses of mononuclear cell leukemia in females and peritoneal mesothelioma in males, {{both of which were}} significantly increased. Preliminary evidence of dose dependent injection site sarcomas after chronic subcutaneous injection of EtO were obtained in NMRI-mice. In-vitro microbial and animal test systems showed mutagenicity and alkylating activity of EtO, and mutagenic and adverse reproductive effects and chromosomal abnormalities were found in experimental animals. Epidemiologic studies of <b>exposed</b> <b>worker</b> populations demonstrated possible carcinogenic activity, with increases in overall death rates, all cancers, leukemia, stomach cancer, and circulatory system mortality. Exposures were generally below current standards, although occasional excursions to higher levels were possible. Chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in peripheral lymphocytes were increased in one <b>exposed</b> <b>worker</b> population studied. It is recommended that ethylene-oxide be considered a potential occupational carcinogen and that the OSHA standard be reexamined.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} associations between dust exposure and adverse chronic respiratory health effects, but {{there are only a}} few follow-up studies among cement workers. None of the previous {{studies have reported}} on the possible health effects following improvement of dust control measures in the cement factory. Airway inflammation has recently been reported as a possible underlying mechanism of dust-related respiratory health effects. Only one study has examined FENO as a possible non-invasive marker of inflammation among cement workers. Objectives: We aimed at assessing changes in personal total dust exposure levels, chronic respiratory symptom, lung function and COPD among Tanzanian cement production workers, following improvement of dust control measures. In addition, we aimed at exploring possible associations between total dust exposure and FENO. Method: This thesis consists of four papers. In Paper I, we compared summarized group data for total dust exposure reported in 2002 with data collected in 2010 – 11 in the same cement factory (before vs after improvement) (n: 79 vs. 179 dust samples). Similarly, summarized group data for chronic respiratory symptoms, FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC ratio, COPD and % predicted values for FEV 1 and FVC obtained in 2002 were compared with analogous data in 2010, among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and controls (n: 120 vs. 171, and 107 vs. 98, respectively). In Paper II, a one-year follow-up on chronic respiratory symptoms was conducted among the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and controls from 2010 to 2011. Paper III compared FENO levels between <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and controls (n: 127 vs 28). The FENO levels in Paper III were also compared between the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> with high (GM ≥ 5 mg/m³) and low total dust exposure (GM < 5 mg/m³), and between the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> in the first and second stage of cement production (n: 64 vs. 64, and 65 vs. 62, respectively). Paper IV examined possible cross-shift changes in FENO for three consecutive days among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and for two consecutive days among controls (n: 55 vs. 31). Associations between individually measured total dust exposure levels and the crossshift change in FENO were also evaluated. Results: In Paper I, total dust exposure among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> was reduced in 2010 – 11 compared to 2002, GM: 5. 8 mg/m³ vs. 10. 6 mg/m³. Similarly, the proportion of total dust exposure exceeding the threshold limit value of 10 mg/m³ was lower in 2010 – 11 and 2002, 31 %, vs. 58 %. The <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> had higher symptom prevalence and impaired lung function compared to controls in 2002, whereas no such differences were observed in 2010. Among the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers,</b> the prevalence of chronic cough, chronic sputum production, chronic bronchitis and COPD was lower in 2010 compared to 2002. The <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> in 2010 had higher FEV 1, FEV 1 % and FVC% than the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> in 2002. In Paper II, the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> had higher chronic respiratory symptom prevalence and overall symptoms score at baseline (2010) compared to controls, but these differences were not significant. One year later in 2011, there was significantly lower prevalence of cough, cough with sputum, dyspnoea and wheezing among the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> compared to controls. In Paper III, there were similar FENO levels among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and controls (GM; 16 ppb for each group), among the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> with high total and low total dust exposure (GM: 17 ppb and 16 ppb, respectively), and among workers in the first and second stage of cement production (GM: 17 ppb vs. 16 ppb, respectively). In Paper IV, we observed a statistically significant cross-shift decrease in FENO on each of the three days of examination among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers,</b> but not for the two days among controls. The cross-shift decrease in FENO among the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> was not correlated with personal total dust exposure levels, correlation coefficient; - 0. 175, and 95 % confidence interval:- 0. 36 to 0. 04. Conclusions: We found a reduction in personal total dust exposure, prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms and COPD among Tanzanian cement production workers, after improvement of dust control measures, from 2002 to 2010. After one year from 2010, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms among Tanzanian cement production workers. There was no significant difference in FENO between <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and controls. However, there was a significant cross-shift decrease in FENO among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> The reason for this decrease is unknown. </p...|$|R

Methods Based on the Guangzhou Occupational Health Surveillance Record System established in 1989 - 1992, 80 987 factory workers, aged≥ 30, occupationally exposed to dust and non-exposure to dust, {{were included in}} a prospective cohort study. Results (1) The {{mean age of the}} cohort was 43. 5. Most subjects were workers, with secondary education, and married. Out of them 16. 3 % having ever exposed to dust, 43. 7 % ever smoked and 33. 5 % drank-alcohol. (2) The cohort were traced for 8 years on average, but 35 were lost for follow-up. Malignant neoplasm was most commonly seen among 1539 deaths. (3) The adjusted relative risk (RRs) of death of all causes, malignant neoplasm and cerebro-cardiovascular diseases for dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> were close to those for smokers. However, the adjusted RRs of death of nasopharynx cancer and respiratory system diseases for dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> were higher than those for smokers. The adjusted RRs of death of lung cancer and stomach cancer for smokers were 2. 2 times and 1. 5 times of that for dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> respectively. Dust exposure combined with smoking caused significantly higher death RR. (4) In males, the adjusted RRs of death of all causes, malignant neoplasm and respiratory system diseases for silica dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and the adjusted RR of death of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases for wood dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> were higher those in smokers. (5) The population attributable risk percentage (PARP) of all causes of death for smokers was 2. 5 times of that for dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> (6) In males, the risks of death for all causes, malignant neoplasm, lung cancer and stomach cancer increased with the amount of smoking per day and the duration of smoking. The risks of death caused by coronary heart disease and respiratory system diseases were increasing with the amount of smoking per day and the duration of smoking respectively. Conclusions The adjusted RRs for dust <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> were close to those for smokers with dust exposure and smoking having synergistic effects.

Furthermore, the relation between exposure and these biomarkers of response was examined using urinary levels of 2 -thiothiazolidine- 4 -carboxylic acid (TTCA), which reflect the exposure. Methods Included in the study were 166 <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and 117 controls. Medical and occupational histories were obtained in structured interviews. Symptoms were recorded, and immunologic markers were analyzed in blood. Urinary levels of TTCA were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results Compared with the controls, the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> had increased risks of eye symptoms [odds ratio (OR) 3. 0], nose bleeds (OR 4. 0), burning and dry throat (OR 3. 0), hoarseness (OR 2. 4), severe dry cough (OR 3. 8), nausea (OR 4. 3), and headache (OR 2. 5).

The estimated dioxin exposure concentrations were 0. 5 to 7. 2 pg TEQ/m 3 in the daily operation and 0. 2 to 92, 000 pg TEQ/m 3 in the periodic maintenance. It was also expected that the daily dioxin intake can exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) in incineration plants with fly ash of high dioxin concentration.

Polymorphisms in genes, which are involved in the defense against reactive oxygen species and metabolism of toxic substances present in the vulcanization fumes, were analyzed. METHODS: One hundred and forty-five exposed and 117 unexposed workers were included in the study. Medical and occupational histories were obtained in structured interviews. Symptoms were recorded and immunologic markers analyzed in blood. Polymorphisms in glutathione-related genes (glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) - 129, glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) - 588, glutathione S-transferase alpha 1 (GSTA 1) - 52, GSTM 1 *O, GSTP 1 - 105, GSTP 1 - 114, and GSTT 1 *O) were analyzed by Taqman-based allelic discrimination and ordinary PCR. RESULTS: A protective effect of GSTA 1 - 52 (G/A + A/A) genotype on symptoms and immunologic cells, in particular among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers,</b> was suggested. <b>Exposed</b> <b>workers</b> with GSTT 1 *O had increased risk of nosebleed compared to <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> with GSTT 1 * 1. <b>Exposed</b> <b>workers</b> with GSTP 1 - 105 (ile/val + val/val) had decreased levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) compared to <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> with GSTP 1 - 105 ile/ile.

The total sample was divided according to sex and task. The Pearson's correlation coefficient among the variables was calculated after subdivision on the basis of sex and task. The multiple linear regression was performed to take into account the major confounding factors. RESULTS: Statistical tests showed a negative correlation between urinary Cd levels and free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine and a positive correlation between urinary Cd and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our early results seem to point out that occupational exposure to low concentrations of Cd present in urban air affects the thyroid hormone levels in <b>exposed</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine if urban {{pollution}} can modify indices of genotoxic damage. METHODS: Research of articles inherent in the evaluation of these alterations. Differents categories of <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> are included in the study (cases, in number of 7287) and compaired with no <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> (controls, in number of 8054). To calculate the result of meta-analysis the Effect Size (ES) was used and the confidence interval was calculated. RESULTS: In this category we evaluated 54 studies and we observed significantly differences in the complex. CONCLUSIONS: Starting from the individual variables analysis investigated, between exposed and not exposed group, we underline the utility to deepen the studies concerning of these parameters, to appreciate their benefits and to safeguard health of <b>exposed</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -HP) levels in contemporary Swedish vulcanization workers and in controls. These levels were used as an index substance for vulcanization fumes, as well as a biomarker for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The risk of symptoms and changed levels of immunologic markers were investigated in relation to the 1 -HP levels. METHODS: Included in the study were 163 <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> and 106 controls. Medical and occupational histories were obtained by structured interviews. Symptoms were recorded and immunologic markers analysed in blood by routine analysis methods. Levels of 1 -HP were determined by liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection. RESULTS: The highest levels of 1 -HP were found among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> using injection and compression vulcanization and lower levels were found among <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> vulcanizing with salt bath, hot air, microwaves or fluid-bed. Compared to controls, <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> had increased risks of eye symptoms, nosebleeds, burning and dry throat, hoarseness, severe dry cough, nausea and headache. Furthermore, <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> had elevated levels of neutrophils and total IgG (immunoglobulin subclass G). However, only for severe dry cough an evident exposure-response relationship with urinary 1 -HP levels was found. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly shows increased levels of urinary 1 -HP in Swedish vulcanization workers. Furthermore, it demonstrates an increased risk of several symptoms and elevated levels of some immunologic markers in these workers. However, no obvious exposure-response relationships were found...|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} {{and health of}} a working population exposed simultaneously to jute and hemp were studied. Classical symptoms of byssinosis were not present but 21 workers (7 %) complained of atypical tightness of the chest. The prevalence of chronic bronchitis among the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> was statistically significant in comparison with controls. Effects of dust concentrations, age and duration of exposure on the prevalence of chronic bronchitis were studied. A statistically significant reduction in FEV 1. 0 {{at the end of}} a work shift occurred in all the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> Bronchodilators given after the shift showed that acute reductions in forced expiratory volumes were nearly fully reversible in all <b>exposed</b> <b>workers.</b> Smokers and those with chronic bronchitis had greater reductions in FEV 1. 0 values at the end of the work shift...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of biological and environmental monitoring {{to the risk}} assessment of occupational exposure to lead (Pb), arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) was studied in 18 workers at a birdshot factory (Exposed) and in 18 control workers (Controls), by the determination both of airborne Pb (PbA) and As (AsA) only in the exposed workers, and blood Pb (PbB), erythrocytic zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), urinary Sb (SbU) and the urinary As species in exposed workers and controls. PbA (12 - 42  μg/m(3)) and AsA (1 - 4  μg/m(3)) were strongly correlated (r = 0. 95). PbB, ZPP and the sum of As(3) +As(5) +MMA were significantly higher in the exposed workers. As (3) was higher than the limit of detection in 14 exposed workers and 1 control, As (5) only in 1 <b>exposed</b> <b>worker,</b> SbU in all the exposed workers and in 4 controls. Monitoring for more metallic elements reveals a wider spectrum of exposures than {{can be achieved by}} lead surveillance alone and is preferable for characterizing occupational risk wherever possible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Phoenix Firefighters {{have had}} {{abnormally}} {{high rates of}} tuberculin skin test (TBST) results on medical surveillance. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate our firefighters using QuantiFERON-TB (QFT), comparing the results to their TBST results. Methods Using QFT results obtained during the study, we compared previously positive TBST responders (Cases) to negative responders (Controls). We also compared both groups for QFT results for Mycobacterium avium (MA) exposure. Results QFT effectively monitored our working population. 12. 9 % of the 148 cases, and 3. 2 % of the 220 controls had a positive QFT result. Another 14. 8 % of cases and 4. 5 % of controls had conditionally positive QFT results. There was an unusually high rate of MA response on QFT testing in both groups. Conclusion Phoenix Firefighters have a higher than expected TBST and QFT results, which cannot be explained by the increased MA rate. The decreased level of QFT positivity in comparison to TBST results may indicate a considerable false positive TBST rate. The QFT offers many advantages as a surveillance method over TBST in <b>exposed</b> <b>worker</b> populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{occupational}} asthma caused by cobalt associated with systemic symptoms. He was a non-atopic, ex-smoker and had worked in a glassware factory for 14 months. A skin prick test with CoSO 4 up to 100 mg/ml showed a negative result. A bronchoprovocation test with CoSO 4 demonstrated an isolated asthmatic response with systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia and myalgia. Although an initial methacholine bronchial challenge test showed a negative result, the following methacholine bronchial challenge test which was done 24 hours after the challenge testing demonstrated an increased airway hyperresponsiveness at 2. 5 mg/ml which recovered 7 days later. An intradermal skin test with 10 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml CoSO 4 solution demonstrated positive responses respectively(13 x 12 / 40 x 32, 20 x 15 / 40 x 37, histamine 16 x 14 / 64 x 50). A patch test including cobalt showed a negative result. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after the cobalt inhalation testing and other laboratory findings showed no evidence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. These results suggested that cobalt could induce occupational asthma with systemic illness in an <b>exposed</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nickel {{exposure}} {{is recognized as}} an endocrine disruptor because of its adverse effects on reproduction. AIM: This {{study was designed to}} investigate the possible testiculo-hormonal perturbations on <b>workers</b> occupationally <b>exposed</b> to nickel and to assess its effects on human male sexual function. METHODS: Cross-sectional comparative study, comprising 105 electroplating male non-smoker, non-alcoholic <b>workers</b> <b>exposed</b> to soluble nickel and 60 controls was done. Serum luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone levels and urinary nickel concentrations were determined for the studied groups. RESULTS: Serum luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, urinary nickel and the simultaneous incidence of more than one sexual disorder were significantly higher in the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> compared to controls. The occurrence of various types of sexual disorders (decreased libido, impotence and premature ejaculation) in the <b>exposed</b> <b>workers</b> was 9. 5, 5. 1 and 4. 4 folds respectively than the controls.
