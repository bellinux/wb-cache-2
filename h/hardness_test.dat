5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{sources of}} {{problems}} with a <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machine that are detectable via day-to-day inspection using hardness standard blocks, or indirect verification, can be roughly divided into three: the indenter, the test force, and the indentation measuring apparatus. If any problems are detected, repair or recalibration of the testing machine, focusing on the aforementioned three factors, is carried out {{based on the results}} of verifying the direct accuracies of that machine. These efforts have been accumulated to acquire the high level of <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> technology as is available now. This article describes the development of a hardness standard block as a tool for indirect verification of <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machines, discusses possible factors that have effects on hardness measurements, and provides insights into the future <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> from a perspective of a hardness block manufacturer...|$|R

Biomaterial hardness is desirable as equal to bone hardness. If higher than the biomaterial, then it penetrates in the bone. As above said, biomaterials sample are very small therefore, micro and nano scale <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> (Diamond Knoop and Vickers indenters) are used.|$|E
