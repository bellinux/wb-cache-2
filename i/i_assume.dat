25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
500|$|Another person {{planned to}} voice a {{character}} in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why. Nobody told me... But, you know, the movie didn't do anything, so who cares?" ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E
2500|$|The wing commander, Colonel Gabriel, {{was asked}} by Senator Stennis, {{what he thought about}} filing the false {{intelligence}} reports. Gabriel replied, [...] "My conjecture was... it goes to the world, the OPREP-4—-and <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> there was somebody on the loading list [...] that did not have a need to know, and the full report would be filed with the special report that was sent in at night." ...|$|E
2500|$|The column drew about 100,000 {{visitors}} to this website {{in a day}} or so. And—fairly or not—it's been cited by some as the event that triggered the Plame hullabaloo. I doubt that the column prompted the investigation eventually conducted by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, for <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> that had my column not appeared the CIA still would have asked the Justice Department to investigate the leak as a possible crime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of the general theory in 1916, a number of scientists pointed out that general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational redshift. Einstein himself suggested the following thought experiment: (<b>i)</b> <b>Assume</b> that a tower of height h (Fig.5‑3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass m {{from the top of the}} tower. It falls freely with acceleration g, reaching the ground with velocity , so that its total energy E, as measured by an observer on the ground, is [...] (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon E back into a particle of rest mass m.|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E
2500|$|In The Cry of Tamar: Violence Against Women and the Church's Response, Pamela Cooper-White {{criticizes the}} Bible's {{depiction}} of Tamar for {{its emphasis on}} the male roles in the story and the perceived lack of sympathy given to Tamar. [...] "The narrator of 2 Samuel 13 at times portrays poignantly, eliciting our sympathy for the female victim. But mostly, the narrator (<b>I</b> <b>assume</b> he) steers us {{in the direction of}} primary interest, even sympathy, for the men all around her. Even the poignancy of Tamar's humiliation is drawn out for the primary purpose of justifying Absalom's later murder of Amnon and not for its own sake." [...] She opined that [...] "Sympathy for Tamar is not the narrator's primary interest. The forcefulness of Tamar's impression is drawn out, not to illuminate her pain, but to justify Absalom's anger at Amnon and subsequent murder of him." [...] Cooper-White also states that after the incestuous rape, the narrative continues to focus on Amnon, writing, [...] "The story continues to report the perpetrator's viewpoint, the thoughts and feelings after the incident of violence; the victim's viewpoint is not presented. [...] We are given no indication that he ever thought about her again—even in terms of fear of punishment or reprisal." ...|$|E
