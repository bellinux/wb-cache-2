Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, the object is found to be a bloodstained <b>fencing</b> <b>glove,</b> in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E

6000|$|What the mawleys were I did not know, but {{presently}} {{they brought}} out four great puddings of leather, {{not unlike a}} <b>fencing</b> <b>glove,</b> but larger. With these our hands were covered after we had stripped ourselves of our coats and our waistcoats. Then the table, with the glasses and decanters, was pushed {{into the corner of}} the room, and behold us; face to face! Lord Sadler sat in the arm-chair with a watch in his open hand. [...] "Time!" [...] said he.|$|E
40|$|In foil fencing, an {{adequate}} amount of hand forces and dexterity {{is extremely important}} in manipulating the foil and thus affecting {{the performance of a}} fencer. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of handwear of <b>fencing</b> <b>gloves</b> and posture on four performance measures in foil fencing. Eight male fencers were tested in an experiment. Four measures of fencing performance were collected and analyzed. They were the grip and pinch forces under four hand postures and the hitting scores and motion time under a fundamental attacking scenario. Analysis of variance was conducted. Duncan’s multiple range tests were conducted if a significance level of 0. 05 was reached. The results showed that both the handwear condition and posture were significant on the grip force. The effects of posture on grip and pinch forces were both significant. Handwear affected hitting accuracy significantly. The effect of handwear on pinch force was not significant. The hitting scores for both the glove I and II conditions were significantly higher than the bare hand condition. The results in this study supported that selection of the thinnest glove resulted in relatively better performance for the fencers...|$|R

For Logan first walked to a chemist's shop, where he purchased a quantity of a certain drug. Next he went to the fencing rooms which he frequented, took his fencing mask and glove, borrowed a <b>fencing</b> <b>glove</b> from a left- handed swordsman whom he knew, and drove to his rooms with this odd assortment of articles. Having deposited them, he paid a call at the dwelling of a fair member of the Disentanglers, Miss Frere, the lady instructress in the culinary art, at the City and Suburban College of Cookery, whereof, as we have heard, Mr. Fulton, the eminent drysalter, was a patron and visitor. Logan unfolded the case and his plan of campaign to Miss Frere, who listened with intelligent sympathy.|$|E
