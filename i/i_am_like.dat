You give us precisely what we need. We owe you our gratitude. Until then, please receive, with your usual kindness, the deep respect of Voltaire." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 22, 2005, the day Katif was evacuated, David Hatuel {{addressed}} the settlers, defining {{the day as}} one of destruction and expulsion, thanking his fellow residents for their support after {{the murder of his}} wife and children, adding: [...] "We are going through a crisis, an unfathomable hardship; but we will not despair and we will not fall." [...] In December of the same year, he married Limor Shem-Tov, an occupational therapist, stating: [...] "I have two options, either to collapse or to continue living. I have chosen life! My new home is an addition and not a replacement of the home that was destroyed. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> a tree whose branches were cut off and now they are growing again."

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of the first volume, Rossiter was asked to run the NSF's program on the History and Philosophy of Science while its director took a year of leave during 1982–1983. In 1983–1984 she was a visiting professor at Harvard, where she continued work on her second volume. Still unable to find a tenure-track position, she applied for the NSF's Visiting Professorships for Women program, and received a one-year appointment to Cornell, which she stretched to two years (1986–1988). Cornell agreed to keep her on for another three years, but her funding was split between three departments including women's studies, agriculture, and history. In many ways, at this stage of her career she felt like some of the women she wrote about, saying [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> a 78 [...] record in a 33 world".|$|E

However, upon {{arriving}} at the palace, Heuxos informs Ijim that the Tiriel with him is indeed the real Tiriel, but Ijim suspects that the entire palace and everyone in {{it is part of the}} spirit's deception; [...] "Then it is true Heuxos that thou hast turnd thy aged parent/To be the sport of wintry winds.

2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>like</b> {{a man who}} sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though {{he does not know}} the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
