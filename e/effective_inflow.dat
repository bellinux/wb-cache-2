40|$|A {{sample of}} 1185 Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model {{analysis}} (0 h) proximity soundings, within 40 km and 30 min of radar-identified discrete storms, was categorized by several storm types: significantly tornadic supercells (F {{2 or greater}} damage), weakly tornadic supercells (F 0 –F 1 damage), nontornadic supercells, elevated right-moving supercells, storms with marginal supercell characteristics, and nonsupercells. These proximity soundings served {{as the basis for}} calculations of storm-relative helicity and bulk shear intended to apply across a broad spectrum of thunderstorm types. An effective storm inflow layer was defined in terms of minimum constraints on lifted parcel CAPE and convective inhibition (CIN). Sixteen CAPE and CIN constraint combinations were examined, and the smallest CAPE (25 and 100 Jkg � 1) and largest CIN (� 250 Jkg � 1) constraints provided the greatest probability of detecting an <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> layer within an 835 -supercell subset of the proximity soundings. Effective storm-relative helicity (ESRH) calculations were based on the upper and lower bounds of the <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> layer. By confining the SRH calculation to the <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> layer, ESRH values can be compared consistently across a wide range of storm environments, including storms rooted above the ground. Similarly, the effective bulk shear (EBS) was defined in terms of the vertical shear through a percentage of the “storm depth, ” as defined by the vertical distanc...|$|E

40|$|CIVINSA {{propeller}} lifting surface {{design and}} analysis program is automatically {{coupled with a}} Euler/integrated Boundary Layer Theory (IBLT) axisymmetric flow solver. The lifting surface method solves the localized propeller problem, while the Euler/IBLT solver handles the global flowfield, capturing the <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> problem. For viscous flows, the boundary layer is constructed based upon the parameters specified by the IBLT solution, and is merged with the inviscid Euler flowfield. The robust coupled method is capable of representing open propellers, ducted propulsors, and internal flow cases, including multi-blade row applications. For large axisymmetic bodies, the user may specify a nominal inflow, and the coupled method {{is used for the}} localized propulsor problem only, further increasing the computational efficiency. The specified nominal flow field may be calculated by other numerical flow solvers, obtained from experimental results, or calculated from a Euler/IBLT solution of the entire body. The coupled code is an extremely rapid flowfleld gridding, calculation, and convergence method, which allows an order of magnitude reduction in convergence time when compared to the current efforts using Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) as the flow solver. Experimental validation is demonstrated for open, ducted, and internal flow propulsors. CIVIN...|$|E
40|$|A Pratt and Whitney JT 15 D- 1 {{turbofan}} engine was tested in two facilities at Ames Research Center: the outdoor Static Test Facility and the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The primary {{purposes of the}} test were {{to determine the effects}} of forward velocity on the turbofan spectra in the forward quadrant for the cruise inlet and to compare these wind-tunnel spectra with outdoor spectra to determine the possibility of simulating forward-velocity effects from purely outdoor measurements. The wind-tunnel data show a reduction in the blade-passage frequency tones of the order of 10 dB with increasing forward velocity at subsonic fan-tip speeds. No forward-velocity variation was observed at supersonic tip speeds. Comparison of in-duct spectra for the cruise inlet at forward velocity, with spectra from outdoor tests with a distortion-control inlet shows excellent agreement for the in-duct data when allowance is made for different in-duct volumes. This is also reflected in good agreement for the far-field spectra at small forward angles. The comparisons of wind-tunnel and outdoor data also indicate that at least for the JT 15 D- 1, it may be possible to approximate the shape of the far-field spectra at large directivity angles from an outdoor measurement with the cruise inlet, providing an <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> control device is used...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} cannula allowing single site transaortic inflow and outflow cannulation for centrifugal assist devices is described. The cannula {{is inserted}} through a straight 18 mm collagen coated Dacron tube anastomosed to the anterior {{aspect of the}} ascending aorta. The inflow conduit of the cannula is positioned into the left ventricle through the aortic valve, and the end hole of the outflow conduit is positioned in the ascending aorta. The cannula was evaluated in vivo in 3 adult pigs by the institution of a centrifugal pump for left ventricular support. Optimal flow varied between 5 and 6 L/min and mean aortic pressure between 55 and 70 mm Hg throughout the 3 days of left ventricular support. Recently, we employed this cannula in a patient who {{was not able to}} be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass for the institution of left ventricular support using a centrifugal pump. The cannula provided <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> and outflow drainage with an optimal flow of 5. 2 L/min throughout the 72 h of support. The patient was successfully weaned from support on the fourth postoperative day. This rational transaortic approach of cannulation using this specific cannula is a refined implantation technique which allows direct left ventricular inflow drainage, reduces the time of implantation, spares left ventricular myocardium, avoids bleeding that is sometimes encountered at other cannulation sites, and avoids compression of the heart by cannulas...|$|E
40|$|Salinity and {{stratification}} in {{the deep}} basins of the Baltic Sea {{are linked to the}} occurrence of Major Baltic Inflows (MBIs) of higher saline water of North Sea origin, which occur sporadically and transport higher saline and oxygenated water to deeper layers. Since the mid- 1970 s, the frequency and intensity of MBIs have decreased. They were completely absent between February 1983 and January 1993. However, in spite of the decreasing frequency of MBIs, there was no obvious decrease of larger Baltic Sea volume changes (LVCs). A LVC is defined by a total volume change of at least 100 km 3. LVCs can be identified from the sea level changes at Landsort which is known to represent the mean sea level of the Baltic Sea very well. Strong inflows leading to LVCs are associated to a special sequence of atmospheric circulation patterns. Our analysis based on Jenkinson-Collison circulation (JCC) types confirms that most <b>effective</b> <b>inflows</b> occur if about a month before the main inflow period, eastern air flow with anticyclonic vorticity over the western Baltic prevails. These conditions reduce the mean sea level of the Baltic Sea and lead to an increased saline stratification in the Belt Sea area. An immediate period of strong to very strong westerly winds trigger the inflow and force LVCs/MBIs. The lack of MBIs coincide with a negative trend of eastern types and a parallel increase of western type JCC...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantity}} of water available for irrigation is getting scarce {{in many countries}} and it assumes great importance for assured crop production, especially {{in view of the}} erratic behavior of the monsoon. Thus, there is a pressing need to improve the water efficiency of irrigation systems. One-way of improving the efficiency of the irrigation system is reusing the return flow from the irrigation system. This task requires quantification of return flow, which still remains as a grey area in irrigation water management. The estimation of return flow from the irrigation system is usually obtained using thumb rules depending upon the site-specific conditions like command area conditions and soil properties. In this paper, a hierarchical modeling technique, namely, regression tree is developed for return flow estimation. Regression tree is built through binary recursive partitioning. The <b>effective</b> rainfall, <b>inflow,</b> consumptive water demand, and percolation loss are taken as predictor variables and return flow is treated as the target variable. The applicability of the hierarchical model is demonstrated through a case study of Periyar-Vaigai Irrigation System in Tamil Nadu, India. The model performance shows a good match between the simulated and the field measured return flow values. Results of statistical analysis indicated that the correlation coefficients are high for both single as well as double crop seasons.

40|$|Summarized {{here are}} key {{advances}} in experimental techniques and theoretical applications {{which point the}} way to a broad understanding and control of turbomachinery noise. On the experimental side, the development of <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> control techniques makes it possible to conduct, in ground based facilities, definitive experiments in internally controlled blade row interactions. Results can now be valid indicators of flight behavior and can provide a firm base for comparison with analytical results. Inflow control coupled with detailed diagnostic tools such as blade pressure measurements can be used to uncover the more subtle mechanisms such as rotor strut interaction, which can set tone levels for some engine configurations. Initial mappings of rotor wake-vortex flow fields have provided a data base for a first generation semiempirical flow disturbance model. Laser velocimetry offers a nonintrusive method for validating and improving the model. Digital data systems and signal processing algorithms are bringing mode measurement closer to a working tool that can be frequently applied to a real machine such as a turbofan engine. On the analytical side, models of most of the links in the chain from turbomachine blade source to far field observation point have been formulated. Three dimensional lifting surface theory for blade rows, including source noncompactness and cascade effects, blade row transmission models incorporating mode and frequency scattering, and modal radiation calculations, including hybrid numerical-analytical approaches, are tools which await further application...|$|E
40|$|Background: The breathhold contrast-enhanced {{three-dimensional}} {{magnetic resonance}} angiography (MRA) using T 1 -weighted gradient-echo imaging sequence {{is the standard}} technique for MRA of the thorax. However, this technique is not desirable for certain patients with respiratory insufficiency, serious renal impairment, or allergy to contrast agents. The objective {{of this study was}} to optimize and evaluate a non-contrast-enhanced free-breathing pulmonary MRA protocol at 3 Tesla. Methods: The time-of-flight protocol was based on a two-dimensional T 1 -weighted turbo field echo sequence with slice-selective inversion recovery and magnetization transfer preparation together with respiratory navigator gating, cardiac gating, and parallel imaging. Optimal values for time of inversion delay, flip angle and slice thickness were experimentally determined and used for all subjects. Results: Excellent pulmonary MRA images, in which the 7 th order branches of pulmonary arteries could be reliably identified, were obtained in the 12 free-breathing healthy volunteers. TI of ∼ 300 ms provides the best suppression of background thoracic and cardiac muscles and <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> enhancement. With increasing flip angle, the pulmonary vessels gradually brightened and exhibited optimal contrast at 20 °- 30 °. The 2 mm slice thickness and 0. 5 mm slice overlap is suitable for visualization of the peripheral pulmonary vessel. Conclusions: The MRA protocol at 3 Tesla may have clinical significance for pulmonary vascular imaging in patients who are not available for contrast-enhanced 3 D MRA and CT angiography examination or are unable to sustain a long breath-hold. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|CIVINSThis thesis {{develops}} {{a method to}} analyze the maneuvering forces on surfaced and underwater vehicles with complex propulsors. The analysis method is developed for general propellers yet has unique applicability to model highly contracting stern flows associated with integrated propulsors. Integrated propulsors exhibit strong coupling of the various blade rows and duct, if present, to the vehicle stern. The method developed herein provides a robust means to analyze propulsor induced maneuvering forces including those arising from wake adapted, multi-stage, ducted propulsors. The heart of the maneuvering force prediction is a three-dimensional, unsteady lifting surface method developed as {{the first part of}} this thesis. The new method is designated PUF- 14 for Propeller Unsteady Forces. The lifting surface method uses many advanced techniques. One significant advance is the use of a wake adapted lattice to model the flow through the propulsor. In related research, a 2 -D Kutta condition has been augmented using Lagrangian interpolation to dramatically reduce the required computational time to model a 2 -D gust. The second thrust of this thesis couples the unsteady lifting surface method with a three-dimensional, time-average Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes flow solver. Rotating a propeller through a spatially varying flow field causes temporally varying forces on the propeller. From the converged coupled solution, the maneuvering and blade rate forces can be estimated. This thesis explores the relationship of time varying and time average forces in the flow solver and potential flow domains. Similarly, it explores the relationship of the <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> in the two domains. Finally, this thesis details the synergistic means to correctly couple the potential flow method to a viscous solver. Verification and validation of the method have been done on a variety of geometries and vehicles. Preliminary results show good correlation with experiment[URL]...|$|E

We {{applied the}} dynamic push-pull technique tomanipulate the flow-divertermesh density at the aneurysmorifice tomaximize flowdiversion. This {{study investigated the}} hemodynamic impact of the dynamic push-pull technique on patient-specific aneurysms by using the devel-oped high-fidelity virtual-stenting computational modeling technique combined with computational fluid dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We deployed 2 Pipeline Embolization Devices into 2 identical sidewall anterior cerebral artery aneurysm phantoms by using the dynamic push-pull technique with different delivery-wire advancements. We then numerically simulated these deployment processes and validated the simulated mesh geometry. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to evaluate detailed hemodynamic changes by deployed flow diverters in the sidewall aneurysm and a fusiform basilar trunk aneurysm (deployments implemented previously). Images of manipulated flow diverter mesh from sample clinical cases were also evaluated. RESULTS: The flow diverters deployed in silico accurately replicated in vitro geometries. Increased delivery wire advancement (21 versus 11 mm) by using a dynamic push-pull technique produced a higher mesh compaction at the aneurysm orifice (50 % metal coverage versus 36 %), which led to more <b>effective</b> aneurysmal <b>inflow</b> reduction (62 % versus 50 % in the sidewall aneurysm; 57 % versus 36 % in the fusiform aneurysm). The dynamic push-pull technique also caused relatively lower metal coverage along the parent vessel due to elongation of the flow diverter.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} evidence that large dams that trap riverine sediment, decrease significantly SPM within estuaries, making them less turbid {{and less of}} a particulate trap for phosphorus adsorption. The study gives science-based insights for a future integrated estuarine water management in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary. The hindsight focuses on the evolution and fate of riverine dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in the Yangtze Estuary from 1999 to 2010. A significant correlation between phosphorus and suspended particulate matter (SPM) was established. This shows that, in the past decade, the estuary has changed from being a source of DIP to being a sink, and from a heterotrophic system to an autotrophic system. The ecosystem shift {{may be explained by}} the combined impact of the construction of dams that retain SPM but not nutrients, and to increasing nutrient fluxes to the estuary due to increasing usage of fertilizer and sewage. The foresight study is based on likely future scenarios for 2050. These are estimated using historical data and the stratified and a muddy-LOICZ model, which takes stratification and adsorption-desorption of phosphorus into account. We forecast that in 2050 the <b>effective</b> DIP <b>inflow</b> into the Yangtze Estuary will increase by a factor of 1. 5 if the SPM remains at the current annual average of 700 mg L- 1, and by a factor of 3. 3 if the SPM decreases to 200 mg L- 1 {{as a result of the}} dams, which will further degrade the estuary...|$|R

40|$|To {{maximize}} {{the effectiveness of}} the rapidly increasing capacity of installed wind energy resources, new models must be developed that are capable of more nuanced control of each wind turbine so that each device is more responsive to inflow events. Models used to plan wind turbine arrays and control behavior of devices within the farm currently make questionable estimates of the incoming atmospheric flow and update turbine configurations infrequently. As a result, wind turbines often operate at diminished capacities, especially in arrays where wind turbine wakes interact and inflow conditions are far from ideal. New turbine control and wake prediction models must be developed to tune individual devices and make accurate power predictions. To that end, wind tunnel experiments are conducted detailing the turbulent flow {{in the wake of a}} wind turbine in a model-scale array. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to characterize the spatial evolution of structures in the wake. Mode bases from distinct downstream locations are reconciled through a secondary decomposition, called double proper orthogonal decomposition (DPOD), indicating that modes of common rank in the wake share an ordered set of sub-modal projections whose organization delineates underlying wake structures and spatial evolution. The doubly truncated basis of sub-modal structures represents a reduction to 0. 015 % of the total degrees of freedom of the wind turbine wake. Low-order representations of the Reynolds stress tensor are made using only the most dominant DPOD modes, corrected to account for energy excluded from the truncated basis with a tensor of constant coefficients defined to rescale the low-order representation of the stresses to match the original statistics. Data from the wind turbine wake are contrasted against simulation data from a fully-developed channel flow, illuminating a range of anisotropic states of turbulence. Complexity of flow descriptions resulting from truncated POD bases is suppressed in severe basis truncations, exaggerating anisotropy of the modeled flow and, in extreme cases, can lead to the loss of three dimensionality. Constant corrections to the low-order descriptions of the Reynolds stress tensor reduce the root-mean-square error between low-order descriptions of the flow and the full statistics as much as 40 % and, in some cases, reintroduce three-dimensionality to severe truncations of POD bases. Low-dimensional models are constructed by coupling the evolution of the dynamic mode coefficients through their respective time derivatives and successfully account for non-linear mode interaction. Deviation between time derivatives of mode coefficients and their least-squares fit is amplified in numerical integration of the system, leading to unstable long-time solutions. Periodic recalibration of the dynamical system is undertaken by limiting the integration time and using a virtual sensor upstream of the wind turbine actuator disk in to read the <b>effective</b> <b>inflow</b> velocity. A series of open-loop transfer functions are designed to inform the low-order dynamical system of the flow incident to the wind turbine rotor. Validation data shows that the model tuned to the inflow reproduces dynamic mode coefficients with little to no error given a sufficiently small interval between instances of recalibration. The reduced-order model makes accurate predictions of the wake when informed of turbulent inflow events. The modeling scheme represents a viable path for continuous time feedback and control that may be used to selectively tune a wind turbine in the effort to maximize power output of large wind farms...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{failure of}} {{borehole}} supplies in weathered Precambrian basement throughout southern Africa, and in Malawi in particular, has been blamed {{on a variety}} of causes. These include poor borehole design, badly sited boreholes, mechanical failure and even implementer ignorance of basic hydrogeological principles. Recent work in Malawi demonstrates that recharge and flow potential of the data-scarce basement aquifer can be investigated by deriving a variety of surrogate and secondary data. Investigation shows that the weathered Precambrian basement aquifer may not always be up to the job sustaining even modest abstraction sources indefinitely and that many new sources will fail in the short to medium term. Failure is the result of recharge being able to sustain abstraction within the limited capture zone of an abstraction source, there being little <b>effective</b> lateral <b>inflow</b> of groundwater on the African plateau savannah lands which have very low hydraulic gradients. If lateral groundwater flow does occur across source capture zone, for example towards the rift-valley escarpment, sources are more sustainable to a degree, depending on the volume of through-flow. Where surface water courses traverse the aquifer, albeit flowing ephemerally or largely as sub-river bed sand rivers, sustainability of borehole sources is increased provided there is hydraulic connectivity to the aquifer. Abstraction from the aquifer within a source capture zone may be as little as 25 % of storage in isolated rural areas, more typically about 50 % and as high as 70 % in the more densely populated areas. If demographic growth requires an increase of just 1 % in large areas of Malawi, source failure will occur within a 25 -year to 35 -year period...|$|R
