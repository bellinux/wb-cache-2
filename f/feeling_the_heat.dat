The fire underneath the store weakened the wooden beams, while the thickness of the floor prevented firefighters from <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> extreme <b>heat</b> below.|$|R
60|$|When Miltoun {{entered the}} breakfast room, his grandmother, {{with a copy}} of the Times in her hands, was seated before a grape fruit, which, with a {{shredded}} wheat biscuit, constituted her first meal. Her appearance hardly warranted Barbara's description of 'terribly well'; in truth she looked a little white, {{as if she had been}} <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> But there was no lack of animation in her little steel-grey eyes, nor of decision in her manner.|$|E

60|$|Lord Cheisford and {{she left}} the room together. I, <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the apartment, walked to the window, and raising the sash looked out into the cool dark evening. At the door, drawn up in front of Lord Cheisford's brougham, was a {{carriage}} with a tall footman standing facing me. I recognized him and the liveries in a moment. It was the Rowchester carriage. Some one from Rowchester House was even now with Lord and Lady Chelsford.|$|E
50|$|In cold climates, {{double glazing}} {{should be used}} to reduce {{conductive}} losses through the glass to <b>the</b> outside. Night-time <b>heat</b> loss, although significant during winter months, is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed {{off from the rest of}} the building. In temperate and cold climates, thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important. Large glass panels, French doors, or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open <b>feeling</b> without <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> loss associated with an open space.|$|R

60|$|Margaret {{raised her}} hood and looked full at him, {{and he fell}} back. He knew her, and knew that Madame la Dauphine did strange things. The road was stony and bare and treeless, unfrequented at first, {{and it was very}} sultry, the sun shining with a heavy melting heat on Margaret's weighty garments; but she hurried on, never <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> or hearing Linette's {{endeavours}} to draw her attention to the heavy bank of gray clouds tinged with lurid red gradually rising, and whence threatening growls of thunder were heard from time to time. She really seemed to rush forward, and poor, panting Linette toiled after her, feeling ready to drop, while the way was as yet unobstructed, as the two beautiful steeples of the Cathedral and Notre Dame de l'Epine rose before them; but after a time, as they drew nearer, the road became obstructed by carts, waggons, donkeys, crowded with country-folks and their wares, with friars and ragged beggars, all pressing into the town, and jostling one another and the two foot-passengers all the more as rain-drops began to fall, and the thunder sounded nearer.|$|E
60|$|At length, Merton, who {{had been}} {{coughing}} a great deal while dressing, came in assisted by his wife, but quite exhausted with the exertion of walking from one room to the other; and after shaking hands with their visitor he sunk into his easy-chair, not yet able to talk. She was greatly shocked at the change in him; the once fine, marble-like face was horribly wasted, so that the sharp unsightly bones {{looked as if they}} would cut their way through the deadly dry parchment-yellow skin that covered them; and the deep blue eyes now looked preternaturally large and bright--all the brighter for the dark purple stains beneath them. He was low indeed, nigh unto death perhaps; yet he did not appear cast down in the least, but even while he sat breathing laboriously, still unable to speak, the eyes had a pleased hopeful look as they rested on their visitor's face. A smile, too, hovered about {{the corners of his mouth}} as his glance wandered over her costume. For, in spite of <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> a great deal, she looked cool in her light-hued summer dress, with its dim blue pattern on a cream-coloured ground. The loose fashion in which it was made, the tints, and light frosting of fine lace on neck and sleeves, harmonised well with the grey tender eyes, the pure delicate skin, and golden hair.|$|E

5000|$|In Finland, a pefletti is {{a simple}} device used in a sauna. It is a sheet of paper, cardboard, cloth, foam rubber or other soft {{material}} that {{is placed on the}} sauna bench and then sat on. Its purpose is to maintain sanitary conditions in a sauna with a wide user base by preventing genital contact with the bench. Another reason is to prevent uncomfortable <b>feeling</b> because of <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> pefletti come in both disposable and re-usable varieties. The word pefletti is a combination of the Finnish word [...] "peffa", which is a mild slang word for one's behind, and the Swedish word [...] "tablett", meaning placemat.

30|$|Cooperative {{style of}} {{conflict}} handling indicates {{the willingness of}} the entrepreneur to take into consideration the other party’s views and concerns along with his/her own while resolving conflicts. This indicates equal concern for the self and the others, which is ideally, a very healthy way of resolving conflicts. Competitive style of conflict resolution indicates entrepreneurs’ high concern for self and self-interests than that of others. They have high need to win against their conflicting opponent. This approach may save time involved in negotiations, but might lead to underlying unhappiness for the opponent which might further result in negative image of the competing party. Avoiding style is ideally the least preferred style of conflict resolution as the conflict is not truly resolved with this approach. Conflict is just avoided for time being. At times, it may help in settling <b>the</b> extreme <b>feelings</b> and dampen <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of <b>the</b> conflict situation, but will not result in resolution as such. This style is thus to be discouraged for healthy business relationships (Figure 3).|$|R
6000|$|... "And yonder {{is truly}} the boat!" [...] added Mulford, {{with a sigh}} that almost {{amounted}} to a groan. The light had, by this time, so far returned as to enable the party not only to see the fins {{of half a dozen}} sharks, which were already prowling about the wreck, the almost necessary consequence of their proximity to a reef in that latitude, but actually to discern the boat drifting down toward them, at a distance that promised to carry it past, within the reach of Mulford's powers of swimming, though not as near as he could have wished, even under more favourable circumstances. Had their extremity been greater, or had Rose begun to suffer from hunger or thirst, Mulford might have attempted the experiment of endeavoring to regain the boat, though the chances of death by means of the sharks would be more than equal to those of escape; but still fresh, and not yet <b>feeling</b> even <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of <b>the</b> sun of that low latitude, he was not quite goaded into such an act of desperation. All that remained for the party, therefore, was to sit on the keel of the wreck, and gaze with longing eyes at a little object floating past, which, once at their command, might so readily be made to save them from a fate that already began to appear terrible in the perspective. Near an hour was thus consumed, ere the boat was about half a mile to leeward; during which scarcely an eye was turned from it for one instant, or a word was spoken.|$|R
