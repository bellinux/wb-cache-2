5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s the Genealogical Research Kit which {{contained}} microfilm copies of popular key archival documents was expanded, renamed the Archives Resources Kit (ARK), and deposited at forty Community Access Points (CAPs), mainly public libraries, throughout New South Wales. This {{had the effect}} of reducing demand in the Reading Rooms at the Sydney and Western Sydney Records Centres. In addition to the Archives Resources Kit, work was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes to make more State archives available to external users electronically. In 2000 Archives Investigator was developed jointly by the State Records Authority of NSW and the Council of the City of Sydney. (The name refers to HMS Investigator, in which Matthew Flinders completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, 1801–1803, and mapped much of the coast for the first time.) This made a large number of archival series available online via the Internet. Work on Photo Investigator, a related database commenced in the early 2000s and by 2006 a considerable number of photographs from the archives were available to users online.|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 1998–99 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having {{recently}} signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours {{of a big}} money move {{to a host of}} Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a [...] "hands-off" [...] warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have [...] "been a number of things <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes which have unsettled him recently". In particular, his £1,400 a week salary was compared with the £5,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.|$|E
500|$|Leicester City's manager Brian Little was {{forbidden}} {{to speak to}} Aston Villa by their board, after rumours began circulating that Ellis wanted to hire him. Although maintaining {{that he had not}} spoken to Ellis about the possibility of taking over at Villa, Little resigned from his post at Leicester even though he was contracted to the club {{until the end of the}} 1997–98 season. Three days after his resignation, Ellis hired him as the new Villa manager. Little kept Villa in the Premiership, and then reshaped the squad in the 1995 close-season by selling most of the club's older players and buying in several younger ones. Villa won the 1996 League Cup with a win over Leeds United, reached the FA Cup semi-finals and finished fourth in the Premiership in the 199596 season. In February 1998, with Villa standing 15th in the Premiership and speculation rife that he would be sacked, Little resigned, stating that, [...] "There were certain things <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes which were affecting my own managerial position." [...] Ellis came out with a statement directly challenging that it had anything to do with the management at Villa Park. Instead, he suggested it was due to a [...] "variety of pressures" [...] including abuse directed towards Little and his family by irate fans.|$|E

60|$|Reassured by the calmness {{with which}} James issued his orders, the boats {{took up the}} {{positions}} assigned to them. James, {{who was in the}} last boat in the line, shuddered at <b>the</b> din <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> him. <b>The</b> yells of the Indians, the screams and cries of the provincials, mingled with the sharp crack of rifles or the duller sound of the musket. The work of destruction was soon over. Save his own company and some fifty of the provincials in the boats ahead, the whole of Colonel Parker's force had been killed, or were prisoners {{in the hands of the}} Indians, who, having finished their work, set off in pursuit of the boats which had escaped them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Move {{farther on}} {{and give them}} another shower," [...] Hector said; and again the rocks fell on the crowded causeway. The first volley had caused a pause--numbers had been crushed, many of the stones as they rolled down the road had carried {{confusion}} to those below; the second volley completed their discomfiture. Appalled by a discharge against which they had no shelter and which was wholly unexpected, those near whom the stones had fallen turned, and in their panic swept those below them on the road down into the valley, many being overthrown and trampled to death. Ignorant of what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> them, <b>the</b> crowd above {{the spot where the}} stones had fallen were still pressing upward, those in front hewing with their scythes and axes at the pikeheads.|$|R
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rubio's {{reviews from}} {{students}} have been positive, even from students who disagree with him politically.

2500|$|During 1943, the RNPG {{gradually}} {{changed from}} providing false papers to information-gathering for France libre. Pierre de Bénouville said, [...] "Mitterrand created a true spy {{network in the}} POW camps which gave us information, often decisive, about what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> German borders." [...] On 10 July Mitterrand and Piatzook (a militant communist) interrupted a public meeting in the Salle Wagram in Paris. The meeting was about allowing French POWs to go home if they were replaced by young French men forced to go and work in Germany (in French this was called [...] "la relève"). When André Masson {{began to talk about}} [...] "la trahison des gaullistes" [...] (the Gaullist treason), Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling la relève a [...] "con" [...] (i.e., something stupid). Mitterrand avoided arrest as Piatzook covered his escape.|$|E
40|$|Drawing upon two {{public opinion}} surveys {{conducted}} in Geneva in 2015 and 2016, the paper explores how video surveillance was lived and {{perceived by the}} residents of the monitored Pâquis area, {{as well as by the}} population at large. This study shows that the delegation of control to systems and individuals that are both spatially and socially detached from the monitored areas also results in a kind of `mental distance' that characterizes the relation between the monitored individuals and the system: People quickly forget about the cameras and withdraw from any conscious attempt to imagine what might be <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> their back. <b>The</b> system thus gradually loses its relevance in people's everyday life. This, in turn, limits the symbolic power of the cameras to enduringly revitalize, and thus to properly re-territorialize, the monitored areas...|$|R

2500|$|Expanded Western {{sanctions}} in mid-March coursed through financial markets, hitting the business interests of some Russia's richest people. The Americans centred {{on the heart}} of Moscow's leadership, though the EU's initial list shied from targeting Putin's inner circle. As ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's credit outlook, Russian banks warned of a sanctions-induced recession, the country braced for capital outflows {{for the first three}} months of 2014 to reach $70 billion, more than the entirety of outflows for 2013, and Russian government-bond issues plummeted by three-quarters compared with the same period the previous year. Novatek, Russia's second-largest gas producer, saw $2.5bn in market value wiped out when its shares sank by nearly 10%, rendering Putin's close friend Gennady Timchenko, who has a 23% stake in the company, $575m poorer. [...] "I do hope that there is some serious diplomatic activity <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes," [...] said one Russian banker, though others were more sanguine on the question of whether the sanctions would have any enduring effect, and Russians, top and bottom, seemed defiant. The official Russian response was mixed.|$|E
2500|$|Since Reichenau's {{order was}} widely {{understood}} as endorsing the mass killings of Ukrainian Jews which were <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> German lines, with which 6th Army {{at any rate}} was actively co-operating, Rundstedt's open endorsement of its strongly anti-Semitic language clearly contradicts his later assertions {{that he did not}} know what the Einsatzgruppen were doing. He told interrogators in 1946 that he was aware of just one atrocity, at Berdichev on 30 July. At Nuremberg he sought to portray the issue in terms of anti-partisan warfare: [...] "Disorderly, irregular warfare behind the front of the Army must bring very great misery to the population of the country affected. No army in the world can tolerate such conditions for any length of time, but in the interests of the security and protection of its own troops it must take sharp, energetic measures. But this should, of course, be done in a correct and soldierly manner." [...] Rundstedt shared the general German Army prejudice against the Ostjuden (Eastern Jews) found in the Soviet Union. He described Zamosc as [...] "a dirty Jewish hole." ...|$|E
2500|$|General Murray {{also worked}} for a {{division}} of Lockheed Skunk Works. He {{was assigned to the}} project development of [...] "The Black Missile". This was the first missile that was undetectable by radar. It was being built in a large tan-colored hangar located on the north corner of The Burbank Airport, located in Burbank, California. The hangar was owned by Lockheed Skunk Works Division. It was accessed via San Fernando Rd. This hangar was not the typical hangar. It was larger than normal and heavily guarded. There were no signs of what was really going on there. General Murray worked there daily, entering the door {{on the west side of}} the hangar. He explained, upon entering the hangar there was an enormous black curtain that was drawn across the center of the hangar, splitting the work space. He stayed on his side and the other workers stayed on their side. They never saw each other or looked beyond the curtain. General Murray was advised that the other side of the curtain contained a highly classified development, as his project wasn't classified enough. Years later, General Murray discovered what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> curtain. He was told the first stealth aircraft was in its early stages of development and testing. Murray declined to speak about which aircraft. The hangar was torn down in the year 2002, closing another door to an amazing piece of history.|$|E
