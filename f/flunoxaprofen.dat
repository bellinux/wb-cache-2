50|$|It {{has also}} been shown that <b>flunoxaprofen</b> {{inhibits}} leukotriene rather than prostaglandin synthesis. This is similar to benoxaprofen. <b>Flunoxaprofen</b> and benoxaprofen have been shown to have similar absorption characteristics. However, the distribution and elimination of <b>flunoxaprofen</b> {{has been shown to be}} much faster than benoxaprofen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunoxaprofen,</b> {{also known}} as Priaxim, is a chiral nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It {{is closely related to}} naproxen, which is also an NSAID. <b>Flunoxaprofen</b> has been shown to significantly improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The clinical use of <b>flunoxaprofen</b> has ceased due to concerns of potential hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|A {{structural}} analog of <b>flunoxaprofen</b> is benoxaprofen. The two {{drugs are}} carboxylic acid analogs that form reactive acyl glucurnonides. Benoxaprofen {{has been shown}} to be involved in rare hepatotoxicity. Because of this, benoxaprofen has been removed from the market. In response to this the clinical use of <b>flunoxaprofen</b> has also stopped, even though studies have shown that <b>flunoxaprofen</b> is less toxic than benoxaprofen.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>flunoxaprofen</b> {{has limited}} water-solubility, {{additional}} steps {{must be taken}} in order to prepare syrups, creams, suppositories, etc. In order to make <b>flunoxaprofen</b> water-soluble, yet still active and efficient, it must be mixed with lysine and then suspended in an organic solvent that is soluble in water. A salt will crystallize upon cooling. The salt must then be filtered out and dried. Pharmacological testing of this now water-soluble compound has shown that it has anti-inflammatory properties equal to <b>flunoxaprofen</b> by itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunoxaprofen</b> has two enantiomers. The {{absorption}} and siposition of both enantiomers {{were studied}} in 1988. No {{significant differences were}} seen between the absorption and elimination half-lives between the two. However, further {{studies have shown that}} the S-enantiomer is the active form of the drug. <b>Flunoxaprofen</b> is pharmacologically activated through biotransformation of the R-enantiomer to the S-enantiomer. This highly stereoselective chiral inversion is mediated by the FLX-S-Acyl-CoA thioester.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunoxaprofen</b> is a two-ring heterocyclic {{compound}} derived from benzoxazole. It {{also contains a}} fluorine atom and a propanoyl group.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} within the {{chemical}} structures of pharmaceutical drugs such as <b>flunoxaprofen.</b> Benzoxazole derivatives are also of interest for optical brighteners in laundry detergents. Benzoxazoles belong {{to the group of}} well-known antifungal agents with antioxidant, antiallergic, antitumoral and antiparasitic activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>flunoxaprofen</b> has been {{compared with those of}} Naproxen in rheumatoid arthritis patients to show that the two drugs have equivalent therapeutical effects. Both drugs significantly relieve spontaneous pain which occurs both during the day and at night. Both drugs also significantly relive the pain associated with active and passive motion and aid in relieving morning stiffness. The study also showed both drugs to be equally effective at improving grip strength.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flunoxaprofen</b> {{is a new}} nonsteroidal {{antiinflammatory}} agent that, like benoxaprofen, inhibits leukotriene {{rather than}} prostaglandin synthesis. The absorption and disposition kinetics of <b>flunoxaprofen</b> and benoxaprofen have been compared in six healthy volunteers after oral administration of 100 mg of each drug. The two drugs showed similar absorption characteristics, whereas the distribution and elimination processes were much faster for <b>flunoxaprofen.</b> The renal route of elimination appeared to contribute significantly less to the disposition of <b>flunoxaprofen.</b> These kinetic characteristics render less likely the risk of excessive drug accumulation with <b>flunoxaprofen,</b> especially {{in the presence of}} reduced renal function...|$|E
40|$|Six horses, {{both males}} and females between 7 and 10 years old, have been treated for 10 days by 1. 5 mg/kg of <b>Flunoxaprofen</b> taken orally. Notwithstanding the {{accumulation}} of the drug in the analyzed parenchyma, the resyults of researchers made during {{and at the end of}} the treatment do not show any modifications in homeometric values nor in hematochemical constants, both considered as expressions of the functionality of the liver and kidney. A progressive increase of <b>Flunoxaprofen</b> plasma levels in treated horses has been observed, as the administration is progressing. The Authors because of <b>Flunoxaprofen</b> cumulation, think better a reduction of dosage in long-term/therapy of subjects suffering with hepato-renal disease...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiments}} {{evaluated in}} rats {{the effects of}} prenatal and postnatal exposure to a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent, <b>flunoxaprofen</b> (5 - 10 and 20 mg/kg/day by the oral route), on cardiovascular function in the pups. In both conscious and anaesthetized rats pre- and postnatal <b>flunoxaprofen</b> exposure at the 30 th and 60 th day of age, significantly (P less than. 05) induced a decrease of pressor response to carotid-sinus baroreceptor stimulation and to L-noradrenaline (0. 1 - 1 and 5 micrograms/kg iv), and an increase of the hypotensive responses to L-isoprenaline (0. 01 - 0. 1 and 1 microgram/kg iv) and acetylcholine (0. 01 - 0. 1 and 1 microgram/kg iv). These effects were not observed in rats on the 90 th day of age. Moreover, pre- and postnatal <b>flunoxaprofen</b> exposure did not modify systolic arterial blood pressure of plasma levels of catecholamines and acetylcholinesterases. Our results also show that in normotensive rats <b>flunoxaprofen</b> exposure during pregnancy {{did not affect the}} body weight, systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate of pregnant rats. It did not affect the length of gestation, number of pups per litter or pup body weight. No macroscopic teratogenic effects were observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>flunoxaprofen</b> (FL) were {{investigated}} using anesthetized normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) {{young and old}} rats. The animals {{were divided into two}} groups. One group received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent at doses significantly inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) -cyclooxygenase; the other received no non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Oral pretreatment of anesthetized rats with <b>flunoxaprofen</b> (6. 6, 11. 5, and 19. 9 mg/kg/day in the feed for 560 days) significantly increased the following responses: occlusion of the common carotid arteries, and reactivity to L-noradrenaline (NA) (i. v.), and angiotensin II (Ang) (i. v.). Pressor responses also increased in normotensive and in SHR rats treated with FL (20 mg/kg/day for seven days). The effects were more intense in the SHR rats. Moreover, oral pretreatment of normotensive rats with FL (20 mg/kg/day for seven days) partially yet significantly reduced the antihypertensive activity of etozolin (ET), a diuretic and antihypertensive drug. Our data confirm the important role of prostaglandins in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, and an increase in arachidonic acid metabolite biosynthesis with vasodilatory effects being part of the mechanism of action of some antihypertensive drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} and disposition kinetics of the enantiomers of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug <b>flunoxaprofen</b> {{were studied}} in six healthy volunteers after oral administration of either R,S(+/-) -flunoxaprofen or R(-) -flunoxaprofen. The apparent {{values of the}} volume of distribution and systemic clearance of the S(+) -enantiomer were significantly lower than those of the R(-) -enantiomer. There {{was no significant difference in}} the absorption and elimination half-lives between the two isomers. The S(+) - to R(-) -isomer plasma concentration ratio increased with time with an apparent inversion half-time of about 50 h. This observation suggests metabolic inversion of R(-) - to S(+) -enantiomer, although the possibilities of stereoselective bioavailability or interaction between the two isomers can not be excluded...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flunoxaprofen</b> (FLX) is a chiral nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drug that}} was withdrawn from clinical use {{because of concerns}} of potential hepatotoxicity. FLX undergoes highly stereoselective chiral inversion mediated through the FLX-S-acyl-CoA thioester (FLX-CoA) {{in favor of the}} (R) -() -isomer. Acyl-CoA thioester deriv-atives of acidic drugs are chemically reactive species that are known to transacylate protein nucleophiles and glutathione (GSH). In this study, we investigated the relationship between the stereo-selective metabolism of (R) -() - and (S) -() -FLX to FLX-CoA and the subsequent transacylation of GSH forming FLX-S-acyl-gluta-thione (FLX-SG) in incubations with rat hepatocytes in suspension. Thus, when hepatocytes (2 million cells/ml) were treated with (R) -() - or (S) -() -FLX (100 M), both FLX-CoA and FLX-SG were detected by sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-trometry techniques.

40|$|Benoxaprofen (BNX), a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{that was}} withdrawn because of hepatotoxicity, is more toxic than its structural analog <b>flunoxaprofen</b> (FLX) in humans and rats. Acyl glucuronides have been hypothesized to be reactive metabolites {{and may be}} associated with toxicity. Both time- and concentration-dependent glucuronidation and covalent binding of BNX, FLX, and ibuprofen (IBP) were determined by exposing sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes to each NSAID. The levels of glucuronide and covalent protein adduct measured in cells followed the order BNX > FLX > IBP. These results indicate that 1) BNX-glucuronide (G) is more reactive than FLX-G, and 2) IBP-G is the least reactive metabolite, which support previous in vivo studies in rats. The proportional increases of protein adduct formation for BNX, FLX, and IBP as acyl glucuronidation increased also support the hypothesis that part of the covalent binding of all three NSAIDs to hepatic proteins is acyl glucuronide-dependent. Moreover, theses studies confirmed the feasibility of using sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes for studying glucuronidation and covalent binding to hepatocellular proteins. These studies also showed that these in vitro methods can be applied using human tissues for the study of acyl glucuronide reactivity. More BNX-protein adduct was formed in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes than FLX-protein adduct, which not only agreed with its relative toxicity in humans but also was consistent with the in vitro findings using rat hepatocyte cultures. These data support the use of sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes as an in vitro screening model of acyl glucuronide exposure and reactivity...|$|E

Thus, when hepatocytes (2 million cells/ml) were treated with (R) -(−) - or (S) -(+) -FLX (100 μM), both FLX-CoA and FLX-SG were detected by sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques. However, these derivatives were observed primarily from (R) -(−) -FLX incubation extracts, for which the formation rates of FLX-CoA and FLX-SG were rapid, reaching maximum concentrations of 42 and 2. 8 nM, respectively, after 6 min of incubation. Incubations with (S) -(+) -FLX over 60 min displayed 8. 1 and 2. 7 % as much FLX-CoA and FLX-SG area under the concentration versus time curves, respectively, compared with corresponding incubations with (R) -(−) -FLX. Coincubation of lauric acid (1000 μM) with (R) -(−) -FLX (10 μM) led to the complete inhibition of FLX-CoA formation and a 98 % inhibition of FLX-SG formation. Reaction of authentic (R,S) -FLX-CoA (2 μM) with GSH (10 mM) in buffer (pH 7. 4, 37 °C) showed the quantitative formation of FLX-SG after 3 h of incubation. Together, these results demonstrate the stereoselective transacylation of GSH in hepatocyte incubations containing (R) -(−) -FLX, which is consistent with bioactivation by stereoselective (R) -FLX-CoA formation...|$|E
