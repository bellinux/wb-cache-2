40|$|As {{a part of}} the <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> plume {{research}} program at the NASA Lewis Research Center, efforts have been initiated to analytically and experimentally investigate the plumes of resistojet thrusters. The method of G. A. Simons for the prediction of rocket exhaust plumes is developed for the resistojet.

Technological readiness {{has been demonstrated}} for 8 cm, 5 mN, and 30 cm, 30 mN electrostatic thrusters, with major use seen for GEO communications satellites in the near-term, and space station orbit adjustments later. Ion thrusters and/or MPD thrusters are projected to become viable if a space nuclear reactor system is operational in the 1990 s, allowing the transport of thousands of kilograms to the outer planets. Basic research is proceeding on the <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> concept to provide resistojet thrusters suitable for a space station by 1986, although the program is hindered by insufficient funding. A flight test for the ion auxiliary propulsion system is detailed, and test results of the solar electric rocket (SERT II) are reported.

40|$|Mission {{analyses}} were completed {{to show the}} benefits of low-power <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems for three classes'of LEO smallsat missions. Three different electrothermal systems were considered: (1) a 40 W ammonia resistojet system, (2) a 600 W hydrazine arcjet system, and (3) a 300 W ammonia resistojet. The benefits of using two 40 W ammonia resistojet systems were analyzed for three months of drag makeup of a Shuttle-launched 100 kg spacecraft in a 297 km orbit. The two 46 W resistojets decreased the propulsion system wet mass by 50 % when compared to state-of-art hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. The 600 W arcjet system was used for a 300 km sun synchronous makeup mission of a 1000 kg satellite and was found to decrease the wet propulsion mass by 30 %. Finally, the 300 W arcjet system was used on a 200 kg Earth-orbiting spacecraft for both orbit transfer from 300 to 400 km, two years of drag makeup, and a final orbit rise to 700 km. The arcjet system was determined to halve the propulsion system wet mass required for that scenario as compared to hydrazine monopropellant thrusters...|$|E
40|$|An <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> concept {{utilizing}} a microwave plasma system as the mechanism to convert electromagnetic energy into kinetic {{energy of a}} flowing gas is investigated. A calorimetry system enclosing a microwave plasma system has been developed to accurately measure the energy inputs and outputs of the microwave plasma system. The rate of energy transferred to the gas can be determined to within + or - 1. 8 W from an energy balance around the microwave plasma system. The percentage of the power absorbed by the microwave plasma system transferred to the hydrogen gas as it flows through the system is found to increase with the increasing flow rate, to decrease with the increasing pressure, and to be independent of the absorbed power. An upper bound for the hydrogen gas temperature is estimated from the energy content, heat capacity, and flow rate of the gas stream. A lower bound for an overall heat-transfer coefficient is then calculated, characterizing the energy loss from the hydrogen gas stream to the air cooling of the plasma discharge tube wall. The heat-transfer coefficient is found to increase with the increasing flow rate and pressure and to be independent of the absorbed power. This result indicates that a convective-type mechanism {{is responsible for the}} energy transfer...|$|E
40|$|Deep Space Industries (DSI) is {{developing}} a microspacecraft asteroid exploration mission named Prospector- 1. The goal of this mission is prospecting for resources, particularly water, extractable {{from the surface of}} a volatiles-rich target asteroid. This mission objective implies not just surveying the water content of the surface, but penetrating to subsurface depths as well. In addition to water reconnaissance, Prospector- 1 will also investigate the mineralogy and geotechnical characteristics of the asteroid using a proprietary instrument suite that is intended to be used on the asteroid surface. In addition to representing what will potentially be the first private interplanetary mission yet undertaken, it is also expected that Prospector- 1 will be the smallest and least expensive asteroid mission to date. The mission involves dispatching a small microspacecraft using all-chemical propulsion to an asteroid, followed by the use of water <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> for cruise, rendezvous, and proximity operations. A multi-week remote sensing campaign will map the surface and subsurface in visible and mid-wave infrared bands, in parallel with the generation of a water map of the asteroid at near-subsurface levels. Finally, the spacecraft will attempt to land on the asteroid surface to assess geotechnical characteristics of potential resource extraction sites, as well as to assert a presence and establish the first commercial base on a space object. This mission is being developed with an aggressive cost-cap in the tens of millions of USD and a schedule in single-digit years...|$|E
40|$|The RF plasma {{thruster}} has considerable {{potential to}} ease the impact of severe constraints on power, mass, volume and lifetime of microsatellite propulsion systems. This concept is classified as an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> system and exploits RF capacitively coupled discharge (RFCCD) for heating of a propellant. The plasma is characterized as a low-power discharge possessing a low-current density with high uniformity and propagating through low-pressure gas. To assess computationally the thruster’s propulsive capabilities {{as a function of}} mass flow rate, electrode separation, RF frequency and power input, a numerical model comprises particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo (PIC/MCC) and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithms. Thruster performance is investigated by permuting electrode geometry (0. 5 - 2 cm), chamber pressure (0. 05 - 50 Torr), applied voltage (100 - 500 V), and frequency (10 - 1000 MHz). For this parameter space, PIC/MCC determines overall trends in plasma characteristics. One selected case (3 Torr, 500 V, 200 MHz) and its set of conditions (plasma density, plasma heating, gas temperature, etc.) form the basis for an in-depth flow field and thrust performance analysis with DSMC. Assuming adiabatic wall conditions, the RF plasma thruster achieves a specific impulse of 104. 4 s with Argon at the throat Reynolds number of 25. The RF heating increases the specific impulse by 125 %. This study shows that propulsive capability of the RF plasma thruster can be enhanced by increasing the discharge chamber length, redesigning the nozzle contour, and using propellants with lower molecular weights...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-induced}} molecular contamination {{around the}} space station could have adverse effects on space station components (for example solar panels) as well as scientific experiments that might be done on or near {{the space station}}. Aerospace engineers need to design a space station (SS) propulsion system that keeps the SS in a stable orbit {{and at the same time}} does not allow the propellant gases to interfere with the experiments of the user. One scenario that might accomplish the above requirements is to use an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> system, resistojet, that will thrust continuously in the hundreds of milli-Newton range which will provide a constant altitude for the SS with a low g environment. As a first attempt to understand the contamination from such a propulsion system, a point source model was developed. The numerical results of the point source model are given. Number column densities for CO 2 are presented as a function of direction of observation (line of sight), temperature of the exit gas, and mean exit velocity. All the results are for a constant exhaust rate of 5, 000 kg/year. In addition, a mathematical model to study the effect of nozzle design on the induced molecular environment around the space station produced by simple gas propellants is described. The mathematical model would allow one to follow the expansion of the gas from the throat of a nozzle to the nozzle exit plane and then into the space external to the nozzle...|$|E
