25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} close spacing between the heads and the disk surface, HDDs {{are vulnerable to}} being damaged by a <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> – {{a failure of the}} disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss. Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, corrosion, or poorly manufactured platters and heads.|$|E

Then the door he had been making for swung back, and he knew he had another {{antagonist}} to deal with.

He felt his knuckles jar and heard the fellow's <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> against the vestibule, but the other seized him as he turned. Foster surmised that they feared the report of a pistol but might use the knife, and determined to throw the fellow down the steps. If this proved impossible, he must try to jump off the train.|$|E

50|$|A {{feature of}} the 655 drives was 12 read / write heads per surface. This reduced track to track {{movement}} and thus access times. However, this meant that there were 12 times more heads per drive, further increasing the likelihood of <b>head</b> <b>crashes.</b> These flying <b>heads</b> were moved using a 16 position magnetic actuator. The actuator used four different magnets to create the 16 positions. The magnetic actuators were later replaced with hydraulic actuators and later yet the hydraulic actuators were replaced with voice coil actuators. Later NCR used disk units from other manufacturers, who had significantly reduced <b>head</b> <b>crashes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{most notorious}} cause of drive failure is a <b>head</b> <b>crash,</b> where the {{internal}} read-and-write {{head of the}} device, usually just hovering above the surface, touches a platter, or scratches the magnetic data-storage surface. A <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> usually incurs severe data loss, and data recovery attempts may cause further damage if not done by a specialist with proper equipment. Drive platters are coated with an extremely thin layer of non-electrostatic lubricant, so that the read-and-write head will simply glance off {{the surface of the}} platter should a collision occur. However, this head hovers mere nanometers from the platter's surface which makes a collision an acknowledged risk. Another cause of failure is a faulty air filter. The air filters on today's drives equalize the atmospheric pressure and moisture between the drive enclosure and its outside environment. If the filter fails to capture a dust particle, the particle can land on the platter, causing a <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> if the head happens to sweep over it. After a <b>head</b> <b>crash,</b> particles from the damaged platter and head media can cause one or more bad sectors. These, in addition to platter damage, will quickly render a drive useless. A drive also includes controller electronics, which occasionally fail. In such cases, {{it may be possible to}} recover all data.|$|E

5000|$|A {{firmware}} update introduced wear levelling which avoids the heads dwelling too long {{over the same}} area thereby reducing the potential for <b>head</b> <b>crashes.</b> [...] The same {{firmware update}} also fixed a possible data corruption due to a problem with S.M.A.R.T. background operations.|$|R
50|$|Hardware and {{software}} failure {{are the two}} main causes for data loss. Background radiation, <b>head</b> <b>crashes,</b> and aging or wear of the storage device fall into the former category, while software failure typically occurs due to bugs in the code.Cosmic rays cause most soft errors in DRAM.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 655 {{removable}} disc drives {{were the}} first to employ floating or flying heads. Early marketing material made a big deal of this, but {{there were a number of}} problems that plagued all of the Century Series systems. Head crashes were common, because the head flew less than a human hair's width above the disc surface. (Unless a drive unit was repaired and carefully cleaned after a crash, the next disc pack loaded in that drive would also crash. And, if a crashed disc pack was loaded on an operational drive, it would destroy the head on that drive unit. Contributing to this was the fact that disc packs were hand-loaded: spun tight onto a spindle, then uncovered by hand, in open air, before the drive cover was closed. A <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> could be caused merely by repeatedly bumping the smoked polycarbonate pack cover against the edge of a disc platter while lifting it off. Although the typical <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> ruined heads and the pack, the worst kind of <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> was caused by an entire pack coming loose from its spindle and rising freely inside the machine while spinning at high speeds!) ...|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the system}} {{consists}} of accelerometers that alert the system when excess acceleration or vibration is detected. The software then tells the hard disk to unload its heads {{to prevent them}} from coming in contact with the platter, thus potentially preventing <b>head</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{hard disk}} failure may {{occur in the}} course of normal operation, or due to an {{external}} factor such as exposure to fire or water or high magnetic fields, or suffering a sharp impact or environmental contamination, which can lead to a <b>head</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{failures}} can cause physical damage to storage media, which may result from human errors and natural disasters. CD-ROMs can have their metallic substrate or dye layer scratched off; hard disks can suffer any of several mechanical failures, such as <b>head</b> <b>crashes</b> and failed motors; tapes can simply break.|$|R

50|$|Physical {{damage to}} a hard drive, even in cases where a <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> has occurred, does not {{necessarily}} mean there will be permanent loss of data.

50|$|The drive spins a PET film {{floppy disk}} at about 3000 rpm, 1 µm over a {{read-write}} head, using Bernoulli's principle {{to pull the}} flexible disk towards the head {{as long as the}} disk is spinning.

50|$|The drives {{were known}} for {{an unusually high}} rate of <b>head</b> <b>crashes,</b> due to the {{magnetic}} coating soon beginning to loosen and sprinkle off from the platters, creating dust in the hard disk array and leading to crashes over {{large areas of the}} platters. The combination of two technologies, GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistive) heads on 3.5-inch glass platters, are said to be largely to blame for the issues.|$|R

50|$|A <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> is a hard-disk {{failure that}} occurs when a {{read-write}} head of a hard disk drive comes in contact with its rotating platter, resulting in permanent and usually irreparable damage to the magnetic media on the platter surface.

5000|$|In a hard drive, {{the heads}} 'fly' above the disk surface with {{clearance}} of {{as little as}} 3 nanometres.

The role of the air bearing is to maintain the flying height constant as the head moves over the surface of the disk. If the head hits the disk's surface, a catastrophic <b>head</b> <b>crash</b> can result.|$|E
50|$|A {{free-fall}} sensor (FFS) is an accelerometer used {{to detect}} if a system has been dropped and is falling.

This device is included in the many common computer and consumer electronic products that are produced by a variety of manufacturers. It is also used in some data loggers to monitor handling operations for shipping containers. The length of time in free fall is used to calculate the height of drop and to estimate the shock to the package.|$|E
40|$|This paper details {{part of a}} {{research}} program conducted to examine the potential effect of autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems on common crash types that involve a frontal collision. To accomplish this, simulations were conducted of 103 real world crashes. AEB system models with differing specifications were applied to these simulations to determine the change in impact speed that various AEB interventions could produce. It was found that AEB systems {{have the potential to}} reduce the impact speed, and hence the severity, in pedestrian crashes, right turn <b>crashes,</b> <b>head</b> on <b>crashes,</b> rear end crashes and hit fixed object crashes. The greatest potential reductions were for pedestrian <b>crashes,</b> <b>head</b> on <b>crashes</b> and rear end crashes. The variations in system specification demonstrate the advantages of a longer time-to-collision and higher autonomous deceleration. A system that has less potential to generate false alarms than the other systems was considered and demonstrated potential for reducing the impact speed in pedestrian, head on, rear end and hit fixed object crashes.
