In comparison to earlier models found in the literature this model is more detailed, hierarchical and includes more modelling constructs (activities, <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> <b>controls,</b> mechanisms). Method. logy. The modelling methodology used is IDEF 0, a process modelling method, which previously has mainly been used for business process reengineering in the manufacturing industry.

The scope of the model is the whole communication value chain, from initial research to the assimilation of research results to improve every-day life. The model treats both informal and formal communication, as well as the publishing of data, but the major focus is on modelling the publishing and indexing of traditional peer reviewed journal articles, as well as the activities of readers to find out about them and access them.

40|$|MAG (an Italian acronym {{which stands}} for Musical Genetic Algorithms) is an {{electronic}} art piece in which a multifaceted software attempts to “translate ” musical expression into a corresponding static or animated graphical expressions. The mechanism {{at the base of}} such “translation ” consists in a quite complex and articulated algorithm that, in short, is based on artificial learning. Indeed, MAG implements different learning techniques to allow artificial agents to learn about music flow by developing an adaptive behaviour. In our specific case, such a technique consists of a population of neural networks – one dimensional artificial agents that populate their two dimensional artificial world, and which are served by a simple <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>control</b> system – that can use both genetic and reinforcement learning algorithms to evolve appropriate behavioural answers to an impressively large shapes of inputs, through both a fitness formula based genetic pressure, and, eventually, a user-machine based feedbacks. More closely, in the first version of MAG algorithm the agents ’ control system is a perceptron; the world of the agents is a two dimensional grid that changes its dimensions accordingly to the host-screen; the most important input artificial agents get (i. e. not necessarily the only one) is the musical wave that any given musical file produces, run-time; the output is the behavioural answer that agents produce by moving, and thereby drawing on to a computer screen, therefore graphical.

40|$|Workload Control is a {{production}} planning and control concept developed for high-variety job shops. It integrates two control mechanisms: (i) input control, {{to regulate the}} inflow of work to the system; and (ii) <b>output</b> <b>control,</b> which uses capacity adjustments to regulate the outflow of work from the system. Much Workload Control {{research has focused on}} <b>input</b> <b>control,</b> while <b>output</b> <b>control</b> has been largely neglected. Only recently has research emerged that uses Workload Control theory to guide capacity adjustments. Yet this literature focuses on capacity adjustments (<b>output</b> <b>control)</b> only – it fails to integrate it with Workload Control’s input control element. In response, this study explores the performance impact of Workload Control when input control (controlled order release) and <b>output</b> <b>control</b> (capacity adjustments) are combined. Job shop simulation results demonstrate that <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>control</b> can and should play complementary roles. Both elements significantly enhance performance in isolation, and performance effects appear to complement each other. Further, results indicate that the choice of the workload threshold that triggers capacity adjustments has a stronger impact on performance than the actual size of the adjustment. The measure of workload used to guide the load-based order release decision is also used to determine the workload threshold that triggers the capacity adjustment. This facilitates implementation in practice. Finally, although our study is on Workload Control, the findings have important implications for other production planning and control concepts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis applies multivariable Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) {{control design}} methodologies to provide {{simultaneous}} isolation {{of an active}} mirror mount in multi-ple directions. To achieve this goal, three single <b>input</b> single <b>output</b> (SISO) <b>control</b> designs are implemented to determine the achievable performance {{in each of the}} di-rections of interest while neglecting the dynamical coupling within the active mount. It is shown that, in general, attempts to isolate in any one direction by itself leads to amplification of the disturbance in the other directions. In addition, a multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> (MIMO) <b>control</b> design which incorporates full knowledge of the active mount coupling, and attempts to get simultaneous performance in all di-rections, is designed and implemented.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new tool for facilitating the diagnosis of logistic improvement opportunities in make-to-order (MTO) companies. Competitiveness of these companies increasingly imposes needs upon delivery reliability. In order to achieve high delivery reliability, both the average lateness and the variance of lateness of orders need to be controlled. A good diagnosis tool should make a link between performance on these two aspects and production planning and control (PPC) decisions. PPC decisions can relate to input control (order acceptance/delivery date promising, order release and priority dispatching) or <b>output</b> <b>control</b> (adjusting capacities). For a diagnosis related to the average lateness, a well-developed supportive tool is available: the throughput diagram. By using industrial data we show that the throughput diagram can help to gain insight into the consequences of <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>control</b> decisions across time. Tools for facilitating the diagnosis of the variance of lateness in a similar way have not been published in literature. In order to fill this gap, the order progress diagram has been developed in this research. It helps to relate the variance of lateness to disturbances in order to progress and to uneven flow patterns. The diagram indicates the difference between the progress of an individual order and the average progress pattern of orders for different stages of the process. Thus it shows where due date deviations emerge. Similar to the throughput diagram, it links performance to the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>control</b> decisions mentioned. Its added value is illustrated by industrial data. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
