50|$|<b>Fenoterol</b> is a β2 {{adrenoreceptor}} agonist {{designed to}} open up the airways to the lungs. It is classed as sympathomimetic β2 agonist and asthma medication.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{combined}} with salbutamol (albuterol — USAN) under the trade names Combivent (metered-dose inhaler or MDI) and Duoneb (nebulizer) {{for the management}} of COPD and asthma, and with <b>fenoterol</b> (trade names Duovent and Berodual N) {{for the management of}} asthma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenoterol</b> is a short-acting β2 agonist, {{which also}} stimulates β1 receptors at doses above the {{recommended}} therapeutic doses. It was {{widely used in}} New Zealand in the early 1990s but withdrawn from that market because of its association with an excess number of deaths.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-(1-Hydroxy-2-{2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylethylamino}ethyl)benzene-1,3-diol is a {{molecule}} with two different stereogenic centers. Thus, four stereoisomers may exist, the (R,R)-, (R,S)-, (S,R)- and (S,S)-stereoisomers (see the figure below). <b>Fenoterol</b> is a racemate of the (R,R)- and the (S,S)-enantiomers. This racemate is 9 to 20 times more effective, {{as compared to}} the racemate of the (R,S)- and (S,R)-enantiomers.|$|E
50|$|Once {{bound to}} a β2 receptor, an olodaterol {{molecule}} stays there for hours — its dissociation half-life is 17.8 hours —, {{which allows for}} once-a-day application of the drug like with indacaterol. Other related compounds generally have a shorter duration of action {{and have to be}} applied twice daily (e.g. formoterol, salmeterol). Still others (e. g. salbutamol/аlbuterol, <b>fenoterol)</b> have to be applied {{three or four times a}} day for continuous action, which can also be an advantage for patients who need to apply β2 agonists only occasionally, for example in an asthma attack.|$|E

50|$|In 1967, it {{was shown}} that the β2-receptor was {{responsible}} for bronchodilation and this led to development of more selective drugs. In 1961 orciprenaline, a longer acting β2-agonist was found, {{but it was not}} as potent as isoproterenol. Orciprenaline does not have the catechol structure which was the reason for the longer action time. In the mid-1960s, albuterol or salbutamol was discovered, followed by terbutalin and <b>fenoterol</b> a few years later. Albuterol and terbutaline gave fewer side effects, such as increased heart rate, than isoproterenol. The pharmaceutical company Glaxo discovered salmeterol, a long-acting β2-agonist that had bronchodilation activity for up to 12 hours. It was marketed in 1990. Formoterol, another long-acting β2-agonist, was marketed shortly after. This long duration of action made the treatment for severe asthma and COPD more convenient for the patients because it is inhaled twice a day.In 2013 an extra long-acting β2-agonist, vilanterol, was marketed. Its duration of action lasts for 24 hours which should improve patients' compliance and make the treatment more convenient.|$|E
40|$|Nine {{patients}} with reversible obstructive airways disease were studied {{to compare the}} bronchodilator response {{to a combination of}} <b>fenoterol</b> and ipratropium aerosols with two dose levels of <b>fenoterol</b> alone. Using a double-blind, cross-over, single dose regime, 200 micrograms <b>fenoterol</b> hydrobromide and 80 micrograms ipratropium bromide was compared to 400 micrograms <b>fenoterol</b> + placebo, and to 200 micrograms <b>fenoterol</b> + placebo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reason for}} the {{association}} of increased risk of death with <b>fenoterol</b> in patients with asthma in New Zealand is unknown but may relate to its cardiovascular effects. Most deaths from asthma occur outside hospital, where hypoxaemia {{is likely to be}} a complicating factor. The cardiovascular effects of <b>fenoterol</b> have been investigated therefore under conditions of normoxaemia and hypoxaemia. METHOD: Eight healthy men were studied on two occasions. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, total electromechanical systole (QS 2 I), electrocardiographic QTc interval, cardiac index, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were made under conditions of normoxaemia and hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation 90 %) before and after administration of 800 micrograms of <b>fenoterol</b> by a metered dose inhaler. The order in which treatments were applied was according to a Latin square design. RESULTS: Before inhalation of <b>fenoterol</b> hypoxaemia was associated with a significant increase in heart rate (8 beats/min) and QTc interval (15. 6 ms). Under conditions of normoxaemia <b>fenoterol</b> caused a significant increase in heart rate (14. 3 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (7. 7 mm Hg), stroke volume (27. 7 ml), cardiac index (1. 6 1 /min/m 2), ejection fraction (11. 48), and QTc interval (32. 9 ms) and a fall in QS 2 I (- 23. 2 ms) and diastolic blood pressure (- 8. 4 mm Hg). Under conditions of hypoxaemia the changes after inhalation of <b>fenoterol</b> were similar to those recorded during normoxaemia; thus the effects of hypoxaemia and <b>fenoterol</b> were additive (heart rate 21. 9 beats/min, QTc 43. 5 ms with <b>fenoterol</b> and hypoxaemia). CONCLUSION: The chronotropic and electrophysiological effects of <b>fenoterol</b> were enhanced by conditions of hypoxaemia...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It has {{previously}} been shown that <b>fenoterol,</b> a beta 2 adrenergic agonist, increases the ventilatory response to hypoxia (HVR) and hypercapnia (HCVR) in normal subjects. The effects of beta 2 adrenergic agonists on chemoreceptors in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) remain controversial. This study was designed to examine whether <b>fenoterol</b> increases the HVR and HCVR in patients with COPD. METHODS: The HCVR was tested in 20 patients using a rebreathing method and the HVR was examined using a progressive isocapnic hypoxic method. The HCVR and HVR were assessed by calculating the slopes of plots of occlusion pressure (P 0. 1) and ventilation (VE) against end tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PETCO 2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2), respectively. Spirometric values, lung volumes, and respiratory muscle strength were also measured. The HCVR and HVR were examined after the oral administration of <b>fenoterol</b> (15 mg/day) or placebo for seven days. RESULTS: <b>Fenoterol</b> treatment increased the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and inspiratory muscle strength. In the HCVR the slope of P 0. 1 versus PETCO 2 was increased by <b>fenoterol</b> from 0. 35 (0. 23) to 0. 43 (0. 24) (p < 0. 01). Moreover, the P 0. 1 at PETCO 2 of 8 kPa was higher on <b>fenoterol</b> than on placebo (p < 0. 05) and the VE was also greater (p < 0. 01). In the HVR <b>fenoterol</b> treatment increased the P 0. 1 at 80 % SaO 2 from 0. 90 (0. 72) to 0. 97 (0. 55) kPa (p < 0. 05) while the slopes of the response of P 0. 1 and VE were not changed. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fenoterol</b> increases the ventilatory response to hypercapnia in patients with COPD, presumably by stimulation of the central chemoreceptor. The hypoxic ventilatory response is only slightly affected by <b>fenoterol.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The time {{course of}} changes in plasma cyclic AMP, heart rate and {{bronchial}} tone after inhalation of <b>fenoterol</b> or isoprenaline from a dose-metered aerosol are reported {{in a group of}} normal subjects. After isoprenaline, plasma cyclic AMP increased rapidly reaching a peak by 10 min and returned to basal levels within 60 min. A rapid, transient rise in heart rate occurred that was maximal by 5 min and returned to a basal level by 45 min. After <b>fenoterol,</b> the changes in cyclic AMP and heart rate were of much longer duration. The rise in plasma cyclic AMP was slower in onset and of greater magnitude than for isoprenaline, reaching a peak by 20 min and remaining above basal level for more than 6 h. The maximum increase in heart rate after <b>fenoterol</b> was less than that observed with isoprenaline but an elevated rate persisted for 4 h after inhalation of <b>fenoterol.</b> <b>Fenoterol</b> is known to have a longer duration of action as a bronchodilator in comparison with isoprenaline. The prolonged rise in plasma cyclic AMP in normal subjects given inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> may reflect this long duration of action. The concomitant rise in heart rate, however, suggests that the duration of plasma cyclic AMP response may in part be due to the systemic effect of the fraction of inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> known to be absorbed via the buccal and intestinal routes...|$|E
40|$|The airway {{response}} and cardiovascular and hypokalaemic effects of <b>fenoterol,</b> salbutamol, and terbutaline given in multiples of standard doses from metered-dose inhalers were studied in ten patients with mild asthma. In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study the subjects received 2, 6, and 18 puffs of each drug with intervals of 90 min, and {{forced expiratory volume}} in 1 s, heart rate, QTc interval, plasma potassium concentration, tremor, and bronchial reactivity to histamine were measured. All three drugs produced similar bronchodilatation. However, the rises in heart rate, QTc interval, and tremor and the fall in plasma potassium were greater after <b>fenoterol</b> than after salbutamol or terbutaline. The maximum mean (SD) increases in heart rate for <b>fenoterol,</b> salbutamol, and terbutaline were 29 (24) bpm, 8 (9) bpm, and 8 (14) bpm, respectively; falls in plasma potassium were 0. 76 (0. 62) mmol/l, 0. 46 (0. 32) mmol/l, and 0. 52 (0. 39) mmol/l, respectively. <b>Fenoterol</b> afforded no additional protection against histamine compared with salbutamol. These findings suggest that at doses based on those used in clinical practice <b>fenoterol</b> causes more adverse effects than salbutamol or terbutaline. The most likely explanation for these effects is that <b>fenoterol</b> has been marketed at a higher dose than the other beta 2 -agonists; <b>fenoterol</b> may in addition be less selective for beta 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if transdermal penetration of <b>fenoterol,</b> a β-agonist drug, could be enhanced and controlled by formulation modification and formulation of transdermal patches. Pre-formulation studies were performed to determine the feasibility of a transdermal dosage form of <b>fenoterol.</b> Penetration of <b>fenoterol</b> was determined using the hairless guinea pig skin with unjacketed Franz diffusion cell. Transdermal patches were formulated using drug in-adhesive technique. Several enhancers were investigated for <b>fenoterol</b> skin penetration. Transcutol–oleic acid co-solvent gives the highest drug flux among all tested liquid formulations. Pretreatment of the skin with oleic acid 2 h before patch application significantly increases drug diffusion. Cis-oleic acid gives best results compared to oleic acid. Azone derivative (1 -dodecyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone) gives the highest drug diffusion amongst all tested enhancers. Results of this study show the feasibility of using <b>fenoterol</b> formulated in transdermal delivery system in the treatment of chronic asthma to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduce the inter-subject variability...|$|E
40|$|The {{bronchodilator}} potencies of inhaled atropine sulphate and {{atropine methonitrate}} have been compared either {{alone or in}} combination with <b>fenoterol</b> {{in a group of}} adult asthmatic patients. A cumulative dose response study showed that 2 mg of atropine sulphate produced near maximum bronchodilatation. A larger dose of 4 mg was used in comparing the potency of this drug with 2 mg of atropine methonitrate, a dose previously shown to produce optimum bronchodilatation. In a randomised double-blind fashion atropine methonitrate (2 mg), atropine sulphate (4 mg), <b>fenoterol</b> (400 μg), a combination of atropine methonitrate with <b>fenoterol,</b> a combination of atropine sulphate with <b>fenoterol,</b> and two placebos were administered by inhalation on separate days to eight stable adult asthmatics. Measurements of FEV 1 were made before administration of the drugs and at 20 minutes, one, two, four, and six hours afterwards. The two atropine drugs produced a similar peak effect but the bronchodilatation after atropine methonitrate was more prolonged. In combination the bronchodilatation achieved with both atropine drugs and <b>fenoterol</b> was greater than with either atropine or <b>fenoterol</b> alone, confirming that atropine and an adrenergic drug can have an additive effect. The response with atropine methonitrate and <b>fenoterol</b> showed {{a significant increase in the}} FEV 1 for six hours whereas with atropine sulphate and <b>fenoterol</b> the increase of FEV 1 was significantly greater than the placebo for only four hours. It was concluded that the atropine drugs produce useful bronchodilatation either alone or in combination with an adrenergic agent. Of the two atropine drugs, the methonitrate appears to be superior to the sulphate as an inhaled bronchodilator in adult asthmatics...|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} <b>fenoterol,</b> a uterine relaxant of the {{adrenergic}} beta-mimetic group of drugs, {{has been investigated}} on placental, myometrial, and cardiac blood pools. 113 mIndium was injected intravenously and the blood pools were measured by recording gamma activity externally. In eight cases with oxytocin-induced labor, <b>fenoterol</b> inhibited the typical blood pool changes of labor, i. e., contraction-synchronized decrease of placental and myometrial blood pools with increase in cardiac blood pool. Furthermore, <b>fenoterol</b> produced an increase in placental and myometrial pools with corresponding decrease of cardiac blood pool. These changes were observed consistently. In four other cases, of which three had spontaneous labor, similar effects were observed. The possible mechanisms of hemodynamic action of <b>fenoterol,</b> with reference to uterine relaxation, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] There is {{controversy}} as to {{the relative}} safety of <b>fenoterol</b> and salbutamol. No differences {{have been found in}} the relative cardiac beta 1 /beta 2 receptor activity of inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> and salbutamol in normal subjects. These initial findings have been extended by comparing the respective potencies of equivalent doses by weight of <b>fenoterol</b> and salbutamol in asthmatic subjects, in terms of airways and systemic responses. METHODS [...] Eighteen asthmatic patients of mean (SD) age 40 (14) years and a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) % predicted of 56 (14) % (1. 97 (0. 66) 1) were randomised to inhale <b>fenoterol</b> (100 micrograms/puff or 200 micrograms/puff), salbutamol, or placebo (100 micrograms/puff or 200 micrograms/puff) on three separate days. Dose-response curves were constructed using cumulative doses of 100 micrograms, 200 micrograms, 400 micrograms, 1000 micrograms, 2000 micrograms, and 4000 micrograms, and airways and systemic responses were measured 20 minutes after each dose with 40 minute increments. Dose ratios for the relative potency of <b>fenoterol</b> versus salbutamol were calculated from the dose-response curves using regression analysis of parallel slopes. RESULTS [...] There was no difference in bronchodilator potency between <b>fenoterol</b> and salbutamol (as median dose ratio) : FEV 1 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 4 to 4. 6). In contrast, dose ratios for systemic responses showed that <b>fenoterol</b> was more potent than salbutamol: serum potassium 3. 7 (95 % CI 2. 0 to 6. 0), tremor 5. 7 (95 % CI 1. 4 to 10. 2), heart rate 1. 6 (95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 3). At a conventional dose of 200 micrograms the only difference in response between the two drugs was observed for tremor (as mean difference) : 0. 23 log units (95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 41 log units). CONCLUSIONS [...] There was no difference in the bronchodilator potency between <b>fenoterol</b> and salbutamol on a microgram equivalent basis. In contrast, systemic potency was greater with <b>fenoterol,</b> although this difference was not clinically relevant at conventional dosages up to 200 micrograms...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of concurrent beta 1 -adrenoceptor blocker or calcium channel antagonist administration on the haemodynamic sequelae of an inhaled beta 2 -selective adrenoceptor agonist bronchodilator, we examined echocardiographically the effects of <b>fenoterol</b> (400 micrograms) by metered dose inhaler following oral pre-treatment with (a) placebo, (b) atenolol or (c) diltiazem. Following placebo, <b>fenoterol</b> produced significant decreases in diastolic blood pressure (14 % +/- 6 %), total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) (31 % +/- 9 %) and end-systolic stress (ESS) (15 % +/- 21 %). Cardiac output rose significantly (42 % +/- 23 %) as did heart rate (25 % +/- 13 %). After atenolol, responses to <b>fenoterol</b> were significantly blunted. Post-fenoterol heart rate, systolic blood pressure, % fractional shortening, stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output and pressure/volume ratio increased significantly less after atenolol pre-treatment as compared to placebo pretreatment. TPR decreased significantly less. After diltiazem pre-treatment, the response to inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> was not different from that following placebo pre-treatment. We conclude that atenolol blunts the haemodynamic changes induced by <b>fenoterol</b> inhalation whereas diltiazem has little effect...|$|E
40|$|Agonists at β 2 adrenoceptors {{are used}} widely as {{bronchodilators}} in treating bronchial asthma. These agents {{also may have}} important anti-inflammatory effects on eosinophils in asthma. We examined whether widely prescribed β 2 -adrenoceptor agonists differ in ability to suppress stimulus-induced eosinophil effector functions such as superoxide anion (O 2 −) generation and degranulation. To examine involvement of cellular adhesion in such responses, we also investigated effects of β 2 agonists on cellular adhesion and on CD 11 b expression by human eosinophils. O 2 − was measured using chemiluminescence. Eosinophil degranulation and adhesion were assessed by a radioimmunoassay for eosinophil protein X (EPX). CD 11 b expression was measured by flow cytometry. <b>Fenoterol</b> inhibited platelet-activating factor (PAF) -induced O 2 − generation by eosinophils significantly more than salbutamol or procaterol. <b>Fenoterol</b> partially inhibited PAF-induced degranulation by eosinophils similarly to salbutamol or procaterol. <b>Fenoterol</b> inhibited phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -induced O 2 − generation and degranulation by eosinophils, while salbutamol or procaterol did not. <b>Fenoterol</b> inhibition of PMA-induced O 2 − generation was not reversed by ICI- 118551, a selective β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist. <b>Fenoterol,</b> but not salbutamol or procaterol, significantly inhibited PAF-induced eosinophil adhesion. <b>Fenoterol</b> inhibited O 2 − generation and degranulation more effectively than salbutamol or procaterol; these effects may include a component involving cellular adhesion.

In rats, the age-related decrease in the maximal rate of relaxation is reversed after 4 -wk administration with the β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist (β 2 -agonist) <b>fenoterol.</b> Given the critical role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in regulating intracellular Ca 2 + transients and ultimately the time course of muscle contraction and relaxation, we tested the hypothesis that the mechanisms of action of <b>fenoterol</b> are mediated by alterations in SR proteins. Sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) kinetic properties were assessed in muscle homogenates and enriched SR membranes isolated from the red (RG) and white (WG) portions of the gastrocnemius muscle in adult (16 mo) and aged (28 mo) F 344 rats that had been administered <b>fenoterol</b> for 4 wk (1. 4 mg/kg/day ip, in saline) or vehicle only.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the dose related effects of <b>fenoterol</b> and {{salbutamol}} on cardiac beta 1 and beta 2 receptors using the beta 1 selective antagonist atenolol, in order to dissect out relative beta 1 /beta 2 mediated responses. METHODS [...] Fourteen normal volunteers were randomised to receive pretreatment with either atenolol 25 mg or placebo, followed by inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> or salbutamol in equal doses by weight (cumulative doses of 1 mg and 4 mg). Measurements were made 30 minutes after inhaling each dose of beta 2 agonist. Values (mean and 95 % CI) were expressed as a change from baseline. RESULTS [...] At 4 mg <b>fenoterol</b> produced equivalent falls in serum potassium and increases in tremor to salbutamol. The mean (95 % CI) increase in heart rate (beats/min) with <b>fenoterol</b> at 4 mg after placebo was 47 (41 - 53) and after atenolol was 34 (28 - 40), with values for salbutamol being 46 (40 - 52) after placebo and 30 (24 - 36) after atenolol. The inotropic response (stroke distance) after atenolol at the 4 mg dose was 5. 0 (3. 9 - 6. 1) cm for <b>fenoterol</b> and 4. 7 (3. 5 - 5. 9) cm for salbutamol. There were no significant differences in heart rate or stroke distance response between the two drugs after either placebo or atenolol. Furthermore, ECG effects (Q-Tc and T wave) of <b>fenoterol</b> and salbutamol were comparable at both doses.

Untreated old rats exhibited a loss of skeletal muscle mass and a decrease in force-producing capacity, in both fast and slow muscles, compared with adult rats(P < 0. 05). However, there was no age-associated decrease in skeletal muscle β-adrenoceptor density, nor was the muscle response to chronic β-agonist stimulation reduced with age. Thus, muscle mass and force-producing capacity of EDL and soleus muscles from old rats treated with <b>fenoterol</b> was equivalent to, or greater than, untreated adult rats. The increase in mass and strength was attributed to a non-selective increase in the cross-sectional area of all muscle fibre types, in both the EDL and soleus. <b>Fenoterol</b> treatment caused a small increase in fatiguability due to a decrease in oxidative metabolism in both EDL and soleus muscles, with some cardiac hypertrophy. Further studies are needed to fully separate the desirable effects on skeletal muscle and the undesirable effects on the heart. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that <b>fenoterol</b> is a powerful anabolic agent that can restore muscle mass and strength in old rats, and provide preliminary evidence of therapeutic potential for age-related muscle wasting and weakness...|$|E
40|$|Beta {{adrenergic}} agents {{given by}} aerosol decrease the responsiveness of the airways to histamine and methacholine {{in subjects with}} asthma, causing a shift of the dose response curve to the right. To {{find out whether the}} shift is related to the dose of beta adrenergic agent given and to determine the duration of the reduced responsiveness, eight subjects with asthma were given histamine inhalation tests after inhaled saline and after increasing doses of inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> on different days. The histamine inhalation tests were repeated at hourly intervals for five hours after a selected dose of <b>fenoterol.</b> <b>Fenoterol</b> caused a dose related shift {{to the right of the}} histamine dose response curve in each subject and in some the dose response relationship reached the "non-symptomatic range. " The shift in the dose response curve was short lived and had returned towards the control position within three hours in all subjects. There was no change in shape of the curves at the time of maximal shift. The results show that inhaled <b>fenoterol</b> greatly reduces the airway responsiveness to histamine, but up to 400 micrograms of <b>fenoterol</b> every four to five hours may be needed to keep the responsiveness of the airways in the non-symptomatic range...|$|E
40|$|Background: β 2 -Adrenergic {{agonists}} are {{the most}} widely used bronchodilators for the treatment of asthma. On the other hand, there is concern that excessive use of β 2 -agonists may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma. However, the mechanism of such adverse effects of β 2 -agonists is not completely clear. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the direct influence of β 2 -agonists on airways by analyzing the effect of a β 2 -agonist, <b>fenoterol,</b> on airway sensitivity in an animal model and on tachykinin neurokinin- 2 receptor expression in bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Methods: We performed an acetylcholine challenge test on ovalbumin sensitized guinea pigs that were exposed to daily inhalation of ovalbumin and <b>fenoterol.</b> We also investigated the effects of <b>fenoterol</b> on neurokinin- 2 receptor messenger RNA and density with Northern blot analysis and receptor binding assay. Result: The increase of airway responsiveness and the decrease of β 2 -adrenergic receptors were found in guinea pigs that were treated with <b>fenoterol.</b> There were time- and dose-dependent increases of neurokinin- 2 receptor mRNA and of density in tracheal smooth muscle that was treated with <b>fenoterol.</b> Conclusion: This increased airway responsiveness, increased neurokinin- 2 receptor expression, and decreased β 2 -adrenergic receptor density may be relevant to asthma exacerbation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
