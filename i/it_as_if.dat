The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the blue sky and then drop <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E
5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E

25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were his own. Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} break-in, Nixon's team (chiefly Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean) asked Helms in effect to assert a phony {{national}} security {{reason for the}} break-in and, under that rationale, {{to interfere with the}} ongoing FBI investigation of the Watergate burglaries. Such a course would also involve the CIA in posting bail for the arrested suspects. Initially Helms made some superficial accommodation that stalled for several weeks the FBI's progress. At several meetings attended by Helms and Walters, Nixon's team referred to the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco, using <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a talisman of dark secrets, as an implied threat against the integrity of CIA. Immediately, sharply, Helms turned aside this gambit.|$|E
25|$|Because all saxophones use {{the same}} key {{arrangement}} and fingering to produce a given notated pitch, {{it is not difficult}} for a competent player to switch among the various sizes when the music has been suitably transposed, and many do so. Since the baritone and alto are pitched in E, players can read concert pitch music notated in the bass clef by reading <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were treble clef and adding three sharps to the key signature. This process, referred to as clef substitution, makes it possible for the Eb instruments to play from parts written for baritone horn, bassoon, euphonium, string bass, trombone, or tuba. This can be useful if a band or orchestra lacks one of those instruments.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} {{election of}} a candidate found guilty (whether personally or by his agents) of a corrupt practice is void, and anyone found personally guilty of a corrupt practice is prohibited from holding any elected office (and for some offences, also from voting in any election) {{for a period of}} five years. In addition, if the offender is a solicitor, barrister, advocate or member of another regulated profession (such as a medical doctor) then the offence is also reported to the appropriate regulatory body which is empowered to deal with <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were professional misconduct, and thus could result in suspension or being struck off their professional register. If an election court finds that someone with a licence for the sale of alcohol allows bribery or treating to take place on his premises, they can also report the matter to the licensing authority which may consider it grounds to refuse to renew the licence.|$|E
25|$|Gyges {{asks the}} Queen {{to join in}} the dancing. She takes a cup and empties <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to drown her thoughts. She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E

Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, {{at least not in}} body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E

25|$|The week of July 2, 2007, PATH {{began an}} initial roll {{out of the}} SmartLink card {{to the general public}} at the World Trade Center station. On July 23 the card was {{introduced}} at the 33rd Street terminal. On August 6 the card was introduced at the Hoboken terminal. Special vending machines that sold an 11-trip SmartLink card were installed at terminal stations. The cost of the card at $20 which includes 11trips plus a $5 charge for the card. In 2008 when the fare was increased to $1.75, these machines were upgraded to sell an $18 card which included 10trips at $1.30 plus the $5.00 card fee. Also a machine selling just the card for $5.00 was installed. The cards can be registered online, allowing riders to retain unused trips in case the card is lost or stolen. A charge of $5 is assessed for a replacement card. In 2011, the card was $20 ($15 for10 trips + $5 for card) In the initial stage, the SmartLink card will allow riders to place the same value on <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were purchasing a QuickCard by using machines located in PATH stations. A later stage will allow the rider to register the card to be automatically be refilled if the value on the card reaches a pre-set minimum. In June 2008, PATH inaugurated an online web account system allowing a cardholder to register the card and monitor its usage. It also allows for an automatic replenishment (linked to a credit card) when the card balance gets to 5 trips or 5 remaining days, {{depending on the type of}} trips on the card. Automatic replenishment is offered in 10-, 20-, and 40-trip increments, as well as weekly and monthly passes. Fares are the same as regular purchases.|$|E

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} {{for this}} episode, director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley refer to an additional motivation for Adam's actions. Apparently, in earlier drafts of the script, Adam's father {{suffered from a}} disease that was incurable in his time (2012) and he hoped to learn about a cure which had been discovered between that year and 200,000. In the shooting script, the condition is arthritis. No trace of this motivation remains in the finished programme, although Grant discusses <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were still present. Langley and Grant also reveal that the [...] "frozen vomit" [...] that Adam spits out in one scene {{was in fact a}} [...] "kiwi and orange ice cube".|$|E
500|$|The Undiscovered Countrys cast {{includes}} the final group {{appearance of the}} main actors from the original television series. Casting director Mary Jo Slater loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by Christian Slater, her son, as an Excelsior officer; Cinefantastique considered the cameo a likely attempt to lure younger audiences. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup. Producer Ralph Winter said, [...] "We were not {{looking for someone to}} say 'Okay, I'll do it', but people who were excited by the material [...] and would treat <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was the biggest picture ever being made." ...|$|E

In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to [...] "fit into the same family" [...] as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The {{final version of the}} Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
