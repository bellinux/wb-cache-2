5|$|During {{her teenage}} {{years before she}} {{acquired}} a driver's licence, Ebsary's mother <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> to the state capital, Adelaide—more than 100km away—to play for the Flinders University Cricket Club in SACA's district women's competition on weekends. Back in Snowtown, she practised against her father {{and one of her}} brothers.|$|E
5|$|Before her death, Plath tried {{several times}} to take her own life. On August 24, 1953, Plath overdosed on pills in the cellar of her mother's home. In June1962, Plath <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> car {{off the side of}} the road, into a river. When {{questioned}} about the incident by police, she admitted to trying to take her own life.|$|E
5|$|The Farrar {{children}} were all engaged in activities outside the home. Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some felt she was a supportive mother, while others believed she <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> children too hard and put down their efforts too often.|$|E

5|$|Three days later, Smith met Rosemary Corcoran, a 25-year-old {{mother of}} three from Castle Vale at the same public house, and again they were seen leaving together. He <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> to Worcestershire before bludgeoning her to death and running over her body near Droitwich Spa. She was found at 8:30am on 12 November by a man walking his dog in a lane near Junction 5 of the M5 motorway.|$|E
5|$|Departing Plymouth on 19 May, Strachan sailed for the Caribbean, passing Madeira and the Canary Islands before {{anchoring}} at Carlisle Bay, Barbados on 8 August. Five {{days later}} Strachan sail northwards {{in pursuit of}} Willaumez and on 18 August {{was caught in the}} same hurricane that dispersed Willaumez's squadron slightly to the north. During August and September, Strachan's scattered ships gathered off the rendezvous point at Chesapeake Bay in the hope of intercepting any French vessels seeking shelter in American ports. On 14 September, Belleisle, Bellona and Melampus sighted the limping French ship Impétueux off Cape Henry and <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> ashore, burning the wreck in violation of American neutrality.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then lift her off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> farther onto shore, from whence she could not be moved.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{sought to}} find a wife; his first attempt failed when it was {{revealed}} that his proposed bride was related to his clan. He subsequently entered a relationship with Grace Wahu, who had attended the CMS School in Kabete; she initially moved in to Kenyatta's family homestead, although joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> out. On 20 November 1920 their son was born, and named Peter Muigui. In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking Holy Communion; the suspension was in response to his drinking and his relations with Wahu out of wedlock. The church insisted that a traditional Kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a Christian civil marriage; this took place on 8 November 1922. Kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking, but in July 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to Holy Communion.|$|E
5|$|In 1141 Alexander and the {{citizens}} of the town of Lincoln requested that Stephen come to Lincoln and intercede with Ranulf de Gernon, the Earl of Chester, who was attempting to enforce what he regarded as his rights to Lincoln Castle. Stephen arrived and besieged Ranulf's wife and half-brother in the castle, but the earl escaped and sought aid from Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and leading supporter. Following Robert's arrival in Lincoln a battle took place there on 2 February 1141, during which Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces. Alexander was present at Oxford in July 1141, when the Empress Matilda held court and attempted to consolidate her hold on England. The citizens of London objected to Matilda's rule when she arrived in their city, and <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> away; Robert of Gloucester was captured shortly afterwards. This reversal of the Empress' fortunes resulted in Stephen's release, after he was exchanged for Robert. The next few years, until 1148, saw a period of civil war in England, often called The Anarchy, when neither Matilda nor Stephen controlled the country.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school to {{familiarize}} herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her permission to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with her pace at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her why she had not competed in more events. He later offered her a multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her crew chief was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a new operation. Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E

5|$|Warrior {{was ordered}} on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down {{some time after}} 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P ocean liner Seine was launched, and the slipway was {{reinforced}} to support Warriors weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of hydraulic rams, additional tugs, and dockworkers running {{from side to side}} on the upper deck to rock her free. Warrior was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary wooden ship of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter bowsprit and a shorter jib boom, along with the provision of extra heads amidships.|$|E

25|$|On 9 February 1843 Larkins {{arrived in}} the Downs on her return from China. A gale {{developed}} and although two steam tugs had been dispatched to bring her up the Thames, the weather was too strong to permit them to take her in tow. As the weather <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> towards the shore, the captain cut away her main and mizzen masts; still, on 12 February the gale <b>drove</b> <b>her</b> onshore about a mile east of Margate. She had a cargo of tea.|$|E
