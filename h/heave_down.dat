2500|$|After having {{reduced the}} lead to a slow margin, Australia were faced with a pitch which had {{deteriorated}} and made batting increasingly difficult. So as to ensure a healthy first-innings lead, the Australian batsmen switched gears quickly from aggressive to defensive. The Indian bowlers were rewarded with Martyn's wicket in the fourth ball of the 92nd over, by which time Australia had already gained a lead of 13. At {{the end of the}} first session, Australia added 79 runs for the loss of Martyn's wicket. The second session saw some more circumspect batting, as Australia added 84 runs from the 28 overs [...] bowled in that period, but for the loss of Simon Katich's wicket. The highlight of the second session was Ponting's double hundred, which was crafted from 368 with a neat single off Ashish Nehra's bowling. His double hundred was described as being [...] "magnificent" [...] by S Rajesh, noted Cricinfo statistician, [...] "for its complete mastery over the Indian bowlers". Ponting was also dominant as he neared his double century, singling out Kumble for some punishment. His knock also continued his excellent form in the year 2003, in which he had already notched up an average excess of 100, in tests. Another incident, a setback for Australia briefly, was Steve Waugh's decision to retire after being hurt. Waugh came out to bat with a standing ovation, but the second ball he faced, from Agarkar, was a short one to which he turned his back, turning his head towards third slip. The ball hit him on his elbow, and after a quick examination from the physio, he decided to go off. The last session, though, made the difference, as Australia added 88 runs for 6 wickets, of which, Anil Kumble took three. After Waugh retired hurt, Simon Katich came in and hung around, adding 64 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. But he was soon out to Kumble(437/5). Steve Waugh returned at this stage, wearing an arm-guard over his hand, but he looked far from comfortable in his 19-run knock. He padded up once too many times to Kumble, which turned out to be his downfall, as he lost his wicket that way(502/6). Then Ponting lost the tail as India steadily worked their way through the match, with some perseverance from Kumble. Ponting was soon dismissed off Kumble, at 555/9, after missing an attempted <b>heave</b> <b>down</b> the track, and being stumped. Ponting's 468-ball innings was termed as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "mature", and had less aggression or flamboyance compared to his double century at Adelaide. His approach towards batting was similar to that of Rahul Dravid's in Adelaide: he was in command of his shots and the bowlers, so he had to occupy the crease for a long time. An important aspect of Ponting's knock which stood out was his footwork: he scored at a rate of 1.5 off the front-foot, but scored at a pace of 5.4 from the back-foot. He remarkably remained in control for 87% of the balls he faced from other Indian bowlers, except Kumble, against whom he had a relatively low in-control percentage of 81%. Sambit Bal noted that despite being uncomfortable against Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar early on, Ponting played an innings of ambition. He added, ...|$|E

60|$|She was an American whaler, a {{very old}} craft. Having sprung a leak at sea, she had made all sail for the island, to <b>heave</b> <b>down</b> for repairs. Found utterly unseaworthy, however, her oil was taken out and sent home in another vessel; the hull was then {{stripped}} and sold for a trifle.|$|E
6000|$|Madeline got down, glad {{to stretch}} her limbs, {{and began to}} stroll about. She heard Stillwell throw the harness {{on the ground and}} slap his horses. [...] "Roll, you sons-of-guns!" [...] he said. Both horses bent their fore legs, <b>heaved</b> <b>down</b> on their sides, and tried to roll over. One horse succeeded on the fourth try, and then heaved up with a {{satisfied}} snort and shook off the dust and gravel. The other one failed to roll over, and gave it up, half rose to his feet, and then lay down on the other side.|$|R
60|$|He glanced to his right; another {{white sea}} was <b>heaving</b> <b>down</b> on him; {{he could just}} see its {{glittering}} crest. With all his force he dug the paddle into the water; the canoe answered to it; she came round {{just in time to}} ride out the wave with safety, but the paddle snapped. It was already sprung, and the weight he put upon it was more than it could bear. Right in two it broke, some nine inches above that blade which at the moment was buried in the water. He felt it go, and despair took hold of him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh. When {{he comes}} back, wring his neck, and <b>heave</b> him <b>down</b> here,' said Jim. 'I want {{a word with}} him on the subject of short cuts. I say, is there much {{excitement}} about this?' ...|$|R
60|$|Thirdly: Some {{eighteen}} {{or twenty}} years ago Commodore J---then commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed {{to them by the}} professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks later, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to <b>heave</b> <b>down</b> and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} two months Wright harried French shipping, winning many prizes. Louis XV fitted out two ships, while the Marseilles Chamber of Commerce {{prepared}} another ship, to seek and destroy Wright. The Hirondelle of Toulon also set out after him and they fought in the Channel of Malta. Wright defeated the French ship and both put into Malta to refit. His own vessel had taken several shots under the waterline, but the Maltese refused to allow Wright to <b>heave</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
50|$|Port Clarence connects at its {{northeast}} {{end with}} Grantley Harbor, which is 3 to 4 miles wide, about 12 miles long, and connects at its eastern end by a narrow, difficult channel {{with a large}} lake farther inland. The mouth of the harbor is formed by two sand spits which slightly overlap. The water westward of the sand spits is shoal, {{but there is a}} channel close to the north one which can be used by vessels drawing 12 feet or less, but which should be sounded out before attempting to enter. Inside the harbor, the depths range from 2Â£ to 3 fathoms, and it is probable that a draft of 12 feet can be taken through the channel to the lake. Vessels have gone into Grantley Harbor to <b>heave</b> <b>down</b> and repair on the north sand spit.|$|E
50|$|In her, {{late in the}} {{afternoon}} of 14 March 1808, Dillon was sailing towards the south-west the coast of Norway when he sighted a sail. He set out in pursuit and chased the vessel into the small port of Midbe (possibly Midtre Kalvekilen). The local inhabitants sent out boats to retrieve the quarry's cargo, but these dispersed when Childerss boats arrived to cut her out. The party from Childers retrieved the galiot together with her cargo of oil and fish, and despite small arms fire from the shore and rocks <b>heaved</b> <b>down</b> on them from a precipice above where her crew had abandoned the galiot. As the cutting out party returned with the galiot, Dillon observed a large brig sailing out from Hitteroe (probably Flekkefjord), towards Childers, with the apparent intent of recapturing the prize.|$|R
50|$|USS Marion was a sloop-of-war of {{the third}} rate in the Union Navy during the American Civil War {{launched}} at the Boston Navy Yard on 24 April 1839. On 10 November 1839, she departed Boston on her first cruise, to Brazil. Sunk when <b>heaved</b> <b>down</b> in the harbor at Rio de Janeiro early in 1842, she was raised and sailed back to Boston, arriving in May. She then set sail for the Caribbean, returning in May 1843. For the next few years, she remained in ordinary at Boston and then cruised off the West Coast of Africa and in the Mediterranean until 1848. After a tour in the East Indies from 1850-52, she resumed operations with the African Squadron from 1853-55 and 1858-60. 1856-57 was spent in ordinary at Norfolk.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the course}} of his talk he rambled into a {{criticism}} upon New England degrees of merit in ship building.

Well, sir, she hain't been hove down a week till you can heave a dog through her seams. You send that vessel to sea, and what's the result? She wets her oakum the first trip! Leave it to any man if 'tain't so. Well, you let our folks build you a vessel--down New Bedford-way. What's the result? Well, sir, you might take that ship and <b>heave</b> her <b>down,</b> and keep her hove down six months, and she'll never shed a tear!" ...|$|R

60|$|Bending our {{steps toward}} the glen, roaring down the rocks we descried a stream from the mountains. But ere those waters gained the sea, vassal tribute they rendered. Conducted through {{culverts}} and moats, they turned great wheels, giving life to ten thousand fangs and fingers, whose gripe no power could withstand, yet whose touch was soft as the velvet paw of a kitten. With brute force, they <b>heaved</b> <b>down</b> great weights, then daintily wove and spun; like {{the trunk of the}} elephant, which lays lifeless a river-horse, and counts the pulses of a moth. On all sides, the place seemed alive with its spindles. Round and round, round and round; throwing off wondrous births at every revolving; ceaseless as the cycles that circle in heaven. Loud hummed the loom, flew the shuttle like lightning, red roared the grim forge, rung anvil and sledge; yet no mortal was seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ship's company being {{reduced to}} but a handful, the captain called upon the Islanders {{to assist him}} in the {{laborious}} business of <b>heaving</b> <b>down</b> the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.|$|R
25|$|Because maglev {{vehicles}} essentially fly, stabilisation of pitch, {{roll and}} yaw is required. In addition to rotation, surge (forward and backward motions), sway (sideways motion) or <b>heave</b> (up and <b>down</b> motions) can be problematic.|$|R

60|$|I {{forgot the}} arduous toil. How tight and cool and prickling {{the feel of}} my skin! The fresh track of a big grizzly would rouse the hunter in any man. We made sure how fresh this track was by observing twigs and sprigs of manzanita just broken. The wood was green, and wet with sap. Old Bruin had not escaped our eyes any too soon. We {{followed}} this bear trail, evidently one used for years. It made climbing easy for us. Trust a big, heavy, old grizzly {{to pick out the}} best traveling over rough country! This fellow, I concluded, had the eye of a surveyor. His trail led gradually toward a wonderful crag-crowned ridge that rolled and <b>heaved</b> <b>down</b> from the rim. It had a dip or saddle in the middle, and rose from that to the lofty mesa, and then on the lower side, rose to a bare, round point of gray rock, a landmark, a dome-shaped tower where the gods of that wild region might have kept their vigil.|$|R

60|$|Sim, as he {{was called}} in the locksmith's family, or Mr Simon Tappertit, as he called himself, and {{required}} all men to style him out of doors, on holidays, and Sundays out,--was an old-fashioned, thin-faced, sleek-haired, sharp-nosed, small-eyed little fellow, very little more than five feet high, and thoroughly convinced {{in his own mind}} that he was above the middle size; rather tall, in fact, than otherwise. Of his figure, which was well enough formed, though somewhat of the leanest, he entertained the highest admiration; and with his legs, which, in knee-breeches, were perfect curiosities of littleness, he was enraptured to a degree amounting to enthusiasm. He also had some majestic, shadowy ideas, which had never been quite fathomed by his intimate friends, concerning the power of his eye. Indeed he had been known to {{go so far as to}} boast that he could utterly quell and subdue the haughtiest beauty by a simple process, which he termed 'eyeing her over;' but it must be added, that neither of this faculty, nor of the power he claimed to have, through the same gift, of vanquishing and <b>heaving</b> <b>down</b> dumb animals, even in a rabid state, had he ever furnished evidence which could be deemed quite satisfactory and conclusive.|$|R
