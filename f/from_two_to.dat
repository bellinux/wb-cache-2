Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E

Other changes included adding more powerful engines and {{increasing the number of}} tires <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.|$|E

5|$|Elective safeties {{are more}} common in Canadian football, where they can result in better field {{position}} than a punt. The 2010 Edmonton Eskimos surrendered a Canadian Football League (CFL)-record 14 safeties, a factor that led CFL reporter Jim Mullin to suggest increasing {{the value of the}} safety touch <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three points as a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} a $5.5million project {{to improve the}} intersection between Clover Street (NY65) and Jefferson Road (NY252) {{in the town of}} Pittsford. The project, which had been in development for a decade, involved the widening of Jefferson Road <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection, the addition of green arrow signal lights for all left-hand turns, and the installation of sidewalks alongside both Clover Street and Jefferson Road. Work on the project was temporarily halted during the winter months; however, it resumed on April1, 2009. The project was completed in late 2009.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Lucas, who had {{previously}} confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department {{to create their own}} versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.|$|E

5|$|Lysaker {{was one of}} two {{original}} Drammen Line {{station in}} Bærum, opening on 7 October 1872. The original station building, designed by Georg Andreas Bull, burned down in 1914 and was replaced by a new station Adalbert Kielland. In the following years the elevated and double-track layout was introduced. This station arrangement was demolished in 1987 {{to make way for a}} station designed by Arne Henriksen. Traditionally only served by commuter trains, the station was branded as Lysaker/Fornebu from 1990 to 2000 because of its vicinity to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The station was rebuilt again from 2006 to 2009 in which it was expanded <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four tracks. It became connected to the Asker Line in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Operation of {{the system}} is {{subcontracted}} to Metro Service. Trains run continually, twenty-four hours a day, with the headway varying <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four minutes, but with longer intervals (up to twenty minutes) during the night only. While a 6 train per hour (tph) service with 8-car trains, moves 48 cars per hour in each direction, Copenhagen Metro with 30 tph with 3 cars only, actually moves 90 cars per hour in each direction. So, in terms of capacity, the Copenhagen Metro is equivalent to a system with 8 cars and 12 tph (or a train every fifth minute).|$|E

5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four months.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{acquisition}} {{strategy was}} revised on 17 January 2013 to further reduce risk and maintain affordability of the program. The revision extended the technology development phase by {{six months to}} give industry more time to refine vehicle designs. Milestone B would occur in 2014, with {{the selection of a}} single vendor for the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and production phases of the program. This would initiate critical design and testing activities in anticipation of vehicle production. Budgetary pressures caused the reduction of number of vendors to be selected <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> one.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} {{is a highly}} social animal and lives in {{extended}} family groups. Group sizes are anywhere <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> 20 members, but likely average between three and eight. (Larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together.) The groups are strongly cohesive: the otters sleep, play, travel, and feed together.|$|E
