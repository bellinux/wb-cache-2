5|$|The war <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Australian {{society in}} other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation's {{involvement}} {{is seen as a}} symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E

5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the evolution}} of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved {{the use of the}} TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on contemporary theology, particularly {{in the way people}} perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E

5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals {{in the thirteenth century}} generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E

The {{loss of his}} wife <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E

5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s saw several {{important}} changes in popular music, especially rock. Many {{of these changes}} took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on American culture and music.These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment. These changes led {{to the rise of}} musical movements connected to political goals, such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlandish {{painters}} {{were largely}} {{forgotten in the}} 18th century. When Musée du Louvre was converted to an art gallery during the French Revolution, Gerard David's Marriage at Cana – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels {{were added to the}} collection after the French conquered the Low Countries. These works <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on German literary critic and philosopher Karl Schlegel, who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to Ludwig Tieck, who had the piece published in 1805.|$|E

5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|Like the extravaganza and the burlesque, {{the variety}} {{show was a}} comic and ribald production, popular from the middle {{to the end of}} the 19th century, at which time it had evolved into vaudeville. This form was innovated by {{producers}} like Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women and children to attend his shows; they were hesitant because the theater had long been the domain of a rough and disorderly crowd. By the early 20th century, vaudeville was a respected entertainment for women and children, and songwriters like Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country. The most popular vaudeville shows were, like the Ziegfeld Follies, a series of songs and skits that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the subsequent development of Broadway musical theater and the songs of Tin Pan Alley.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the outcome of}} this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E
