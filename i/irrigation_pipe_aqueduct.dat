Much of this trade is conducted through a third country. Israel supplies Iran with fertilizer, <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes,</b> hormones for milk production, seeds, and fruit; Iran, meanwhile, provides Israel with marble, cashews, and pistachios. Based on the same report in November 2000, the Iranian government asked an Israeli company, which built Tehran's sewage pipes 30 years earlier, to visit the country for renovations. Shortly afterwards, the assistant director-general of Iran's Ministry of Agriculture visited Israel secretly and stayed at the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the hydraulic characteristics for the subsurface trickle <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes,</b> eight types of locally available trickle lines were selected. Field tests were made to determine the hydraulic characteristics and to insure their adequacy for trickle system design requirements. Test results have indicated that actual flow rates were higher as compared to measured values reported by the manufacturer manuals for all pipes tested. Results have also shown clear differences in flow rates along pipes due to high values of coefficient of manufacturing variation which led to the lower uniformity of some subsurface pipes. The results have also shown that the increase in operating pressure seems to improve the uniformity of water distribution. Suggestions and recommendations were made to achieve the optimum use of the subsurface trickle <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{accidental}} electrocutions in Washington State from 1950 to 1979, {{the standardized}} proportionate mortality ratio for farmers {{compared with the}} general population {{was found to be}} 226 in a recent report. This excess mortality rate in Washington State was investigated by the authors, who reviewed death certificates and associated local newspaper reports of all farmers killed by electrocution during 1950 - 79 and of all persons killed by electrocution during 1970 - 79. Selected employers, next of kin, and public utility personnel were also interviewed. In Washington State 42 farmers were electrocuted during the years 1950 - 79; 23 of them were killed while working near <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes</b> that came into contact with overhead electrical lines. During 1970 - 79 there were 15 irrigation pipe-associated (IPA) electrocutions among farmers and 15 among farm workers. The average age of farmers who suffered IPA electrocutions, 33. 2 years, was less than the average age of farmers whose electrocutions were not associated with <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes,</b> 48. 9 years. Among persons less than 20 years old, IPA electrocutions were more common than any other type of electrocutions. During the months of April through September, 93 percent of the IPA electrocutions occurred as compared with only 61 percent of other types of electrocution. Among measures for the prevention of these electrocutions are education of the population at risk and changes in methods of irrigation...|$|R

40|$|The Hartley Sand Trap {{could mean}} the end to the curse of sand {{blocking}} up filters and <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes.</b> This simple invention developed and patented by Tim Hartley is worth the while for any farmer or farmers group involved in irrigation. It removes sand from the borehole, at the well-point or the river, while under online pressure. Here is how it works. Sandy water enters {{the bottom of the}} Trap equipment under pressure up to 10 bar and clean water comes out {{from the top of the}} Sand Trap under the same pressure. The rising speed of the water is slower than the settling speed of the sand which can therefore never reach the Trap s outlet only the clean water can. The accumulated sand can periodically be flushed through from the Trap by opening the flush valve. The maximum flow rate of the trap is 4, 000 litres/ hour. For higher flow rates, two or more sand traps would have to be installed in parallel. The device costs ZAR 980 South African Rand (t 142), excluding transport.

40|$|Plastic {{materials}} have been worldwide applied in agriculture for soil mulching, greenhouse covering, <b>irrigation</b> and drainage <b>pipes,</b> bags, containers, pots, and agrochemical containers. All of these plastic materials require, {{at the end}} of their lifetime, suitable collection and treatment systems. Agricultural activities in some areas of the Apulia Region, Southern Italy, are characterized by huge quantities of plastic wastes and local authorities and farmers associations have been interested in solving this problem by applying modern land management tools such as Geographical Information System (G. I. S.). In this paper a G. I. S. methodology is applied to an area of 10, 200 ha in the Trani municipality, included in the Province of Barletta, Andria, Trani (BAT) - Apulia Region, in order to assess the agricultural plastic waste generation. The use of plastics at the agricultural farms has been investigated and related to the land use by applying statistical analysis, orthophoto analysis and remote sensing surveys. These data were introduced in a specific geo-database, and the agricultural plastic waste quantity and localization were defined. Vineyards and olive groves are scattered in this area, so the agricultural plastic waste mostly consists in <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes,</b> after-use covering films and anti-hail nets used on vineyards. The analysis carried out showed that up to 614 kg ha- 1 of covering films waste are yearly produced in some areas while the estimation of waste from the anti-hail nets was up to 159 kg ha- 1 and the waste yearly produced from <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes</b> was up to 83 kg ha- 1. Through the use of the G. I. S., the areas with high density of plastic wastes were pointed out thus allowing to determine the suitable location of temporary storage areas and collecting points, in order to optimize the transport of agricultural plastic waste from the farms to the collecting points and to the recycling firms...|$|R

About half the men were then dismissed; the other half were kept on to remove whatever equipment could be sold.
