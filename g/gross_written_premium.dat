As such, the DRC insurance market remained largely undeveloped. A clear indication of this is that in 2014 SONAS placed USD 82 million of premium, which is substantially less than the potential insurance market. A simple comparison between Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) and <b>Gross</b> <b>Written</b> <b>Premium</b> (“GWP”) shows this. The DRC generated a GDP of USD 32.69b in 2013, in line with Ivory Coast whose growth was USD 31.06b. While the GWP in Ivory Coast was USD 500m, USD 82m only were generated in the DRC. Common expectation is that an additional $400 million of premiums are bought for the Congo, without Sonas being involved. This is known as the informal insurance sector.|$|E
