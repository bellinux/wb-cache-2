50|$|Outside of Asia, <b>direct</b> <b>consultations</b> with Protestant churches {{other than}} Lutherans have, {{for the most}} part, been less fruitful. Movements toward full communion between the Anglican Church of Canada and the United Church of Canada were derailed because {{of the issue of}} episcopacy and the mutual {{recognition}} of ordained ministry (specifically, apostolic succession). The same issue blocked the first attempt at a covenant between the Church of England and the Methodist Church of Great Britain, but such a covenant was eventually signed in 2003. This issue also has held back the Churches Uniting in Christ initiative in the United States.|$|E

50|$|From 1949 to 1953, Comecon's {{function}} consisted {{primarily of}} redirecting commerce of member countries {{toward each other}} and introducing import replacement industries, thus making members economically more self-sufficient. Little was done to solve economic problems through a regional policy. This was a period, moreover, when their first five-year plans, formulated along the Soviet model, preoccupied the East European members. In the headlong pursuit of parallel industrialization strategies, East European governments turned their attention inward. Because of Stalin's distrust of multilateral bodies, bilateral ties with the Soviet Union quickly came to dominate the East European members' external relations. Each country dealt with the Soviets on a one-to-one basis by means of <b>direct</b> <b>consultations</b> with Moscow through local Soviet missions. Although reparations transfers (extracted by the Soviet Union to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and former Slovakia, who were Axis' allies during World War II) {{had been replaced by}} more normal trade relations, outstanding reparations obligations were not halted until 1956. In these circumstances, there was scarcely need or scope for multilateral policies or institutions.|$|E

50|$|The Australian Podiatry Council {{has defined}} {{the scope of}} {{podiatry}} in Australia as:Podiatry deals with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of medical and surgical conditions of the feet and lower limbs. The conditions podiatrists treat include those resulting from bone and joint disorders such as arthritis and soft-tissue and muscular pathologies, as well as neurological and circulatory disease. Podiatrists are also able to diagnose and treat any complications of the above which affect the lower limb, including skin and nail disorders, corns, calluses and ingrown toenails. Foot injuries and infections gained through sport or other activities are also diagnosed and treated by podiatrists. A range of skills are employed by podiatrists. <b>Direct</b> <b>consultations</b> include a clinical history composition, physical examination, diagnosis, preparation of a treatment plan and provision {{of a range of}} therapies. Clinical assessment techniques aim to secure a diagnosis and prognosis and take into account clinical, medical and surgical history, footwear, occupational and lifestyle factors, and may incorporate the use of diagnostic equipment such as vascularscopes or radiology. Gait analysis will often be undertaken through visual or computerised means and might include range of motion studies, postural alignment evaluation or dynamic force and pressure studies. Clinical services require skilled use of sterilised instruments and appropriate infection control procedures, along with appropriate application of pharmacological agents, specialist wound dressings and a variety of physical therapies. Prescription foot orthoses (in-shoe devices) offer long-term solutions in the treatment and prevention of corns, callous and necrotic ulceration in their capacity to provide pressure redistribution. As a technique for providing consistent weightbearing realignment they are utilised in the treatment of acute and chronic foot conditions such as tendonitis, recurrent ankle sprain, chronic knee pain and stress fractures, to supplement and enhance clinical care. Foot health education regarding self care techniques and prevention of foot pathology is an important component of individual care but is also frequently implemented on a greater scale, either to specific target groups or as community projects. In order to facilitate enhanced clinical care, podiatrists establish and maintain collaborative relationships with other health care providers, often working within a site-based, multi-disciplinary team.|$|E

The process resulted in the Taj becoming a market leader in Goa. The case traces the process using the 7 -I model: inspiration, insight, ideation, initiative, implementation, invigilation, and investigation. Focusing {{on the need to}} upgrade service by addressing and reducing customer complaints, Taj Holiday Vil-lage Goa began with the idea of using cell phones to text guest complaints immediately to the guest services department. The plan was subsequently modified to include communication of complaint reports to department managers and <b>direct</b> <b>consultations</b> between high-level managers and guests to personalize the service offering. The process identified additional issues that were resolve by establishing a new check-in time, reorganizing the breakfast room and kitchen, and the use of pictorial evidence to improve guestroom preparation. As a result of the successful implementation of these innovations, guest satisfaction scores increased by 20 percent, revenue per available room (RevPAR) rose to the highest in the market, and the RevPAR index increased from 0. 96 to 1. 17. Ultimately, the cost of this innovation was insignificant in comparison with the benefit resulting in a high return on innovation.

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of chronic leg ulcers requires frequent assessments of local wound status and adjustment of therapy. The availability of reasonably priced photographic equipment and quick electronic transfer of high-quality digital images {{should make it}} possible that the assessment of wound status can be made by remote experts. Objective: This study examines the feasibility of using teledermatology for wound assessment and therapeutic suggestions for patients with chronic leg ulcers. Methods: One hundred ten chronic leg ulcers of different origins were examined in face-to-face consultations. The examining doctor assessed the wound, made therapeutic recommendations and took 1 - 4 photographs of the wound using a digital camera. The digital images and relevant clinical information were then transmitted via a web application to an expert in wound care, who provided an independent teledermatological assessment of wound status and therapeutic recommendations. Results: In our study, a high accordance between <b>direct</b> <b>consultations</b> and electronic consultations was found in the assessment of chronic leg ulcers, especially for important features like slough (concordance: 84. 6 %), necrosis (concordance: 98. 2 %) and granulation tissue formation (concordance: 76. 4 %). Furthermore, the teledermatologist generally felt confident in recommending further treatment strategies and in planning further wound assessments via the internet. Conclusions: Our results suggest that teledermatology offers great potential for the future in chronic wound care. By reducing the need to travel long distances to the hospital or to consult a physician with expertise in wound care, wound teleconsultation might lower health care costs and {{improve the quality of life}} for patients with chronic wounds, while still maintaining a high quality of wound care...|$|E

Fish plays {{a leading}} role in {{nutrition}} and food security in several African countries, but in many cases this is not reflected in national policies for food security. This study, carried out in the framework of the FAO‑SmartFish Programme of the Indian Ocean Commission funded by the EU, makes a preliminary assessment of the inclusion of fisheries and aquaculture into the food and nutrition policy frameworks of twenty countries in the East and South Africa and Indian Ocean (ESA-IO) region. The study reviews the integration of fisheries into the formulation of food security and economic and social development policies, and the inclusion of food security issues in the formulation of national fisheries policies (“integration by word”); as well as the extent to which fish and fisheries are actually integrated into the diets and economies of the ESA-IO countries (“integration by deed”). The knowledge and awareness of fishery officers was also evaluated through <b>direct</b> <b>consultations.</b> With this information it was possible to evaluate the importance and potential of fisheries to contribute to food security and to identify the countries in which enhancement of the integration of fisheries into policies is needed.
