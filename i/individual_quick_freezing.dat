Adding starch at the highest concentration, <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> and slow thawing produced a lighter-coloured mashed potato, although the loss of colour in the processed product was not detected by panellists in the microwave-thawed samples. DM was higher in the quick-frozen samples and lower in air-thawed samples. The factors studied affected different sensory texture parameters but had hardly any effect on attributes perceived during final and residual phases of mastication. Only starch concentration had a significant effect on sensory acceptability, but interactions between factors showed that starch addition followed by <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> was judged undesirable by the panellists due to excessive softening.

EMC 2016. 5846 International audienceThe “unroofing” {{technique}} {{has been successfully}} used to observe the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (PM) using either light or electron microscopy. Combined to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is an invaluable method to reveal {{the composition of the}} PM and to directly observe macromolecular complexes including the cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane invaginations. This method has been optimized over decades to preserve membranes close to their native states by the combination of <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> of exposed membranes, followed by deep etching and rotary replication (the so-called “QF-DE-RR” technique). However, a serious setback in implementing unroofing combined with QF-DE-RR stems from the necessity to use complicated apparatus, such as <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> and freeze-fracturing devices, along with strong expertise to handle them.
