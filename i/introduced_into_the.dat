60|$|The High Dutch commentators, however, declare {{in favor}} of the other reading, and affirm that the worthy in {{question}} was a burly, bulbous man, who, in sheer ostentation of his venerable progenitors, was <b>the</b> first to <b>introduce</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> settlement the ancient Dutch fashion of ten pair of breeches.|$|R
5|$|Domitian himself {{supported}} the travel of competitors from {{all corners of}} the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes.

He also undertook {{a survey of the}} endowments of the vicarages within his diocese.|$|E

Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
