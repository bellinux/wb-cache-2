The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate soil pH alterations and alterations in the contents of forms of phosphorus in the rhizosphere of soil <b>fertilized</b> with <b>rock</b> phosphate as a result of cultivation of species of plants. An experiment was developed under greenhouse conditions to evaluate alterations in the pH and in the forms of phosphorus in the rhizosphere of an Oxisol <b>fertilized</b> with <b>rock</b> phosphate and cultivated with four species. Treatments consisted of the cultivation of four species of soybean - Glycine max (L.) Merrill, brachiaria grass - Brachiaria brizantha Hochst Stapf, millet - Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Brown, and sorghum - Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench grown in PVC columns filled with soil and divided with a nylon screen (25 µm mesh) to impede root growth in part of the column. After 45 days of cultivation, the soil was divided into the layers of 0 - 1, 1 - 2, 2 - 3, 3 - 4, 4 - 5, 5 - 7, 7 - 9, and 9 - 14 mm from the rhizoplane and air dried to determine pH and P contents through Hedley fractionation. In the 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 mm layers, soybean cultivation caused an increase in pH when compared to the control treatment (without plants). In the other layers, there were no alterations in pH due to cultivation of plants. The cultivation of millet, brachiaria grass, and sorghum reduced the inorganic P content in the most labile forms only in the 0 - 1 mm layer from the rhizoplane...|$|R

Foram isolados fungos e bactérias capazes de solubilizar hidroxiapatita, proporcionando P solúvel. O experimento utilizado foi em blocos ao acaso com fatorial 3 x 3 x 2. E os fatores avaliados foram espécies de plantas (controle, braquiária e guandu), fertilizantes (controle, superfosfato simples e fosfato de rocha, ambos na dose de 400 kg ha- 1 de P(2) 0 (5)) e calagem (com e sem calcário). A população bacteriana cresceu pelo efeito da calagem, e a de fungos aumentou, independentemente da calagem, nas parcelas cultivadas com braquiária e fertilizadas com superfosfato. Foi constatado incremento de biomassa-P microbiana sobre o controle por influência da braquiária (23, 9 %), do superfosfato (30, 9 %) e da calagem (46, 9 %). O número de bactérias solubilizadoras foi favorecido pela calagem ou pelo plantio de guandu adubado com fosfato natural ou com braquiária sem adubação. Os fungos solubilizadores aumentaram na ausência de planta ou de adubação e na presença de guandu com fosfato natural. Finalmente, a calagem favoreceumais o crescimento dos fungos solubilizadores, em comparação com o controle, nos tratamentos fosfato natural, braquiária ou guandu. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of different plant species, phosphorus sources, and liming on the total microbial and phosphate-solubilizing population. In order to achieve that, bacteria and fungi capable of solubilizing hydroxyapatite providing available P were isolated. An experiment was carried out in a randomized factorial block design 3 x 3 x 2. The factors evaluated were plant species (control, Brachiaria ruziziensis and Cajanus cajan), fertilizers (control, simple superphosphate and rock phosphate, both at the dose of 400 kg ha- 1 of P(2) 0 (5)) and liming (with and without lime). While the bacterial population increased due to the effect of liming, the fungal population also increased independently of liming in the soil cultivated with B. ruziziensis and fertilized with superphosphate. An increase of the microbial biomass-P compared to the control was observed under the influence of B. ruziziensis (23. 9 %), superphosphate (30. 9 %) or liming (46. 9 %). The number of solubilizing bacteria was favored by liming andby the planting of C. cajan <b>fertilized</b> with <b>rock</b> phosphate or with unfertilized B. ruziziensis. The solubilizing fungi increased in the absence of plants or fertilization and in the presence of C. cajan <b>fertilized</b> with <b>rock</b> phosphate. Finally, liming enhanced more the growth of solubilizing fungi than did the control in the treatments using rock phosphate, B. ruziziensis or C. cajan...|$|R

30|$|Despite the {{numerous}} uncertainties about {{the specificity of}} the mechanisms of heavy metal absorption, especially of those not essential to plant growth, the concentration and accumulation of these elements in plant tissues generally depend on their availability in the soil solution. Root and shoot concentrations can increase with increasing metal concentrations in the soil solution. The biosorption capacity of various biological materials to remove heavy metals has been studied increasingly (Ahmaruzzaman and Gupta 2011; Gupta and Saleh 2013; Gupta et al. 2015). The few studies that evaluated vermicomposting {{with the addition of}} rock powders (Wei et al. 2012; Souza et al. 2013) did not address the effects of heavy metal contained in the rock powder on their concentrations in the soil or on plant development. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the presence of heavy metals in plants and soil and subsequent maize growth when soil was <b>fertilized</b> with vermicomposted <b>rock</b> powders. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse and complements a study that was performed in the field (Souza et al. 2018).|$|R
5000|$|Menkin {{began the}} IVF {{experiments}} in March 1938. Rock and Menkin {{requested that the}} women participating in the study, who were scheduled to undergo hysterectomies, have unprotected sex prior to the surgery. They elected {{to carry out the}} surgical procedures just before the patient would ovulate, which gave them many suitable ova for the study. Over the course of the study, Menkin followed a fairly steady weekly schedule: find eggs on Tuesday, add sperm on Wednesday, pray on Thursday, and observe the outcome on Friday. She made variations to the procedure every so often, altering the conditions the eggs were kept in and the length and concentration of the sperm samples. Menkin would find the unfertilized eggs in the ovaries that Rock removed from the patients, put the eggs in the solution, and then culture them before adding sperm. In the first 6 years of the study, Menkin tried many different strategies but did not achieve IVF. On February 3, 1944, she obtained an egg from a woman whose cervix and uterus prolapsed following the birth of four children. Menkin's standard protocol was to wash the sperm sample 3 times in solution and let the egg and sperm interact for 30 minutes. However, she had stayed up with her newborn daughter the night before, and on that day she mistakenly washed the sperm sample only once, used a more concentrated sample, and allowed one hour of interaction. The following Friday morning (February 6, 1944), Menkin found that cell cleavage had begun, which indicated that a fertilized egg had formed. Menkin neglected to take an immediate photograph of the discovery, and she could not find the egg when she finally went to get a picture. She was able to fertilize and photograph three more eggs, involving all three factors that she had altered before the original discovery. Rock and Menkin achieved two and three cell development in their successful fertilizations. After the additional eggs were <b>fertilized</b> successfully, <b>Rock</b> and Menkin elected to publish their work in a brief report. Science magazine published their findings in the article “In Vitro Fertilization and Cleavage of Human Ovarian Eggs" [...] on August 4, 1944. The Associated Press, New York Times, and Time magazine ran accounts of the discovery in the following days.|$|R

Este estudo avaliou a diversidade de bactérias isoladas do solo em resposta a diferentes plantas (controle, Brachiaria ruziziensis e Cajanus cajan), fertilizantes (controle, superfosfato simples e fosfato de rocha) e calagem (com e sem calcário). As características fenotípicas e fisiológicas dos isolados foram registradas e organizadas em um arquivo para identificar as bactérias. Entre os isolados, 95 % foram de bactérias Gram positivas e 5 % bacilos Gram negativos. B. ruziziensis favoreceu mais os bacilos Gram positivos não esporulados e bacilos Gram negativos que o solo com C. cajan ou não cultivado. O número de bacilos Gram positivos esporulados foi superior nas parcelas fertilizadas com fosfato do que nas não adubadas ou fertilizadas com fosfato de rocha. Nas parcelas não fertilizadas, maior número de cocos Gram positivos e bacilos Gram negativos foi obtido do que nas parcelas fertilizadas.

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} desinged {{to study the}} role of vesicular -arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) and bradyrhizobia on soybean growth and the activity of phosphatase in soil and plant roots which were grown under water stress conditions. Soil was <b>fertilized</b> with either <b>rock</b> or super phosphate as P-fertilizer while uninoculated unfertilized soil conducted as control. VA mycorrhizal inoculation was applied in soil received rock-P fertilizer as single inoculum while dual inoculum (bradyrhizobia and VA mycorrhiza) was applied in soils received either of P-fertilizers. Data showed a significant increases in soybean shoot and root dry weights, due to inoculation with VA mycorrhiza or bradyrhizobia inoculants. Greatest values were recorded when dual inoculantion in soil received super phosphate was applied, increases reached more than 167 % and four folds over control when plants grown under normal and water stress conditions respectively. Nodulation was also affected by VA mycorrhizal inoculation, maximum nodules count and weight were 82 and 2. 5 gm per plant respectively, when plants were grown under normal watering conditions, while under water stress plant nodulation was affecting greatly as nodules count and weight were reduced. VA mycorrhizal colonization in soybean roots was significantly increased by application of VAM inoculant or duel inoculation {{and seemed to be}} higher under water stress conditions. On the other hand phosphatase activity trend decreased under water drought conditions but increased in treatments with either VAM or dual inoculants, maximum value recorded in plant roots were 245 x 102 u mole per gm root per hour in plants inoculated with both inoculants and grown in soil received rock phosphate fertilizer under normal watering conditions. Soil phosphatase activity was found {{to be in the same}} trend of that in roots but with low values. NPK concentration and contents in soybean shoots were significantly increased due to either of P-fertilizer application or endophyte inoculation under water stress and normal watering conditions The maximum N concentration and contents values were found in plant shoots growing in soil fertilized with superphosphate and inoculated with both of bradyrhizobia and VAM inoculants. P and K contents in plant shoots were in parallel with those of N contents. Data showed that VA mycorrhizal inoculation reduced the effect of water stress condition on NPK contents in soybean shoots. Micronutreint (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) concentration and content in plant shoots were also affected significantly by inoculation and water stress conditions. The highest concentrations values of Fe,Mn,Zn and Cu concentrations were 438. 5, 174, 40. 8 and 26. 7 ug g- 1 shoot, were found in plants grown with dual inoculation treatment. Again micronutrient contents were increased significantly and maximum values were found under normal irrigation condition as water stress tended to reduce values of micronutrient shoot contents.
