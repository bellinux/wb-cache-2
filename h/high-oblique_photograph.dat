40|$|The aerial {{photographs}} (APs) {{acquired by}} the 7 a Sezione Topocartografica during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia (1935 - 1941) have recently been discovered, scanned and organised. The oldest APs {{of the country that}} are known so far were taken in the period 1958 - 1964. The APs over Ethiopia in 1935 - 1941 are presented as assemblages on approx. 50 cm x 20 cm cardboard tiles, each holding a label, one nadir-pointing photograph flanked by two low-oblique photographs and one <b>high-oblique</b> <b>photograph.</b> The four APs were exposed simultaneously and were taken across the flight line; the <b>high-oblique</b> <b>photograph</b> is presented alternatively at left and at right; there is approx. 60 % overlap between subsequent sets of APs. One of Santoniâ€™s glass plate multicameras was used, with focal length of 178 mm, flight height at 4000 - 4500 m a. s. l., which results in an approximate scale of 1 : 11 500 for the central photograph and 1 : 16 000 to 1 : 18 000 for the low-oblique APs. The surveyors oriented themselves with maps of Ethiopia at 1 : 400 000 scale, compiled in 1934. The flights present a dense AP coverage of Northern Ethiopia, where they were acquired in the context of upcoming battles with the Ethiopian army. Several flights preceded the later advance of the Italian army southwards towards the capital Addis Ababa. Further flights took place in central Ethiopia for civilian purposes. As of 1936, the APs were used to prepare highly detailed topographic maps at 1 : 100 000 scale. These APs (1935 - 1941) together with APs of 1958 - 1964, 1994 and recent high-resolution satellite imagery are currently being used in spatially explicit change studies of land cover, land management and (hydro) geomorphology in Ethiopia over a time span of almost 80 years, the first results of which will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Discussion {{is made of}} the Apollo 15 and 16 metric and {{panoramic}} cameras {{which provided}} photographs for accurate topographic portrayal of the lunar surface using photogrammetric methods. Nine stereoscopic models of Apollo 16 metric photographs and three models of panoramic photographs were evaluated photogrammetrically {{in support of the}} Apollo 16 geologic investigations. Four of the models were used to collect profile data for crater morphology studies; three models were used to collect evaluation data for the frequency distributions of lunar slopes; one model was used to prepare a map of the Apollo 16 traverse area; and one model was used to determine elevations of the Cayley Formation. The remaining three models were used to test photogrammetric techniques using oblique metric and panoramic camera photographs. Two preliminary contour maps were compiled and a <b>high-oblique</b> metric <b>photograph</b> was rectified...|$|R
