500|$|Herriman had a {{great love}} of animals, and had {{a large number of}} dogs and cats; he had five dogs and {{thirteen}} cats in 1934. [...] He usually kept to a vegetarian diet, except when <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> too weak, and he refused to ride horses. [...] He so admired Henry Ford's pacifist stance that he would only buy Ford automobiles. He purchased a new model annually.|$|E
500|$|The Star-Ledger {{television}} columnist Alan Sepinwall declared [...] "Sweetums" [...] one of {{the episodes}} he would suggest to newcomers seeking {{to become familiar with}} Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall enjoyed the main story with Leslie and Ron, which he said [...] "returned to a goldmine for the series: the civil servants having to deal with the insane questions and complaints from their constituents". He also felt Tom's subplot was impressive because <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> sympathy for Tom due to his problems with Wendy, despite the fact that Tom was being so inconsiderate to his friends. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly particularly praised Aziz Ansari and Ron Swanson, as well as the moving subplot, which she said spotlighted the show's impressive supporting cast. Gonzalez felt the main plot [...] "fell a little flat", but was helped by the conflict between Leslie and Ron. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode, and said the script keeps the characters grounded without making them into caricatures.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Todd's {{introduction}} to OLTL, he was a competitive athlete. His fraternity {{was the most important}} part of his life; Howarth stated that Todd was [...] "under intense pressure from the male figures in his life". He felt that the key to understanding Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms [...] "spun out of control". Howarth, during an April 1994 Soap Opera Update interview, said that the only thing that he admired about Todd was his clothing style. His interviewer called Todd's early fashion sense [...] "grunge, Salvation Army like 'rags'," [...] and Howarth described Todd's later wardrobe as [...] "all Ralph Lauren" [...] and [...] "ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket". St. John, as Todd's second portrayer, described the character as [...] "kind of both good and bad. He's got his good side with his kids, and yet he is conniving and vicious and all those negative things".|$|E

60|$|The {{only thing}} about 'im that they didn't like was that 'e was a teetotaler. He'd go into public-'ouses with 'em, but he wouldn't drink; leastways, {{that is to}} say, he wouldn't drink beer, and Ginger {{used to say that}} <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>'im</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable to see Bill put away a bottle o' {{lemonade}} every time they 'ad a drink. One night arter 'e had 'ad seventeen bottles he could 'ardly got home, and Peter Russet, who knew a lot about pills and such-like, pointed out to 'im 'ow bad it was for his constitushon. He proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o' Bill's stomach, and that if 'e kept on 'e might drop down dead at any moment.|$|R

500|$|On the character's {{transformation}} Dawson told Digital Spy {{that when}} Darren was younger he was [...] "just a horrible child {{and he had}} nothing nice to say about anyone" [...] before Darren matured and softened. Dawson added that {{it was nice to}} see a different side to the character. Dawson later added that the character's change was good as [...] "everyone goes through changes in their life and Darren just hit that time. It was good timing for him". He also explained that his character becoming a father led him to develop and mature further, stating that Darren accepted his responsibilities as a father and [...] "tries hard to be the father that he wants to be". He felt that Darren enjoyed being a father and that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "complete and like he has a purpose in life, whereas before he was always chasing his tail". Dawson felt that as time went on, Darren became more helpful, sympathetic and more empathetic towards other characters, especially Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Dawson stated, [...] "It's very uncharacteristic but Darren is softening up". Dawson added that Darren's difficult life has led him to mature and act like a [...] "bit of a saint", but that Darren was still greatly misunderstood.|$|E
500|$|Kelly and Darrylâ€™s {{continuing}} relationship {{proves to}} be dysfunctional, as she cannot comprehend his candor, and he finds her to be attractive yet [...] "crazy." [...] Creed Bratton (played by the real-life Creed Bratton) advises Michael to declare bankruptcy, which Michael does literally by walking {{into the office and}} shouting [...] "I declare bankruptcy!", thinking this was all he needed to do. Upon reviewing Michael's financial situation, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) finds that Michael spends a large amount on useless items like magic kits and bass fishing equipment. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam feel sorry for Dwight and attempt to cheer him up by posting a positive review of his bed & breakfast on TripAdvisor.com, which pleases him. [...] However, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) gains Angela's approval to ask her out on a date by giving her the cat (named Garbage) that Dwight had tried to give Angela earlier, sending Dwight spiraling into crushing depression. Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan. Jim joins him and recounts his days pining for Pam and how miserable <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel,</b> saying he would not wish it on his worst enemy, Dwight included, to experience it, and Dwight realizes that he is not without friends. Having re-opened his old memories, Jim re-enters the office, goes right to Pam and kisses her passionately, and indirectly confesses {{in an interview that he}} loves her. Jim is quietly pleased when Dwight returns to his desk along with his annoying and overbearing personality. Jan learns of Michael's dismal finances by phone, and immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. [...] He panics and attempts to hop a nearby train. [...] However, the train is slowing down and comes to a complete halt, upon which he is seen sitting on the train singing to himself. Jan speeds to the office and Oscar tells her in which direction Michael ran. She then runs to the train yard. She tells him that she will stand by him as he did when she was fired. Eventually, they leave the train yard hand in hand.|$|E
2500|$|One {{composer}} Culshaw {{had nothing}} to do with was Mahler. He had a strong aversion to Mahler's music, writing that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> sick: [...] "not metaphorically but physically sick. I find his strainings and heavings, juxtaposed with what always sounds (to me) like faux-naif music of the most calculated type, downright repulsive".|$|E
60|$|Quiet and dark, {{beside him}} stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused {{himself from his}} {{thoughtful}} quest, he fancied, {{from the turn of}} the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at <b>him</b> keenly. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> shudder, and <b>feel</b> very cold.|$|R
60|$|My father {{liked the}} matter {{even less than}} I did. He {{said it was a}} strange and unwarrantable {{performance}} on the part of Chipperton, and he did not understand it. And he certainly did not want to sit {{at the head of the}} table in another man's place. I could not say anything to him to make <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better about <b>it.</b> I <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> worse, indeed, when I told him that Uncle Chipperton did not want his absence explained, or alluded to, any more than could be helped. My father hated to have to keep a secret of this kind.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed to}} have a power of {{reaching}} rather intimate conversation in one silent and cat-like bound, as he had scaled the steep road, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> her <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> to be dangerous, and perhaps unscrupulous. She changed the subject sharply, not without it movement toward gratifying her own curiosity.|$|R
2500|$|Early on, Pinsky was {{inspired}} by the flow and tension of jazz and the excitement that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel.</b> As a former saxophonist, he has said that being a musician was a profoundly influential experience that he has tried to reproduce in his poetry. The musicality of poetry was and is extremely important to his work. Additionally, Pinsky revealed in a 1999 interview with Bomb Magazine that he enjoys jazz for its [...] "physical immediacy, improvisation and also the sense that a lifetime of suffering and study and thought and emotion is behind some single phrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|Growing up, k-os {{was a fan}} {{of artists}} and groups as diverse as New Order, Depeche Mode, RX Bandits, Michael Jackson, Boogie Down Productions, Slick Rick, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Beatles. He {{said that he was}} [...] "insecure" [...] in high school and he pursued his musical ambitions because after {{performing}} at an assembly in his high school gym he realized performing attracted people towards him and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "powerful and... secure". In 1992, he attended Carleton University in Ottawa for one semester to please his father. He returned to Toronto and enrolled into York University. Being friends with Nigel Williams, a member of the band Pocket Dwellers, Nigel encouraged k-os to continue to develop his musical abilities when he was confronted with [...] "difficult forays." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{recasting}} {{the role}} for 2009's Star Trek, Nimoy was asked his opinion. He highlighted {{the work of}} Zachery Quinto, as he felt he looked similar [...] and could sufficiently portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto became the first actor to be cast for the film, and Nimoy agreed to return as the version of the character from the [...] "Prime" [...] universe. Nimoy said that he returned because of the enthusiasm from director J.J. Abrams and the writers, and because <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> appreciated. Nimoy made a final appearance as Spock in Star Trek Into Darkness {{as a favor to}} Abrams. At the time, he did not rule out returning again, but he died prior to the following film. In Star Trek Beyond, Quinto's Spock mourns the loss of Spock Prime, as played by Nimoy.|$|E
60|$|Hayes {{went away}} and Osborn lighted a cigar. He had a {{disturbing}} {{feeling that he}} had been rash. The money would not last long and if he had not borrowed it, he might have paid the interest on other loans. Buying the sheep had really decided him to give the mortgage, since <b>it</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> keenly the embarrassment of having very little money at command. There was another thing; Hayes wanted him to borrow the fresh sum, although a prudent agent would try to keep the estate out of debt. He could not see Hayes' object and felt suspicious, but while he pondered it began to rain and he went into the house.|$|R

For all the trouble Monsieur de Vionnet will ever take!" [...] It {{was the first time she}} had spoken to him of her husband, and he couldn't have expressed how much more intimate with her <b>it</b> suddenly <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't much, in truth--there were other things in what she was saying that were far more; but it was as if, while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers of the past, the single touch had shown the reach of her confidence. [...] "But our friend," [...] she asked, [...] "hasn't then told you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} safe!" [...] Rosier {{declared}} without moving. This might be; but <b>it</b> evidently <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> more so {{to make the}} announcement in rather a loud voice, balancing himself a little complacently on his toes and looking all round the Coliseum {{as if it were}} filled with an audience. Suddenly Isabel saw him change colour; there was more of an audience than he had suspected. She turned and perceived that her two companions had returned from their excursion. [...] "You must really go away," [...] she said quickly. [...] "Ah, my dear lady, pity me!" [...] Edward Rosier murmured in a voice strangely at variance with the announcement I have just quoted. And then he added eagerly, like a man who {{in the midst of his}} misery is seized by a happy thought: [...] "Is that lady the Countess Gemini? I've a great desire to be presented to her." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kyo's older brother, and {{original}} {{heir to the}} Tengu Clan. He is 22 {{years old when he}} is first introduced. Once the clan realized how cruel he is, Kyo became the heir. When he was the heir, he was supposed to marry Misao. However, he is very cruel to her and does not love her, and even slapped her as a child. He hates that his brother was always there in case he failed to harm Misao. [...] The previous Clan Leader called Kyo [...] "the spare tire" [...] or [...] "back-up plan" [...] because Sho was deemed unfit as the heir due to his abusive and cruel nature. [...] While he despises Misao, he hates that she chose Kyo over him because <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> useless to the clan. In later chapters, however, he shows an emotional side, as he saves Misao from being crushed to death inside a storage house. He is later brought back to life by the efforts of his former attendant Roh. In the last battle between the two brothers, he is killed, but warns Kyo that he wouldn't be like him and kill Misao, implying that he read the last pages of the Immortal Fruit Record.|$|E

60|$|If such an {{incident}} did happen, Shirley, reflecting what a ruin of peaceful and humble hopes had been {{wrought by the}} cold policy of the statesman and the iron band of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral from it. It should have taught him that the poor man's hearth is sacred, and that armies and nations {{have no right to}} violate it. <b>It</b> should have <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> that England's triumph and increased dominion could not compensate to mankind nor atone to Heaven for the ashes of a single Acadian cottage. But it is not thus that statesmen and warriors moralize.|$|R
60|$|Winifred {{waited for}} him in a little passion of duty and sacrifice, willing to serve the soldier, if not the man. <b>It</b> only <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> a little more ugly inside. The {{week-end}} was torment to him: {{the memory of the}} camp, the knowledge of the life he led there; even the sight of his own legs in that abhorrent khaki. He felt as if the hideous cloth went into his blood and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> gritty and dirty. Then Winifred so ready to serve the soldier, when she repudiated the man. And this made the grit worse between his teeth. And the children running around playing and calling in the rather mincing fashion of children who have nurses and governesses and literature in the family. And Joyce so lame! It had all become unreal to him, after the camp. It only set his soul on edge. He left at dawn on the Monday morning, glad {{to get back to the}} realness and vulgarity of the camp.|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{relationship}} between Speer and Dorsch was strained. A major bone of contention {{was the fact that}} the OT only had responsibility for building projects outside the Reich. It was now increasingly being employed for construction work at home and needed to have control of the domestic construction industry. Dorsch and Speer fought a bitter battle over the issue, with Dorsch demanding that he be put in charge of all building activity inside the Reich so that new projects could be managed by the OT. Dorsch was secretly an ally of Speer's arch-enemy, Martin Bormann, who recruited him as an agent of the Parteikanzlei (the Nazi Party head office) to spy on Speer; as Speer later put <b>it,</b> Dorsch <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "insecure in my own Ministry". In the spring of 1944, Dorsch instigated a move to oust Speer; although he was unsuccessful, Speer's position was seriously weakened. [...] Speer described the clique led by Dorsch as a [...] "camarilla".|$|R

60|$|Babbitt {{could have}} entered his office from the street, as {{customers}} did, but <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> an insider {{to go through}} the corridor of the building and enter by the back door. Thus he was greeted by the villagers.|$|E
6000|$|She {{lifted her}} hand, blew him a kiss, {{and he saw}} her smiling. Without knowing what his own lips answered, he went out. He could not {{make up his mind}} to go away, but, {{crossing}} to the railings, stood leaning against them, looking up at her windows. She had been very good to him. He felt like a man who has won at cards, and sneaked away without giving the loser his revenge. If only she hadn't loved him; and it had been a soulless companionship, a quite sordid business. Anything rather than this! English to the backbone, he could not divest himself of a sense of guilt. To see no way of making up to her, of straightening <b>it</b> out, <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> intensely mean. 'Shall I go up again?' he thought. The window-curtain moved. Then the shreds of light up there vanished. 'She's gone to bed,' he thought. 'I should only upset her worse. Where is Noel, now, I wonder? I shall never see her again, I suppose. Altogether a bad business. My God, yes! A bad-bad business!' ...|$|R
6000|$|That he {{had hurt}} his father Harold knew, but in exactly what other {{way he could}} have acted he could not tell. The overanxiety on the father's part irritated the boy. Had he been less morbid, less self-accusing, he would have won. Harold passionately loved {{strength}} and decision, especially in a big man like his father, who looked like a soldier and a man of action, and who ought not to cry like a woman. If only he would act all the time as {{he did when he}} threw the sheriff across the walk that day on the street. [...] "I wish he'd stop preaching and go to work at something," [...] he said to Jack. The psychology of the father's attitude toward him was incomprehensible. He could get along very well without a father; why could not his father get along without him? He hated all this fuss, anyway. <b>It</b> only <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> sorry and perplexed, and he wished sincerely that his father would let him alone.|$|R
5000|$|To {{this may}} be added the {{surviving}} version of Austens handwritten copy of the original draft before the editing process outlined above had even started where Austen wrote it in the following nascent form:"He {{found that he was}} considered by his friend Harville, as an engaged Man. The Harvilles entertained not a doubt of a mutual attachment between him & Louisa -- and though this to a degree was contradicted instantly -- <b>it</b> yet <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> that perhaps by her family, be everyone, by herself even, the same idea might be held -- and that he was not free alas! in Heart. -- He had never thought justly on this subject before -- he had not sufficiently considered that this excessive Intimacy at Uppercross must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways, and that while trying whether he c-d (sic) attach himself to either of the Girls, he might be exciting unpleasant reports, if not, raising unrequited regard! -- He found, too late, that he had entangled himself --." ...|$|R

He writes about what he saw, where he saw it, who he was with, what <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> think and <b>feel</b> - the little story of each birdwatching episode, be it goldfinches on his garden feeder, seeing hen harriers nesting underneath a bridge in Glasgow, or the extraordinary rescue of a rare albatross on a Somerset beach. The result is both a unique chronicle of Britain's natural history and a touching and funny piece of autobiography - a year of life measured out in birds...|$|R
500|$|Columbus's second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and {{featured}} Dashâ€”an expatriate bar owner {{for whom}} the Nazis workâ€”and the Monkey King as villains. The Monkey King forces Indiana and Dash to play chess with real people and disintegrates each person who is captured. Indiana subsequently battles the undead, destroys the Monkey King's rod, and marries Clare. Location scouting commenced in Africa but Spielberg and Lucas abandoned Monkey King because of its negative depiction of African natives, and because the script was too unrealistic. Spielberg acknowledged that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> [...] "... <b>feel</b> very old, too old to direct it." [...] Columbus's script was leaked onto the Internet in 1997, and many believed it was an early draft for the fourth film because it was mistakenly dated to 1995.|$|R

With Rose, because he was as little able as anyone else to resist his charm, Philip was even more than usually shy and abrupt; and whether on account of this, unconsciously bent upon exerting the fascination he knew was his only by the results, or whether from sheer kindness of heart, it was Rose who first took Philip into the circle. One day, quite suddenly, he asked Philip if he would walk to the football field with him. Philip flushed.|$|R
