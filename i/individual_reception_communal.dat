40|$|In this book, Jennifer A.

A core premise of the book is that neopragmatism draws attention to an otherwise overlooked aspect of Kant's "Critique of Aesthetic Judgment," and this is the conception of community which it sets forth. While offering an interpretation of Kant's aesthetic theory, the book focuses on the implications of Kant's third Critique for contemporary art. McMahon draws upon Kant and his legacy in pragmatist theories of meaning and language to argue that aesthetic reflective judgment cultivates a capacity exercised by moral judgment, which is conducive to community and plays a pivotal role in the evolution of language, meaning and knowledge.

40|$|If {{relational}} aesthetics aims at fostering {{connections between}} atomised individuals, {{how can this}} be compared to reconceived philosophies of community, especially as trends connected with relational art have paradoxically reinforced both the authorial presence of the artist, and competitive individualism amongst artists? The author considers Claire Bishop’s critique of relational aesthetics, and, through an analysis of Santiago Sierra’s ‘remunerative’ method, finds that her necessary introduction of ‘antagonism’ into any meaningful discussion of social relations nevertheless ends up reinforcing the status and divisions of art. By conceiving of antagonism in terms of quality rather than equality (aesthetics rather than politics), Bishop’s focus remains stuck on the <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> of artworks, rather than on the possibility of transforming art world structures. Examining the work of Paul McCarthy, the author describes how an attack on individualism might be accomplished through ‘self‐ridicule’, whereby the artist is exposed as ‘absent’ – atomised competitor; figure without social function – through his/her physical presence...|$|R

40|$|Networks {{consisting}} of low-cost wireless sensors {{have been the}} subject of extensive research, with applications ranging from environmental monitoring to building control systems, to name a few. In this paper we consider networks intended to provide wide area coverage of one or more physical, chemical, or biological parameters. We envision a target average data rate per sensor of 1 - 5 bps and transmission ranges of up to 100 m. Unlike conventional networks, the goal of wide-area parameter characterization can be achieved even with less than 100 reliability, a feature that allows us to propose a novel ultra-low-cost architecture based on redundant sensors. To achieve the low-cost goal, sensor nodes include no receivers, and they transmit their information to a central reader using radio backscatter. This communication modality makes it possible to achieve a few years of battery life with small and inexpensive batteries. Performance impact due to absence of <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> acknowledgement in this unidirectional communication channel is offset mainly by transmitter spatial diversity achieved through deployment of additional nodes.

40|$|Maintaining {{low power}} {{consumption}} is critical in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. With packet transmissions and re-transmissions consuming much of the energy resources in wireless networks, it becomes important to minimize the number of transmissions associated with the end-to-end delivery of packets. Power-aware routing algorithms must balance {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of selecting to forward packets over shorter high-quality links against selecting longer and less reliable links. This paper proposes a new power-aware geographic routing technique that combines geographic greedy routing with proba-bilistic random walks to recover from local minima (i. e., cases when the forwarding node is not aware of any neighboring node providing “greedy ” progress towards the destination). Building upon previous power-aware protocols without recovery mecha-nisms, our protocol uses simple distance metrics that combine information about the <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> rates between node pairs and the relative forward progress candidate nodes provide towards the target destination. The combined metrics are used to make greedy choices (when at least one node provides progress) and probabilistic choices (when the packet recovers from a local minimum). Using simulations we show that power-aware routing significantly reduces the energy consumption in the network, and our probabilistic recovery mechanism can significantly increase the delivery rates with only a small decrease in energy efficiency.

40|$|Miłosz’s later poetry {{attempts}} {{to overcome the}} (post) modernist gap between the author as a textual effect {{and the subject of}} autobiography. An important stage on this road was his poetry book (in fact, a long poem in its own right) Nieobjęta ziemia [Unattainable Earth]. Its form is clearly dialogical. The collection mixes authorial poems with various examples of “heteroglossia”. Particularly striking is the prominent presence of Walt Whitman’s poetry. Whitmanian poetics assume that fully experiencing reality presupposes the existence of a community. The task of poetry consists in conceiving artistic structures that, when they are “concretized”, allow the reader to participate in such a community. Nieobjęta ziemia tries {{to come to terms with}} the Whitmanian challenge. The poetical subject in this somewhat modified example of the modern “sylva rerum” experiences its link with the “other” by an <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> of artifacts that point to the communal essence of humanity. Nieobjęta ziemia, realizing community in the field of poetics “performatively”, incorporates these artifacts into the text. Particularly important seems to be the role played by poems translated by Miłosz himself (they are explicitly labeled as translations), and that represent the human condition called by Whitman “en masse”.

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} ‘the child’ is a discursive {{construct}} deployed by broadcasters, regulators, and viewers {{that tells us}} {{a lot about how}} television is understood in culture. Centralised broadcast and dispersed <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> of television since the 1930 s enable versions of public service broadcasting that attempt to raise cultural, educational and social standards, and television’s address to children promotes inclusion but also individuation, shared cultural references but also taste discrimination, and forms of distinction and inequality through which British social life is reproduced. Some British children’s programmes also sell overseas, because of a shared ideology about what childhood is. In the Western world, childhood is seen in two contrasting ways. On one hand, children have been regarded as irrational, immoral and in need of adult guidance. But on the other hand, children are also regarded as innocent, and naturally predisposed to be good. Regulation has therefore aimed to protect ‘vulnerable’ children, yet ironically, in Britain greater regulation has decimated children’s television production. Regulation on behalf of children is a special case of more general attempts to control audiences, and inasmuch as ‘the child’ is necessarily an ‘other’, he or she is always elsewhere.

30|$|In {{this journal}} article, we have {{investigated}} the effect of beaconing on network dwell time using cumulative probability and <b>individual</b> successful beacon <b>reception.</b> This work has proved {{that the size of}} the beacon directly affects the <b>individual</b> packet <b>reception</b> probability (i.e. the value of P changes), especially the probability distribution of the first packet P 1 and hence affects both single reception probability as well as the cumulative reception probability. However, the frequency of the beacon only affects the cumulative probability, and hence, this shows that the effect of beacon size and beacon frequency is orthogonal to each other with regard to the network dwell time. In addition, the rate of change of the probability, i.e. (Δ P) is affected by the velocity of the vehicle and the velocity affects both the cumulative probability and the probability of successful reception. Hence, though the size and frequency of the beacon have orthogonal effects, the velocity of the vehicle affects both of these parameters. This work therefore significantly enhances our attempt to build a full-blown analytical model that encompasses all layers in an attempt to provide seamless handover.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} advances {{the explanation}} of behaviour of creative art, design and communication practitioners. It uses notions of receiver persuasion and gratification as analytic tools to understand perceptions of people starting businesses in the creative sector. The study shows {{the importance of the}} personal perceptions of the cultural message sender and that sender-recipient tensions among creative art, design and communication practitioners are detrimental {{to the development of the}} government’s enterprise culture. The entrepreneurially unusual responses of such practitioners to enterprise culture norms indicate that a subculture of entrepreneurial practice might exist. Blending notions from cognitive anthropology, cultural schemas and audience reception of culture to explore art, design and communication practises makes the methodology and focus of this work original. It borrows multidisciplinary perspectives of communication and enterprise to examine perception themes of creative practitioners. The paper asserts that although <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> and acceptance of norms in the enterprise culture operates through reciprocal benefits, the basis of that reciprocity differs from mainstream entrepreneurs.

Particulary it will be discussed a) how the issue of ambivalence/polyvalence and its (literary) perception is treated in both fields and b) if there are any possibilities to find out by psychophysical experiments how perception works in the reading process so one can reconstruct impartially intersubjective validated mental images produced by reading literay texts. It will be claimed that both in literature and cognitive science one is confrontated with subjective forms and ways of perception. Both disciplines describe how signals from the outside world are interpreted and constructed to a (readable) world (Heinz von Foerster). Where cognitive science accents the research of the processes inside the brain and how it forms by inherent structures in combination with given sense-data its ‘reality’, literature can focus on the act on how personal conceptions, ideas and associations are transformed in words and texts and how these verbal representations of perceptions interact, correspond or confront with the society and its historical and/or cultural different forms and norms of perception. So we think that perception is always also a social phenomenon as it is communicated and evaluated by language and other signs and signals and language can also—for good or bad—replace one’s own perceptions. Both the brain and literature are so to say filter-tools that form and construct ‘as-if-realities’, but, following Bachtin and its concept of dialogical literature, literary texts boost ambiguities and polysemies where in contrast the biological perception-apparatus is inclined to establish a monological and unambigous reality.

40|$|Chapter I {{examines}} {{the text of}} the Manuel des Péchés. A new concept of the genuine structure and subsequent corruption of the poem is evolved with close reference to internal and external (MS.) evidence. Previous claims that the Manuel was designed for the edification of laypeople are shown, with detailed attention to the text, to be indefensible. The poem is a tract which promotes observance of a sacramental law and which was designed for repeated study and absorption by a general clerical readership. Chapter II begins with an unprecedented positive identification and biography of the author of the Manuel. William of Waddington was a secular canon and a prominent figure in the legal hierarchy of the Diocese of York. The MS. circulation is thereafter investigated. Copies of the work almost instantly reached clerical individuals and institutions throughout England. Waddington's intended and achieved audiences are nearly identical. Chapter III considers the text of Handlyng Synne. It is demonstrated that this poem was not, as some have claimed, intended for systematic use in a program of education of the laity. It does not promote the sacrament of confession and it removes much of the reformative material in the Manuel. It was designed for random and selective group and <b>individual</b> <b>reception</b> by unsophisticated laypeople and clerics from' the author's region. Through local stories, a familiar tone, and an uncomplicated and leisurely style Robert Mannyng, the author, transformed the Manuel into a local story-book/directory of sin. Chapter IV traces the MS. circulation of Handlyng Synne. The poem was received for the most part by the ordinary lay and religious people for whom it was intended. Chapter V studies the text and MSS. of the stanzaic redaction of Handlyng Synne by Peter Idley. It is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the work commonly called Idley's Instructions to His Son,/em> seems in fact to be two independent and internally unrelated poems (the second being the redaction of Mannyng's work) which initially circulated separately and which were subsequently fused by a scribe. A biography uncovering Idley's connections with literary society is provided. He transformed Mannyng's poem into a guide to prosperity for the prosperous. Deft additions to and deletions from his source often cunningly reassure men of position that wealth is a product of virtue, and largely irrelevant borrowings from Lydgate's Fall of Princes are appropriately fashionable. The MSS. indicate that the poem achieved geographically wide circulation among the prosperous laity for whom it was intended. These three poems were in practice received by the audiences for whom they were intended. While the texts share a common core of content, they are extremely different from each other in purpose and audience. There is, however, a fringe audience of interconnected northern landed families who took an interest in all three texts. At the center of this network is a family closely connected with the village of Waddington, Lancashire, the birthplace of the author of the Manuel, and more distantly linked with Mannyng's birthplace and with apparent ancestors of associates of Idley. These and other matters are developed in the nine appendices which conclude the thesis. </p...|$|R

Canuto & Xu Xiaoxis {{first feature}} film, {{produced}} as a graduation {{work in their}} Master of Fine Arts at the New York Film Academy (Los Angeles) in Hollywood. The story follows three family members (mother, daughter and son) {{as they try to}} survive their loneliness and obsessions by going through different sexual experiences and relationships with a prostitute. [...] "This film has a flamboyant style that is oddly downplayed by characters that tend to be frustrated by the barrenness of their urban living.

40|$|Objective. Determine the {{infection}} status with pathogenic Leptospira of one Saguinus oedipus and nine Saguinus leucopus at the Cali Zoo {{that had been}} confiscated in Colombia from illegal trade. Materials and methods. A full physical examination, blood work, urinalysis were conducted in all <b>individuals</b> during the <b>reception</b> health check-up, in addition to running the microagglutination test with a pool of 19 serovars, with a starting dilution of 1 : 50. Results. A high positive titer (≥ 1 : 3200) to Leptospira alexanderi serovar manhao in an asymptomatic S. oedipus was detected. All S. leucopus tested negative or less than 1 : 50. Conclusions. Captive locations have been documented to artificially enhance opportunities to {{come into contact with}} contaminated bodily fluids from peridomestic rodents. However, infectious diseases acquired during the illegal transport of wildlife to major metropolitan centers are rarely considered a wildlife conservation or public health threat. Infection with zoonotic pathogens should also be considered an additional threat to endangered wild primates involved in illegal trade, which could hamper reintroduction efforts or other population management procedures for primate species with restricted and fragmented distributions...|$|R
