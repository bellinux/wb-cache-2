5000|$|Christianity {{presents}} a goal which Kierkegaard calls an eternal happiness and Christ called [...] "Paradise". Jesus said, [...] "Verily I say to you, today {{you will be}} with me in Paradise." [...] {{or it might be}} [...] "Verily I say to you today, you will be with me in Paradise." [...] (Luke 23.43) to the thief on the cross. The goal was very close for the thief but might not be so close for the single individual {{who wants to be a}} Christian. Kierkegaard asks why the Christian should not set a few intermediate goals that can be accomplished before the eternal happiness arrives. One does not have to start with saving the world. Kierkegaard suggested exploring the relationship between pride and cowardliness to see if one of these two passions is keeping you from reaching intermediate goals. He has advice for goal setters. Stop talking and start! Don't worry so much about the outcome. Set a goal for yourself and try to reach it. It's alright if you fail because you can start again immediately. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>help,</b> ask someone. But this goal should be something in particular, something concrete, so that your passions can be aroused. If Christianity is the task then it's a task that lasts a lifetime.|$|E
