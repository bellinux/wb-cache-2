5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects,</b> to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects,</b> developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil parrot {{remains were}} later {{excavated}} from grottos on Réunion and reported in 1996. X-rays {{of the two}} existing stuffed Mascarene parrots {{made it possible to}} compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to Réunion as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects,</b> they were more {{similar to those of the}} Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.|$|E
5|$|The Kclass proved {{successful}} on well-maintained track. It {{was capable}} of high speeds on express passenger duties, although their use was limited by the lower storage capacity of tank locomotives, which meant the Kand K1classes were prone to water shortages on the long Kent Coast routes, and precluded them from working many of the former London and South Western Railway (LSWR) routes west of London. The need to save weight meant that compromises were made <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of the design. The boiler size was constrained by the SECR’s axle-loading restrictions, {{with the result that}} the design’s full steaming potential was not realised. The failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler would also affect Maunsell’s subsequent 2-6-0 classes, as they were given the same boiler despite their lower axle-loadings.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
