40|$|The {{establishment}} of an accurate global carbon budget and the consequent ability to understand and predict future environmental change is dependent on knowing the strength of terrestrial sinks and sources of carbon. Regenerating tropical forests {{are one of the}} major terrestrial carbon sinks as they are found growing quickly and are sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Total forest biomass (which includes above and below ground living mass of plants and litter) is a measure of terrestrial vegetation carbon content. It follows that to determine the strength of terrestrial carbon sinks we require information on the location, extent, biomass and biomass change of regenerating tropical forests. Near-constant cloud cover over the tropics and an insensitivity to biomass change at relatively low levels of biomass has limited the use of optical imagery but not Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for the provision of such information. The biophysical properties of regenerating tropical forests are related to the temporal, spatial, spectral and polarisation characteristics of SAR backscatter (a°) and this formed the framework for this thesis. The objectives were to (i) detect biomass accumulation using the temporal characteristics of 0 °, (ii) use the spatial characteristics of a° (texture) to increase the strength of the a 7 biomass relationship and (ill) use the spectral and polarisation characteristics of 0 ° to classify a surrogate for biomass in regenerating tropical forests (optical Landsat TM data were also included to widen the spectral analysis). Although no biomass change was detectable using temporal 0 °, a seasonal pattern in 0 ° for young regenerating forest was detected, as a result of changing water content in both vegetation and soil. The influence of recent rainfall was confirmed to be an important source of variation in a°, suggesting the use of SAR data from the dry season only. Using simulated data, seven texture measures showed potential for strengthening the a 7 biomass relationship. However, when applied to real SAR data only GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) derived contrast strengthened the a 7 biomass relationship. The addition of GLCM-derived contrast to a° potentially increases the accuracy of biomass estimation and mapping. Neural networks can be used for the classification of land cover in tropical <b>forest</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>Classification</b> accuracy of around 80 % was achieved using combined multiwavelength and multipolarisation SAR and Landsat TM bands for 4 land cover classes (pasture, mature forest, 0 - 5 years old regenerating forests and 6 - 18 years old regenerating forest). These results demonstrated that multiwavelength and multipolarisation SAR data could provide information on the location, and extent of regenerating tropical forests. However an increase in the accuracy of biomass estimation relies on the optimal use of additional information that resides within the spatial, spectral and polarisation domains of SAR data...|$|E
40|$|In very humid regions the {{presence}} of clouds is constant, which promotes the use of radar, {{due to the fact}} of microwaves dont suffer atmospheric interference, allowing the imaging in these areas, regardless of weather conditions in the region. Moreover, the way the radar signal interacts with the targets could allow a better discrimination of features of study. In this context, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the use of interferometric coherence images of the polarimetric radar ALOS/PALSAR to discriminate classes of land cover in the region of the Tapajos National <b>Forest,</b> through supervised <b>region</b> <b>classification</b> using the Battacharyya distance. The use of interferometric coherence attribute, measured from the complex correlation coefficient between two images of an interferometric pair, to discriminate classes of land cover in the <b>forest</b> <b>regions</b> is justified {{by the fact that it}} is expected low interferometric coherence in areas for typical forests (primary, secondary and regeneration), in contrast to areas of bare soil and land use (agriculture or pasture) that are associated with higher values of coherence. Classifications were made on combinations of interferometric coherence and an intensity images. The kappa coefficient of agreement was used to compare the results. It was possible to conclude that the interferometric coherence represented an increase in quality when combined with the intensity image. Pages: 7489 - 749...|$|R
40|$|The ALOS PALSAR sensor {{can provide}} full polarimetric SAR data (HH, HV and VV) but the full polarimetric mode is only {{available}} experimentally. Here, several supervised classifiers {{have been studied}} {{to determine how much}} the use of full polarized (HH, VV and HV, no phase information) PALSAR data information can improve, or not, the overall classification accuracy in comparison with the standard products, which, for PALSAR instrument, is the HH (like JERS- 1) or the dual polarization product HH-HV. The study area, Tapajós National Forest at the south of Santarém City, in the Brazilian Amazon, Pará State, has being object of intensive scientific observation for more than 15 years. Several types of supervised classifiers are tested for having, as much as possible, an assessment rather independent of the classifier type. Initial results indicate that, no phase considered, the dual polarization product HH-HV is the better channels combination for mapping the set of tropical classes composed by the primary forest, secondary forest, bare soil, agriculture and degraded forest. Also, it was observed that one year regeneration areas are not discriminated in any PALSAR combination, which indicates the utility of maintaining the complementary use of optical images when possible, because, in the optical combination, the one year regeneration class still shows different from secondary <b>forest.</b> <b>Region</b> based <b>classification,</b> particularly one developed to take in account as much as possible the radar statistical behavior, generally presented better performance.
