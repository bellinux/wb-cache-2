5|$|The Grinch realizes {{then that}} Christmas <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than its trappings. The book criticizes {{the commercialization of}} Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday. The tale was adapted into a 1966 short {{animated}} film for television with a screenplay by Seuss and narration by Boris Karloff. Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not enough}} to suggest that the novel with its {{multiple}} endings is a mere experiment with the narrative form. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> in it," [...] as Mandal puts it, [...] "an impasse that resists any straight forward resolution to the story." [...] After all, the form of a narrative is determined by its content. It is Sarah Woodruff [...] "the content of whose character produces multiple and contradictory possibilities" [...] for the narrative.|$|E

[...] The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, [...] "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than just an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on." ...|$|E

[...] {{and tries to}} communicate her thoughts to George but, [...] "...his sexual desire kindles her own, and she loses touch with the intellectual, spiritual, and creative potentials of her emotion. At last, however, George begins to perceive that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> to be communicated {{between men and women}} than physical encounter..." [...] Yet this lesson is not solidified for the young reporter when, after boasting in a bar in the story [...] "An Awakening", he has a surge of [...] "masculine power" [...] and tries to seduce Belle Carpenter, only to be repelled and humiliated by her beau, the large-fisted bartender, Ed Handby.|$|E
500|$|Setting {{the opera}} in Japan, an exotic locale {{far away from}} Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British {{politics}} and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, [...] "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution." [...] G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: [...] "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt {{if there is a}} single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than a satire; he is the truth." [...] Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including The Gondoliers, Utopia Limited, and The Grand Duke.|$|E
500|$|... "Brother, Brother", {{the first}} song on the album, is {{inspired}} by the band members' experience with the drug use of friends. Bawinkel stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "a bunch of the tunes cover what we wanted to say to them during those times [...]" [...] Michael Weaver, writing for Jesus Freak Hideout, interpreted the song as an attempt to convince this individual to turn his or her life around and return to the Christian faith. The next track, named [...] "The Rich, The Strong and The Poor", tells the story of three men looking for happiness. The first tries to find it in money, but he returns unfulfilled. The second tries looking for happiness in physical strength. He believes that if he proves himself, that he will find peace. Like the first man, he ends up unfulfilled. The final man looks for happiness in basic life needs and likewise ends up in the same position as the first two men. Bawinkel explains that, [...] "all three are very much in the same position in that happiness hasn’t been found in chasing these various desires. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> which is hopeful for some and frustrating for others." ...|$|E

5000|$|Driven by a piano {{melody and}} mid-tempo percussion, the ballad {{is focused on}} Vesely's vocals, as he wails about self-revelation and purpose in life: [...] "There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> Do we know what we're {{fighting}} for?... I fooled everyone and now what will I become? I have to start this over... There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> Do we know what we're fighting for?", the hypnotic ballad reflects on learning how to forgive and move on from a shattered relationship.|$|R
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E

In fact, the man is the greater part. The personal welfare of the operator must be considered. This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than the man’s relation to the machine.

2500|$|... {{so much is}} made of the deep, deep exculpatory {{shame of}} illiteracy– {{despite the fact that}} burning 300 people to death doesn't require reading skills– that some worshipful {{accounts}} of the novel (by those who buy into its ludicrous premise, perhaps because it's been declared [...] "classic" [...] and [...] "profound") actually seem to affirm that illiteracy <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> to be ashamed of than participating in mass murder... Lack of reading skills is more disgraceful than listening in bovine silence to the screams of 300 people as they are burned to death behind the locked doors of a church you're guarding to prevent them from escaping the flames. Which is what Hanna did, although, of course, it's not shown in the film.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} biblical interpretations {{explain that}} Sheol is a grim and desolated land below, {{occupied by the}} dead who continue their colorless existence irrespective of their earthly conduct. Contrary to this exposition however, the Hebrew Bible supports the descriptions of Sheol which suggest that it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than just a place. In terms of sheer numbers the amount of anthropomorphic descriptions is significant. [...] Sheol is either portrayed by means of human qualities ( [...] , Job 26:6; [...] , Canticles 8:6 [...] desire isaiah 5:14) or attributed with the elements of human anatomy: womb ( [...] , Jonah 2:3), hand ( [...] , Psalms 49:15; 89:48; Hosea 13:14) and mouth ( [...] , Psalms 141:7; Isaiah 5:14). In addition, [...] praises Elohim, {{who is said to}} ransom one’s soul from the hand of Sheol, [...] acknowledges Sheol’s insatiability, whereas [...] depicts Sheol as a gargantuan monster.|$|E

2500|$|By {{setting the}} opera {{in a foreign}} land, Gilbert felt able to more sharply criticise British society and institutions. [...] G. K. Chesterton {{compared}} the satire in the opera to that in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: [...] "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did. ... I doubt {{if there is a}} single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England, Pooh-bah <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than a satire; he is the truth." [...] The opera's setting draws on Victorian notions of the far east, gleaned by Gilbert from the glimpses of Japanese fashion and art that immediately followed the beginning of trade between the two island empires, and during rehearsals, Gilbert visited the popular Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge, London. A critic wrote in 2016: [...] "It has been argued that the theatricality of the show was ... a tribute on the part of Gilbert and Sullivan to the growing British appreciation of the Japanese aesthetic [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Since all {{fiction is}} {{essentially}} untrue, Martin believes {{it needs to}} reflect reality at least in its core. He agrees with William Faulkner's statement in his Nobel Prize speech that [...] "the human heart in conflict with itself" [...] {{is the only thing}} worth writing about, regardless of the genre. He thus tried to give the story a little more historical fiction feel than a fantastic feel like previous authors' books, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more emphasis on swordplay and battles and political intrigue. The Atlantic noted that the series attempts to mash together fantasy and realism as two seemingly contradictory genres of literature, and Martin's books are generally praised for their realism. The Atlantic saw the realist heart of the Ice and Fire books in that [...] "magic lingers only {{on the periphery of the}} world in which the characters dwell, and <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> terrifying than wondrous. [...] It's a fantasy story that defies expectations by ultimately being less about a world we'd like to escape, at times becoming uncomfortably familiar to the one we live in." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{there did}} indeed exist [...] "psychological laws" [...] as Proust calls them. These laws and this system are the {{consequences}} of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called [...] "the mimetic character of desire." [...] This is the content of his first book, Deceit, Desire and the Novel (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person—the model—for this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object is not direct: there is always a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the object, one is drawn to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator: it is in fact the model who is sought. Girard calls desire [...] "metaphysical" [...] in the measure that, as soon as a desire <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than a simple need or appetite, [...] "all desire is a desire to be", it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also our}} view that Lessig and later Ninth Circuit {{decisions}} refining and applying it are {{inconsistent with the}} policy of the Sherman Act. The purpose of the Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest. Thus, this Court and other courts have been careful to avoid constructions of § 2 which might chill competition, rather than foster it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm activity is unlike concerted activity covered by § 1, which [...] "inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk." [...] Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 767-769, 104 S.Ct., at 2739-2740. For these reasons, § 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so. Id., at 767, 104 S.Ct., at 2739. The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to further anticompetitive ends is plainly not met by inquir ing only whether the defendant has engaged in [...] "unfair" [...] or [...] "predatory" [...] tactics. Such conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case also requires inquiry into the relevant product and geographic market and the defendant's economic power in that market.|$|E
2500|$|The 1920s {{contained}} {{analysis of}} the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In Road to Xanadu (1927), a book length study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and [...] "Kubla Khan", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were [...] "two {{of the most remarkable}} poems in English". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, [...] "Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing modus operandi of his genius, in the fresh light which I hope I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself." [...] After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, [...] "with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are like to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu." [...] He continued by describing the power of the poem: [...] "For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings." [...] Lowes then concluded about the two works: [...] "Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, {{is an integral part of}} a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory." [...] George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's {{analysis of the}} poems [...] "will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism." [...] Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, [...] "Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' finished" ...|$|E
