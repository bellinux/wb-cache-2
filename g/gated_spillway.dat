40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} <b>Gated</b> <b>Spillways</b> and Fuse Plugs {{from an economic}} perspective. Life Cycle Cost Analysis was carried out for both these alternatives.

40|$|<b>Gated</b> <b>spillways</b> {{are often}} {{necessary}} to provide both operational flexibility and discharge capacity to pass large flood events. However, <b>gated</b> <b>spillways</b> present operational challenges to dam owners and operators, often necessitating development of a flood operations plan (FOP) that is used {{in tandem with the}} dam’s emergency action plan (EAP). Even a well-intentioned and robust FOP/EAP can require personnel to predict flooding, use judgment particular to the requirements of the plan, and react quickly. In addition, all of the equipment required to operate the gates need to function as designed and be operated in accordance with the FOP. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the risks related to gate operations during floods, considering operations in accordance with the FOP, as well as operations that deviate from the FOP/EAP due to operator (human) error or system (mechanical/electrical/structural) malfunction. Case studies are presented to evaluate the downstream impacts of gate operations (or misoperation) for a range of flood events. A basis for quantitative evaluation of risks is included. Considerations for improving operation plans and replacement of <b>spillway</b> <b>gates</b> with more reliable passive systems are presented in the context of risk framework.

40|$|Head-discharge curves in <b>gated</b> <b>spillways</b> are {{commonly}} obtained {{by means of}} the application of empirical formulations. The most popular one, recommended by SPANCOLD [1], was developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers [2].

40|$|Safety {{inspection}} of large dams in Taiwan is conducted every 5 years. The practice {{does not take}} into consideration uncertainty of dam conditions. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the optimal dam inspection interval under the consideration of overtopping risk incorporating uncertainty gate availability. In earlier studies, assessment of overtopping risk only considered the uncertainties in reservoir properties and natural randomness of hydrologic events without giving much thought to the availability of <b>spillway</b> <b>gates.</b> As a result, the overtopping risk could be underestimated. In this study, an innovative concept is proposed to evaluate dam overtopping by taking into account <b>spillway</b> <b>gate</b> availability. The framework consists of three parts: (1) evaluation of conditional overtopping risk for different numbers of malfunctioning spillway gates; (2) evaluation of <b>spillway</b> <b>gate</b> availability; and (3) dam inspection scheduling. Furthermore, considerations are given to overtopping risk, inspection cost, and dam break cost for determining the optimal inspection schedule. The methodology is applied to the Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan and to evaluate its time-dependent overtopping risk. Results show that overtopping risk considering the availability of the <b>spillway</b> <b>gates</b> is higher than the one without considering the availability of the <b>spillway</b> <b>gates...</b>|$|R

The fusegates are the largest in the world, and are designed to open automatically by water pressure when Lake Kaweah reaches dangerously high levels. The design was chosen because it would provide cost savings over conventional options such as a concrete or <b>gated</b> <b>spillway.</b>|$|E
