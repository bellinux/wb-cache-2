Semiconductor based circuits and traditional <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memories</b> will malfunction {{when exposed to}} extreme environments, such as space and nuclear reactor. The mechanisms for radiation effect are mainly attributed to the radiation-induced charging of the oxide in a CMOS device. Spintronics is an emerging area of nanoscale electronics involving the detection and manipulation of electron spin. The magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), based on the intrinsic spin of the electron, {{can be used as}} the storage elements in non-volatile magnetoresistive <b>random-access</b> <b>memories</b> (MRAMs). In this effort, we study radiation tolerance of MTJs by exposing the devices in gamma and neutron radiation environment. Theoretical model for the radiation-induced defects is analyzed in this work. Experiments of the MgO-based MTJs under the conditions of pre- and post-radiation are concluded. MTJs were irradiated with gamma ray to a total dose of 10 Mrad. During the neutron irradiation, total epithermal neutron fluence up to 2. 9 × 10 ¹⁵/cm² was obtained. The experimental results show that neither the electrical nor the magnetic properties of MTJs are affected by the radiation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of bottom electrodes (Pt, Ir, Ru) on {{the degradation of}} (Ba,Sr) TiO 3 (BST) thin films under dc stress condi-tions was investigated. The current-time (–) and current–voltage (–) measurement results indicated that the BST thin films de-posited on Ru have faster degradation than those deposited on Pt and Ir. The degradation was considered to be caused by the dete-rioration of Schottky-barrier. Under dc stress conditions, the di-electric relaxation current in the BST dielectric films probably en-hances the deterioration. The breakdown time was found to be ap-proximated by an exponential function of an electric field [= exp () ] for dc stress. The value of the exponential factor for BST deposited on Pt and Ir was about a quarter of that for BST deposited on Ru. The different value of observed under dc stress indicates that the degradation of BST on Ru would be more serious than on Pt and Ir. The ten years lifetime of time-dependent dielec-tric breakdown (TDDB) studies indicate that BST on Pt, Ir and Ru have longer lifetime over ten years on operation at the voltage bias of 1 V.

40|$|For large memory capacities, {{stand-by}} systems usually need {{a considerable}} amount of redundant hardware, {{not only because of the}} spare components, but for storing fault conditions and for carrying out the necessary reconfiguration. As alternatives, two methods of implementing fault tolerance by means of <b>dynamic</b> redundancy in <b>random-access</b> <b>memories</b> are proposed which allow the treatment of memory-chip faults at the interface of the memory. The memory reliability for both approaches is estimated by a simple model. These methods improve the reliability considerably compared to conventional memory fault tolerance methods, and the size of the units of reconfiguration can be tailored to the demands of the system user...|$|R

25|$|While Intel {{created the}} first commercially {{available}} microprocessor (Intel 4004) in 1971 {{and one of the}} first microcomputers in 1972, by the early 1980s its business was dominated by <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the IBM personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.|$|E

2500|$|Synchronous <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (SDRAM) is any <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (DRAM) {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal. DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input. [...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks, allowing the device to operate on a memory access commands in each bank simultaneously and speed access in an interleaved fashion. [...] This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1981, MOS Technology, Inc., Commodore's {{integrated}} circuit design subsidiary, initiated {{a project to}} design the graphic and audio chips for a next generation video game console. Design work for the chips, named MOS Technology VIC-II (Video Integrated Circuit for graphics) and MOS Technology SID (Sound Interface Device for audio), was completed in November 1981. Commodore then began a game console project that would use the new chips—called the Ultimax or the Commodore MAX Machine, engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled {{after just a few}} machines were manufactured for the Japanese market. At the same time, Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Russell (system programmer and architect on the VIC-20) and Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Yannes (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the Commodore PET line aimed at business users.

The team was able to quickly design the computer because, unlike most other home-computer companies, Commodore had its own semiconductor fab to produce test chips; because the fab was not running at full capacity, development costs were part of existing corporate overhead. The chips were complete by November, by which time Charpentier, Winterble, and Tramiel had decided to proceed with the new computer; the latter set a final deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).|$|E
