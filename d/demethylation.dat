5|$|Nonstandard {{amino acids}} are usually formed through {{modifications}} to standard amino acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} <b>demethylation</b> of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine, while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{sequences}} (siRNA and miRNA) {{that are}} complementary {{to parts of}} a promoter can increase gene transcription, a phenomenon dubbed RNA activation. Part of the mechanism for how these RNA upregulate genes is known: dicer and argonaute are involved, possibly via histone <b>demethylation.</b> miRNAs have been proposed to upregulate their target genes upon cell cycle arrest, via unknown mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Histones H3 and H4 {{can also}} be {{manipulated}} through <b>demethylation</b> using histone lysine demethylase (KDM). This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC). The <b>demethylation</b> occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it. JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.|$|E

25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of mirtazapine {{is about}} 50%. It is found mostly bound to plasma proteins, about 85%. It is metabolized {{primarily in the}} liver by <b>demethylation</b> and hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 enzymes. One of its major metabolites is desmethylmirtazapine. The overall elimination half-life is 20–40 hours. About 75% is eliminated in feces and 25% in urine.|$|E
25|$|Temazepam {{has very}} good bioavailability, with almost 100% being absorbed from the gut. The drug is metabolized through {{conjugation}} and <b>demethylation</b> prior to excretion. Most {{of the drug}} is excreted in the urine, with about 20% appearing in the faeces. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of temazepam (90%); the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl temazepam was a minor metabolite (7%).|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{methylation}} {{activity is}} necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive <b>demethylation.</b> DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase {{that is responsible for}} copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to {{ketoconazole}} {{has been}} observed {{in a number of}} clinical fungal isolates, including Candida albicans. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha <b>demethylation</b> step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{encoding}} CYP enzymes, and the enzymes themselves, {{are designated}} with the root symbol CYP for the superfamily, {{followed by a}} number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene. The convention is to italicise the name when referring to the gene. For example, CYP2E1 is the gene that encodes the enzyme CYP2E1—one of the enzymes involved in paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolism. The CYP nomenclature is the official naming convention, although occasionally CYP450 or CYP450 is used synonymously. However, some gene or enzyme names for CYPs may differ from this nomenclature, denoting the catalytic activity {{and the name of}} the compound used as substrate. Examples include CYP5A1, thromboxane A2 synthase, abbreviated to TBXAS1 (ThromBoXane A2 Synthase 1), and CYP51A1, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, sometimes unofficially abbreviated to LDM according to its substrate (Lanosterol) and activity (<b>DeMethylation).</b>|$|E

Additionally, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (BDMBA) can be produced also by oxidative deamination.

2500|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{patterns are}} largely erased and then re-established between generations in mammals. Almost {{all of the}} methylations from the parents are erased, first during gametogenesis, and again in early embryogenesis, with <b>demethylation</b> and remethylation occurring each time. [...] <b>Demethylation</b> in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages – initially in the zygote, then {{during the first few}} embryonic replication cycles of morula and blastula. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. [...] This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{erythromycin}} is metabolised by <b>demethylation</b> in {{the liver}} by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%-15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. [...] Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5-2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food.|$|E

2500|$|Diazepam {{undergoes}} {{oxidative metabolism}} by <b>demethylation</b> (CYP 2C9, 2C19, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5), hydroxylation (CYP 3A4 and 2C19) and glucuronidation {{in the liver}} {{as part of the}} cytochrome P450 enzyme system. It has several pharmacologically active metabolites. The main active metabolite of diazepam is desmethyldiazepam (also known as nordazepam or nordiazepam). Its other active metabolites include the minor active metabolites temazepam and oxazepam. These metabolites are conjugated with glucuronide, and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug. Diazepam has a biphasic half-life of about one to three days, and two to seven days for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. [...] Most of the drug is metabolised; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged. [...] The elimination half-life of diazepam and also the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action, as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration.|$|E

50|$|DNA <b>demethylation</b> is {{the process}} of removal of a methyl group from {{nucleotides}} in DNA. DNA <b>demethylation</b> could be passive or active. The passive process takes place in the absence of methylation of newly synthesised DNA strands by DNMT1 during several replication rounds (for example, upon 5-Azacytidine treatment).

50|$|In humans, several {{metabolic}} pathways for galantamine exist. These pathways lead to {{the formation}} of a number of different metabolites. One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the glucuronidation of galantamine. Additionally, galantamine may undergo oxidation or <b>demethylation</b> at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites. Galantamine can undergo <b>demethylation</b> at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation. Lastly, galantamine may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing <b>demethylation</b> or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or <b>demethylation</b> and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom.|$|E
