500|$|In early 1947, {{with the}} Linggadjati Agreement {{granting}} relative peace, Sudirman {{began work on}} consolidating the TKR with various laskar.

However, the ceasefire obtained through the Linggadjati Agreement was not long lasting.

Sudirman called the army to fight, using the code [...] "Ibu Pertiwi <b>is</b> <b>calling!</b> Ibu Pertiwi is calling!", and later delivered several speeches over RRI in an unsuccessful attempt to encourage soldiers to fight against the Dutch.
