500|$|The {{assignment}} statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including {{the nature of}} Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to [...] "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to [...] "(generic) name x receives {{a reference to a}} separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." [...] This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the <b>indicated</b> <b>value,</b> it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.|$|E

Thirty garments of five manufacturers (listed as 0. 25 - 0. 35 - 0. 50 mm Pb equivalent) were tested. Transmission values were determined at 70, 90 and 110 kVp using an inverse broad beam geometry. Pb equivalence was determined using lead sheets as reference material. A substantial variability in photon transmission across garments was found. Differences between lead composite and nonlead garments were not statistically significant. Depending on tube voltage, between 9 and 12 out of 30 garments had a lower Pb equivalence than the <b>indicated</b> <b>value.</b> This work shows that lead equivalence as indicated on a garment's label may overestimate its protective performance.
