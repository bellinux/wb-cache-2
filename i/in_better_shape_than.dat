5|$|The British Army during World War I was {{the largest}} {{military}} force that Britain had put into the field up to that point. On the Western Front, the British Expeditionary Force ended the war as the strongest fighting force, more experienced than the United States Army and its morale was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the French Army.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{retired after}} the Tour in 2005. Ullrich decided to ride {{one or two}} more years. Early reports said Ullrich was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> {{previous}} years and could be ready for his second victory in the Tour. Ullrich finished 115th in the Tour de Romandie on 30 April. However, he injured his knee in the off-season, which could have limited his performance in the 2006 Tour, had he participated (see below).|$|E

The report stated, [...] "Europe's {{economics}} are <b>in</b> substantially <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> at {{the height}} of the Eurozone crisis, but the politics is now much worse...That's true on three different levels: bottom-up, intra-EU, and outside-in." ...|$|R
25|$|With the 1980 {{end of the}} Rock Island, the Regional Transportation Authority {{purchased}} the suburban territory and remaining Rock Island commuter equipment from the estate. LaSalle Street Station was torn down and replaced with the Chicago Stock Exchange building with a small station for commuters retained one block south of the old station. The RTA gradually rebuilt the track and added more new equipment to the service, leaving the property <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> {{it was in the}} Rock Island's heyday, albeit with less track. The Rock Island District, as the Rock Island's suburban service is now known, now operates as part of Metra, the Chicago Commuter Rail agency.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} was subsequently sent to Nimes, France to rebuild, as many divisions mauled on the Eastern Front were. On 1 May 1944 it absorbed men and tanks of the 155th Reserve Panzer Division {{to return to}} its full strength. During this absorption it received 31 Panzer IIIs, 74 Panzer IVs, 20 assault guns, 15 Panther tanks and 200 other vehicles. The division then conducted training exercises up until June of that year. It was reassigned to an area on the Rhone River for a time. It was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> {{many of the other}} divisions in the area, which were refitting, forming, or lacked transportation to move effectively.|$|E
500|$|To {{the left}} of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a {{different}} story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E

They, like the two high-profile MCs, are all here in service of [...]" [...] Becky Bain Idolator found a number of topics to discuss about the video, including trick photography, golden rains {{and the appearance of}} the singers as [...] "triple Marilyn or triple Madonna". Though she believed that it was not Madonna's best video, nevertheless it was successful as a release. Christopher Farley from The Washington Post gave another positive review, saying that the singer [...] "appears to be <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> many college students, which is crazy" [...] and also complimented her for picking [...] "M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj–and getting them to literally serve as cheerleaders for the Madonna brand." [...] MTV News' Jocelyn Vena described it as [...] "funky, fun and surreal (and almost cartoony)" [...] as well as fun and light-hearted: [...] "Madonna looks like she's having an incredibly fun time throughout the visual, smiling and shimmying her way through this fictional, hyper-fantasy world. Watching the clip, one may wonder what doesn't happen in the video." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had passed}} the stone by thirty yards, when the cheering broke out again. Kennedy this time, in great straits, but <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> Crake. Dencroft's in a body trotted along {{at the side of}} the road, {{shouting}} as they went. Crake, hearing the shouts, looked round, almost fell, and then pulled himself together and staggered on again. There were only a hundred yards to go now, and the school gates were in sight at the end of a long lane of spectators. They looked to Kennedy like two thick, black hedges. He could not sprint, though a hundred voices were shouting to him to do so. It was as much as he could do to keep moving. Only his will enabled him to run now. He meant to get to the gates, if he had to crawl.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very simple," [...] Bellamy declared. [...] "That {{meeting in}} Vienna {{was meant to}} force our hands. It is all a {{question}} of the balance of strength. Germany and Austria together, with Russia friendly,--even with Russia neutral,--could have defied Europe. Germany could have spread out her army westwards while Austria seized upon her prey. It was a splendid plot, and it was going very well until the Czar himself was suddenly confronted by our King and his Ministers with a revelation of the whole affair. At Windsor the thing seemed different to him. The French Government behaved splendidly, and the Czar behaved like a man. Germany and Austria are left plante la. If they fight, well, it will be no one-sided affair. They have no fleet, or rather they will have none in a fortnight's time. They have no means of landing an army here. Austria, perhaps, can hold Russia, but with a French army <b>in</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> it has been for years, and the English landing as many men as they care to do, with ease, anywhere on the north coast of Germany, the entire scheme proved abortive. Come into the club and have a drink, Laverick. To-day great things have happened to me." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the United States {{produced}} {{roughly half}} of the world's industrial output. The US, of course, had been spared industrial and civilian devastation.
