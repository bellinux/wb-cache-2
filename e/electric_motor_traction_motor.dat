40|$|Sustainable {{operation}} of electric railway systems represents a significant purpose nowadays {{in the development}} of high power and high speed locomotives and trains. At present, high speed electric vehicles mostly work with three-phase induction motors or three-phase synchronous <b>motors</b> as <b>traction</b> <b>motors.</b> The two <b>electric</b> machine types have different efficiencies at different operation points, and experience differences with respect to safety, speed and power, energy use and exergy efficiency. An important issue that correlates these aspects is the electromagnetic torque developed by an <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor.</b> In order to provide an overview of the technical performance of the {{operation of}} sustainable railway systems, a detailed analysis is carried out of the electromagnetic torque capability of AC <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> utilized as <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> in modern locomotives of high power and/or high speed.

40|$|In-wheel-motor drive {{electric}} vehicle (EV) is an innovative {{configuration of the}} modern EV, in which each wheel is driven individually by an <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The classical <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> control called the Independent Machine Control Structure (IMCS) using a PID speed controller presents major inconveniences in modern EV safety, when the proposed control can not ensure stability of the EV with differing road topology and variations of speed. A new approach is proposed for a control of a two-in-wheel-motor drive EV, called the Maximum Control Structure MCS. This {{is based on a}} multivariable PID (MIMO-PID) strategy, which is employed to estimate the linear speed error of each of the two back driving wheels, when the error of each wheel is taken into account in the other speed control computations. Simulation results show that the new control system presents increased safety for the EVs compared with the IMCS strategy and can maintain the error slip rate within the optimal range, ensuring the stability of the vehicle either in a straight or a curved line...|$|R

The electric loco-motive {{is adapted to}} high speed driving and mass transportation due to obtaining high traction force.

40|$|The {{traction}} {{characteristic of}} an electric vehicle is the main characteristic of mechanical system that reflects its key performance indicators. Implementation of the traction characteristic is based on controlling angular speed and torque of <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> in an automatic control system. The static mechanical characteristic of an <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> in an automatic control system {{is the most important}} characteristic that determines weight, size and operating characteristics of an <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and serves as the basis for design. The most common variants of constructive implementation of a traction electric drive are analyzed, and a scheme is chosen for further design. Lagrange’s equation for electric mechanical system with one degree of freedom is written in generalized coordinates. In order to determine the generalized forces, elementary operation of all moments influencing on a moving car has been calculated. The resulting equation of motion of the electric vehicle corresponding to the design scheme, as well as the expressions for calculation of characteristic points of static mechanical characteristics of <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> (i. e. the maximum and minimum time, minimum power) are obtained. In order to determine the nominal values of the angular velocity and the power of <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor,</b> a method based on ensuring the movement of the vehicle in the standard cycle has been developed. The method makes it possible to calculate characteristic points of the mechanical characteristic with the lowest possible power rating. The algorithm for calculation of mechanical characteristics of the motor is presented. The method was applied to calculate static mechanical characteristic of an <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> for a small urban electric truck. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Loading-back {{systems are}} used for post-maintenance {{acceptance}} tests of <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> of <b>electric</b> rolling stock (ERS) in mainline and industrial transport. The {{aim of the research}} is justification of choice method of the rational loading-back parameters of <b>traction</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> during the tests for heating. Methodology. At the heart of the choice method justification of the rational loading-back parameters is a theory of heating the homogeneous solid body and well-known methods of heating calculations of traction electric machines. Findings. Expediency of heating tests for <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> at load currents equal to the starting current (for ERS of mainline transport) or fifteen minutes current (for ERS of industrial transport) was substantiated. It was shown that this increase of load current will reduce the electricity costs of the tests for 20 – 30 % and shorten the tests duration for three–four times while ensuring the corrected power minimum of energy sources in loading-back system. Originality. It is shown that the energy costs for heating tests of the <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> can be reduced by both the increasing the energy efficiency of the loading-back system and by the optimizing of loading mode of traction electric machines. Choice technique of rational modes of loading-back for <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> of rolling stock in mainline and industrial transport was grounded. Practical value. Load current increase of <b>traction</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> during their tests for heating will reduce the total electricity consumption for the acceptance tests, reduce test time and total material costs for repair of the <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> of rolling stock in mainline and industrial transport...|$|R
