25|$|In February 2007, Australia {{enacted a}} law that will, in effect, by legislating {{efficiency}} standards, disallow most sales of incandescent light bulbs by 2010. The Australian Federal Government announced minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for lighting products. The new minimum standard efficiency level is 15 lumens per watt (lm/W). From November 2008, no non-compliant lighting (including some <b>incandescent</b> <b>globes)</b> were imported into Australia, and from November 2009, the retail sale of non-compliant lighting was banned.|$|R

40|$|Plant growth {{chambers}} {{are commonly}} used to minimize environmental variation but the light sources used vary considerably from natural light and from each other. <b>Incandescent</b> <b>globes</b> are often used to add more far-red light, {{with the aim of}} producing a more natural red to far-red ratio (R:FR), but also add to thermal load. High-intensity discharge lamps are often used to produce higher irradiances, more akin to natural light, but the thermal implications are rarely considered because air temperature is controlled. This paper examines the spectral properties and thermal implications of growth chamber light sources and takes a whole-plant physiology approach, by examining growth responses of a photoperiodic pea line (Pisum sativum L. cv. Torsdag) in the same growth chamber type under different light sources – in essence using plants to study the controlled environments rather than vice-versa. High R:FR delayed flowering and inhibited internode extension in pea. However, the addition of far-red-rich <b>incandescent</b> <b>globes</b> in the proportions provided in the growth chambers (400 – 500 W) did little to reduce R:FR, did not induce earlier flowering and actually further inhibited internode length. Leaflet size and yield were significantly reduced. While air temperature was maintained at 20 C in all experiments, radiant temperature was significantly higher under high irradiance and/or with incandescent added, and soil temperatures were elevated. Growth responses under these lights were similar to the effect caused by elevating the air temperature. An alternative method of controlling R:FR, without thermal load implications, using light-emitting diodes is described...|$|R
50|$|Hydroelectric {{development}} occurred {{soon after}} {{the development of the}} <b>incandescent</b> light <b>globe</b> and the Pelton wheel in the 1870s. Hydroelectric technologies were adopted in Australia, and Tasmania in particular, very {{soon after the}} technology was developed. The first driver of this was the electricity needs of remote mining operations that lacked access to coal. By the early 1880s, a hydro scheme was supplying electricity at a remote tin mining operation at Mount Bischoff. Other remote mining operations such as the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company copper mine in , and the Pioneer Tin Mining Co. in eastern Tasmania, followed soon after.|$|R
25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or <b>incandescent</b> light <b>globe</b> is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|R
40|$|Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) {{are highly}} {{non-linear}} devices which {{are likely to}} experience very high growth in penetration levels, especially in domestic environments, in Australia over the next 2 – 3 years. This will occur due to the decision taken by the Australian Federal Government to ban the sale of <b>incandescent</b> light <b>globes</b> after 2009 as measures towards meeting the needs for demand side management and climate change abatement. While CFL technology has been in existence since the late 1980 s penetration levels are now increasing {{to a point where}} the total CFL load cannot be considered negligible compared to other non-linear domestic loads. This paper seeks to redress the lack of concise data available describing the performance of modern CFLs over a range of influence factors such as input voltage magnitude and harmonic distortion. It seeks to provide definitive characterisation of the modern CFL in terms of harmonic and power factor performance over a range of input supply conditions. This aim is achieved through laboratory testing of 25 CFLs of different brands, construction types and rated power levels...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{domestic}} loads {{are considerably}} different {{to those found}} in households 10 to 15 years ago. In addition to traditional heating, cooking and refrigeration loads, modern loads are likely to include a variety of sophisticated devices containing power electronic front ends. Such front ends can lead to a range of power quality (PQ) impacts on the electricity network, primarily harmonic distortion. Indications are that penetration levels of non-linear residential load are likely to increase. The decision by the Australian Federal Government to ban the sale of traditional <b>incandescent</b> light <b>globes</b> by 2010 is one driver of the increase in non-linear load. At present, the only viable alternative to the <b>incandescent</b> light <b>globe</b> is the compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), a well-known non-linear load. The evolution of the residential load in terms of magnitude and characteristics into a significant distorting load and as such a potential source of significant power quality disturbances is worthy of detailed study. Distribution utilities are required by law to maintain acceptable power quality levels on their distribution networks to ensure safe and reliable operation of the network as well as equipment connected thereto. This is only possible if detailed understanding of the behaviour of equipment connected to the distribution network has been achieved so that proper planning schemes can be put in place. In order to understand the electrical behaviour of modern loads the electrical performance of a range of appliances, including a range of CFLs, was examined through laboratory investigations. Examination was made of performance under a range of input voltage conditions (magnitude and waveform distortion). A realistic low voltage (LV) electricity distribution network simulation model was developed to assess their impact on distribution system PQ levels using the appliance load characteristics determined through laboratory testing. This flexible distribution system model allowed a range of feeder lengths and loading scenarios to be examined. Field monitoring conducted in conjunction with theoretical work is used to substantiate the simulation studies. Broadly, the majority of the results obtained from the modelling work were found to be indicative of credible harmonic magnitudes and profiles. Results most reflective of recent field observations were obtained using the simulation models where the injected current levels were based on appliance behaviour when such appliances were supplied with distorted input voltages rather than sinusoidal input voltages. There are a number of reasons that make direct comparison of model outputs with field data very difficult. Notwithstanding these difficulties, good correlation between field measurements and model outputs was achieved for 3 rd and 5 th harmonic voltage levels. Correlation between model outputs and field data for the higher order harmonics which were examined (7 th, 15 th and 21 st) was not as strong. On the whole, results obtained from the simulation models indicate that a very high penetration of modern domestic appliances (i. e. large numbers in each residence) will result in harmonic voltage levels that will exceed the Australian harmonic voltage planning levels on LV feeders. The modelling also indicated that the profile of the harmonic voltages due to modern domestic appliances may be different to the traditional profile where low order harmonics dominate. There is evidence to show that if high penetration of modern appliances occurs, the dominant voltage harmonics due to interaction of appliance load currents with network impedance may be the 7 th or 15 th harmonic. Special emphasis has been placed on the impact of CFLs on harmonic levels. Results of modelling clearly show {{that a large number of}} CFLs can have a significant impact on voltage harmonic levels. It was clear that some of the simulation models which were developed produced values which were unlikely to be representative of those seen in practice and this is an avenue for future research. Methods of harmonic modelling are complex, especially for higher order harmonics, and if very accurate models are required, some of the assumptions used may need closer examination. Further, as appliances develop over time, it may be necessary to periodically perform studies such as the one presented in this thesis in order to maintain a complete understanding of the electrical behaviour both of modern loads and the LV distribution network...|$|R
