2500|$|However, {{there was}} concern that the GSEs' {{liquidity}} was insufficient to handle growing delinquency rates, such that although viable in September 2008, the scale of loss in the future would be sufficient that insolvency would occur and that knowledge of this future failure would induce immediate or near-immediate failure due to buyers refusing to buy debt. Both GSEs roll over large amounts of debt on a quarterly basis and failure to sell debt would lead to failure {{due to lack of}} liquidity. A slower form of failure would be the issuing of debt at high cost (to compensate buyers for risk), which would greatly diminish the earning power of both GSEs, rendering them unable to earn the money they would need to handle expected future losses. Both GSEs counted large amounts of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets towards their regulatory capital, which were considered by some to be of [...] "low quality" [...] and not truly available capital. The <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets would only have value if the companies were profitable and could use the assets to offset future taxes.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the signalling function of accounting and financial information by investigating the information content of the adoption of a certain accounting practice, namely the recognition of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> in the financial statements. Specifically, we examine whether (1) the decision to recognise a certain accounting practice, and (2) the timing of the recognition supplement one another as signalling devices. The new accounting law on <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> (Royal Decree of December 30, 1991) requires all Belgian firms to recognise <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> for all grants on the balance sheet as of 30 / 12 / 91. The results show that the recognition and the timing of the recognition supplement one another as signalling tools. The immediate recognition of positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> signals good news: firms that report positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> typically perform better at the time of adoption and in the near future thereafter. Within the class of recognisers, early recognisers perform better than late recognisers. However, this second signal, the timing of the recognition is only used as a second signal for the class of tax-paying firms. Our findings also indicate that the impact on the balance sheet is a significant determinant of the decision to report <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Firms where the adoption of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> would lead to a high increase in the debt/equity ratio are less likely to adopt, or, if they do report <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> do so later. These results suggest that firms decide not to recognise positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> in order to limit the decrease in their solvency position. Indeed, firms that have already experienced a decline in their solvency position are more likely to postpone the recognition of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Accounting; Law; Solvency;...|$|R

Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using income before tax and current tax payable computed using taxable income.
