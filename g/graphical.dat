5|$|Computer {{role-playing}} games (CRPGs) {{are once}} again popular. Recent titles, such as BioWare's Mass Effect series and Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls series, have been produced for console systems and have received multi-platform releases, although independently developed games are frequently created as personal computer (PC) exclusives. Developers of role-playing games have continuously experimented with various <b>graphical</b> perspectives and styles of play, such as real-time and turn-based time-keeping systems, axonometric and first-person <b>graphical</b> projections, and single-character or multi-character parties. Subgenres include action role-playing games, roguelikes and tactical role-playing games.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the <b>graphical</b> BitLocker {{interface}} in Windows Vista {{could only}} encrypt {{the operating system}} volume. Starting with Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, volumes other than the operating system volume could be encrypted using the <b>graphical</b> tool. Still, {{some aspects of the}} BitLocker (such as turning autolocking on or off) had to be managed through a command-line tool called manage-bde.wsf.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a <b>graphical</b> user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a <b>graphical</b> application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The update also {{removes the}} <b>graphical</b> user {{interface}} for the Windows System Assessment Tool, {{meaning that the}} Windows Experience Index is no longer displayed. The command line version of the tool remains available on the system. Microsoft reportedly removed the <b>graphical</b> Windows Experience Index {{in order to promote}} the idea that all kinds of hardware run Windows 8 equally well.|$|E
5|$|Also in this category, {{there is}} TuneUp Disk Doctor. It can check the {{integrity}} of files stored on hard disk drives and salvage damaged files. It can also scan for physical defects known as bad sectors and isolate them. TuneUp Disk Doctor is a <b>graphical</b> replacement for Windows CHKDSK.|$|E

5|$|Free-body {{diagrams}} {{can be used}} as {{a convenient}} way to keep track of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that <b>graphical</b> vector addition can be done to determine the net force.|$|E
5|$|<b>Graphical</b> user {{interfaces}} (GUIs) may be developed using Perl. For example, Perl/Tk and WxPerl {{are commonly used}} to enable user interaction with Perl scripts. Such interaction may be synchronous or asynchronous, using callbacks to update the GUI.|$|E
5|$|In 1871 he {{established}} Maxwell's thermodynamic relations, which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials {{with respect to}} different thermodynamic variables. In 1874, he constructed a plaster thermodynamic visualisation {{as a way of}} exploring phase transitions, based on the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs's <b>graphical</b> thermodynamics papers.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to run <b>graphical</b> user interfaces on older or low-end systems, but the installation of window managers instead of desktop environments is recommended, as desktop environments are more resource-intensive. Requirements for individual software vary widely and must be considered, {{with those of the}} base operating environment.|$|E
5|$|LiveArea, {{designed}} to be used on the PlayStation Vita, is a <b>graphical</b> user interface set to incorporate various social networking features via the PlayStation Network. It has been designed specifically as a touchscreen user interface for users.|$|E

5|$|Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a {{distributed}} operating system, {{originally developed}} by the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs between the mid-1980s and 2002.

5|$|SAS is a {{software}} suite that can mine, alter, manage and retrieve {{data from a}} variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it. SAS provides a <b>graphical</b> point-and-click user interface for non-technical users and more advanced options through the SAS language.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{released}} a Microsoft Windows port {{of the game}} in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. PC Gamers Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the low resolution, limited <b>graphical</b> options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by modder Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed many of the issues. Michael McWhertor of Polygon also noted a similar critical response by consumers. A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the <b>graphical</b> features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements.|$|E
5|$|The Dietrich {{hypothesis}} interprets rongorongo {{not as a}} script, but as a notational {{system for}} astronomical, calendrical, and navigational data.

Reviewing Leifthrasir, Famitsu praised the increased smoothness and battle frequency, noting that the title still felt fresh despite being the remake of a 2007 title. They also praised the <b>graphical</b> upgrade {{and its effect on}} the artwork. Critics generally agreed that Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its technical performance, lack of the original's framerate problems, <b>graphical</b> upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{built-in}} preference {{manager for}} Web {{is designed to}} present user only basic browser-specific settings. All the advanced configuration is done with the stand-alone GSettings configurator tools such as GNOME's default dconf (command line) and dconf-editor (<b>graphical).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} saw <b>graphical</b> {{and musical}} revisions {{and is based}} on the international versions of both games, making certain content accessible to players outside of Japan for the first time. The collection sold favorably in Japan and the west, and has received positive reviews in western territories. Many praised the <b>graphical</b> upgrade and the chance to play through the games on the new platforms. The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults and uneven quality between the two, while some of the collection's added content drew mixed opinions. The minor upgrade faults and uneven quality were fixed in the PlayStation 4 version.|$|E

25|$|<b>Graphical</b> {{adventure}} {{games were}} considered to have spurred the gaming market for personal computers from 1985 through the next decade, as {{they were able to}} offer narratives and storytelling that could not readily be told by the state of <b>graphical</b> hardware at the time.|$|E
