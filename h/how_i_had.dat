500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gilligan {{revealed that}} he wrote {{the character of the}} genie, Jenn, with Janeane Garofalo in mind, but she was unavailable at the time of filming. However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, she was even better than <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written the character. In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had a heart of gold. She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E
500|$|In 1585 Leicester led an English {{expedition}} {{to assist the}} rebellious United Provinces against Spain. He incurred Elizabeth's wrath when he accepted the title of Governor-General in January 1586—what had especially kindled her fury was a tale that the Countess of Leicester was planning to follow her husband to the Netherlands [...] "with such a train of ladies, and gentlewomen, and such rich coaches, litters, and side-saddles, as Her Majesty had none, and {{that there should be}} such a court of ladies, as should far pass Her Majesty's court here." [...] Thomas Dudley, who informed Leicester about these events, stressed that [...] "this information" [...] was [...] "most false". At this same time the Earl was giving his wife authority to handle certain land issues during his absence, implying they had no plans to meet in Holland. William Davison, whom Leicester had sent to explain his doings to the Queen, described a visit to the Countess during the crisis: [...] "I found her greatly troubled with tempestuous news she received from court, but somewhat [...] comforted when she understood <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> proceeded with Her Majesty." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was thus}} that Sir Gregory {{regarded}} the matter. 'See all that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done for this man,' said he to himself; 'see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> warmed {{him in my}} bosom, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lifted him to fortune and renown, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heaped benefits on his head! If gratitude in this world be possible, that man should be grateful to me; if one man can ever have another's interest at heart, that man should have a heartfelt anxiety as to my interest. And yet <b>how</b> is it? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> placed him in {{the chair next to}} my own, and now he is desirous of sitting above me!' ...|$|R

2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
2500|$|In a video exposé by The Atlantic, Voris stated {{his belief}} that what had led up to his sexual {{behavior}} could be traced to his mother having bipolar disorder. He stated that in his home life with a bipolar parent [...] "Everything in the environment revolves around that mental illness. I wound up believing my parents didn't love me." [...] After {{his mother had been}} diagnosed with stage four cancer, about three months before she died she told Voris, [...] "'I never believed that you were homosexual or gay. I believed that you were acting out in response to the fact of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> created this situation at home that you didn't {{know how to deal with}} it.'" [...] Voris said that struck him like a hammer.|$|E

Despite this, Hill won by 115pts with a season's best 6,669. Theisen-Eaton was disappointed with her silver medal saying [...] "I'm disappointed. I went in as the favourite and I didn't compete <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to to win gold. And that was my own fault. So I am disappointed with it, {{but there are some}} lessons that I have learned from it that hopefully I can take into next year...I mean, I scored 250 points less than I already have this year, and had I just done the same thing I had done already previously this year, it would have got me a gold." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Pawsey's help, £630,000 {{was raised}} from the Ford Foundation {{to build the}} Culgoora radio-{{heliograph}}. Years later he was to admit [...] "When I think back I wonder <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the nerve to do it." [...] The heliograph stayed in operation for 17 years from 1967, providing {{a huge amount of}} data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The heliograph also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 {{to make way for the}} Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space weather monitoring of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.|$|E
