5|$|The Bay Area {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of {{wildlife}} and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's <b>Dungeness</b> <b>crab,</b> Pacific halibut, and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the <b>Dungeness</b> <b>crab,</b> or competing with them for resources.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native blue crab in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential biological control agent of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the <b>Dungeness</b> <b>crab,</b> Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between adult abundance and zoea I (ZI) density of <b>Dungeness</b> <b>crabs</b> {{was investigated in}} southeastern Alaska. Commercial harvest data (catch per pot) for male crabs larger than 165 mm in carapace width were collected from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) management area, district 114 and a subdivision of district 114, 114 C from 1996 to 2003. Commercial harvests of <b>Dungeness</b> <b>crabs</b> in the management area varied interannually. Commercial harvests decreased until 2000 but increased beginning in 2001. ZI density was obtained from zooplankton samples collected monthly from sampling stations within the same management district from 1997 to 2004. ZI occurred mostly in May and June, but as late as July in 1997 and 2002. ZI densities increased beginning in 1999. Total densities of ZI were significantly correlated with the commercial harvest data of adult male crabs within the management area, 114 C (tens of square kilometers), containing the plankton sampling stations, but were not related to total commercial harvests within the larger geographic management area 114 (hundreds of square kilometers).

40|$|Adult female <b>Dungeness</b> <b>crabs</b> (Cancer magister) can be inseminated only {{while in}} a soft-shell {{condition}} immediately after molting.

To accomplish this, the amount of clams and crabs consumed by populations of concern was determined, a tolerable daily intake (TDI) was developed for individuals most sensitive to effects of this compound, and the TDI was equated with consumption patterns to determine tolerable clam and crab domoic acid levels. Results indicate that the primary health effects associated with domoic acid toxicity can be averted in populations of concern and for others consuming crabs or clams less frequently (or in lesser quantity) if domoic acid contaminant concentration does not exceed 30 mg/kg in the hepatopancreas and viscera of <b>dungeness</b> <b>crabs</b> or 20 mg/kg in clams...|$|R
