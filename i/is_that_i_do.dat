6000|$|Kenwardine laughed. [...] "You're remarkably frank; but there's {{some truth}} {{in what you}} say, {{although}} the convention <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> guarantee them and their honor's mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> or that I ought not to do. But all my life {{everything}} that I have done at Perivale has always been wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I did Jacques's {{first film}} {{so it has}} to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> his first American film," [...] said Aimee.|$|R
60|$|The wonder <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not kill}} {{him on the}} spot. I cannot think what possessed the man,--he must have known me better.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to justify him in saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever engaged to the young lady. The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ask her and she,--refused me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> desire this lady, O High-priest, {{and that}} if I can I will obtain from Kari the promise of what you seek. And now where is the loophole?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{opposing}} {{a theory}} to a fact," [...] Mrs. Mortimer stated. [...] "The {{fact is that}} all the farmers do not do it. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> receive double the price. You can't get away from that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Elizabeth,--"no. I do {{not know}} him. I {{do not know}} him. There is something.... But I don't know. All I know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know him." [...] Her face was a face of {{infinite}} distress.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{thinking}} how very unfortunate it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not breakfast with Lyndhurst this morning, as <b>I</b> was nearly <b>doing,</b> {{instead of going}} down to Eton.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} to the church this morning in order to {{distress}} you: <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not, Cytherea. It was to try to speak to you before you were--married.' ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{surprising}} {{part of the}} whole thing to me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel in the least alarmed. If anything, I was rather pleased to see him. It was company.|$|R
6000|$|Jack. It pains me {{very much}} to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not approve at all of his moral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my boy," [...] he said, [...] "being totally inexperienced at this game, {{you might}} lose {{us more than}} that in a month. But I like your courage, I like your courage, and the truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want help. I will think it over and write to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{goes for}} nothing," [...] {{declared}} Overweg, with a smile. [...] "I have, however, drawn upon my base camp rather heavily, {{and should be}} glad of any stores from the schooner that you could let me have. The difficulty <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish {{to go too far}} toward the beach." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{talked about}} {{feminism}} {{in an interview}} with Vogue in 2015, saying [...] "There <b>are</b> things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> feminists don't like, and there <b>are</b> things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> they <b>do</b> like. <b>I</b> don't label myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The darlings!" [...] cried Proserpina; {{and then}} she thought to herself, [...] "I <b>was</b> looking at <b>that</b> spot only a moment ago. How strange it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the flowers!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No: its too much. The plain truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{care whether}} she finds me out or not. I {{want her to}} {{understand}} thoroughly, once and for ever, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wont marry her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, {{they would}} be almost as well-informed, as I am myself," [...] {{returned}} the rear-admiral, with a little point, but quite without any bitterness of manner. [...] "The only advantage I have over them <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know where the fleet is, {{which is more than}} the First Lord can boast of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may say so in a {{very special}} and {{emphatic}} sense," [...] said Turnbull. [...] "I {{do not believe in}} nature, just as I do not believe in Odin. She is a myth. It is not merely that I do not believe that nature can guide us. It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe that nature exists." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I am." [...] The old Duke shrugged his shoulders. [...] "What I mean <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think that}} we ought to pay an {{increased}} price for their support. His lordship is very well as the Head of an Office; but he is not nearly so great a man as my friend Lord Cantrip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, Douglas, {{you have}} learnt the truth. Well, I am glad of it. You believe in me now? You always may. Looking back upon our last {{interview}} my only regret <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not tell you}} the whole truth then.|$|R
5000|$|... 6. a) *This <b>is</b> the girli <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{know what}} ti [...] said. b) This <b>is</b> the girli <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> know what shei said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, no,' {{replied the}} man-brother. 'The fact <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{get up to}} them till we had run half way across the world and left the wind far behind us. Think what a trouble {{it would have been}} to drag it here! So--I just ate them both.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good!" [...] {{said the}} Thing. [...] "As I {{am not a}} Gump, I cannot have a Gump's pride or {{independent}} spirit. So I may as well become your servant as anything else. My only satisfaction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not seem to have}} a very strong constitution, and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mynheer Retief," [...] I replied; [...] "it is no {{question}} of reward; {{and as for the}} land, I have already pegged out my farm on a river about thirty miles to the east. It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like to leave Marie alone, fearing lest her father should play some trick on me as regards her and Hernan Pereira." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Victoria, [...] "I {{was afraid}} you wouldn't. And moreover, you never would. There is no use in my {{trying to make}} myself any clearer, and you'll {{have to keep your}} appointment. I {{hesitate}} to contradict you, but I am not the kind of woman you want. That is one reason I cannot marry you. And the other <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love you." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{man will}} really attempt to {{describe}} his feelings, when he first stood at the gateway of the grave of Christ. The only record relevant here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel the reaction, not to say repulsion, that many seem to have felt about its formal surroundings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} {{willing to}} die," [...] Chebron said; [...] "and my greatest regret now <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not follow my first impulse and denounce myself as the accidental killer of the cat. No blame could have then been attached to my father or to any but myself." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{will tell}} about later. The point I {{was coming to}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not realise until after the crash how {{recklessly}} my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent. on the ordinary shares of that hugely over-capitalised enterprise, Household Services.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit still," [...] she said, [...] "and {{you are as}} safe {{as though}} you were in your own armchair. No current that ever ran could upset this clumsy raft. The only reason I am working so hard <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not want to be}} carried down past the ridges. If we get too low down we shall have to walk across the black mud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, Marian. On the contrary, {{he was all}} {{kindness}} and attention on our journey home, and he several times checked Sir Percival's outbreaks of temper, in the most considerate manner towards me. Perhaps I dislike him because he has so much more power over my husband than I have. Perhaps it hurts my pride to be under any obligations to his interference. All I know <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> dislike him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{have offered}} no {{explanation}} {{at all of}} who Cronos was, what he was god of, from what race he was borrowed, from what language his name was derived. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know the truth about these important debated questions. Therefore, after speaking so kindly of our method, and rejecting the method of Mr. Max Muller, Professor Tiele now writes thus (and this Mr. Max Muller does cite, as we have seen):-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Walters, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{not quite}} true. I {{ought not to}} have said it to friends so kind as you have all shown yourselves to be. No; my real reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to grieve you unnecessarily, and even now I {{would not have done}} so, only----" ...|$|R
6000|$|I was so startled at this totally {{irrelevant}} {{reference to}} the worthy collector of chimpanzees with whom I ought to have dined <b>that</b> evening, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> glanced sharply at Grant. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not look at Mr Shorter. I only heard him answer, in his most nervous tone, [...] "No." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have read}} it. The English bishop here {{has given me}} the book. It is a good one, written, I observe, entirely by Jews. I find in it many things with which I agree; and if there be some from which I dissent, it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{comprehend}} them.' ...|$|R
