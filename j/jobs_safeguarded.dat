40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} deep economic recession, the German federal government has adopted two economic stimulus packages to be applied in the period from 2009 to 2010. According to our estimations, these programs include investments amounting to 25. 3 billion Euros mainly in infrastructure and education. We investigate the total effects of these investments on production and employment using a static input-output model. We find that the gross domestic product will increase by at most one percentage point, namely 0. 4 points in 2009 and 0. 7 points in 2010. This implies that approximately 400 000 <b>jobs</b> will be <b>safeguarded.</b> About one quarter of the effects will concern construction and business services respectively. For several reasons, our calculations constitute the upper bound to the expected effects. The increasing demand in construction could lead to significantly increasing prices.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} reasons for the {{exceptionally}} robust performance of the German labour market during the Great Recession. While GDP dropped by more than five per cent in 2009, employment remained constant and started to increase soon after.

We find that reductions in hourly productivity {{played a significant role in}} all recessions while working time reductions helped to <b>safeguard</b> <b>jobs</b> only occasionally. However, in the Great Recession, temporary working time reductions were amply used to stabilise employment. Using a time series model, we show that the reduction in hourly productivity during the Great Recession is predictable with historical data, while the reduction in working time was unexpectedly pronounced. Using detailed information on instruments for the adjustment of working hours, we show that new instruments which have been established in the decade before the Great Recession have been heavily used to reduce working time in the Great Recession. We argue that the development of these instruments was only possible within the framework of corporatist industrial relations...|$|R

We explore whether this is true by conducting an econometric ex-post evaluation of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the three East German States Brandenburg, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Whereas previous studies have employed descriptive statistics or qualitative methods and have looked at single policy instruments in isolation, we apply a difference-in-differences estimator to analyse the employment effects of the entire portfolio of CAP measures simultaneously. Based on panel data at the county level, we find that investment aids and transfers to less favoured areas had a zero marginal employment effect. We present evidence that full decoupling of direct payments in 2005 led to labour shedding, as it made transfer payments independent of factor allocation. Spending on modern technologies in processing and marketing and measures aimed at the development of rural areas led to job losses in agriculture. Agri-environmental measures, on the other hand, kept labour intensive technologies in production or induced them. This analysis calls into question whether an expansion of existing second pillar measures is a reasonable way to use funds modulated away from the first pillar.

40|$|Driven by {{increasing}} environmental awareness {{as well as}} numerous environmental policy measures, the market for environmental goods has expanded {{over the last few}} years, bringing a growing number of jobs. A study of leading German economics research institutes shows that the employment effects of environmental protection have attained considerable dimensions, with nearly a million jobs in 1994 alone, with the service sector being the main beneficiary. And of particular importance: In terms of both population and economic performance, the new Laender are in a better position than the old Laender (the former FRG states) in respect of environmental jobs. In the new Laender important impulses towards creating and <b>safeguarding</b> <b>jobs</b> have emerged from environmental clean-up and development. The concern of this publication is not to promise a job-creation miracle by means of environmental protection alone. Nor is it a matter of legitimising environmental protection in terms of employment policy, for environmental protection does not require employment policy for legitimisation. Rather, the paper wants to provide up-to-date background information to point out the synergies between environmental and employment objectives. It also presents fields of activity which can be helpful to address both environmental and employment policy problems. I do hope that this study can provide some incentives for further action.

Brought {{out in the}} context of widespread unemployment after the First World War it required all aliens seeking employment or residence to register with the police. The Order drew its powers from the 1919 Act and granted a wide ranging discretion to the Home Secretary. It stipulated that no alien might land without the permission of an immigration officer, by way of a passport stamp, and granted powers to attach conditions to the grant of leave, to refuse those who could not support themselves, and their dependants, those medically unfit and those convicted of crimes abroad. It gave the power to demand documents satisfactorily establishing identity and nationality. It restricted the employment rights of aliens resident in Britain, barring them from certain jobs (in the civil service, for example), and had a particular impact on foreign seamen working on British ships. It required people seeking employment in the UK to obtain permission from the Ministry of Labour which was of huge significance in establishing a link, for the first time, between immigration control and the employment market. It also targeted criminals, paupers and ‘undesirables’, and made it illegal for aliens to promote industrial action - a response to fears of imported revolutionaries following the still recent Russian Revolution.Further motivation to extend restrictions on foreigners was driven by post-war unemployment and the consequent desire to <b>safeguard</b> <b>jobs</b> for indigenous Britons.

Although the overarching definition of sustainability is understood to represent the long-term maintenance of social, environmental and economic systems (Gudmundsson et aL, 1996; Hughes et aL, 2005), many aspects of sustainable development are far from having integrity in terms of political and business agendas {{due to the lack of}} viable accounting techniques. This study was designed to assess the methods of evaluating the sustainable development achievements of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) project at the Centre for Waste Management (CWM), based at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK. The research was developed as a result of the author completing the CWM ERDF project closure report; the report identified a lack of collaboration between the project's achievements in the area of sustainable development and the ERDF targets.

Our Indian economy had experienced leading policy changes in early 1990 s. The new economic reform, popularly known as, Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization designed at building the Indian economy as fastest mounting economy and that too globally competitive.

The globalization has brought in new infringe to developing countries. Generously proportioned way in to developed country markets and technology shift hold out assurance improved productivity and higher living standard. Globalization has also alarmed up new challenges like growing inequality across and inside nations, unsteadiness in financial market and environmental issues. Decay is unhelpful feature of globalization is that an enormous mainstream of developing countries stay behind removed from the course. Till the 90 ’s the progression of globalization of the Indian economy was pocket watch over by the wall of trade and investment liberalization of trade, investment and financial flows initiated in the 90 ’s has gradually lowered the barriers to competition and hastened the swiftness of globalization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{additional}} help document is to clarify the financial aspects Office of Civilian Response (OCR) travel advances. Background The Office of Civilian Response (OCR) was created within USAID/DCHA to coordinate USAID's Agency-wide efforts to "assist foreign states and regions at risk of, in, or in transition from conflict or civil strife. " USAID is one of nine civilian US Government Agencies tasked with providing these services worldwide. OCR both supports and manages these inter-agency deployments around the globe. This support includes both the rapid deployment of the Civilian Response Corps (CRC) as well as logistical and financial management support. Many of these deployments are to regions where direct support from either an existing in-country USAID Mission or U. S. Embassy is limited and where our deployed personnel operate in cash economies where neither credit cards, travelers checks nor banking services are available. In a typical scenario, CRC personnel will be deployed to an area experiencing civil strife or another situation that has undermined host country government operations or effectiveness. Travel authorizations will be created in Washington, and CRC personnel {{will be brought to}} Washington for training and preparation. Upon departure from Washington, these employees are issued a cash travel advance. Subsequent advances may be issued by the supporting Mission, Embassy or M/CFO/CMP. Frequently, cashier support is difficult to provide and does not consistently deliver the required amounts of cash to the deployed personnel. The availability of transportation varies and the employee has to journey long distances, sometimes across international borders, to file a travel voucher and request an advance to replenish their cash. Where personnel are operating under such conditions, the following procedures are being implemented to minimize the amount of time the employee is taken away from the <b>job,</b> to establish <b>safeguards</b> to minimize the risk of loss or theft of the USG funds, and to further the accomplishment of the USAID mission...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Private {{and public}} sector working {{together}} for mutual benefit {{is nothing new}} and {{in the context of}} education, this has historically focussed on areas such as employability-related experiences for students, supply-chains for goods and services, and within higher education specifically, the growing need to demonstrate research impact. In this presentation, we explore the impact of private and public-sector working together to deliver regional economic growth through technology transfer. The objectives of this research stems from a twelve-year collaborative relationship between a higher education institute (HEI) and a private sector, technology value-added reseller (VAR). The authors assess and reflect on this activity, funded through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to help understand the inputs, processes and outcomes of that relationship. Approach / Methodology The approach undertaken was firstly to identify the ERDF-funded projects since 2002 that the VAR (Quadra Solutions Ltd) has been a part of, as a private sector partner, with the HEI (Lancaster University’s Engineering Department). This is defined as where there is a service level agreement in place and the provision of match-funding is committed-to in that contract. This differs from that of a sub-contractor where the relationship may be better defined as purchaser-supplier and emphasizes the collaborative nature of the relationship being explored. We subsequently identified the ‘interventions’ in which both the knowledge exchange team (Lancaster Product Development Unit) and Quadra Solutions Ltd had worked with a ‘beneficiary’ as part of those ERDF initiatives. Retaining confidential information, these interventions were aggregated and basic company information collected in terms of location, size (by turnover) and sector. Analysis was then undertaken on the results collected as a consequence of that intervention, based on the following economic key performance indicators (KPIs) : businesses improving performance; safeguarding of jobs; and the creation of new jobs. Qualitative reflection was carried out to assess wider impacts of the relationship {{and the development of a}} model that articulates this way of working. We highlight both the benefits and drawbacks based on extensive experience of providing technology-transfer solutions to SMEs, part-funded by ERDF. Results The results show that 93 interventions have been undertaken between Lancaster University’s Engineering Department and Quadra Solutions Ltd, in-part funded by ERDF between 2003 and 2015, spanning seven major projects. All of these interventions supported technology transfer by the introduction of a new or enhanced design process within the beneficiary, using the Autodesk family of software. All beneficiaries receiving support were SMEs, complying with national and regional eligibility guidelines as defined by the funding body secretariat. Sectoral breakdown unsurprisingly shows that the vast majority were in the engineering/manufacturing sector, accounting for 94. 6 % of the total. Of those SMEs that were assisted, all received increased functionality via the introduction or improvement to design software than that previously being used, demonstrating clear technology transfer. Where data was obtained, this intervention led to the cumulative safeguarding of 102. 1 jobs and the creation of 71 jobs. As noted elsewhere, there is considerable ambiguity in using figures that attempt to provide a unit cost per result, and whilst one can attempt to draw comparison with other initiatives in other areas, this can be problematic due to assumptions made. For the purposes of this investigation, we have benchmarked against ourselves and show that for all cumulative ERDF assistance provided by the Engineering Department, the average job created per intervention is 0. 64 and the average <b>job</b> <b>safeguarded</b> is 0. 91. For the technology transfer work carried out in partnership with Quadra Solutions Ltd, the figures are 0. 76 and 1. 10, respectively. More widely, there are other impacts from joint collaboration with private sector partners that have been created, for the HEI: • Clear access to the latest in engineering design functionality, informed by globally-operating OEMs spanning many sectors; • Provision of a match-funding contribution through the time of company representatives contributing towards the objectives of the project; • Sharing of a networks of users and manufactures in close proximity, with a ‘seal-of-approval’ for quality of work; • Local, regional, national and international market intelligence; • Formalisation in the pursuit of similar objectives; • Contribution to the state-of-the-art and hence vital commercial-sector input to other future programmes of business support. The benefits created by such a relationship for private sector partners include: • Promotion of joint-funding opportunities to potential beneficiaries generating in-house advocates, or ‘funding champions’; • Ability to join-up wider business-support allied to technology transfer, which may include time-bound financial incentives, training offers, subscriptions, hardware support and so on. • Increased knowledge and experience of public-funding processes, regulations and conditions; • Externally-visible partnerships with a world-ranked university. Arguably the most important benefits relate to the end-user, which in this case is the beneficiary. The following model outlines a typical journey taken by a beneficiary through the technology acquisition route of intervention. Additional benefits to the beneficiaries in these cases may include: • Increased ability to develop new products • Awareness of how new technology processes can be further exploited, such as through expansion, training, add-ons; • A route into higher education to explore other research and development opportunities that may exist beyond that of the intervention; Implications and Recommendations The authors fully accept that there are a number of issues with the data collected which include that our assessment methods: • Only take account of the reported results when/if engaged with the beneficiary. Some beneficiaries become reluctant to undertake evaluation after the assistance has been delivered. • It does not record the exact time input to each intervention made by either the HEI or the VAR. • The package of support (or agreed solution) has not been specified and will include some differences, in this case in software, including for example upgrades or new packages. Notwithstanding some of the limitations outlined above, we have been able to demonstrate that the work carried-out by the partnership of a private sector VAR and an HEI to support SMEs in technology transfer has clear, demonstrable impact, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Such a model can be applied to future initiatives that have technology transfer as a theme within business support. Areas for development / future research There are a number of important areas underpinned by this work that would be useful to explore further: • Sector transference, for example application in other disciplines requiring software, such as for example architecture, construction, chemicals, food and drink, creative. • Technology transference, for example application of using other technologies beyond software, such as for example, manufacturing hardware. • Longer-term assessment of the impact to beneficiaries of these interventions, which may include aspects related to innovation culture, new product development or increased capacity for R&D. • Exploration of opportunities that may be available beyond the intervention provided, by the HEI, such as access to graduates, and the ‘completion of the circle’...|$|R
40|$|Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) is {{the largest}} and oldest {{business}} support scheme currently operating in Scotland. It provides grants to firms undertaking capital investment projects in economically deprived EU designated ‘Assisted Areas’. As a component of regional policy, the scheme is principally designed to safeguard and generate employment in the Assisted Areas. Many of the grants are given to help foreign firms to set up in Scotland. The aim of this thesis is to estimate the impact of receipt of these grants on plant performance as measured by productivity and survival. The main econometric problem to be confronted when estimating the impact of grants is self-selection bias. Because plants self-select into the treated group, the treated group will have different characteristics from the untreated group which would lead to differences in performance had neither group received treatment. This creates difficulties in estimating the impact of treatment as a simple comparison of a variable across treated and untreated groups will not measure the causal impact of treatment. This problem was dealt with using propensity score matching and instrumental variables. The dataset was created by linking a register of plants that received an RSA grant into the longitudinal ARD which contains the necessary range of financial variables for empirical analysis. This part of the thesis was crucial as failure to identify {{a high percentage of}} plants that received a grant in the ARD would seriously undermine the empirical analyses. In the end, a higher proportion of plants that received a grant were linked with the ARD than has been previously achieved using these databases. In the first empirical chapter, the growth of labour productivity and TFP between 1994 and 2004 in Scottish manufacturing plants was decomposed to reveal the contribution of plants that receive an RSA grant. This showed that RSA-assisted plants made a small but positive contribution to both measures of productivity growth. The latter two empirical chapters showed that receipt of an RSA grant had no statistically significant impact on either the TFP or the survival probability of Scottish manufacturing plants between 1984 and 2004 in any of the industries considered. This is a major concern as it casts doubt on whether the <b>jobs</b> created and <b>safeguarded</b> by an RSA grant will endure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the E-Verify program, which provides employers a tool for verifying an employee's authorization {{to work in the}} United States. The opportunity for employment {{is one of the most}} powerful magnets attracting immigrants to the United States. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, as of March 2010, approximately 11. 2 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the country, and an estimated 8 million of them, or about 70 percent, were in the labor force. Congress, the administration, and some states have taken various actions to better ensure that those who work here have appropriate work authorization and to <b>safeguard</b> <b>jobs</b> for authorized employees. Nonetheless, opportunities remain for unauthorized workers to fraudulently obtain employment by using borrowed or stolen documents and for unscrupulous employers to hire unauthorized workers. Immigration experts have noted that deterring illegal immigration requires, among other things, a more reliable employment eligibility verification process and a more robust worksite enforcement capacity. E-Verify is a free, largely voluntary, Internet-based system operated by the Verification Division of the Department of Homeland Security's U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). The goals of E-Verify are to (1) reduce the employment of individuals unauthorized to work, (2) reduce discrimination, (3) protect employee civil liberties and privacy, and (4) prevent undue burden on employers. Pursuant to a 2007 Office of Management Budget directive, all federal agencies are required to use E-Verify on their new hires and, as of September 2009, certain federal contractors and subcontractors are required to use E-Verify for newly hired employees working in the United States as well as existing employees working directly under the contract. A number of states have also mandated that some or all employers within the state use E-Verify on new hires. From October 1, 2010, through April 5, 2011, E-Verify processed approximately 7. 8 million queries from nearly 258, 000 employers. In an August 2005 report and June 2008 testimony on E-Verify, we noted that USCIS faced challenges in detecting identity fraud and ensuring employer compliance with the program's rules. We highlighted some of the challenges USCIS and SSA faced in reducing instances of erroneous tentative nonconfirmations (TNC), or situations in which work-authorized employees are not automatically confirmed by E-Verify. We also noted that mandatory implementation of E-Verify would place increased demands on USCIS's and SSA's resources. This testimony is based primarily on a report we issued in December 2010 and provide updates to the challenges we noted in our 2005 report and 2008 testimony. The statement, as requested, highlights findings from that report and discusses the extent to which (1) USCIS has reduced the incidence of TNCs and E-Verify's vulnerability to fraud, (2) USCIS has provided safeguards for employees' personal information, and (3) USCIS and SSA have taken steps to prepare for mandatory E-Verify implementation. Our December 2010 report also includes a discussion of the extent to which USCIS has improved its ability to monitor and ensure employer compliance with E-Verify program policies and procedures. ...|$|R
40|$|International {{accounting}} scandals {{around the}} world have triggered a wave of interest and discussion on the transparency and integrity of financial statements. Prior literature has stated that due to a variety of motivations and by using different techniques, the management of corporations might intend to influence the figures in financial reporting. The preferred term used in the accounting literature to describe this issue is 'earnings management', which is a very interesting and topical issue for researchers. Therefore, this research investigates the earnings management phenomenon in the Libyan environment. In this research, secondary data, which was accruals-based models, and primary data analysis, which included a questionnaire survey combined with semi-structured interviews, were used to achieve the objectives of this research, that are: to determine the existence and the direction of earnings management in the Libyan context; the motivations and techniques behind that; and the earnings management constraints, which include internal accounting standards, corporate governance mechanism and audit quality. The analysis of secondary data examined the existence and the direction of earnings management in Libyan companies. Accruals-based models were applied on a sample of state-owned and private companies. The results indicated {{that the majority of the}} companies that engaged in earnings management by using income-increasing policies accruals were state-owned companies. However, the majority of the companies that engaged in earnings management by using income-decreasing policies accruals were private companies. The above results indicated that there are linkages between the direction of earnings management and the nature of company ownership in the Libyan environment. Further, as regards the relationship between the direction of earnings management and company size, the results of the state-owned companies group indicated that company size was positively and significantly associated with discretionary total accruals. On the other hand, the results of the private companies group indicated that company size was negatively and significantly linked to discretionary total accruals. The primary data analysis was used to investigate three main issues: the motivations behind the practice of earnings management; the most frequently used techniques to practice earnings management; and the earnings management constraints, which include accounting standards, internal corporate governance mechanism and audit quality. These subjects were investigated by using a questionnaire survey administered to external auditors, financial managers and senior accountants, internal auditors, lenders, tax officers and accounting academics. Also, a series of semistructured interviews was combined with the questionnaire survey, which was conducted with selected respondents to the survey. Results indicated that the main incentives for practising earnings management in Libyan state-owned companies were: to mitigate the threat of displacement (i. e. <b>safeguard</b> <b>job</b> position) and/or enhance management reputation, to report profits, to increase the value of management compensation, and to meet regulatory objectives. On the other hand, the main incentives for the private companies were to decrease the amount of taxes and to enhance the chance of obtaining bank loans. Further, the results showed that manipulation of the value of inventory, improper assets revaluation, incorrect capitalising rather than expensing of expenditures, manipulation of accrual estimation, incorrect use of expenses on asset acquisition, and related-party transactions were the most frequently used techniques to practice earnings management in Libya. Finally, the results showed a consensus among respondents on the importance of accounting standard. internal corporate governance mechanisms, audit quality as policies to constraint earnings management in the Libya environment...|$|R
