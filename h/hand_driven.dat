Lewis's {{invention}} is later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, although this comes about under great suspicion after a fire at Daniel Bourn's factory in Leominster that specifically uses Paul and Wyatt's spindles. Bourn produces a similar patent in the same year.|$|E

50|$|A new {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} (IRS) system was developed specifically for the new model. It also became the first version factory designed as a right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> export model to be sold overseas through Ford new car dealerships in right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets.

50|$|Right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> {{cars were}} made at GM's Oshawa plant in Canada and often shipped {{overseas}} in kit form for assembly in South Africa and New Zealand. The RHD cars — Chevrolet or equivalent Pontiac (built on Chevrolet frames and using Chevrolet engines in Canada) — all used a right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> version of the left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> 1961 Pontiac dashboard.|$|R
50|$|An {{aero engine}} inertia starter uses a pre-rotated {{flywheel}} to transfer kinetic {{energy to the}} crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over-torque conditions. Three variations have been used, <b>hand</b> <b>driven,</b> electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a manual cable is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.|$|E

5000|$|Irish born {{inventor}} James Henry Apjohn (1845-1914) patented an [...] "Apparatus for Cleaning Carriage, Motor Car {{and other}} Windows" [...] which was stated to use either brushes or wipers {{and could be}} either motor driven or <b>hand</b> <b>driven.</b> The brushes or wipers were intended to clean either both up and down or in just one direction on a vertical window.

50|$|By {{the time}} the Senator was updated to the new Senator B, and the Monza cancelled,43,812 Monzas had been built. There was no direct Monza replacement, {{although}} the idea of a large Opel/Vauxhall sporting car was also seen in the Lotus Carlton/Lotus Omega saloon. Bitter Cars put a 4.0 engine under the hood as a prototype. Three were built; two left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> and one right <b>hand</b> <b>drive,</b> one left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> burned out on a motorway in Germany and the other is in a museum, but the right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> one is in Somerset, UK.|$|R
50|$|The Explorer {{was sold}} outside of North America to export markets in a right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> configuration. Today {{countries}} like Japan export used right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> {{models of the}} Ford Explorer to other countries such as Australia and New Zealand where there is demand for quality used right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> SUVs. Due to Japans strict Shaken Laws, used vehicles tend to have low milage with detailed repair histories.|$|R

50|$|The Antikythera mechanism, {{discovered}} in 1900 in a wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera and extensively studied, exhibited the diurnal {{motions of the}} Sun, Moon, and the five known planets. It has been dated between 150 and 100 BC. The Antikythera <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> mechanism is now {{considered one of the}} first orreries, but for many decades was ignored as it was thought to be far too complex to be genuine. It was geocentric and used as a mechanical calculator designed to calculate astronomical positions.|$|E
50|$|Depending on climate, barnyards {{may contain}} trees for shade. A water source is also common; the {{watering}} trough in past times was supplied by {{water from a}} <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> well, with the water kept in wooden or metal containers. The water trough was filled daily, perhaps by a pitcher pump, or by windmill power. Pumping the trough full, by hand, was often the chore of farm children. In modern times, a trough may be hand-filled with a hose, or an automatic water fountain designed for livestock may be installed {{in one or more}} locations.|$|E
5000|$|The Berna 2 US is a truck model {{manufactured}} by the Swiss company Berna from 1957 onwards. The payload of 4.9 tonnes, it {{is a right}} <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> truck. The Berna 2 US, military designation [...] "Lastw m 4.0 t 4x2", has a total weight of 8800 kg, a structure with cab and bridge {{as well as an}} on-board voltage of 24 V. The 4-cylinder diesel engine with 5820 cm³ produces a power of 59 kW (80 hp). The Swiss Army used it since 1957. The Berna 2 US was also sold for civilian purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of the 3,131 cars were right <b>hand</b> <b>drive,</b> but some 300 were left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> models, built primarily for the Okinawa market. (Okinawa, having been American occupied, drove on the [...] "other side" [...] from the rest of Japan.) A very limited number of left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> cars were used by Toyota to [...] "test drive" [...] in the US, but Toyota made a decision not to import or sell the cars in the US market.|$|R

50|$|Assembly of the Laser also {{occurred}} in Malaysia and Indonesia (in right <b>hand</b> <b>drive)</b> and in left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> for markets like Taiwan and the Philippines. In Taiwan, it was assembled using complete knock-down kits from 1981 via the local joint venture Ford Lio Ho.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{ice cream}} vans carried simple ice cream, {{during a time}} when most {{families}} did not own a freezer. As freezers became more commonplace, ice cream vans moved towards selling novelty ice cream items, such as bars and popsicles. [...] Early vans used relatively primitive techniques: their refrigeration was ensured by large blocks of dry ice so the engine was always turned off when the van was stopped for sales. The chimes were operated by a <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> crank or a take-off from the engine, so they were not heard as often. Modern chimes are always electrically operated and amplified.|$|E
5000|$|In 1748 Lewis Paul of Birmingham, England invented two <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> carding machines. The {{first used}} {{a coat of}} wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals. This failed. On the second, a coat of wire slips was placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder.Daniel Bourn {{obtained}} a similar patent in the same year, and probably used it in his spinning mill at Leominster, but this burnt down in 1754. [...] The invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton. Arkwright's second patent (of 1775) for his carding machine was subsequently declared invalid (1785) because it lacked originality.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-late 2000's, Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) Jeep Grand Cherokees {{that came}} in right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> became a popular vehicle choice for Canadian Mail Carriers since it shared the same chassis, body, {{suspension}} and engine as the North American left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> version.|$|R
50|$|With the Aprilia Lancia {{followed}} their tradition of offering cars with {{the steering wheel}} on the right even in markets seen by other manufacturers as left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets.

5000|$|Having not complied, in February 2015 the Polish Government {{informed}} the Commission {{that it would}} not simply allow right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles to be dealt with {{in the same way as}} left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles; additional checks would be added to the annual roadworthiness tests.|$|R
50|$|The Puffin was {{powered by}} a 450 hp (336 kW) geared down Napier Lion II engine, a 12-cylinder unit with three banks of four {{cylinders}} in W or broad arrow arrangement. The radiator for the water-cooled engine was immediately {{in front of the}} engine and benefited from airflow from the two-bladed propeller. The electric starter used an internal battery. The single central float was wide and stretched aft to below {{the leading edge of the}} fin. It joined to the fuselage around the wing roots with two pairs of struts. The wheels were linked by an axle that rode in a vertical slot in the float at its deepest point, and a <b>hand</b> <b>driven</b> screw enabled them to be raised or lowered. The aft-most part of the float was hinged so it could lift up and down and provided with a tailskid and a vertical shock absorber to the fuselage. At the extreme rear was a water rudder. Two deep and wide chord floats were fitted below the outer interplane struts to provide lateral stability on the water.|$|E

30|$|The {{manipulation}} {{rules are}} required for the interaction of virtual <b>hand.</b> <b>Driven</b> by the motion data input to the virtual hand, the virtual hand has different shapes that can be projected to two orthogonal planes, and the gestures are obtained. With the meaningful gestures and the collision detection results, the manipulation is validated and then the virtual hand manipulation rules are established.|$|E
