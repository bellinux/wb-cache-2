5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the <b>hot</b> <b>spring,</b> which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|Sakurajima {{is part of}} the Kirishima-Yaku National Park, and its {{lava flows}} are a major tourist attraction.

5|$|The {{potential}} redevelopment of Sembawang <b>Hot</b> <b>Spring</b> into {{a national}} park is currently being explored. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on 23 April 2016 that it is prepared to return the land occupied by the <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> to the Singapore Land Authority. MINDEF hopes a public agency such as the National Parks Board (NParks) can take over to improve and maintain the place, while constructing amenities such as toilets and adding more greenery. The ministry added that putting the place under a public agency means the land need not be tendered out {{to the highest bidder}} and become commercialised.|$|E
50|$|Before World War II, {{there were}} about 40 <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> spas in Truth or Consequences. By 2008, the <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> Association in Truth or Consequences had 10 spa {{facilities}} as members. Five of those obtained their water from wells, and La Paloma <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> & Spa (formerly Marshall <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs),</b> Indian Springs Bath House, Artesian Bath house and Hay-Yo-Kay <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> are from free flowing <b>hot</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Boulder Creek {{is noted}} {{for a set}} of surface <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> {{commonly}} known as the Pebble Creek <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> and Keyhole <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> and rarely Boulder Creek <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs.</b> They are related to volcanism of the Mount Meager massif which last erupted about 2,350 years ago. The <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> issue from Mesozoic basement rocks near volcanic vents. <b>Hot</b> <b>springs</b> are also present at nearby Meager Creek.|$|R
5|$|This is {{a natural}} <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> that spouts water {{constantly}} without stopping for recharge. Some of these are incorrectly called geysers, {{but because they are}} not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the well}} {{can still be}} seen locked inside a red-brick {{enclosure}} with a steel gate, and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building. Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a makeshift shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, {{a series of}} {{scalding}} cases, including an incident in which a senior citizen diabetic lost six toes to gangrene after soaking in the <b>hot</b> <b>spring,</b> prompted the Singapore General Hospital to warn that people with nerve disorders or diseases affecting blood circulation should be cautious to hot mineral springs. As a result of some negative rumors and hearsay, and the RSAF redevelopment, public interest began to wane {{and the number of}} visitors dwindled.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} local {{developed}} <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> in Ouray and nearby Ridgway. These include the Ouray <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> Pool, the vapor caves of the Wiesbaden <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> Spa & Lodgings, the pools at the Twin Peaks Lodge & <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> {{and at the}} naturally landscaped pools at Orvis <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> in Ridgway.|$|R

5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a <b>hot</b> <b>spring.</b> The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a <b>hot</b> <b>spring,</b> {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing and washing clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran {{from one of the}} hot springs outside the city. In 1943, the first district heating company was started with the use of geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|During its peak, up to 300 people {{visited the}} <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> daily. On 1 March 2002, {{it was closed}} for two months while {{upgrading}} and improvement works were carried out to {{the area around the}} spring, which had become sodden and muddy. Litter had also become a problem because of the increased numbers of visitors. The former dirt track leading to the spring was paved with cement, and lined with bougainvillea bushes and high fences to ensure the security of the air base. Drainage pipes were also installed. Mindef, which owns the land, allows public access between 7 am and 7 pm daily, free-of-charge. When the spring reopened on 1 May 2002, more than 100 people visited the site despite the afternoon drizzle. At the same time, some new free-hold condominiums were built in the surrounding area; one of the developments, built by the property arm of F in 2001, is called Seletaris after the company's former mineral water.|$|E

5|$|East of San Diego, US 80 {{followed}} {{the path of}} El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street near downtown El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade. The route was realigned from Arnold Way onto Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation, before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I-8. At Laguna Junction, a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until when the building was taken down to provide land for the interchange with I-8. A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access to the communities of Descanso, Guatay and Pine Valley; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso. At the time, the Ellis Wayside Rest provided a rest area for travelers; later, the state recognized it as a historic site. Exiting the national forest, US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard, intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94. US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and into the <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> town of Jacumba. East of there, US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower.|$|E
5|$|The Tawau Hills National Park {{established}} as a natural water catchment area. The park contains rugged volcanic landscapes including a <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> and spectacular waterfalls. Bordering the Philippine Turtle Islands is the Turtle Islands National Park, it consists of three islands of Selingaan, Bakkungan Kechil and Gulisaan which is notable as the nesting place for green turtle and hawksbill sea turtle. Other important wildlife regions in Sabah include the Maliau Basin, Danum Valley, Tabin, Imbak Canyon and Sepilok. These places are either designated as national parks, wildlife reserves, virgin jungle reserves, or protection forest reserve. Beyond the coasts of Sabah lie a number of islands rich with coral reefs such as Ligitan, Sipadan, Selingaan, Tiga and Layang-Layang (Swallow Reef). Other main islands including the Jambongan, Timbun Mata, Bum Bum and the divided Sebatik. The Sabah state government has enacted several laws to protect its forests and endangered wildlife species under the Animals Ordinance 1962, Forest Enactment 1968 and the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 among others. Under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment, any persons hunting inside conservation lands are liable for imprisonment {{for five years and}} fined with RM50,000. The state government also plans to implement seasonal huntings as part of its conservation efforts to prevent the continuous lose of its endangered wildlife species while maintaining the state indigenous hunting traditions.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story begins}} on {{the outset of}} summer vacation. Hazumu's {{homeroom}} teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are {{the same age as}} her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort. The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.|$|E

5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a <b>hot</b> <b>spring,</b> Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E
