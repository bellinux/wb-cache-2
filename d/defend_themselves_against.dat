5|$|Alienation is {{a shooter}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by Housemarque {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released in April 2016 for PlayStation 4. The game is an isometric twin-stick shooter in which one to four players <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> an alien invasion on Earth through increasingly-difficult levels. Players can choose one of three character classes, {{each with its own}} abilities. Players can upgrade their weapons with collectables, known as upgrade cores.|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> {{expected}} attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
5|$|The forts were {{positioned}} to defend harbours and anchorages, and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, {{and to protect}} the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be self-contained and able to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had common features and were often built in a consistent style.|$|E
5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of}} his top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which {{included}} a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, a 173rd Airborne {{battalion}} of around 600 American paratroopers headed to Ukraine to train Ukrainian national guard troops. The training {{took place at}} the Yavoriv training center near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. The 173rd Airborne paratroopers trained the Ukrainians on how to better <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> Russian and rebel artillery and rockets. Training also included securing roads, bridges, and other infrastructure and treating and evacuating casualties. This program was known as Fearless Guardian which was congressionally approved under the Global Contingency Security Fund. Under the program, the United States trained three battalions of Ukrainian troops over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The ARF {{became a}} major {{political}} force in Armenian life. It was especially active in the Ottoman Empire, where it organized or participated in many revolutionary activities. In 1894, the ARF {{took part in the}} Sasun Resistance, supplying arms to the local population to help the people of Sasun <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> the Hamidian purges. In June 1896, the Armenakans organized the Defense of Van in the province of Van, where Ottoman Hamidieh soldiers were to attack the city. The Armenakans, assisted by members of the Hunchakian and ARF parties, supplied all able-bodied men of Van with weapons. They rose to defend the civilians from the attack and subsequent massacre.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In {{response}} to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the Ministry of Magic {{and many others}} in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> dark magic.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E

50|$|The game {{is set on}} a 1920s {{recreational}} cruise ship. Each {{player is}} assigned a quarry, and {{the object is to}} murder him or her with nobody watching, {{while at the same time}} watching out for, and <b>defending</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> their own hunter.|$|R
5|$|The trio {{returns to}} the hospital, resolving to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> the zombie horde. Setting up {{barricades}} and making improvised weapons, they battle the zombies, but Menard is killed. The patients reanimate inside the hospital, killing the staff, as the zombies breach the defences. Peter, Anne, and Brian escape as the hospital is consumed by fire. Brian is attacked by a zombified Susan, whom Peter shoots before the three {{make it back to}} the boat and leave the island. At sea, Brian dies. Anne and Peter lock his body in a cabin as proof of what has happened on Matul. His reanimated corpse begins banging on the door, as Peter and Anne listen to a radio report that the New York Harbor incident has escalated into an epidemic: as zombies advance on the Brooklyn Bridge, the entire city is under attack.|$|E
5|$|While at the station, Max overhears his new partner, Valerie Winterson, {{talking on}} the phone about Mona. Suddenly, the station is {{attacked}} by the Cleaners, who are looking for Mona. Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the Cleaners, Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> the Cleaners. After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} {{the option to}} choose which side they wish to command at the {{beginning}} of the game. If the German side is picked, the objective of the game is to evade the Royal Navy fleet by either sailing to Iceland or heading to the safety of Nazi occupied France. The player will only have the ability to control the Bismarck itself, and must <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> Royal Navy and Royal Air Force attacks if compromised. If the British side is chosen, then the player must command the hunting Royal Navy fleet in order to search and destroy the Bismarck. To achieve both these ends, the player will be able to access an in-game command centre, which will give out alerts depending on the side chosen. If controlling the Bismarck, the player will be reported of hostile British U-boat sightings. If controlling the Royal Navy fleet, they will be told of radio intercepts, which will pinpoint the Bismarcks approximate location.|$|E

5|$|In December 1695 the Spanish colonial {{authorities}} in Mérida received a diplomatic visit {{sent by the}} Aj Kan Ek'. The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, alcalde of Bacalar-at-Chunjujub'. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695, who arrived {{around the same time}} that the Itza were preparing to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain. In August Hariza travelled to Mérida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain. Four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities. The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza king. When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza–Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696. AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.|$|E
5|$|The Grey Havens, an Elven port on {{the western}} shores, is {{attacked}} by the Corsairs of Umbar, allies of Sauron. The Dwarves, who {{have been reluctant to}} ally with the Elves, eventually decide to {{come to the aid of}} the Grey Havens. With the Goblins defeated and all of Eriador pacified, the Dwarven-Elven alliance is tested by Sauron's forces. Mordor's overwhelming forces besiege the Lake Town of Esgaroth and the Dwarven city of Erebor. The Dwarven king Dáin leads a small group of Dwarves and men of Dale to defend their homeland and manage to eliminate the Mordor presence in Esgaroth but are forced to retreat back to Erebor to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>against</b> an overwhelming army led by the Mouth of Sauron. After a long battle against the Mouth of Sauron's army, Elven reinforcements from Mirkwood led by the Elven king Thranduil arrive and save the Dwarves, defeating the Mouth of Sauron and his army. Elrond leads the first attack, but later, Thranduil, Glorfindel, Glóin, Arwen, and King Dáin all unite under the Dwarven-Elven alliance for a final battle in Dol Guldur, the stronghold of Sauron in Mirkwood, aided by the Ents and Eagles. The Good forces and its three combined armies overcome the defenses and destroy the fortress, eliminating the last threat in the North.|$|E
