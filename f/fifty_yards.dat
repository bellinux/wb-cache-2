5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzb√ºhel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged <b>fifty</b> <b>yards</b> down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E

On that date Valdez ran over seventy-five yards of open terrain, under {{constant}} enemy fire, to aid a fallen Marine. He then moved the wounded man to a safe area and, quickly and competently, rendered medical assistance. Again exposing himself to enemy fire, Valdez moved across approximately <b>fifty</b> <b>yards</b> of open ground to another Marine.

In one case, a commercial Ugandan bank provided a loan of $100,000 to the winning bidder to finance the construction works.|$|R
5|$|By 1946, Van Buren was {{considered}} one of {{the best players in the}} league. Before the season, he signed a three-year contract to remain with the Eagles, dispelling rumors that he planned to join the rival All-America Football Conference. He returned just five punts in the 1946 season, but ran one of them back <b>fifty</b> <b>yards</b> for a touchdown against the Boston Yanks in the final game of the year. It was the last punt Van Buren returned in his career. He finished the season with 529 rushing yards, third-most behind leader Bill Dudley of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rookie Pat Harder of the Chicago Cardinals. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the New York Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by the United Press.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two ships}} closed Truxtun's ship held the weather gauge, the {{position}} upwind from his opponent which {{allowed him to}} close or break off. However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her leeward side. From there Constellation could bring more of her guns to bear. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within <b>fifty</b> <b>yards</b> of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 51 - 54) The {{purpose of}} this investigation was to determine the effectiveness of two different training programs on the time required to run the <b>fifty</b> <b>yard</b> dash. Fifty-five male volunteers, who were involved in body conditioning classes at San Fernando Valley State College {{during the time of the}} experiment, served as subjects for the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Group A was the forced speed running group, Group B was the uphill and downhill running group, and Group C was the control group. The study lasted for six weeks with three training sessions each week. Group A trained on the treadmill at a forced running speed of five bouts in each of three sessions each week, alternately running uphill and downhill during the sessions, with thirty second interval between the bouts. Group C ran on only three test days, which were the first day of the experiment, at the end of the third week and on the final day of the experiment. Each test day all subjects ran three fifty-yard dashes. The data was statistically analyzed, using both mean and the maximum scores for each subject. The null hypothesis, stating that no difference in running speeds exists between groups in which participated in ???forced speed running???, ???uphill and downhill running??? and the control group which did not engage in a planned program to increase running speed, was found to be tenable. The following general conclusion appears justified: Neither forced speed running nor ???uphill or downhill running??? significantly influences running speed...|$|R
25|$|The {{team won}} their first preseason {{game against the}} Houston Texans by a score of 20‚Äì19. The game was {{highlighted}} by a staunch performance from their three quarterbacks. Rex Grossman completed eight of ten passes for <b>fifty</b> <b>yards,</b> while his back-up, Brian Griese, went six for seven with seventy-two yards and one touchdown and interception. However, third-string quarterback Kyle Orton played an integral part in their victory. Orton, who played nearly two quarters, completed sixteen of twenty-five passes for 151 yards and a single touchdown. At one point, he had completed twelve consecutive passes. Running back Josh Allen and Orton got the Bears to the Texans' twenty-nine-yard line, where Robbie Gould kicked the game's winning field goal. While the team's defense and offense performed productively, their special teams unit drew skepticism after allowing the Texans to produce several large kick returns. Dave Toub, the Bears' special team coach, blamed the problems on a lack of experience and poor tackling, which have since been properly addressed.|$|E
25|$|During the Paitilla Airfield operation, another Navy SEAL group, {{consisting}} of four divers and men on Zodiac attack boats, {{was assigned to}} sabotage Noriega's heavily armed gunboat, Presidente Porras, while it was tied to a pier on the canal. The plan called for the divers to plant explosives {{on the bottom of}} the boat, using Draeger rebreathers, which do not give off exhalation bubbles, for added secrecy. The divers were transported by several combat rubber raiding craft to an insertion point located in a grove of mangrove trees roughly one hundred <b>fifty</b> <b>yards</b> away from the target. The divers entered the water and approached the boat in separate pairs, attached the explosives, and began exfiltrating. As they were leaving, several PDF guards began dropping grenades and shooting into the water, forcing the SEALs to take cover under the pier. Due to this diversion, the divers were still in the area when the bombs went off, and were able to confirm that the ship was destroyed. As the divers were heading back to the rendezvous point, they heard a large ship approaching overhead, and were forced to descend to forty feet, dangerous due to the increased toxicity of the pure oxygen used in the Draeger at greater pressures. However, no divers experienced any ill effects, and both pairs were picked up by several raiding craft, and were transported back to Rodman Naval Base.|$|E

The athletic association to purchased 1,500 additional bleacher seats for {{the east side of}} University Field, but, the team fell way short of all expectations and the expected crowds never materialized. Even with the disappointing season Sweetland's team did accomplished a first in Ohio State football history. It was the first Buckeye team to cross the goal line against University of Michigan. The touchdown was scored by the Buckeye's when Bill Marquardt returned a fumble <b>fifty</b> <b>yards.</b> The next year, he and the Buckeyes improved to 8‚Äì2‚Äì2. This team did not give up any points in Ohio Athletic Conference games. They did have a 0‚Äì0 tie to Case Institute of Technology. Case won the conference due to the fact they played and won two more games in conference than the Buckeyes. The two losses that season were to future Big Ten Conference rivals University of Michigan (40‚Äì0) and Indiana University (11‚Äì0). Sweetland finished with a combined record of 14‚Äì7‚Äì2 in his two years as the Buckeyes head man. Sweetland also coached the Buckeye's track and field team.
