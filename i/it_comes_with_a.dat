500|$|The lens {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] It has a bulb-like aspherical lens, similar to notable wide-angle and fisheye lenses {{such as the}} Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED, Nikon AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8G ED, or Tokina AT-X 107 DX AF 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 fisheye lens. Because of the shape of front element, it is not compatible with many filters, including UV filters, but the frontal exposure is rectified by a petal-shaped lens hood element. Because the lens has a permanent lens hood affixed, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friction-fit aluminum element, variously described as a sleeve, ring or shroud, that surrounds the hood to enable the placement of a front cap on the lens. PC Magazine Jim Fisher says the lens is relatively large and heavy; A reviewer at photozone.de says that for a wide-angle lens the dimensions are unusually narrow but long.|$|E
500|$|GamePro {{also gave}} Super Mario Sunshine a perfect score, {{stating that the}} game was [...] "a {{masterpiece}} of superior game design, infinite gameplay variety, creativity, and life."

Allgame gave a lower review, stating that [...] "During the six-year span between Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine, platform games have become more epic, more interactive, and prettier. Yet the core element of collecting items in a world divided into sub-sections has been left unchanged.

500|$|Others, like Harold Bloom, have {{emphasized}} the [...] "exhausted landscape", the completion, the finality of death, although [...] "Winter descends here as a man might hope to die, with a natural sweetness". If death in itself is final, here <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lightness, a softness, also pointing to [...] "an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief." [...] The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging [...] "to something larger than the self", as James O'Rourke expresses it, but the cycle {{comes to an end}} each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied {{at the end of the}} poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats's own possible fear.|$|E
