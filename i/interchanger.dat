40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} minimizing the number of wavelength <b>interchangers</b> {{in the design of}} wide-sense nonblocking crossconnects for wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks. The problem is modeled as a graph theoretic problem that we call dynamic edge coloring. In dynamic edge coloring the nodes of a graph are fixed but edges appear and disappear, and must be colored at the time of appearance without assigning the same color to adjacent edges. For wide-sense nonblocking WDMcross-connects with k input and k output fibers, it is straightforward to show that 2 k− 1 wavelength <b>interchangers</b> are always sufficient. We show that there is a constant c> 0 such that if there are at least ck 2 wavelengths then 2 k− 1 wavelength <b>interchangers</b> are also necessary. This improves previous exponential bounds. When there are only 2 or 3 wavelengths available, we show that far fewer than 2 k− 1 wavelength <b>interchangers</b> are needed. However we also prove that for any ε> 0 andk> 1 / 2 ε, if the number of wavelengths is at least 1 /ε 2 then 2 (1 −ε) k wavelength <b>interchangers</b> are needed...|$|R
40|$|A {{wavelength}} division multiplexed (WDM) network employs multiple wavelengths {{in order}} to carry many channels in an optical fiber. Switching is, ideally, done by a WDM cross-connect that allows each incoming input channel to be routed to any (unused) output channel. To do this the cross-connect requires expensive components called wavelength <b>interchangers</b> that permute the wavelengths on a fiber in any desired manner. The cross-connect {{is said to be}} wide-sense nonblocking if there is an on-line algorithm that assures that it can always meet demands. (This is weaker than strictly nonblocking where the demands are never blocked even when previous demands have been routed arbitrarily). Our goal here is to minimize the number of wavelength <b>interchangers</b> in the design of a wide-sense nonblocking cross-connect with k input fibers and k output fibers. It is easily seen that 2 kΓ 1 wavelength <b>interchangers</b> suffice, even with greedy routing; we show that with O(k 2) wavelengths they are necessary as well, regardless of the routing algorithm. This improves previous exponential bounds. On the positive side, we show that in the case where there are only 2 or 3 wavelengths there is a significant {{reduction in the number of}} wavelength <b>interchangers</b> required. However, we also show that for any " ? 0 and k? 1 = 2 ", if there are at least 1 =" 2 wavelengths then 2 (1 Γ ") k wavelength <b>interchangers</b> are necessary. This WDM cross-connect problem is shown to be equivalent to a dynamic edge coloring problem for bipartite multigraphs and the results are stated and derived in terms of this edge coloring problem...|$|R

Employing timeslot interchangers in optical TDM is similar to employing wavelength converters in WDM. The former converts between wavelengths, and the latter between timeslots. In this paper, we conduct a comparison between POTSI and the various OTSIs noted in the literature in terms of fiber length, crossbar size, and number of switching operations. Furthermore, we propose an optimized form of POTSI, Limited Range POTSI (POTSI-LR), which can switch a timeslot within a subset of nearby slots in a frame.

40|$|Abstract—Reducing {{communication}} latency, {{which is}} a performance bottleneck in optically interconnected multiprocessor systems, is of prominent importance. A conventional approach for establishing connections in multiplexed networks uses a set of independent time slots (or virtual channels) along a path for each connection. This approach {{requires the use of}} switching devices capable of interchanging time slots, and thus introduces latency in addition to hardware and control complexity. In this paper, we propose an approach to all-optical Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) communications in multiprocessor systems. The idea is to establish a connection along a path using a set of time slots (or virtual channels) that are dependent on each other, so that no time-slot interchanging is required. We compare the proposed approach with the conventional one in terms of the overall communication latency. We found that, despite the possibility that establishing a connection may take a longer time, the proposed approach will result in lower overall communication latency as it eliminates the delays introduced by the time-slot interchanging switching devices.

40|$|All-optical {{networks}} have attracted significant attention because they promise to provide significant advantages in throughput, bandwidth, scalability, reliability, security, and energy efficiency. These six features appealed to optical transport-network operators {{in the past}} and, currently, to cloud-computing and data-center providers. But, the absence of optical processors and optical Random Access Memory (RAM) has forced the optical network designers to use optical-to-electrical conversion on the input side of every node so the node can process packet headers and store data during the switching operation. And, at every node’s output side, all data must be converted from its electronic form back to the optical domain before being transmitted over fiber to the next node. This practice reduces all six of those advantages the network would have if it were all-optical. So, to achieve a network that is all-optical end-to-end, many all-optical switching fabrics have been proposed. Many of these proposed switching fabrics lack a control algorithm to operate them. Two control algorithms are proposed in this dissertation for two previously-proposed switching fabrics. The first control algorithm operates a timeslot <b>interchanger</b> and the second operates a space/time switching fabric - where both these photonic systems are characterized by active Feed-Forward Fiber Delay Line (FF-FDL) and the frame-integrity constraint.

SOA Mach-Zehnder interferometers (SOA-MZI) show great potential for being used as fundamental building blocks in developing intelligent high speed all-optical sub-systems. In this context we discuss the development of optical systems that perform diverse and non-trivial network functionalities that find application in Optical Packet/Burst Switching networks (OPS/OBS). The use of generic building blocks to develop a variety of optical sub-systems is essential, as this avoids the requirement for custom-made technological solutions and allows for a common fabrication procedure for all subsystems. In this context, we discuss latest research on integration of arrays of such optical switches onto the same photonic chip using hybrid integration technology. The development of such arrays reduces the cost of photonic devices by sharing the packaging and pigtailing costs. By using an integrated quadruple array of SOA-MZI switches we demonstrate the frontend unit of an All-optical Label Switched node that performs clock recovery, data recovery and label/payload separation, and a scalable Time Slot <b>Interchanger</b> (TSI), proving the multi-functionality and processing power of such device. Both functional systems exhibit comparable performance compared to implementations using single switches with significantly lower device costs.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in photonic switching have {{paved the way}} for realizing all-optical time switched networks. The current technology of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) offers bandwidth granularity that match peak electronic transmission speed by dividing the fiber bandwidth into multiple wavelengths. However, the bandwidth of a single wavelength is too large for certain traffic. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) allows multiple traffic streams to share the bandwidth of a wavelength efficiently. While introducing wavelength converters and time slot <b>interchangers</b> improve network blocking performance, it is often of interest to know the incremental benefits offered by every additional stage of switching. As all-optical networks in future are expected to employ heterogeneous switching architectures, it is necessary to have generalized network model that allows to study these networks under a unified framework. In this paper, a network model, called Trunk Switched Network (TSN), is proposed to facilitate modeling and analysis of such networks. An analytical model for evaluating the blocking performance of a class of TSN's has also been developed. Using the analytical model, it is shown that a significant performance improvement is obtained with a time-space switch with no wavelength conversion at each node in a multi-wavelength TDM switched network.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} all-optical switching paradigms assume different wavelengths are switched independently, and hence require W switching planes at each core switch, where W {{is the number of}} wavelengths that an optical fiber can carry. As W is becoming as large as a few hundreds in the near future, the above requirement limits the scalability of core switches. In this paper, we present a novel all-optical switching paradigm, called optical cell switching (OCS), for the next-generation optical network. By time-division multiplexing (TDM), time in OCS is divided into time slots of fixed size, and every F consecutive time slots constitute a frame. Fine bandwidth granularity can be achieved by increasing F. The wavelengths in a time slot are all bundled, and each time slot is called an optical composite cell (OCC). The OCC is the switching unit in the OCS network. Therefore, each OCS core switch (OCX) requires only one switching plane and performs mere time-space switching, thus simplifying the management and reducing the implementation complexity of the OCX. Nevertheless, traffic can be aggregated at edge routers and groomed in the wavelength domain before entering the OCS core network. The OCS network can support both guaranteed and best-effort services. Optical time-slot <b>interchangers</b> (OTSIs) can be employed to further improve the performance of OCS. We provide simulation results to show that the OCS network can achieve low call-blocking rate for guaranteed services, and low cell-loss rate for besteffort services...|$|R

The inland waters of South America provide two examples of biological invasions. This review examines bivalve invasions in South America, summarizes the research results for two species, the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) and the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), and suggests further studies. The rapid expansion of invasive bivalves into these environments involves significant changes. Until now, C. fluminea, the Asian clam, did not produce generalized macrofouling in the Neotropical region, as is common in the Holarctic region. However, the first specific cases of macrofouling by C. fluminea were recently detected in heat <b>interchangers</b> of power stations in Brazil. On the other hand, L. fortunei is provoking new economic impacts in South American freshwaters through macrofouling. Before the invasion by the golden mussel, macrofouling was recorded only in the marine and estuarine environments of the Neotropical region. The impact caused by invasive bivalves in this region is not only economic, however. Rapid changes in the benthic community, favoring the presence of Oligochaeta and Hirudinea, as well as the displacement of native species of mollusks, are among the problems related to the presence of the golden mussel. Another issue is the settlement of golden mussels on native bivalves. This bivalve is now a new element in the diet of some native fish species, being the main food item in some cases...|$|R

40|$|Optical Time Division Multiplexing (OTDM) in optical {{networks}} is a bandwidth sharing {{technique that}} organizes {{access to a}} shared wavelength in equal time-slots organized in repeated frames. In this case, a transmission channel can be established at the time-slot level instead of using the full wavelength. The main advantage of this technique is to allow several low speed communication channels to coexist on the same high speed optical wavelength, and hence to make effective use of the enormous bandwidth available on a single wavelength. On the other hand, the major problem with OTDM is the time slot continuity constraint in an OTDM channel, {{which is similar to}} the wavelength continuity in a WDM channel. Due to this constraint, time slot contentions can exist in the network if proper scheduling and slot reservation techniques are not employed. Basically, the adopted time slots must be free on all links throughout the communication route in order to successfully reserve a communication channel. In addition, to mitigate the effect of slot continuity constraint on bandwidth utilization, appropriate time slot buffering (or interchanging) is often employed. Previous work assumed the deployment of Optical Time-Slot <b>Interchangers</b> (OTSI) to solve the contention problems regardless of their industrial feasibility. In addition, other work considered very basic reservation schemes to achieve proper scheduling, such as the First Fit (FF), Random Fit (RF), and Least Loaded (LL) schemes. In this thesis, we propose a new time-slot reservation scheme for OTDM networks without buffering to significantly improve the performance and eliminate the buffering overhead. It is the Least Constraining (LC) slot reservation scheme which allocates resources having the lowest possible constraints on other resources in the network. In addition, we define a distributed scheme to deploy the LC approach in GMPLS networks, and prove that the same performance level can be maintained by a distributed signaling protocol. Finally, we propose an optimized optical buffering technique to achieve close to optimum performance when the LC reservation approach is not used. It helps in building effective time slot synchronization devices uses between adjacent node pairs...|$|R
40|$|Optical Time-Division Multiplexing (O-TDM) {{requires}} no optical header processing and could be, {{in the near}} future, a more practical alternative to optical packet-based switching schemes such as Optical Burst Switching and Optical Packet Switching for providing a finer bandwidth granularity than that can be provided by pure Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. As mature technologies for optical buffering are not yet available, we believe that in an O-TDM network, an important design criterion will be the minimization of the buffer requirement. The theme of this thesis is the exploration of Routing and Time-Slot Assignment (RTA) strategies and network architectures for O-TDM networks {{with the purpose of}} reducing the buffer requirement without sacrificing network capacity. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we first formulate a Markovian model for the arrival and departure process of O-TDM circuits in a single node. We then establish an analytic procedure for the computation of 'bandwidth blocking' and 'buffer blocking', and compare the relative contributions of the two types of blocking to the overall blocking probability. Here we show that we can set a limit to the maximum buffering delay that is allowed in a single node without adversely affecting the overall blocking probability. Then we go beyond a single node and explore RTA algorithms for O-TDM mesh networks. An Expanded Shortest Path (ESP) algorithm is devised such that by expanding each network node into an expanded set of mini-nodes, we can flexibly solve the RTA problem under various bandwidth and buffer cost assumptions. Since the result for the single node case shows that we can reduce the buffer holding time without degrading the overall call blocking probability, we formulate also a trimmed ESP algorithm with greatly reduced complexity. In the second part of this thesis, we shift our focus to O-TDM ring networks without Time Slot <b>Interchangers</b> (TSIs). We show that the intrinsic propagation delay in a TSI-free O-TDM ring network will lead to formation of 'slot cycles' which link together the time-slots in the ring. By studying the concept of 'slot cycle' and the algebraic relationship between the frame size and the total propagation delay of the ring, we discover an O-TDM ring architecture where all slots belong to one slot cycle. We show that by using carefully designed RTA strategies, our proposed architecture can achieve many of the widely used capacity bounds that have been established for WDM rings with wavelength converters. An example is the ⎡N / 4 ⎤bound for the N-node single-port bidirectional ring. In the third part of the thesis, we extend our results in the second part to the case of Single-Connected Double Ring. We believe that interconnected ring may be needed for extended geographical coverage in an O-TDM ring network. Especially, we explore the associated slot cycle properties for the Single-Connected Double Ring. We show that some important properties of an isolated TSI-free ring still hold in an interconnected ring, but other properties will change. We analyze the capacity required to set up a traffic matrix for a given load and show its corresponding time slot assignment algorithm. We also present a generalized Tucker's algorithm that can be used for cases where TSIs are deployed to reduce the capacity requirement. Results in this thesis will enable system designers to make the best tradeoff between bandwidth efficiency and buffer efficiency in an O-TDM network...|$|R
