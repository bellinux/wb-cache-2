5|$|Aarakshan (2011), a socio-drama {{based on}} the issue of caste based {{reservations}} in Indian, was Bajpayee's next film. The film sparked controversy in some groups and was banned in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh before its theatrical release. Trade journalists had <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the film, but it ultimately flopped at the box office. Bajpai's followup was the thriller Lanka (2011).|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2008, {{before the}} release of Left 4 Dead, Valve Corporation {{announced}} that it had purchased Turtle Rock {{in an effort to}} expand the company's console market. Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve Corporation, added that it was an easy decision for the company to make, as they had <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> Left 4 Dead and considered themselves having a long-term relationship with Turtle Rock. After being acquired by Valve, Turtle Rock served as Valve's in-house satellite development team, and was renamed Valve South.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences between college students from divorced and intact families {{with respect to their}} <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> marriage, division of household labor, and childcare. A divorced family was defined as one in which the parents have divorced and includes those who remain single after the divorce and those where one or both parents have remarried. An intact family was defined as one in which the parents were currently married to each other and had never been divorced from each other. Participants included 102 Southern Illinois University undergraduate students enrolled in a introductory psychology course who participated for course credit. It was hypothesized that participants from divorced families would have <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> an egalitarian marriage, more negative attitudes toward divorce, <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the husband 2 ̆ 7 s role in performing household labor, and <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the husband 2 ̆ 7 s role in taking care of the children than those participants from intact families. Results suggest that women have <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> an egalitarian marriage and more positive attitudes toward marriage than men do, women expect to do more household tasks than men whereas men expect household tasks to be shared equally, and women from intact families expect husbands to do more childcare than what men expect to do whereas women from divorced families expect husbands to do less than what men expect to do...|$|R
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
5|$|The team at Revolution had <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> Broken Sword, {{but there}} was {{significant}} competition. Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games, but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries. Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin's Don Bluth studios drew the backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in Photoshop. The introductory sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess, {{who worked for the}} Red Rover animation studio. The game's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the taste and appeal of food.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of Burnout 3: Takedown, UK-based development studio Criterion had been collaborating with publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on a skating video game. However, disagreements over the game's creative direction led to its cancellation and falling out between the two companies. EA later approached Criterion about reuniting and partnering on a game, and so Criterion began developing Burnout 3: Takedown in June 2004 on the condition that EA would not interfere in the creative process. Over a year later, EA acquired Criterion and the Burnout series; their <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> Burnout 3: Takedown was influential in the acquisition. The game launched in September 2004 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles.|$|E
5|$|The film brings {{together}} the video diaries recorded by four friends and {{students at the}} Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in Zayouna, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the Karrada suburb of Baghdad, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the year ahead and hope to graduate so {{they can have a}} chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing sectarian violence that is starting to extend into Karrada. They face the threats of roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints on their way to school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American Apache helicopters overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.|$|E

5|$|Kariya and Selänne joined {{an already}} high-powered Avalanche team that {{included}} such forwards as Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay. Despite <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the duo's reunion, Kariya and Selänne both struggled in their sole years with Colorado. After beginning the 2003–04 season {{on a line}} with Selänne centred by Joe Sakic, Kariya suffered a sprained right wrist {{in a game against}} the Boston Bruins on October 21, 2003. After being sidelined for ten games, he returned in mid-November, but re-injured his wrist in his first contest back. Due to the injury, Kariya missed playing against the Ducks {{for the first time in}} a home game on November 18. Still recovering a month later, he remained sidelined for a return to Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond on December 20. Kariya's departure from the Ducks drew criticism from his previous team's fans. In anticipation of the Avalanche-Ducks game on December 20, Anaheim fans began a fund that raised over $1,200 to be given to the favourite charity of the Ducks player who scores the game-winning goal against Colorado. The idea was precipitated by reports that Kariya had given Selänne $3,000 for scoring the game-winning goal against the Ducks on November 18 (it is an informal tradition in the NHL for players to offer rewards to teammates who score against former teams). Kariya returned to the Avalanche lineup in time for their next game against the Ducks on January 13, 2004, at the Pepsi Center. He scored one goal in a 3–1 win. Later that month, he played his first game against the Ducks in Anaheim on January 30. Booed every time he touched puck, he recorded two assists, as the Avalanche lost 4–3 in overtime. Limited by injuries, Kariya scored below his career pace with 11 goals and 36 points over 51 games. Selänne recorded 32 points, while playing in 78 games. In the final game of the regular season, Kariya injured his right ankle against the Nashville Predators on April 4. As a team, Colorado lost their division for the first time in nine years to the Vancouver Canucks. Qualifying for the 2004 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West, they lost in the second round to the Sharks. Kariya returned to the Colorado lineup in time for Game 6 against the Sharks, recording an assist as the Avalanche were eliminated by a score of 3–1.|$|E
