40|$|OBJECTIVE: Police {{officers}} {{have a higher}} risk for cardiovascular disease. Reductions in occupational physical activity {{may contribute to the}} risk, yet there have been few efforts to characterize the physical demands of police work beyond self-report. PURPOSE: To compare measured physical activity between work and off-duty hours and assess the effects of stress on physical activity. METHODS: Officers (n = 119) from six departments wore a pattern recognition monitor for 96 hours to measure total energy expenditure (<b>kilocalorie</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> (1 k/cal = 4184 joules), activity intensity, and step count per hour. RESULTS: Participants were more active on their off-duty days than at work; the effects of stress on physical activity seemed moderated by sex. CONCLUSIONS: Police work is primarily a sedentary occupation, and officers tend to be more active on their off-duty days than during their work hours...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{temperature}} and body heat were measured in 30 patients. Despite the warming of most fluids given intravenously, all the patients ventilated with dry anaesthetic gases became cooler, {{with an average}} heat loss of 12. 4 <b>kilocalories</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> In a group to whom the gases were delivered saturated at body temperature, the average hourly loss was 1. 5 kilocalories. This difference is {{in agreement with the}} effects calculated from respiratory heat exchange, and indicates that heated humidifi-cation can help to limit or prevent the development of hypothermia in anaesthetized adults. The anaesthetized patient has a reduced metabolic rate, and his thermoregulation is impaired. Body temperatures decrease more rapidly when skin and visceral surfaces are extensively exposed to cool air (Lunn, 1969; Morris, 1971). Cold intravenous infusions, irrigating solutions and wet packs further enhance the tendency to body cooling. The com-bination of these effects can cause the deep body temperature to become less than 32 CC (Newman, 1971). This can happen even with blood-warming and a heated water-mattress (Searle, 1971). The role of respiratory heat exchange has been discounted in anaesthesia for adults (Sato, 1961), yet many of the studies in which temperature reductions were reported appear to involve ventila-tion with dry gases (Lunn, 1969; Lewis and Mac-kenzie, 1972). In infants and children, Rashad and Benson (1967) showed that heated humidification was able to limit or prevent temperature reductions. Moreover, the humidifier has been used effectively in "core " rewarming of adults with accidental hypothermia (Ledingham and Mone, 1972; Lloyd, 1973). In order to assess the role which the humidifier might have, this study compares two groups of adult patients undergoing elective surgery, and attempts to separate the effects of respiratory heat exchange from the other factors which influence heat balance.

The PM ATPase had an estimated Arrhenius energy of activation (Ea) of approximately 18 <b>kilocalories</b> <b>per</b> mole for ATP hydrolysis, and the Ea for proton transport was best estimated with acridine orange, which gave an Ea of 19 <b>kilocalories</b> <b>per</b> mole.

Respiration rates of freshly excised root segments in response to cyanide and to varying temperatures were also measured. The cell membrane PD of roots which had been washed for 12 to 15 hours was almost insensitive to cyanide and anoxia but sensitive to low temperature. In contrast, the cell membrane PD of freshly excised roots was reversibly depolarized by all three treatments, cyanide depolarized from − 117 to − 86 millivolts and the sequential imposition of anoxia further lowered the PD to − 69 millivolts. Anoxia applied first depolarized maximally and the PD was not further lowered by sequential cyanide treatment.

This low efficiency is the result of about 40% efficiency of generating ATP from the respiration of food, losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle, and mechanical losses inside the body.

To account for the relative lack of seasonal variation in DEC, the original hypothesis was rejected in favor of an alternative that predicts that a bird will change its time and energy allocations throughout the year {{in such a way that}} its DEC remains relatively constant. When compared with DEC values calculated using the food-balance technique, the DEC values based on time-budget data underestimated empirical DEC values by as much as 14 percent during extreme temperature conditions.

Regression equations of heart rate versus caloric expenditure were determined for each subject and were used to calculate energy expenditures.

We analyzed purchase data from the Homescan survey, an ongoing, longitudinal, na-tionally representative US survey, from 2000 to 2010 (n = 34, 294).
