500|$|During recording, Timberlake {{sat down}} with Madonna and played a guitar riff {{composed}} by him, asking <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> wanted the song to sound.

[...] In this way, one of the ideas they connected was the universality of long-distance relationships, the pain and heartache of which they were able to incorporate in [...] "Miles Away". After recording it, Timberlake commented that he had helped in creating a classic Madonna song, saying [...] "I couldn't do a song like that, [...] I thought it was completely her.

[...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you want. To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E
500|$|Chotiner {{had worked}} on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular {{governor}} {{did not want to}} be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|E

500|$|Donovan {{commented that}} Scott loved Charlene, {{so when he}} saw she was in danger, he forgot to think about himself and he just went in to rescue her. Donovan added that Scott was [...] "devastated" [...] when he saw Charlene had been injured. At the hospital, Scott gave Charlene the {{friendship}} ring and declared that they would live together. Minogue told Bourne that Charlene was flattered by the gift, while Donovan stated that it proved that they loved each other and {{were not going to}} break up again. Minogue agreed with Donovan, saying [...] "There is that underlying love whether they are together or not." [...] After learning about the couple's plans to move in together, their friends and neighbours expressed their shock at how serious the couple had become. When Charlene showed the ring to Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) and told <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> and Scott wanted to live together, Daphne was taken back. Scott's friend Mike Young (Guy Pearce) also voiced his opposition, but Scott was determined that no one would stop them from moving in together.

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at a former Chili's in the San Fernando Valley, {{in the city}} of Burbank. The episode was filmed [...] "from dawn, until very late at night", {{according}} to Kaling. During filming breaks, Kaling later joked that she took [...] "ladylike" [...] naps, while Paul Lieberstein made notes on the episode and its script. While filming, many parts of the script were changed so the restaurant would allow the shoot to continue. For instance, in the original script, Pam vomits at Chili's and Dwight responds, [...] "A woman has vomited!" [...] Because the completed script was not available for Chili's to review until shooting had already started, when they were finally given a chance to read it, they objected to a customer vomiting in their restaurant. Chili's withdrew its permission to shoot, but, after a few hours, Steve Carell developed a compromise: Pam would fall off her bar stool and Dwight would respond, [...] "A woman has had a seizure!" [...] In the original version, Pam was also to be over-served alcohol by the Chili's staff, but Chili's—feeling that this would reflect poorly on their character as a company—did not want this in the episode either. To solve this issue, the writers had Pam steal drinks off other tables. The writers and producers also agreed to include a scene in which the actual owner of the Chili's restaurant (Jon Bosshart, not an actor) makes it clear that the restaurant does not over-serve alcohol to its customers. [...] Since Jenna Fischer does not drink much in real life, B. J. Novak took her out so she could get drunk while Novak described to <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> was behaving and how it did not match her own perception. She drew upon this experience for her performance.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father {{in the land of}} the midnight sun. Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings, famous in history. As such he is held in great reverence by his servants, who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king, and his daughter a princess. Outside of the years spent at school, Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone, her mother having died when she was a baby. When on a visit to her mother's grave, Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington, a distinguished young Englishman, who is touring Norway in his private yacht. Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and, obtaining information as to where she lives, presents himself to Olaf, the Viking, and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter. Sir Philip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride, and with her sails back to England. In London, Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip's friends, who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis. Lady Clara, alone, of all Sir Philip's old friends, wishes Thelma harm. She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip, and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far-off Norway. This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma's happiness, and force her to leave England. This she contrives to do, in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her, but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara. As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend, who is in love with Lady Clara, and wishes her to become his wife. This Lady Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her. Thelma, heartbroken, believing she has lost her husband's love, returns to Norway, just as her father, the Viking, breathes his last. She, with his faithful followers, complies with his last wishes, which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him – sent out to sea in his burning ship. This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past. After straining her eyes for a final look at the departing ship, Thelma retraces her steps to her mother's grave, and there, feeling that she is absolutely alone, prays for the strength to live. Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother, where first she met the man who won her heart, Sir Philip again finds Thelma. A few words suffice to show <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> has been tricked, and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart. In Sir Philip's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father; she starts out bravely to again face the world, now sure of his unending love." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{reporting}} various unsavory hearsay, {{the ancient}} sources generally portray Livia (Julia Augusta) {{as a woman}} of proud and queenly attributes, faithful to her imperial husband, for whom she was a worthy consort, forever poised and dignified. With consummate skill she acted out the roles of consort, mother, widow and dowager. Dio records two of her utterances: [...] "Once, when some naked men met her and were {{to be put to}} death in consequence, she saved their lives by saying that to a chaste woman such men are in no way different from statues. When someone asked <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> had obtained such a commanding influence over Augustus, she answered that it was by being scrupulously chaste herself, doing gladly whatever pleased him, not meddling with any of his affairs, and, in particular, by pretending neither to hear nor to notice the favourites of his passion." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
