5|$|Long {{before the}} first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to Native Americans, who lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners {{formally}} established the town of Manzanar in 1910, but abandoned the town by 1929 after the City of Los Angeles purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area. As different as these groups were, their histories <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> common thread of forced relocation.|$|E
5|$|Longrich {{observed}} that another newly described genus, Tatankaceratops, <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> strange mix of characteristics already found in adult and juvenile Triceratops. Rather than representing a distinct genus, Tatankaceratops could as easily represent a dwarf Triceratops or a Triceratops individual with a developmental disorder that {{caused it to}} stop growing prematurely.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian Institution <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> Little Boy (complete, {{except for}} enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon {{from the museum}} to remove its inner components, so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material. The {{government}} returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993. Three other disarmed bombs are {{on display in the}} United States; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|The first {{computer-controlled}} {{search for}} supernovae was {{begun in the}} 1960s at Northwestern University. They built a 24-inch telescope at Corralitos Observatory in New Mexico that could be repositioned under computer control. The telescope <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> new galaxy each minute, with observers checking the view on a television screen. By this means, they discovered 14 supernovae {{over a period of}} two years.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} emblem {{that was used}} {{at the time of}} the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base of a red shield, an armored white knight is mounted on a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is <b>displayed.</b> <b>A</b> variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Though {{electric}} guitars {{had been}} used by industrial artists {{since the early days}} of the genre, archetypal industrial groups such as Throbbing Gristle <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> strong anti-rock stance. British post-punk band Killing Joke pioneered the crossing over between styles, and was an influence on major industrial metal bands such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Nine Inch Nails. Another pioneer industrial rock group, Big Black, also impacted some later groups.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{her career}} as a Bass Strait ferry, Nairana had <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> {{commemorative}} plaque and a photograph from her days as a carrier, presented by the British Admiralty in recognition of her service in the First World War, and especially her part in the fall of Arkhangelsk. After she was retired, the plaque went on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea, New Zealand, and the photograph at the Launceston Maritime Museum, Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
5|$|Albion's first regular shirt badge {{appeared}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it {{did not include the}} blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was <b>displayed,</b> <b>a</b> common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.|$|E
5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in The Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, {{by the time of}} his death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, Hope was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld Grimké's Rachel explicitly use the addition of a copy of Hope to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.|$|E
