5|$|Orizaba made15 transatlantic voyages for the Navy {{carrying}} {{troops to}} and from Europe in World War I with the second-shortest average <b>in-port</b> turnaround time of all Navy transports.

The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the ship was chartered to United States Lines. While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service, American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from the rear deck of the liner off Florida in April 1932.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June 2010, Ronald Reagan {{arrived in}} Pearl Harbor to {{participate}} in Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2010. Ronald Reagan was the only aircraft carrier to participate (pictured). During the <b>in-port</b> phase of RIMPAC, officers and crew of the 14 participating navies interacted in receptions, meetings, and athletic events. At sea such as live fire gunnery and missile exercises; maritime interdiction and vessel boardings, and anti-surface warfare, undersea warfare, and air defense training serials took place followed by scenario exercises in Phase III. During RIMPAC 2010, naval personnel from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Chile, Peru, and Colombia directed combat exercises while aboard the Reagan.

2500|$|Tunny {{remained}} at Charleston until March 1974, {{when she moved}} to Groton, Connecticut, for two weeks of <b>in-port</b> training at the submarine base. Between March and June 1974, she conducted shakedown training in the West Indies and along the United States East Coast. From June to August 1974, she conducted operations out of Charleston before heading north to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, where she began post-shakedown [...] on 12 August 1974.

2500|$|Beginning in Fiscal Year 2015, the Optimized Fleet Response Plan aligns carrier strike {{groups to}} a 36-month {{training}} and deployment cycle. All required maintenance, training, evaluations, plus a single eight-month overseas deployment, are scheduled throughout this 36-month cycle {{in order to}} reduce costs while increasing overall fleet readiness. [...] Additionally, this new plan streamlined the inspection and evaluation process while maintaining a surge capacity for emergency deployments. [...] The ultimate objective is to reduce time at sea while increasing <b>in-port</b> time from 49% to 68%. [...] While initially to be used by U.S. Navy carrier strike groups, the Optimized Fleet Response Plan will be adopted for all fleet operations.|$|E
2500|$|This {{duty was}} tense and demanded {{the best of}} men and their ships. <b>In-port</b> time was minimal; {{a few hours to}} fuel and reprovision, and the ships were off again. O'Bannon fought in many surface actions. The Battle of Kula Gulf (6July), in which O'Bannon fought with three cruisers and three other {{destroyer}}s against ten Japanese destroyers, swept the enemy from the area, though an American cruiser was lost. A week later, the Battle of Kolombangara had to be fought in the same waters against a Japanese cruiser, five destroyers and four destroyer escorts.
