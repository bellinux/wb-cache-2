5|$|The Colts {{placed their}} {{franchise}} tag on Manning on February 15, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations {{in which he}} made it clear that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be the highest-paid player in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E
5|$|Boggs is {{led to his}} {{execution}} and sees that Scully has not attended. Scully visits Mulder in hospital, where he is recovering from his gunshot wound. She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs. She tells him that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear anything, because she already knew what her father would have said.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} methodology will acquire comparable {{results with}} the sub-metering methods, yet <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> observe the individual information of each PEV. As a result, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> build expensive sub-metering systems {{and will not}} expose the privacy of PEVs.|$|R
5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> defend himself, and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, {{the essence of the}} letter {{encourages}} the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.|$|E
5|$|Though they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{deploy the}} amber, Walter realizes how close {{he was to}} making the same {{decisions}} that Walternate (Noble), Walter's doppelganger in the parallel universe, had to make to save his universe; Nina (Blair Brown) helps to counsel him. Meanwhile, Olivia and Peter attempt to reconcile and rekindle their relationship. Though still cautious about moving forward, Olivia and Peter kiss and head to the bedroom upstairs at the Bishops' home.|$|E
5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest is at stake the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner. In a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Mowle and David Sacko {{describe}} [...] "soft balancing" [...] as [...] "balancing that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> balance at all.” These theoretical {{efforts are}} counter-productive, since Realism and unipolarity are compatible and structural realism should rather develop {{a set of}} hypotheses for a unipolar world: “Scholars <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> desperately search for signs of balancing, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> soften balancing beyond recognition, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> stand watch for the first glimmering of a new multipolar dawn.” ...|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{standard}} complement of each submarine was six officers and thirty-six sailors, with facilities to carry an additional twelve personnel (usually trainees). This number was minimised by the RAN during design, which insisted that functions be automated where possible; the RAN also requiring that each sailor {{have his own}} rack and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> 'hot bunk'. It was originally intended that multiple ship's companies be established per submarine, and that these be rotated to maximise the submarines' time at sea without adversely affecting personnel, but difficulties in maintaining submariner numbers made this plan unworkable. Enlisted submariners are accommodated in six-bunk cabins.|$|E
5|$|Robson was {{selected}} {{for the first time}} in her career to be a member of the GB Fed Cup Team to play in the Europe/Africa Group 1 match at Eilat, Israel, on 1–4 February 2012. In the group stages she played doubles with Heather Watson, defeating pairs from Portugal, Netherlands and Israel in the group stages. Robson and Watson <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> play the play-off match against Austria as Anne Keothavong and Elena Baltacha won their singles rubbers, and the 2–0 lead qualified the team for a place in the World Group II promotion play-off in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up {{so that it could}} overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E

5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, and it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
5|$|At the game, {{bisexual}} drama teacher Andrew LeGustambos {{attempts to}} grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle, but the whole school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two full and augmented breasts; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench's female hormone replacements. Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> win the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures. Upon opening the time capsule, it is revealed that {{it is full of}} Willard's porn magazines that Ennis hid. Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired.|$|E

30|$|Process {{coordination}} through tuple spaces, {{introduced by}} the programming language LINDA for parallel systems [4], supports decoupled communications in space (processes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know each other locations) and in time (processes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be active at the same time). Besides that, this model of coordination provides some synchronization power.|$|R
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's Brigade {{continued}} south, waking the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. This unit fled in all directions, and Gibson's men <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> shoot. This {{left the}} 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates {{were forced to}} retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house {{the men from the}} Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired. General Johnson was nearly captured when his headquarters was partially surrounded by Union cavalry. He escaped out the back door and jumped on a horse—racing south to the 8th Virginia Cavalry.|$|E
5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the Clean Water Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E

30|$|Remark 4.9 Theorem  4.5 generalizes Theorem  3.4 of Shabanian and Vaezpour [18] in the {{following}} aspects: (1) the C in Theorem  4.5 <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be compact; (2) the E in Theorem  4.5 <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have the convex hull finite property; (3) the set-valued mappings G, H in Theorem  4.5 <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have convex values; (4) the condition that the set-valued mapping G in Theorem  3.4 of Shabanian and Vaezpour [18] is quasi-convex is removed.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the new location, new touches {{were made to the}} service. If a female diner had a handbag, a small side table was placed beside her so that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> place the bag on the floor. Money was not reused; change was only given in new notes and previously unused coins. The kitchen staff were expanded further to around 25, with Robert Reid as the head chef under White. The front of house staff were also expanded to six sommeliers, four Maître d'hôtels and two head waiters. In 1998, ownership of the restaurant transferred to MPW Criterion, a holding company created by White which also owned the Titanic restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Journalists often {{visited the}} set and wrote {{positively}} about the production. The film was shot almost chronologically in Sologne and again in Joinville, Val-de-Marne, which Renoir considered important for the actors' performances. Renoir said he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do much directing since the actors were so involved in their roles. When directing himself, Renoir arranged the performers movements first then acted in the scenes. Jay pushed Renoir to finish filming in Sologne and move the production to sets erected at the Pathé studios in Joinville. Renoir finally agreed and left Zwobada, Cortegganni and Cartier-Bresson in Sologne to shoot B-roll footage of the rabbit hunting sequence. Hundreds of animals were killed during filming and local people were used as stand-ins for the actors.|$|E
5|$|Louder Now is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band Taking Back Sunday. In April 2005, the group had begun writing {{material}} for the album. Two months later, they signed with Warner Bros. Records and contributed a song to the Fantastic Four soundtrack. Soon afterwards, the group rented a room in Manhattan where they composed songs for Louder Now. They came up with 20 songs, discarding half of them and recording demos of the remainder. The group began recording Louder Now with Eric Valentine in September 2005 at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California. After Warner Bros. told them they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> rush, they recorded new demos. Recording ended on New Year's Day, 2006, and {{was followed by a}} tour of the UK, Australia and the U.S.|$|E
