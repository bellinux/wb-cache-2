We conjecture that there is a link between increasing female participation (which we take to be a proxy for ‘attachment to the labour market’ – and thus attachment to unemployment as well as employment) and an increasing incidence of long-term unemployment. Experimenting with policy dummies, we find no evidence of policy effects on the incidence of long-term unemployment in the case of males and females but {{there is some evidence that}} policy had temporary effects on <b>females.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> Business Cycle...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} how {{literacy}} rate affects unemployment among different ages in Palestine. Using labour force surveys and annual reports of Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS, 2000 - 2015), we analyzed 16 years (2000 - 2015) regarding unemployment percentage and literacy rates among different ages in both genders in Palestine. Linear regression models were used to show how literacy rate affects unemployment among the various ages. The results showed that literacy rate is significantly correlated with the percentage of unemployment among ages of (15 to 24, 25 to 34, and 35 to 44). Gender is significantly correlated with the percentage of unemployment among the ages of (15 to 24, 25 to 34, and 45 to 54).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of the current {{financial}} crisis on Canada''s potential GDP growth. Using a simple accounting framework to decompose trend GDP growth into changes in capital, labor services and total factor productivity, we find a sizeable drop in Canadian potential growth in the short term. The estimated decline of about 1 percentage point originates from a sharply decelerating capital stock accumulation (as investment has dropped steeply) and a rising long-term unemployment rate (which would raise equilibrium unemployment rates). However, over the medium term, we expect Canada''s potential GDP growth to gradually rise to around 2 percent, below the pre-crisis growth rate, mostly reflecting the effects of population aging and a secular decline in average working hours.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the Belgian labor market are examined using international comparisons {{in order to assess}} the government’s recent labor market initiatives.

The causes of these problems are investigated. The empirical results, using cross section data from 15 industrial countries, show that the generosity of long-term unemployment benefits helps to explain the prevalence of long-term unemployment. Unemployment compensation also appears to be paid to many who are not actively seeking work. The recent labor market initiatives in Belgium will help to ameliorate some of the underlying problems but they are unlikely to completely address the underlying structural problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Background : Most {{existing}} {{evidence on}} the socio-economic predictors of divorce in developed countries comes from the USA and from Western and Northern Europe. This study contributes to the scarce literature about socio-economic determinants of divorce in Central and Eastern Europe by examining the case of Lithuania. Objective : The study explores how the levels of educational attainment and economic activity, {{as well as the}} interactions of these two variables, influence the risk of first divorce both in the entire population of Lithuania and in its urban and rural sub-populations. Methods : The study uses a census-linked dataset connecting all records from the 2001 census and all first divorce records between the census and December 2003. The impact of education and employment status on the risk of divorce was estimated by applying Poisson regression models. Results : Lower education is related to elevated risks of divorce only in large cities: in rural areas the relationship is inverted. For both urban and rural males, being out of the labor market destabilizes marriage and significantly increases the risk of marital disruption. This pattern was also found for males residing in large cities, regardless of their education. As expected, a lower divorce risk is observed among both urban and rural housewives and other inactive urban <b>females.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> and disability-related inactivity is associated with higher divorce probabilities among rural females. Conclusions : The study finds evidence of individual socio-economic recourses having substantial differentiating effects on first divorce risk in Lithuania. The direction and size of these effects vary notably by sex and place of residence. This suggests that divorce determinants are complex in post-transitional societies in the region...|$|R
