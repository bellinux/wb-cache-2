40|$|What {{determines the}} {{amplitude}} {{and the time}} course of spontaneous excitatory unitary events is not well understood. Desensitization of fast AMPA/K channels {{has been shown to be}} fast enough to shorten individual quantal responses. However, it is not known whether the desensitization is uniform nor is it known what determines the relation between amplitude and rise or <b>decay</b> <b>times</b> in absence of desensitization. Both the rise and the <b>decay</b> <b>times</b> are essentially amplitude-independent in control conditions, but become markedly amplitude-dependent after desensitization has been suppressed by aniracetam. Strong amplitude-dependence of the rise and <b>decay</b> <b>times</b> suggests that in absence of desensitization the process(es) that determine(s) {{the time course of}} unitary events is/are concentration-dependent. Highly nonuniform, and strongly amplitude-dependent desensitization can be explained by its concentration dependence. The scatter of both rise and <b>decay</b> <b>times</b> about the best fitting lines was also amplitude-independent in control conditions. It increased markedly and in an amplitude-dependent manner after addition of aniracetam. The same factors that determine mean values probably determine the scatter as well...|$|R
2500|$|The precessing nuclei {{can also}} {{fall out of}} {{alignment}} with each other (returning the net magnetization vector to a non-precessing field) and stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because {{of the difference in}} the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions [...] ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller dipole-dipole interaction effects). In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to [...] of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay—the T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ("well-shimmed") static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.|$|E
