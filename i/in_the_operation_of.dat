The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the hotel was given by the office boy who handled the arriving guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of}} the Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.|$|E

5|$|In {{a report}} to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon {{proposed}} dramatic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His plan called for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called for the formation of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues. On March 5, 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon's reassignment to Russia that year, however, few of his reforms were implemented.|$|E
5|$|Retaining his {{interest}} in flying {{after the end of}} his active military career, Hess obtained his private pilot's licence on 4 April 1929. His instructor was World War I flying ace Theodor Croneiss. In 1930 Hess became the owner of a BFW M.23b monoplane sponsored by the party newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter. He acquired two more Messerschmitt aircraft in the early 1930s, logging many flying hours and becoming proficient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> light single-engine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The 1215 charter {{had several}} clauses {{relating}} to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably {{did not address the}} forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation of the forest courts.

5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers was more interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able}} to retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
5|$|In February 1936, the Roeriches {{and their}} {{associates}} {{had attempted to}} obtain an injunction to prevent these actions. When the attempt failed, they sued Horch to regain what they believed to be their rightful authority to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the building and its component organizations. This case was settled on February 9, 1938, in favor of Horch. George Frankenthaler, the referee who decided the case, found that the Roeriches never possessed the authority they claimed. Horch alone administered the corporation that had the building constructed, ran the organizations that it housed, and obtained all the needed financing. In addition, he donated {{more than a million}} dollars of his own, while the Roeriches and their associates had contributed no money at all. Regarding allegations of deception, he found Horch to be the more creditable witness.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Act of Foundation, King Philip III granted, {{through the}} Governor-General, the {{permission}} {{to open a}} college in Manila. So in 1612, Fr. Domingo González, O.P., Lector of the Santo Domingo Convent, was appointed {{to work on the}} completion the organization of the college. In that same year, when classes also began, the Dominican Province of the Holy Rosary accepted the College, an act which amounted to the Dominican Order's assuming the responsibility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the institution. In 1619, in the name of King Philip IV, the Governor-General of the Philippines, gave his approval. The Holy See granted, although indirectly or implicitly, recognition to the new College in 1619. In 1627, Pope Urban VIII also authorized the College to confer academic degrees, so that the said academic degrees had both royal and papal approval. Although the College had only been in operation for a few years, records show that degrees were already being conferred in 1640.|$|E

5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached, and to assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the Theatre after its sale to the RTC. By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After a down payment of $160,000, and paying the full cost of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised in a silent auction on February28. More than 100 people attended the auction, including Congressman Maurice Hinchey.|$|E
