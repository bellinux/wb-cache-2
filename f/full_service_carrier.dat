40|$|Low cost {{carriers}} (LCCs) {{have recently}} proved {{that they can}} develop aggressive behaviour towards the threat of new entrants. This paper analyses the theoretical conditions under which a low cost carrier can deter or accommodate entry by means of product proliferation, using the example of Easyjet on the London-Grenoble route. Theoretical conclusions show that they can only deter entry if they launch a service with a quality that is superior to the entrant’s and to their own previous one. Otherwise, they accommodate entry by improving their old product, when they face the entry of a <b>full</b> <b>service</b> <b>carrier</b> (FSC), or by launching a new service, if they {{are caught in the}} middle of a FSC and another LCC.

40|$|As {{with other}} airline markets, the Australian market has {{experienced}} entry by low cost carriers. Most of these attempts have ended in failure; however one low cost carrier, Virgin Blue, continues to operate and prosper. The history of entry and exit by low cost carriers in Australia is outlined first. Two phases of entry are identified: the early 1990 s, {{and the year}} 2000. The factors influencing success or failure are examined, {{in the light of}} experience in North America and Europe. The Australian market differs in some important respects from these markets, and this influences the ability of such carriers to compete. The strategies adopted by the low cost carriers are examined, as are the competitive responses of the incumbents. The lack of presence of low cost carriers in the market for much of the post deregulation period has meant that incumbent carriers have, until recently, not faced much pressure to reduce their costs. The impacts made by low cost carriers on fares, costs and profitability are examined in this paper. Some lessons are drawn from the Australian experience, and issues which remain to be addressed are noted. These include policy issues for the competition regulator, and strategic issues for the airlines. At present, the remaining low cost carrier is performing well, but it has gained considerably from the collapse of one of the two full service carriers. The likely patterns of competition between Virgin Blue and the <b>full</b> <b>service</b> <b>carrier,</b> Qantas, are explored, along with the scope for more entry by low cost carriers and perhaps fill service carriers...|$|E

The analysis is carried on both theoretically and empirically. In the theoretical part, we show that {{the rise of the}} low costs business model can be the consequence of a simple two-player game. When two carriers compete in designing their network configurations (HS or PP), asymmetric equilibria emerge, i. e. one carrier will choose HS and the other PP. <b>Full</b> <b>service</b> <b>carriers</b> are stuck to a HS configuration to serve intercontinental destinations, whilst non-flag carriers implement a point-to-point network. In the second part, the recent network evolution in Europe is empirically evaluated by means of different spatial measures of concentration, such as Gini index, Freeman centrality index and Bonacich centrality. In addition, we also provide an airline-specific measure of centrality based on scheduled time comparison of direct to one-stop services. Spatial measures of centrality capture a reduction of centrality in non-flag carriers and small changes in the network centrality of flag carriers. Indeed, the time-based measure of centrality suggests an increase of centrality of flag carriers. ...|$|R
