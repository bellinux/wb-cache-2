25|$|The Van der Waals {{radius of}} the {{fluorine}} substituent is only 1.47 Å, which is shorter {{than in any other}} substituent and is close to that of hydrogen (1.2 Å). This, together with the short bond length, is the reason why there is no steric strain in polyfluorinated compounds. This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for their high thermal stability. In addition, the fluorine substituents in polyfluorinated compounds efficiently shield the carbon skeleton from possible attacking reagents. This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for the high chemical stability of polyfluorinated compounds.|$|E

In both of these instances, when unsupported by underlying dentin, that portion of the enamel is more vulnerable to fracture.|$|E
25|$|Easy {{access to}} fresh water {{also would have}} been mandatory, which <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> why {{settlements}} were in bottom lands near water. A number of wells from the times have been discovered, with a log-cabin type lining constructed one layer at a time as the previous layers sank into the well.|$|E

25|$|The dowry {{system in}} India <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> that is given for female infanticide. Although India has {{taken steps to}} abolish the dowry system, the {{practice}} persists, and for poorer families in rural regions female infanticide and gender selective abortion is attributed to {{the fear of being}} unable to raise a suitable dowry and then being socially ostracised.|$|E
25|$|Copper’s higher tensile {{strength}} (200–250 N/mm2 annealed) compared to aluminium (100 N/mm2 for typical conductor alloys) <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> why copper is used {{extensively in the}} building industry. Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal current carrying capacity, so the high {{tensile strength}} is offset by its increased weight.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> why Ellis’ {{paintings}} are {{not strong enough}} to be called the scientific illustration. It seems that Ellis had her own taste when she choosing the object, which resulted in the limitation of botanical species in her painting. She preferred colorful and showy species rather than many small-flowered herbaceous species, for example, waterlilies were her most favorite flowers, and there was no depicting of the large and significant sunflower family in her artworks.|$|E
500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E
500|$|Horses {{normally}} require {{free access}} to all the fresh, clean water they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time. However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. [...] But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30–90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process. [...] A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked. [...] Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.|$|E

500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{property}} owner interferes with an easement upon his property {{in a manner}} that satisfies the requirements for adverse prescription (e.g. locking the gates to a commonly used area, and nobody does anything about it), he will successfully extinguish the easement.

Also note that a comparison sort cannot use less than [...] comparisons on average to sort [...] items (as explained in the article Comparison sort) and in case of large , Stirling's approximation yields , so quicksort is not much worse than an ideal comparison sort.

2500|$|The load/deflection ratio {{delivered}} by a cantilever, should -as {{for all the}} active elements of the appliance- be as low as possible, leaving the force system {{with a high degree}} of constancy. This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for generally [...] keeping the cantilevers long. In those cases where the cantilevers, for different reasons are short, the load/deflection rate can be lowered by the addition of one or more , or by using a smaller wire dimension. The latter does, however, also cause a problem, as the play between wire and bracket (tube) may become unacceptable. In this case, a composite cantilever could be advisable.|$|E

Septuagint, [...] "If thou hate her and dismiss her," [...] etc.; Vulgate, [...] "If thou hate her, put her away," [...] which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned.
