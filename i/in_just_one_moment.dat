The {{narrative}} form demands {{that there be a}} beginning and an end, but this is fictional. There are numerous people on Earth, and each has a beginning and an end, just as the waves forming the sea repeat themselves, and this intrigues me. I very much like the idea of a repetition that is always different, just as no two waves are alike. The characters are then united and dematerialized; refined through revisions, they become symbols.

Se utiliz? el m?todo Descriptivo, por cuanto identifica caracter?sticas de la poblaci?n objeto de estudio, se?ala formas de conducta, establece comportamientos concretos y adem?s descubre y comprueba una relaci?n entre las variables que lo componen, busca especificar las propiedades de un grupo, referentes a comunicaci?n, identidad, estilo de supervisi?n, ambiente f?sico, recompensas y reconocimiento, calidez y apoyo, estructura de la organizaci?n. Adem?s es transversal puesto que al usar un solo instrumento se obtuvo la informaci?n necesaria para el an?lisis, aplic?ndose en una sola ocasi?n y en un solo momento a los sujetos de estudio (Personal del hospital) Los resultados obtenidos evidencian que las variables que presentaron puntuaciones desfavorables son: Comunicaci?n, recompensa reconocimiento, calidez y apoyo, estructura organizacional. Se logr? conocer el nivel de motivaci?n que tiene los empleados desde su perspectiva, se identific? el nivel de liderazgo que prevalece en el hospital, el cual dentro de la estructura organizacional esta dado de {{acuerdo a}} la jerarqu?a, pero se eval?a que a?n no hay claridad respecto a quien debe tener la autoridad y tomar las decisiones, la percepci?n de los empleados es que en algunas oportunidades las decisiones son tomadas por personas a las cuales no les corresponde esa actividad. Se logr? conocer el nivel de participaci?n el cual se encuentra en un t?rmino medio, 50 % de los encuestados refleja que existen problemas de comunicaci?n interna, no es claro el flujo de informaci?n y se rumora demasiado. Fue posible elaborar un an?lisis que permiti? identificar las diferencias estad?sticamente significativas y ofrecer acciones de mejora proporcionando herramientas para permitir el adecuado establecimiento, desarrollo y permanencia de las buenas relaciones interpersonales en los grupos de trabajo, mediante la ejecuci?n de un seminario taller, todo ello con el fin de contribuir de manera positiva al mejoramiento del clima organizacional.

This study has the general objective of diagnosig the organizational climate at the departmental hospital of Granada Meta, social Enterprise of the state, {{taking into account}} that there are several factors in which workers associated to the institution are exposed, and in a preliminary way have been identified some areas of opportunity. The development of the research Project allowed obtaining results in order to define and determine solutions and/or strategies in favor of strengthen weak points related to the organizational climate, by means of implementation of action mechanisms and employee behavior, and the management level. The descriptive method was used, as it identifies the characteristics of the population object of study, it points out forms of behavior, establishes concrete behaviors and besides it discovers and proves a relationship between the variables related to it, it looks for specify the properties of a group, referring to communication, identity, supervision style, physical environment, rewards and acknowledgment, warmth and support, structure of the organization. Besides it is transversal, given that by using just one instrument all the necessary information for the analysis was obtained, applying it only once and <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> to the subjects of study (Hospital staff). The obtained results evidence that the variables that showed unfavorable scorings are: Communication, acknowledgment-reward, warmth and support, organizational structure. It was achieved to know the level of motivation from the employees perspective, the level of leadership that prevails at the hospital was identified, which inside the organizational structure is given according to the hierarchy but it is evaluated that there is no clarity yet regarding who should have the authority and the making of decisions, the perception of the employees is that in some oportunities the decisions are made by the people that didn?t correspond to that activity. It was achieved to know the level of participation which is found in a midterm, 50 % of the respondents, it shows that there are problems of internal communications, the information flux isn't clear and there is too much whispering. It was possible to elaborate an analysis which allowed to identify the statistically significant differences and offer improvement actions, giving tools to allow the proper establishment, development and remaining of the good interpersonal relations between the work groups, through the execution of a seminar workshop, all that with the purpose of contribute in a positive way to the improvement of the organizational climate.

50|$|For English Dominican mystics, {{the mystical}} {{experience}} was not expressed <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{of the full}} knowledge of God, but in the journey of, or process of, faith. This then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. It is important to understand, however, that for these mystics {{it was possible to}} pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God. They experienced a mystical process that allowed them, in the end, to experience what they had already gained knowledge of through their faith only.|$|R

This (January 1984) is the year for Common Redpolls! Wintering over this year, too, have been several Harris Sparrows. —Doug G. Thomas, Alliance, Nebraska BURT CO. We have lots of birds with all the cold weather. Among the unusual ones is a Tufted Titmouse. At the suet feeder we’ve had an immature Yellow-bellied Sapsucker. Another first for us was Evening Grosbeaks. Another unusual sighting was the pair of Cooper’s Hawks which visited daily during that coldest 10 days or so around Christmas. —Kathleen True, Decatur REPORT FROM MINDEN. On 23 October 1983 Ropert Spicknall and I saw a Prairie Falcon, north of town. On 25 January 1984 Robert saw a Northern Shrike at a carcass on the highway west of town. On 4 February we {{went up to the}} Platte and saw 2 Bald Eagles and on 25 February we saw 3 up there. On 15 February we saw Green-winged Teal on a roadside pond, Shovelers on the same pond 15 March, and 15 April and a White Egret there. Robert saw a Great Blue Heron 6 April, and we both saw one 15 April. On 15 March I saw a Peregrine Falcon, and on 30 April a Turkey Vulture. During the winter, hundreds of Crows, thousands of Lapland Longspurs, and a good sprinkling of Meadowlarks literally lined the shoulders of N 10. —Harold Turner, Minden HAND FEEDING. In winter of 1982 I decided that I would hand feed Black-capped Chickadees, but they refused to cooperate. At the same time Pine Siskins crowded another feeder. A male, displaced by a female, lighted in my near frostbitten hand and ate several minutes from the unroasted sunflower seeds in my palm. I set a new goal: attract the more skitterish American Goldfinches that came in with the Pine Siskins. Several tries, my patience stretched more than I thought possible, a male came <b>in</b> for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> brief <b>moment,</b> long enough to eat one seed and fly off with another. —Doug G.

Things that persist must be thought of as processes leading to newly changed processes.
