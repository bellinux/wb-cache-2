50|$|Always-on connections: Throughout the 1990s, the {{predominant}} mode of consumer Internet access was telephone modem dial-up. The {{rapid increase in}} the number of the <b>dial-up</b> <b>networks</b> increased address consumption rates, although it was common that the modem pools, and as a result, the pool of assigned IP addresses, were shared amongst a large customer base. By 2007, however, broadband Internet access had begun to exceed 50% penetration in many markets. Broadband connections are always active, as the gateway devices (routers, broadband modems) are rarely turned off, so that the address uptake by Internet service providers continued at an accelerating pace.|$|R

50|$|The Teletype Model 33 {{contained}} an answer-back mechanism that was generally used in <b>dial-up</b> <b>networks</b> {{such as the}} TWX network. At {{the beginning of the}} message, the sending machine could transmit an enquiry character or WRU (Who aRe yoU) code, and the recipient machine would automatically initiate a response which was encoded in a rotating drum that could be programmed by breaking off tabs. The answer-back drum in the recipient machine would rotate and send an unambiguous identifying code to the sender, so the sender could verify connection to the correct recipient. The WRU code could also be sent {{at the end of the}} message. A correct response would confirm that the connection had remained unbroken during the message transmission. Finally, the sending machine operator would press the disconnect button. Note that the receiving machine did not need operator intervention. Since messages were often sent across multiple time zones to their destination, it was common to send a message to a location where the receiving machine was operating in an office that was closed and unmanned.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a passive {{methodology}} for TCP performance evaluation over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) networks is presented {{that relies on}} traffic monitoring at the GPRS ingress/egress router interface (Gi). Based on the IP and TCP headers of the packets we estimate the end-to-end performance of TCP connections such as connection setup behavior and data transfer goodput. In order to identify the effects behind the measured performance the introduced algorithms estimate round trip delays, packet loss ratios, available channel rates, throughput and carry out bottleneck analysis. Large-scale GPRS measurements in seven countries are presented to analyze TCP performance and demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} method. The effects of different TCP parameters such as maximum segment size, selective acknowledgements, timestamp usage and receiver window size are also quantified. GPRS measurement results are compared to a wireline <b>dial-up</b> <b>network</b> to identify the effects specific to the wireless environment...|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to UUCP, early Usenet traffic was also exchanged with Fidonet and other <b>dial-up</b> BBS <b>networks.</b> Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was {{facilitated by the}} introduction of UUCP feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP, such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. In 1986, RFC 977 provided the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) specification for distribution of Usenet articles over TCP/IP as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.|$|R
50|$|One Ataxx clone was Boogers, {{an online}} 4-player version {{hosted by the}} ImagiNation <b>Network,</b> a pre-internet <b>dial-up</b> game <b>network.</b> Two to four players fought on a large board (9Ã—9).

Jumping one's booger over an opponent's booger would change the victim's color, resulting in more boogers for the aggressor. Chatting both openly and privately was integrated into the game: this promoted shady non-aggression pacts, ganging up, and stabbing opponents in the back.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{deals with}} {{simulation}} of a Serial Least Mean Square (SLMS) adaptive filter algorithm for echo cancellation of speech-band data transmission with higher computational speed.

An adaptation constant is suitably {{chosen for the}} analysis {{to reduce the number}} of iterations thus achieving much higher speed while maintaining a very high accuracy level. The simulation results are also presented which meets the desired output.

40|$|We {{present results}} from a data set {{comprised}} of five months of RADIUS authentication data taken from a large national dial-up Internet Service Provider (ISP). The data, recorded from May 2000 through September 2000, contains activity from over 600, 000 unique user accounts. Over the five months of data collection, the number of sessions per week grew from 13. 6 million to 14. 4 million. We analyze characteristics of the data set {{as a whole and}} of individual users. We present statistics on the number of sessions based on time-of-day, demonstrating interesting peaks in later afternoon and mid-evening activity. We also present session length data, observing a heavy-tailed distribution. We find that significant numbers of accounts exhibit concurrent sessions, some with as many as 20 sessions that overlap in time. There is considerable activity due to what we hypothesize to be automated processes. These are characterized by regular session interarrival times and relatively constant session lengths. Our results provide important data on the behavior of current <b>dial-up</b> access <b>network</b> users.
