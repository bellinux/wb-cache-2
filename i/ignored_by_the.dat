5|$|As {{the night}} wore on, {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pashtun forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. The British had lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|In protest, Adams briefly {{threatened}} to boycott Canada's annual Juno Awards, where his album {{had been almost}} completely <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> awards committee. He did end up winning the Entertainer of the Year Award (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, Bawdsey was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans for {{the entire}} war, while St Athan was {{attacked}} by a Junkers Ju 88 only weeks after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed to explode.|$|E
50|$|A skeptical position, {{which was}} taken by Blavatsky in respect of the materialistic science, was {{motivated}} by her outrage over <b>the</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scientists the spiritual dimension of reality. On the other hand, the assertion that spiritual truths can be proven from a scientific point of view, was a constant theme of Blavatsky's claims. The efforts of the theosophists were focused on the legitimation {{of all forms of}} extrasensory and mystical experience.|$|R
25|$|These protests were <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> Congress, and <b>the</b> mutual {{housing program}} never revived.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis has criticised British {{involvement}} in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. He said: [...] "It’s sickening {{to think of}} British-built weapons being used against civilians {{and the government has}} an absolute responsibility to do everything in its power to stop that from happening. But as ministers {{turn a blind eye to}} the conflict in Yemen, evidence that humanitarian law has been violated is becoming harder to <b>ignore</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> day." ...|$|R
5|$|Lamarck {{was largely}} <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> major French {{zoologist}} Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck {{as an important}} zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation {{became the basis for}} the formation around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete codification and execution, or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E
5|$|After the {{operation}} closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, the threat of invasion from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase French resistance in the Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the southeastern}} Alaska Panhandle was leased from the Russian Empire, from 1839 to 1867, until <b>the</b> lease was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Russians and Americans and, subsequently, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Canadian and the British {{imperial}} governments, despite British Columbia's protests.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{thousand}} Model S-125s {{were sold}} {{during the first}} seven months of 1947. Despite largely being <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> dealers, <b>the</b> 125 gained a large following among young riders, many of whom {{would go on to}} ride larger motorcycles.|$|R
25|$|This {{message was}} <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> Dubreil and <b>the</b> {{reinforcements}} mentioned <b>by</b> Colbert never materialized when Dubreil failed to surrender the fort.|$|R
5|$|Another {{treaty that}} fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Senate during {{the remainder of the}} President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried to inform the British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

50|$|During {{his tenure}} as the high commissioner, Menon was accused of being {{involved}} in the Jeep scandal case of 1948, but the Government closed the case in 1955, <b>ignoring</b> suggestion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Inquiry Committee.|$|R
5|$|Dana Scully {{is called}} before FBI {{assistant}} director Walter Skinner, who {{is accompanied by}} the Smoking Man. Despite {{the success of the}} X-Files investigations, Skinner criticizes their unconventionalism and wants both Scully and Fox Mulder to do by-the-book work. The agents attend a release hearing for Tooms, where Monte claims that Tooms' attack on Scully was due to being falsely accused of murder. Mulder tries to point out the physical evidence of Tooms' physiology and crimes but is <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hearing's panel. Tooms is released into the care of an elderly couple and is ordered to continue his treatment with Dr. Monte.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> music {{press in the}} US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state government, {{which was more}} concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, he {{directed}} Blacula. While largely <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> critics, <b>the</b> film has become {{somewhat of a}} cult favorite and {{made a name for}} actor William Marshall who played the title character. Crain did other films, then returned to TV show installments which he continues to do today.|$|R

The n {{is the amount of}} threads you specify if {{you do not want to}} use the default.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where such mutilation is illegal, such as Canada, blank planchets, slugs, or U.S. cents are occasionally used, though this law is often <b>ignored</b> both <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{users of the}} machine and law enforcement.|$|R
5|$|In 1912, the Warsaw Scientific Society {{offered her}} the {{directorship}} {{of a new}} laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute {{to be completed in}} August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie. She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Russian authorities. The Institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, with Paul's {{increased}} support, {{the controversy}} over racist and homophobic statements in several Ron Paul newsletters in the 1980s and early 1990s once again gained media attention. During this time Paul supporters asserted that he was continually <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media despite his significant support, citing examples of where television news shows would fail to mention Paul in discussions of the Republican presidential hopefuls {{even when he was}} polling second.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1815, {{four days}} after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette {{arranged}} for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days {{on the island of}} Saint Helena. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.|$|E
50|$|Homeless Dudes {{often appear}} living in alleys, {{cardboard}} boxes {{and on the}} sidewalks. They discuss the economy, mostly, and are usually <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> everyone, including <b>the</b> compassionate main characters Lemont and Susan.|$|R

5|$|Sheffield {{is made up}} of many {{suburbs and}} neighbourhoods, many of which {{developed}} from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew. These historical areas are largely <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28electoral wards, with each ward generally covering 4–6areas. These electoral wards are grouped into six parliamentary constituencies. Sheffield is largely unparished, but Bradfield and Ecclesfield have parish councils, and Stocksbridge has a town council.|$|E
5|$|The Seneca Nation {{could not}} have brought the lawsuit until 1845, when the New York {{legislature}} granted the nation the right to bring suits in courts of law and equity. The Seneca filed a petition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs on January 5, 1881, requesting restoration and possession of certain lands related to the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. This petition was <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> BIA.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, {{when it became clear}} that the party's demands for a federal structure would be <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E
50|$|He co-produced The Philosopher Kings (2009). The Philosopher Kings {{is a film}} {{which seeks}} wisdom in {{unlikely}} places {{from people who are}} most often marginalized and <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> society. <b>The</b> subjects of the film are staff members at prestigious colleges from around North America, but at those schools, the filmmakers only interviewed the custodians.|$|R
40|$|Mobile Commerce is a selling {{technique}} {{which is}} continuously growing, and its adoption and diffusion cannot be <b>ignored</b> <b>by</b> companies. <b>The</b> {{objective of this}} work is to explore Millennials' approach toward this technique, as they are {{the main source of}} revenues. in particular, product preferences and motivational factors are investigated through a direct survey online...|$|R
50|$|The cartel {{concept for}} closer forms of {{inter-state}} cooperation was counteracted {{by just a}} range of actors: by Leninism, American anti-trust policy and European federalists (e.g., Jean Monnet). This conception was first blamed, then <b>ignored,</b> and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1960s increasingly forgotten.|$|R
