5|$|Despite his {{previous}} actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> his expenses after Cyril {{comes to the}} assumption that Kremenski had been stealing from Archer's account the whole time.

She changes the subject when questioned, and rather complains that someone left donuts on the floor attracting ants.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, McGill, in {{accordance}} with the Quebec Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Ministère de l'Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport or MELS), has had eight categories that qualifies certain international students to be <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> paying international fees. These categories include: students from France, a quota of students from select countries which have agreements with MELS, which include Algeria, China, and Morocco, students holding diplomatic status, including their dependents, and students enrolled in certain language programs leading to a degree in French.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck {{does not}} shy from showing the {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E
50|$|Ignorance of {{a censure}} {{prevents}} its being incurred, but moralists dispute whether ignorance of a reservation, {{with or without}} censure, <b>excuses</b> <b>from</b> its incurrence. If a case with censure reserved to the pope, all agree that ignorance does <b>excuse</b> <b>from</b> it; if reserved to a bishop, it is controversial. Some moralists hold that ignorance <b>excuses</b> <b>from</b> all reservations, whether with or without censure. It is certain, however, that a bishop has authority to declare that ignorance of a reservation does not prevent its incurrence in his diocese.|$|R

5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
5|$|More {{than four}} months after the attack, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on August 20, 2007, that Cho had been diagnosed with selective mutism. The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> oral presentations and participation in class conversation and received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy.|$|E
5|$|The last {{trial in}} the House of Lords was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for {{manslaughter}} (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added {{an amendment to the}} Criminal Justice Act 1948, which the Commons accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords. The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} see to the business of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1162 Chesney {{was summoned}} to Normandy by the king, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, and Hilary of Chichester, in order to lend their support to the {{election}} of Thomas Becket to the see of Canterbury. In July 1163, Chesney {{was present at the}} royal court held at Woodstock Palace, which included the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, the prince of Northern Wales Owain Gwynedd, and King Malcolm IV of Scotland. The two Welsh princes and the Scots' king did homage to Henry II while at this court. In 1163 Chesney was <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> attending a papal council at Tours because of his health, but he attended the royal councils of Clarendon and Northampton in 1164, which dealt with the growing dispute, now known as the Becket controversy, between the king and Becket. At those councils Chesney attempted to persuade Becket to compromise, but was unsuccessful. The king subsequently sent Chesney to northern England as an itinerant justice in 1166.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E

5|$|For the English {{winter of}} 1930–31, Lee took on {{positions}} at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries and illness. No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested that Lee be <b>excused</b> <b>from</b> his coaching duties {{to join up}} with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, {{he made his first}} appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores in the forties, but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he had no need to apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation {{came in the form of}} an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him.|$|E
