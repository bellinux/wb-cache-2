5|$|<b>Jade</b> burial suit: Burial suits made of <b>jade</b> {{existed in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in <b>jade</b> burial suits, archaeologists {{discovered}} in June 1968 the tombs and <b>jade</b> burial suits of Prince Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC) {{and his wife}} Dou Wan in Hebei province. Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green <b>jade</b> with holes punctured in {{the four corners of}} each piece so that they could be sewn together with gold thread. The total weight of the gold thread used in his suit was 1,110 g (39oz). Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of <b>jade</b> stitched together with 703 g (24.7oz) of gold thread. Although <b>jade</b> burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC), with the earliest being found in the Shizishan site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25–220 AD) complete and partial <b>jade</b> burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan, as well as at Yangjiawan, Dongyuan, Guangzhou, Mawangdui, Mianyang and Shizhaishan. The <b>jade</b> burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by Emperor Wen of Wei.|$|E
