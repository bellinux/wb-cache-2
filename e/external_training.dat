500|$|Books {{written by}} modern-day martial artists make many claims {{that are not}} {{congruent}} with historical documents or current scholarly thought. For instance, internalist Yang Jwing-Ming says Zhou was a scholar who studied martial arts in the Shaolin Monastery and later took Yue as his student after the young man worked as a tenant farmer for the official-general Han Qi ( [...] , 1008–1075). During this time, he learned all types of military weapons, horseback riding, and hand-to-hand combat. The General later created Xingyi and Eagle Claw boxing from his internal and <b>external</b> <b>training</b> under Zhou. However, history Prof. Meir Shahar notes that unarmed boxing styles did not develop at Shaolin until the late Ming Dynasty. He also states that Ji family memoirs and Qing Dynasty records suggest Xingyi was created hundreds of years {{after the death of}} Yue by a spearplayer named Ji Jike (fl. 1651). In addition, the appearance of Han Qi in the story is a chronological anachronism since he died nearly 30 years before Yue's birth. Yue historically worked as a tenant farmer and bodyguard for descendants of Han Qi in 1124 after leaving the military upon {{the death of his father}} in late 1122, but he learned from Zhou well before this time.|$|E

With such understanding, planning and offering suitable training programs to employees is crucial. In this study, GA is employed as an analytical tool to allocate training courses to employees. The allocation is decided by a system which takes the employees’ preferences as well as the fairness of the allocation into consideration. The use of GA in solving the problem shows that the complex problem can be well solved and suitable allocations can be made. In addition, the system constructed by our approach is also easy to use and can facilitate the allocation under many different kinds of scenarios of the company...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} our results of external aerodynamics, obtained with Large Eddy Simulations (LES), about a typical European passenger-stock inside tunnels. The focal points are the aerodynamic forces and their typical frequencies {{applied to the}} tail. Two train lengths and three tunnels are employed in the study to model the conditions of double and single-track bores. Owing to the relatively high numerical cost associated with LES for <b>external</b> <b>train</b> aerodynamics we could only afford sufficient spatial grid resolution on our shortest train. The flow simulations confirm the existence of coherent structures alongside the body {{that give rise to}} continuously propagating pressure disturbances. These disturbances with a relatively small amplitude and high spatial frequency cannot affect the ride comfort. Still, they are found to influence the flow separation about the tail, which is {{regarded as one of the}} candidate mechanisms to impair the ride comfort and running stability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to present an {{individualized}} resistance training method to enable exercise while maintaining an exercise load that is set according to an individual’s joint angle-torque using a haptic-based resistance training machine. [Methods] Five participants (machine group) performed individualized shoulder internal and <b>external</b> rotation <b>training</b> with a haptic resistance training machine, while another five participants performed general dumbbell-based shoulder internal and <b>external</b> rotation <b>training</b> for eight weeks. Internal and external rotation powers of subjects were measured using an isokinetic machine before and after training. [Results] The average powers of both shoulder internal and external rotation has been improved after training (25. 72 %, 13. 62 %). The improvement in power of external rotation in the machine group was significantly higher than that in the control group. [Conclusion] This study proposes a haptic-based individualized rotator cuff muscle training method. The training protocol maintaining the joint angle-torque profile showed better improvement of shoulder internal/external rotation than dumbbell training...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{how and why}} the European Union’s (EU) <b>external</b> relations <b>training</b> developed over time. In the European Commission diplomatic training began rather late in the 1990 s but within a few years it gained momentum, in particular {{in the run-up to the}} establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS). Overall, the EU’s approach to <b>external</b> relations <b>training</b> has been rather reactive and poorly coordinated across different initiatives. The EEAS offers the opportunity to develop a more coherent and more strategic long-term training concept. Both internal and external factors account for the incremental development of the EU’s <b>external</b> relations <b>training.</b> On the one hand, it underwent changes in response to Treaty reforms and the development of external action as well owing to more general administrative reforms in the Commission. On the other hand, external factors such as the changing nature of diplomacy itself or of training methodologies can be expected to have an impact on training needs and forms. The heterogeneous composition, expanded tasks and envisaged impact of the EEAS call for a joint professional training of its staff in order to promote socialisation effects toward of a common diplomatic culture and ‘esprit de corps’. In addition to imparting relevant knowledge and skills, training could thus serve as a strategic tool for the development of the Service and of EU external action. Yet, member states have different traditions of diplomatic training and diverging views on the additional need for training of their diplomats. Also the EU institutions appear to have a preference for the preservation of their own training initiatives at the expense of a more ambitious and more coherent approach...|$|R
