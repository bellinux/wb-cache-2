5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|Although its <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> can be linearized, a bike is a {{nonlinear}} system. The variable(s) to {{be solved}} for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the leading order {{correction}} to the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the particle, which presumably describes the effect of gravitational radiation reaction. We derive the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> in two different ways. The first one {{is an extension of}} the well-known formalism by DeWitt and Brehme developed for deriving the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> an electrically charged particle. In contrast to the electromagnetic case, in which there are two different charges, i. e., the electric charge and the mass, the gravitational counterpart has only one charge. This fact prevents us from using the same renormalization scheme that was used in the electromagnetic case. To make clear the subtlety in the first approach, we then consider the asymptotic matching of two different schemes, i. e., the internal scheme in which the small particle is represented by a spherically symmetric black hole with tidal perturbations and the external scheme in which the metric is given by small perturbations on the given background geometry. The <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> is obtained from the consistency condition of the matching. We find that in both ways the same <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> is obtained. The resulting <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> is analogous to that derived in the electromagnetic case.

40|$|The {{restrictions}} of analyticity, relativistic (Born) rigidity, and negligible O(a) terms {{involved in the}} evaluation of the self electromagnetic force on an extended charged sphere of radius "a" are explicitly revealed and taken into account in order to obtain a classical <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the extended charge that is both causal and conserves momentum-energy. Because the power-series expansion used {{in the evaluation of}} the self force becomes invalid during transition time intervals immediately following the application and termination of an otherwise analytic externally applied force, transition forces must be included during these transition time intervals to remove the noncausal pre-acceleration and pre-deceleration from the solutions to the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> without the transition forces. For the extended charged sphere, the transition forces can be chosen to maintain conservation of momentum-energy in the causal solutions to the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> within the {{restrictions of}} relativistic rigidity and negligible O(a) terms under which the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> is derived. However, it is shown that renormalization of the electrostatic mass to a finite value as the radius of the charge approaches zero introduces a violation of momentum-energy conservation into the causal solutions to the <b>equation</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the point charge if the magnitude of the external force becomes too large.
