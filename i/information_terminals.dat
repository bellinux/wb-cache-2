A significant feature of IBM's read/write disk media was the use of a Teflon-lubricated fabric liner to lengthen media life. In 1976, media supplier <b>Information</b> <b>Terminals</b> Corporation enhanced resilience further by adding a Teflon coating to the magnetic disk itself. The new system used a different recording format that stored up to 250¼ kB on the same disks. Drives supporting this format were offered by a number of manufacturers and soon became common for moving smaller amounts of data. This disk format became known as the Single Sided Single Density or SSSD format. It was designed to hold just as much data as one box of 2000 punch cards. The disk was divided into 77 tracks of 26 sectors (a total of 2002 sectors), each holding 128 bytes.When the first microcomputers were being developed in the 1970s, the 8-inch floppy found a place on them {{as one of the few}} [...] "high speed, mass storage" [...] devices that were even remotely affordable to the target market (individuals and small businesses). The first microcomputer operating system, CP/M, originally shipped on 8-inch disks. However, the drives were still expensive, typically costing more than the computer they were attached to in early days, so most machines of the era used cassette tape instead.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel AE intelligent sensor networks system. The system {{is composed of}} three parts: the wide band AE sensors, the real-time signal acquisition and processing nodes and an intelligent <b>information</b> <b>terminal.</b> This system acquires AE events from the reinforced concrete structure through its wide band AE sensors, and then extracts the AE characteristic parameters of the defects in the structure through DSP of the nodes. These parameters, including the number of hits, energies, relative AE hit rates and arriving times at the individual sensors on the different locations, etc., are transferred from the individual nodes to the intelligent <b>information</b> <b>terminal.</b> The main functions of the terminal are to organize and manage the distributed nodes, and to transfer the effective information to the users through wired/wireless manner.

The practice of the networks on the Yiwu Shangbo Bridge shows that the system possesses the function of real-time, long-distance, non-destructive monitoring the health status of the reinforced concrete structures, such as the bridge, dam, tunnel, and so on. Furthermore, this system has the property of adjusting and controlling its own status. Therefore, it is suitable for real-time monitoring {{the health of the}} various ne...|$|R

In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{estimate}} the density of nodes for pedestrians and/or vehicles with <b>information</b> <b>terminals.</b> The method enables us to provide intelligent services which are environmentaware with highly dynamic movement of nodes such as intellectual navigation that tells the user the best route to detour congested regions.

This map is updated when a node receives a density map from a neighboring node. Also by estimating the change of the density, {{taking into account the}} movement characteristics of nodes, the density map is updated in a timely fashion. The simulation experiments have been conducted and the results have shown the accuracy of the estimated density maps. ...|$|E
