40|$|A 3 -step global {{reaction}} mechanism for a methane-air mixture is optimized against a detailed reference mechanism for perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) calculations. The global mechanism {{consists of three}} reactions corresponding to the fuel oxidation into CO and H 2 O, and the CO − CO 2 equilibrium reaction. To ensure good agreement for rich conditions, correction functions that are dependent on the local equivalence ratio are introduced into the global mechanism. In {{a comparison of the}} optimized 3 -step global {{reaction mechanism}} with the reference detailed reaction mechanism, GRI Mech 3. 0, the results show that the gas temperature and emissions are reasonably well predicted for lean and rich conditions. The optimized 3 -step global reaction scheme is adapted in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a swirl-stabilized syngas burner, designed by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery (SIT syngas <b>burner)</b> <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> turbines.

Even after extensive aging under practical operating conditions (repeated on-off cycles and prolonged durations under high-temperature radiating conditions), the best developed burners (i. e., those obtained by spray pyrolysis) exhibit very limited catalyst loss and still remarkably lower (30 - 50 %) NO and CO emissions than noncatalytic, virgin FeCrAlloy burners at the specific power densities of practical interest (150 - 650 kW/m 2) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of low-grade biomass {{requires an}} appropriate technology {{that meets the}} increased demands regarding emission reduction (e. g. NOx). Within this work a new <b>burner</b> <b>for</b> low calorific value (LCV) gas applying flameless oxidation (FLOX®) will be presented that replaces the conventional flame burner of a dual-chamber furnace. The integration of an adapted FLOX®-burner has shown several benefits. Different bio-residues were tested and a more stable combustion with enhanced burnout was achieved for all tested fuels. Furthermore, the burner can be operated in broader range of operation and closer to stoichiometric conditions. Due to the high power density of a FLOX®-burner the complete facility could be downsized in the future. Still, the tests {{have shown that the}} NOx reduction potential of a FLOX®-burner is limited <b>for</b> LCV <b>gas</b> combustion since the most NO emissions are related to fuel-bond nitrogen. In the LCV gases generated from wheat pellets and rape cake pellets high concentrations of NO-precursors (NH 3 and HCN) are measured that are subsequently be oxidized to NO in the FLOX®-burner. Therefore, an air-staged <b>burner</b> <b>for</b> N-rich LCV <b>gases</b> based on flameless combustion is proposed where NO-precursors can be reduced to N 2 in a first substoichiometric region. CFD simulations were applied to investigate an appropriate design of an air-staged FLOX®-burner. Special emphasis is placed on the creation of a sufficient internal recirculation of flue <b>gases</b> required <b>for</b> flameless combustion. First results of CFD simulations are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The first {{development}} cycle of a residential {{power generation system}} is described. A steam reformer was chosen to produce hydrogen out of natural gas. After carbon monoxide purification with a preferential oxidation (PrOx) unit the hydrogen rich reformat gas is feed to the anode of the PEM-fuel cell, where due to the internal reaction with air oxygen form the cathode side water, heat and electricity is produced. Due to an incomplete conversion the anode off gas contains hydrogen and residual methane, which is feed to the burner of the steam reformer to reduce the needed amount of external fuel to heat the steam reformer. To develop the system the components are separately investigated and optimized in their construction or operation to meet the system requirements.

40|$|Recent {{national}} and international emissions legislation, in particular sulphur-dioxide, and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels are forcing power producing industries to look at various alternatives, such as biomass and co-firing techniques. Biomass may be transported to the burners of a pulverised fuel (PF) boiler either mixed with the primary fuel, in general coal, or used in dedicated pipelines. In both cases, the transportation of biomass is different due to its composition, size and shape to the transportation of coal. This thesis investigates the computational modelling techniques for a biomass and biomass blend particle transportation (arboreal and flour) in a pipeline with a transverse elbow, the three-phase flow of a coal and biomass co-fire blend in the primary air annulus of a swirl burner and the combustion of a coal and pelletised straw mixture in a full scale <b>furnace</b> using dedicated <b>burners</b> <b>for</b> the biomass injection. The comparison of spherical and non-spherical drag models, under gravity, as well as Saffman lift, inter-particle collision and randomised impulsive wall collision models has been investigated. Good agreement was observed between the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and the experimental data, using a non-spherical drag model. In both cases, due to the dilute volume fraction and secondary air flow, inter-particle collisions and lift were insignificant. In the annulus, lateral regions of high particle concentration were predicted, which are not observed physically. Numerical simulations of a 300 MWe tangentially fired furnace, co-firing bituminous coal and pelletised straw, have been performed and compared to experimental data. Bituminous coal was co-fired with pelletised straw. Good agreement was obtained between the CFD predictions and the experimental data so that the trends of furnace temperature, NOx emissions and carbon burnout reduction, as biomass load is increased, were observed. Quantitative prediction of unburnt carbon (UBC) and NOx require a more detailed picture of the processes within the furnace at higher temperatures than that currently provided by experimental data...|$|R
