25|$|The same {{afternoon}} police {{searched the}} Leik family's basement, Collins {{was confronted with}} evidence thus far gained and deduced. Although Collins burst into tears when informed the stains on the floor covered with paint had been varnish, he quickly regained his composure and continued to deny any knowledge of Karen Sue Beineman. Later that day, having received initial laboratory reports indicating the hair samples recovered from Beineman's panties matched those discovered in Leik's basement, and that the bloodstains recovered from this location were of the same type as hers, Collins was arrested and his apartment and vehicles thoroughly searched. Despite recovering numerous stolen items from his apartment and being informed by Arnold Davis that Collins {{had been in the}} habit of committing burglaries with a former roommate of theirs named Andrew Manuel, no incriminating evidence linking Collins to Beineman or any victim of the Michigan Murders was discovered, although officers were informed by Arnold Davis on this <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> two days earlier in which he (Davis) had observed Collins carrying a laundry box containing women's clothing and jewelry from his apartment and towards his car.|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on May 30, 2017 Dissertation advisor: Chen YiVitaThesis (D. M. A.) [...] Conservatory of Music and Dance, University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Symphonic Poem No. 1, Poems on Stone Drums is an orchestral piece with three main {{sections}} {{played in a}} single continuous movement. Its inspiration comes from a set of ancient Chinese seal scripts on ten drum-shaped stones now preserved in the Palace Museum in Beijing, China. These drum-shaped stones with seal scripts were originally made before the Qin Dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC), and were first discovered in 627 CE. The poems on the seal scripts describe an ancient Qin king’s parade. However, {{for thousands of years}} and still today, experts and scholars do not agree on <b>the</b> exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> described in these poems on stone drums. The legend and mystery that surrounds these drums, and <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Chinese seal script characters are deeply attractive. These ten drum-shaped stones have been traveling through time and space to the present, and they are now displayed quietly in the Palace Museum in Beijing, China, offering a rich and dramatic contrast with <b>the</b> grand scene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king <b>of</b> Qin king’s parade over two thousand years ago. In my composition, I express the massive contrasts in different sections through different timbres, dynamics, registers, and orchestration styles, and thereby praise the glorious and magnificent tradition of Chinese history and culture. Concerning pitch material, I employ a series of tetrachords with their permutations, and develop them using a technique based on set theory combined with a Chinese music flavor. Specifically, I use major and minor seconds to create two groups of tetrachords (“ 0123 ” and “ 0246 ”) along with their transpositions and permutations in the foreground and two Chinese pentatonic scales (CDFGA and C#D#F#G#A#) with their transpositions and permutations in the background.

The Governor's cavalry turned their backs to them, and they were hotly pursued by Maguire and his people, who continued to lash and strike them until they arrived at the camp and fortification where the Governor was.

When the Governor saw that he had not an equal number of men with them, he returned back, he himself and all his people having escaped scathless from that conflict, except only William Clifford, a distinguished gentleman, and five or six horsemen, who were slain on that occasion. On the other side were slain, Edmond Magauran, Primate of Armagh, who happened accidentally to be along with Maguire on this occasion; the Abbot Maguire, (Cathal, son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbot); Mac Caffry (Felim), and his brother's son.

Rogers attended a conference seminar that morning, and says she returned to their room to find Broaddrick on the bed “in a state of shock,” her pantyhose torn in the crotch and her lip swollen {{as though she had}} been hit.

Consequently, the Revisionist perspective would argue, [...] "the armed uprising on 3 April 1948 {{was one of several}} instances of public resistance to the US military government, which originally commenced on 1 March 1947."

40|$|PURPOSE: Two earlier {{population-based}} studies provide {{conflicting information}} on the association between low socioeconomic status (SES) and risk for epilepsy. Seizure etiologies (e. g., head injury, stroke) associated with low SES were not addressed in prior analyses. We assess the relation between SES indices and incident epilepsy separately {{for children and adults}} and in subgroups defined by seizure etiology. METHODS: In this population-based case-control study, a surveillance system identified incident unprovoked seizure or first diagnosis of epilepsy throughout Iceland (n = 418). Controls were selected from the population registry as the next two same-sex births alive, residing in Iceland at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> index seizure, and without a history of unprovoked seizure on <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case's <b>incident</b> seizure (n = 835). The odds ratio measured the association between SES and epilepsy. RESULTS: An association was found between epilepsy and SES among adults, but not among children. Among adults, low education was associated with an increased risk for epilepsy [odds ratio (OR), 2. 29; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 21 - 4. 34), and home ownership was protective (OR, 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 43 - 0. 92). When analyses were repeated by seizure etiology, this association remained only in the group with epilepsy of unknown cause, even after adjusting for alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES, indexed by low education or lack of home ownership, is a risk factor for epilepsy in adults, but not in children, suggesting a cumulative effect of SES on risk for epilepsy. This association is not explained by established risk factors for epilepsy (e. g., head injury, stroke). We find no evidence of a downward social drift among cases whose parents had epilepsy...|$|R
