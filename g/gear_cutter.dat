40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of gear cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutter</b> design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutters.</b> It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutter.</b> With cylindrical <b>gear</b> being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutters.</b> The knowl- edge about the profile of the cutter teeth and the profile cut by the <b>cutter</b> in the <b>gear</b> blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutter</b> is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the <b>cutter</b> and <b>gear</b> geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. <b>Gear</b> shaper <b>cutter</b> profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutter</b> design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the profile cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutters</b> profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life <b>gear</b> shaper <b>cutter</b> designs were performed...|$|R

50|$|By 1896 Fellows had fully {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The gear hobbing process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of gear hobbing and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes <b>gear</b> <b>cutter</b> geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of gear hobbing. Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|E

5000|$|Spur {{gear teeth}} are {{manufactured}} by either involute profile or cycloidal profile. Most of the gears are manufactured by involute profile with 20° pressure angle. When two gears are in mesh at one instant {{there is a}} chance to mate involute portion with non-involute portion of mating gear. This phenomenon is known as [...] "interference" [...] and occurs when the number of teeth on the smaller of the two meshing gears is less than a required minimum.

(some col.) This research investigated bearing failures in a spur <b>gear</b> <b>cutter</b> bar {{used in the}} agricultural equipment sector for cutting forage crops. The cutter bar is under consideration by Case-New Holland (CNH) for use in their equipment. The primary focus {{of this investigation was}} to develop and test a real time monitoring system to monitor the health of the bearings during operation and alert the operator of the location of a pending bearing failure. This system uses temperature as the monitoring parameter and does not estimate the remaining useful life after the initial failure mode has been detected. The temperature profile of interest is that just before catastrophic failure and based on that is used to alert the operator. Causes of bearing failure within the cutter bar are also investigated theoretically to determine the effect that they would have on bearing life. Both cutter bar bending and bearing misalignment were analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Bending of the cutter bar was determined to not have a detrimental effect on the contact stresses within the bearings and thus no shortening of bearing life. Bearing alignment is a critical factor in bearing condition as excessive misalignment creates high contact stresses reducing the useful life. The gear train and bearings are retained between two steel halves creating a case, and to prevent excessive misalignment the case halves cannot shift by more than 0. 47 ± 0. 04 mm relative to the vertical axis of each bearing mount. Additional testing determined that operating the cutter bar on a hill has no effect on bearing life and that oil temperature can be used to monitor the correct amount of oil in the cutter bar...|$|E
40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov gears are {{becoming}} more and more popular for heavy load applications. They have been tried as speed-reducing gears, in spite of heavy noise generation, in aircraft jet engines, marine engines and agricultural machinery. These circular-arc gears, though stronger than involute geras, have the disadvantage of needing larger face width. Axial face width required can be minimized only at the expense of load-carrying capacity. This is not a serious disadvantage with stationary engines. But in the case of automotive applications, this fact limits the load-carrying capacity of Wildhaber-Novikov gears, since space problem is very critical in these applications and large face widths, therefore, cannot be used for such gear-reduction units. The face width is determined by the helix angle and, therefore, a thorough investigation of the dependence of the load-carrying capacity on helix angle is necessary, if these special types of gears have to make headway into the automotive field. In this experimental investigation, three-dimensional photoelastic technique has been employed to study the load-carrying capacity/face width ratio. Three-dimensional gear models made of epoxy castings (Araldite B) were loaded in a specially built gear-loading fixture and were stress frozen. <b>Gear</b> <b>cutters</b> of Wildhaber-Novikov <b>gears</b> developed at the laboratory were used for the preparation of these three-dimensional gear models. The stress-frozen models were analyzed using the conventional slicing technique to study the contact and bending-stress distribution along the face width. The load-carrying capacity in terms of contact stress and bending stress has been studied for different face widths and helix angles. Twenty-deg pressure angle, 14 -mm module gears of alladdendum type of Wildhaber-Novikov gears with different helix angles up to 40 deg were tested. The helical-overlap ratio used was 1. 0. The conventional profile parameters were employed for the manufacture of <b>gear</b> <b>cutters</b> of end-mill type. The decrease in contact and bending strength with increase in the helix angle or decrease in the face width, as obtained from this photoelastic method of stress analysis has been compared with existing theoretical results. © 1977 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|R
