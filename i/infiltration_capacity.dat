This has resulted in dense stand growth with increased destructive fire potential and transpirational water loss. In Arizona, as in many areas, prescribed forest burning {{has been used to}} effectively reduce these fuel hazards. Some question has arisen about the possible side effects of such treatments, particularly air pollution and reduction of infiltration and water yield. In an effort to determine the effects on infiltration, plots receiving various treatments (control, light burn, heavy burn) were fitted with fusion pyrometers before burning, to measure soil surface temperatures during burning. After burning, infiltrometers were installed. Surface temperatures did not exceed 200 degrees f. For the light burns, and ranged over 350 - 500 degrees f. During heavy burns. Both heavy and light burns produced highly significant decreases in <b>infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> after burning and the surface 2 inches showed increases in soil pH, carbon and total nitrogen percentages. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> returned to normal after overwintering and were attributed to frost action on soil texture and porosity.

Four sites, with soil textural classes ranging from a loam to a loamy sand and elevations between 680 and 2180 m, were studied at three moisture contents. Compaction was monitored with a double probe nuclear densiometer and an air permeameter after 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 20 round trips. Density measurements were made at five different depths. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> were determined with a small, portable rainfall simulator. Soil core samples were taken to observe porosity and conductivity levels before and after disturbance. Compaction, or the change in bulk density, was significantly greater on the crawler tractor trails at all depths. When only the plots established in the outer positions of the trails were included, this distinction between vehicles could not be made. The crawler tractor generated more uniform compaction across its trails that either the torsion suspension vehicle or the rubber-tired skidder. The greatest change in bulk density for all the vehicles took place in the surface five centimeters. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> on the undisturbed sites were found to exceed predicted maximum precipitation rates. Mineral soil at the three higher elevation sites was very hydrophobic. This was thought to be due to the coating of soil particles with the metabolic products of fungal mycelia. The crawler tractor reduced <b>infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> by 78 percent, while the torsion suspension vehicle and the rubber-tired skidder caused 67 percent decreases. Suspended sediment concentrations determined from runoff collected on the infiltration plots served as an erosion index for the skid trails. The crawler tractor trails had runoff with 40 percent higher sediment loads than that found on the trails of the other two skidders. Organic matter content was inversely correlated with the sediment levels. Air permeability readings showed that the three vehicles produced very similar reductions in macroporosity in the surface 2. 5 cm layer as the number of trips increased. Approximately 75 percent of the decrease in macropore space occurred by six trips. The air permeameter provided a relatively good index of compaction. Porosity and conductivity levels determined from the soil core samples showed that machine differences did not exist in the track position. Macropore space was r 2 duced 43 percent and the conductivity decreased 80 percent. Site differences were much more evident than vehicle differences.

A "true" runoff scenario is established using very high resolution precipitation data and parameters derived from the physical properties of the soils. This scenario is used for calibration of models using longer sampling periods. Point infiltration models were used to isolate the effects of temporal sampling.

40|$|Forests cover 59 % of Taiwan {{island where}} {{disastrous}} floods, landslides and debris flows occur often due to heavy typhoon-season rainstorms, steep terrain, fragile geologic formations and frequent earthquakes. This study evaluated the hydrologic influences of forests on Taiwan's headwaters watersheds and supports the century-old policy of designating protection forests for streamflow regulation and soil conservation. Despite rainfall intensity that often exceeds 100 mm/h overland flow rarely occurs on Taiwan's permeable forest soils. High evapotranspiration totaling 800 - 1200 mm annually contributes to reduced streamflows. In Taiwan forests reduce stream sedimentation from landslides by enhancing slope stability with roots and protect water quality by minimizing stream temperature fluctuation, regulating nutrient concentration and filtering contaminants. Floods in Taiwan are {{mainly caused by}} heavy rainstorms exceeding 250 mm, and are not significantly affected by the currently low level of annual forest removal.

40|$|Understanding the {{intensity}} and duration of tropical rain events is critical to modelling the rate and timing of wetcanopy evaporation, the suppression of transpiration, the generation of infiltration-excess overland flow and hence to erosion, and to river responsiveness. Despite this central role, few studies have addressed the characteristics of equatorial rainstorms. This study analyses rainfall data for a 5 km 2 region largely comprising of the 4 km 2 Sapat Kalisun Experimental Catchment {{in the interior of}} northeastern Borneo at sampling frequencies from 1 min 1 to 1 day 1. The work clearly shows that most rainfall within this inland, forested area is received during regular short-duration events (< 15 min) that have a relatively low intensity (i. e. less than two 0 Ð 2 mm rain-gauge tips in almost all 5 min periods). The rainfall appears localized, with significant losses in intergauge correlations being observable in minutes {{in the case of the}} typical mid-afternoon, convective events. This suggests that a dense rain-gauge network, sampled at a high temporal frequency, is required for accurate distributed rainfall-runoff modelling of such small catchments.

40|$|The Tarija Basin, {{located in}} {{southern}} Bolivia, {{is subject to}} intense soil erosion and in recent decades rainstorm-induced soil loss and associated flooding have posed a serious hazard to local inhabitants. Intense soil erosion in the basin was initiated by deforestation associated with mining industries in the 17 th century and thereafter it has been accelerated by intensive grazing and land reclamation. Poorly consolidated Quaternary which comprise {{the center of the}} basin and mainly consist of silt and clay promote the erosion. The extremely low <b>infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> of non-vegetated surfaces lead to rapidly generate surface runoff during rainstorms in the rainy season.

The mechanical analysis of the soils indicated that Logo had sandy loam texture while Ambighir and Katsina-Ala were of loamy sand to sandy loam textures. The soils had high values of <b>infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> (0. 0096 cm/s to 0. 053 cm/s).

The pH of the soils varied from slightly acidic in the wet seasons to slightly alkaline in the dry seasons (5. 3 to 7. 8). Risk of infiltration was envisaged as a result of very low values of conductivity (0. 04 ds/m – 0. 25 ds/m). At the present time, infiltration problem is minimal because of high proportion of sand (68 %- 89 %) in the soils but this situation may not be sustained for long.

To investigate the impact of changing ground temperature conditions on hydrological processes in the context of climate change, a distributed hydrological model with an explicit frozen ground module was applied to an alpine watershed in the upstream area of the Hei'he River in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China. After evaluating the base model, we considered scenarios of frost-free ground and climate change. Results showed that the base model with a frozen ground module successfully captured the water balance and thermal regimes in the basin. When the frozen ground module was turned off, the simulated groundwater recharge and base flow increased by a factor of two to three because surface runoff caused by exceeding <b>infiltration</b> <b>capacities</b> at high elevations, which occurred in the base model, was eliminated. Consequently, the river hydrograph became smoother and flatter, with summer flood peaks delayed and reduced in volume. The annual mean depth where subsurface runoff was generated, was about 2. 4 m compared to 1. 1 m in the base model. For a warming climate, a combination of increasing evapotranspiration and reducing permafrost area results in smoother and flatter hydrographs, and a reduction in total river discharge. Although our analysis using numerical models has its limitations, it still provides new quantitative understanding of the influences of frozen ground and climate change on hydrological processes in an alpine watershed. </p...|$|R
