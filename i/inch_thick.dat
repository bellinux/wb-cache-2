The bottom layer, called pavimentum, was one <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> and made of mortar. Above this were four strata of masonry. The layer directly above the pavimentum was called the statumen.

25|$|In 1790, Robert Cox started {{manufacturing}} fusee chains from {{workshops in}} the High Street, {{for use in}} the gearing mechanism of watches. The work was extremely intricate; the chains were only fourteen-hundredths of an <b>inch</b> <b>thick,</b> therefore children as young as nine, from the local workhouse (now the Red House Museum) were employed in their manufacture. The children were paid 1s 6d for a 70-hour week and from 1802 were being taught to read for 10 minutes each morning and afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b>|$|E

Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} soft {{conversion}} {{was within the}} construction products industry (metricated 1969 and 1972) where certain products continue to be produced to with reference to Imperial trade names but made using metric dimensions in the factory; for example, a 13mm thick plasterboard is still often called 'half-inch', even though the measurement is rounded to a convenient metric size and so is now only approximately half an <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b> The construction industry itself (which included civil engineering projects) {{was one of the}} leaders in the metrication programme, having drawn up a detailed plan in 1967 and completing the phase-over by the end 1972.|$|E

25|$|In 1899, Victoria {{was drafted}} {{for use as}} a troopship by the U.S. Government during the Spanish American War.

25|$|The MacAdam shield-shovel {{resembled the}} {{standard}} portable infantry spade of its day in both size and shape. In {{order to stop}} or deflect enemy fire, thicker steel {{was used in the}} construction of the blade; it measured at three-sixteenths of an <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b> Heavy steel was also used to make the shovel's detachable handle which measured four feet in length. Unique to the shield-shovel was the inclusion of a 3.5 by 2 inch sight-hole in the blade. The shovel was intended to be used as a shield by folding the handle to ~90° toward the concave side of the blade, exposing the spike that ran along the handle opposite the blade. The spike would then be driven into the ground, resulting in the blade standing vertically and the handle resting on the ground behind it as a brace.|$|E
