5000|$|MIL-DTL-83538, (formerly MIL-C-83538) {{describes}} connectors and accessories, electrical, circular, umbilical. The {{connector assembly}} provides the necessary connections {{required to meet}} a MIL-STD-1760, Class I electrical interface between stores and their associated launchers using a [...] "blind mating" [...] mechanism. The connector assembly consists of a receptacle installed on the launcher, a receptacle installed on the store, and a buffer plug installed between the two receptacles. This specification also includes the required mounting adapters and nut, accessory adapter, cable bushing, and protective covers. This connector assembly provides the transfer of MIL-STD-1760 interface class I electrical signals and power between an aircraft (or ground vehicle) mounted launcher and an associated store. This connector is military unique because {{it is intended to}} be used on rail and eject launchers where engagement/disengagement of the launcher receptacle (with attached buffer plug) to the store receptacle will be via a blindmate mechanical mechanism; whereas no known commercially equivalent substitute is available. The <b>insert</b> <b>arrangement</b> is 25-20 of MIL-STD-1560.|$|E
30|$|Key {{criteria}} {{in the design}} of the imaging phantom were considered. The phantom should be anatomically realistic and simulate a patient abdomen, both visually and when imaged with scintigraphy and x-ray computed tomography. A fillable section within the structure was required to represent activity distributions within a liver. The liver section needed to accommodate multiple inserts for lesion representation and allow flexibility in <b>insert</b> <b>arrangement</b> while allowing reproducible assembly for repeated studies. All materials used in the phantom must have similar densities and attenuation coefficients to tissue. The material for the lesions should also be transparent for visualisation and ease of filling. Filling and assembly should be uncomplicated to reduce radiation exposure when preparing the phantom. When filled, the material should have low water absorption, be water tight at all seals and be sufficiently strong to maintain structural integrity when filled and transported. Finally, a total weight limit to the phantom was specified as 20  kg to ensure transportation and manual handing constraints were met.|$|E
40|$|Household {{aerosols}} are self-contained handheld {{devices for}} spraying {{products such as}} air fresheners, hairspray, surface cleaners, polishes, and deodorants. Industrial aerosols are similar devices for spraying: cleaners, lubricants, paints, and adhesives. They also have hospital and specific medical uses for spraying coagulants and disinfectants. Worldwide around 20 billion devices are manufactured annually and the UK has a major share of this market, manufacturing 5 billion units, {{second only to the}} USA. Led by the Californian Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2001, there is mounting pressure for the use of liquefied gas propellants (volatile organic compounds) in aerosol cans to be banned. This paper addresses the challenges of creating a fine spray using a pressurized inert gas (non-VOC) as the propellant for household aerosols. The spray produced has to achieve a relative performance to that of a traditional fine spray VOC propellant aerosol with regard to droplet size, reach, cone angle, and flow rate. The findings of this work have demonstrated that to achieve a sub- 50 -µm (Dv, 50) spray is extremely challenging when using compressed inert gas and single fluid alone. However, by bleeding air into the <b>insert</b> <b>arrangement,</b> a spray of 24 µm (Dv, 50) can be obtained and this is comparable in droplet size to that produced by a traditional fine spray VOC aerosol...|$|E

To obtain established human keratinocytes carrying dimeric HPV- 1, origin-minus imian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA {{was used as a}} dominant transforming marker in co-transfection experiments performed with cultured human foetal keratinocytes. Using the Southern blotting technique, HPV- 1 DNA was detected in one out of five SV 40 -transformed human keratinocyte c ll lines which were obtained in this way. Further blotting experiments using SV 40, pBR 322 and HPV- 1 DNA as probes revealed patterns of hybridization which were consistent with co-integration of SV 40 DNA with between two and four copies of the HPV- 1 genome. The HPV- 1 sequences in this cell line were virtually non-methylated and were transcribed at a lower level than SV 40 mRNAs in the same cultured cells. A low level of monomeric HPV form I DNA was detected by blotting of undigested total cellular DNA.

MethodsFifty Wistar female rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a Lichong decoction group, a Guizifuling capsule group and a Mifepristone group. The hysteromyoma rat model {{was established by}} intraperitoneal injection of exogenous estrin and progestogens. Pathological examination of uterine tissue, uterine coefficient and uterine transverse diameter were made under optic microscope and expressions of Bcl- 2 and Bax mRNAs in uterine tissue in the groups were detected with real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.

For introduction of CMS maize in agricultural practice, sufficient yields comparable with conventional systems should be achieved. The plus-cultivar-system in maize offers a possibility for biological confinement together with high and stable yields whereas pollinator amount and distribution within the CMS crop is crucial.

Differences in yield between row and mix arrangements were not detected. No differences between the tested arrangements occurred in Spain. With respect to practical conditions, a pollinator proportion of 15 % can be recommended for achieving a satisfactory yield.

40|$|This work draws {{some early}} {{baselines}} on the in-plane/out-of-plane properties balance in a 5 HS woven carbon fabric/epoxy composite reinforced by tufting and resin injected by resin transfer moulding technique. Details {{of the manufacturing}} processes involved {{in the preparation of}} such through-the-thickness reinforced composites are presented together with analysis of the mesostructure of tufted specimens. Preforms were reinforced locally with a commercial glass or carbon fibre thread. The tufts were <b>inserted</b> in square <b>arrangement</b> with a KSL tufting tool interfaced to a 6 axis computer controlled robot arm from Kawasaki. The presence of tufts improved significantly the delamination resistance, assessed by testing double cantilever beam coupons in mode I loading configuration. In-plane tension and compression after im¬pact (CAI) tests revealed that the reinforcement resulted in a considerable increase in the post-impact residual strength value, with an accompanying drop down in static tensile modulus and strength of less than 10 %. In addition to the standard coupons for the determination of the quasi-static mechanical properties, some cured miniature specimens containing a limited number of tufts were also prepared. These were tested in both uniaxial pull-out and in a mode II configuration in order to measure the bridg¬ing actions of the tufts and to determine the micromechanical failure mechanisms. The obtained crack bridging laws were used for calibrating a simple analytical model of the mechanical behaviour of a single tuft within the composite. The tufting technology was applied to an innovative concept that aims to adopt the tufting threads as a carrier for resin modifiers. For this purpose a single-filament and a multi-filament thermoplastic prototype threads were used. These threads are not intended to modify the composite fibre architecture but are expected to dissolve into and react with the host matrix upon cure. The outcome of mode I delamination and CAI tests conducted on woven preforms reinforced with such `soluble' threads are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Solar-powered thermo-chemical cycles {{are capable}} of emission-free {{hydrogen}} production from water in centralised plants. A two-step cycle based on a metal oxide redox pair system, which can split water molecules by abstracting oxygen atoms and reversibly incorporating them into their lattice, coated on ceramic honeycombs that can absorb concentrated solar radiation has been developed. An easy way of operation is gained by {{the combination of a}} ceramic substrate as absorber structure, which can be heated to high temperatures with concentrated solar radiation, and of a metal oxide coating which is capable of splitting water. This offers advantages over comparable processes, because in this case the entire process can be conducted in a single solar heated converter. In the first step, the steam flowing past the metal oxide is split by binding the oxygen to the excited metal oxide lattice, and H 2 is produced. In the second step, at temperatures of 1150 - 1200 °C, the oxygen, which has previously been incorporated into the lattice, is released again, and the metal oxide is regenerated. Because of the immobilization of the redox pair material on the substrate, not only no solids need to be circulated, but hydrogen production and oxygen release take place at different steps, eliminating thus the need for high-temperature gas separation processes. A slightly modified process can also been applied for the thermo-chemical reduction of CO 2 enabling to provide the precursors for the production of liquid fuels and other organic chemicals. The two steps of the process are carried out in a cyclic mode two identical chambers of the receiver-reactor. The multi-chamber arrangement of the reactor enables a quasi-continuous solar hydrogen production. The present work describes the realisation and successful test operation of a 100 kW pilot plant on a solar tower, which aimed at the demonstration of the feasibility of the process on a solar tower platform under real conditions. The pilot plant has been installed at the Small-Solar-Power-System (SSPS), the small solar central receiver system at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Spain. The first part of the testing of the plant was dedicated to an exhaustive thermal qualification of the pilot plant took place, using uncoated ceramic honeycombs as absorbers. Some main aspects of these tests were the development and validation of operational and measurement strategy, the gaining of knowledge on the dynamics of the system, in particular during thermal cycling, the determination of the controllability of the whole system, and the validation of practicability of control concept. The thermal tests enabled to improve, to refine and finally to prove the process strategy and showed the feasibility of the control concept implemented. It could be shown that rapid changeover between the modules is a central benefit for the performance of the process. This reduces a time period with lower hydrogen production or ineffective regeneration of the modules. After that the absorber was replaced and honeycombs coated with redox material were <b>inserted.</b> With that <b>arrangement</b> several experimental campaigns were carried out. Hydrogen was produced in a quasi-continuous manner by running several production cycles. Potential operation ranges and the influence of key operation parameters was investigated. ...|$|R
