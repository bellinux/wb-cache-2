40|$|Composite cure process induced {{residual}} strains and warping deformations in composite components present significant {{challenges in}} the manufacturing of advanced composite structure. As {{a part of the}} Manufacturing Process and Simulation initiative of the NASA Advanced Composite Project (ACP), research is being conducted on the composite cure process by developing an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which the process induced factors influence the residual responses. In this regard, analytical studies have been conducted on the cure process modeling of composite structural parts with varied physical, thermal, and resin flow process characteristics. The cure process simulation results were analyzed to interpret the cure response predictions based on the underlying physics incorporated into the modeling tool. In the cure-kinetic analysis, the model predictions on the degree of cure, resin viscosity and modulus were interpreted with reference to the temperature distribution in the composite panel part and tool setup during autoclave or hot-press curing cycles. In the <b>fiber-bed</b> compaction simulation, the pore pressure and resin flow velocity in the porous media models, and the compaction strain responses under applied pressure were studied to interpret the fiber volume fraction distribution predictions. In the structural simulation, the effect of temperature on the resin and ply modulus, and thermal coefficient changes during curing on predicted mechanical strains and chemical cure shrinkage strains were studied to understand the residual strains and stress response predictions. In addition to computational analysis, experimental studies were conducted to measure strains during the curing of laminated panels by means of optical fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs) embedded in the resin impregnated panels. The residual strain measurements from laboratory tests were then compared with the analytical model predictions. The paper describes the cure process procedures and residual strain predications, and discusses pertinent experimental results from the validation studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Because the <b>fiber-</b> opt ic {{chemical}} sensors {{based on the}} fluorescence quenching has an adjustable short distance from the membrane {{to the end of}} fiber optics, forming a space of microcell, a diminution of fluorescence is induced by inner f ilter effects, involving absorpt ion of both excited light from the light source and emitted light from the membrane. If the absorpt ion spectra of analytes overlap the fluorescence excitation and / or emission spectra of the fluoroprobe in the membrane, the quenching signal of the <b>fiber-</b> optic {{chemical sensors}} would be produced by the resonance energy transfer. In addition, dynamic quenching happens to some haloid, heavy metal compounds and aromat ic nitro organic compounds.

A successful method of anaerobic digestion built around the fermentation properties of these feedstock has been evolved which uses no moving parts, pretreatment or energy input while enabling recovery of four products: fiber, biogas, compost and pest repellent. An SRT of 27 d and 35 d was found to be optimum for fiber recovery for banana leaf and areca husk, respectively.

40|$|Human {{cervical}} mucus is a heterogeneous mixture of mucin glycoproteins whose relative concentration changes during the ovulatory phases, thereby producing different mucus aggregation structures that can periodically permit the transit of spermatozoa for fertilization. In preovulatory phase, mucus is arranged in compact <b>fiber-</b> like structures where sperm transit is hindered. Previously, through observations made of fixed and dehydrated samples, a permissive {{structure in the}} ovulatory phase was attributed to the larger diameters of pores in the mucus network. Instead, by means of atomic force microscopy, we can show, for the first time, that unfixed ovulatory mucus is composed by floating globules of mucin aggregates.

In addition, we demonstrate that the switch from globular ovulatory to fibrous preovulatory mucus largely depends on a pH- driven mechanism.

40|$|Nonlinear {{electromechanical}} and polarization switching {{behaviors of}} piezoelectric materials and viscoelastic nature of polymers {{result in the}} overall nonlinear and hysteretic responses of active polymeric composites. Understanding the nonlinear behavior of the active polymeric composites is crucial in designing structures comprising of these active materials. This study presents three micromechanical models, i. e., <b>fiber-,</b> particle-, and hybrid-unit-cell models, to study the effective nonlinear and hysteretic electro-mechanical responses of 1 - 3, 0 - 3, and hybrid piezocomposites, respectively. The microstructures of the active composites are idealized with periodically distributed arrays of cubic representative unit cells. A unit cell is divided into several subcells. The <b>fiber-</b> and particle-unit-cell models consist of four and eight subcells, respectively. The hybrid-unit-cell model is derived based on the fiber-unit-cell model of 1 - 3 active composites consisting of fiber and matrix subcells, in which the matrix subcells are comprised of a particle-unit-cell model of 0 - 3 active composites. In order to obtain the overall nonlinear responses of the active composites linearized micromechanical relations are first used to provide trial solutions followed by iterative schemes in order to correct errors from linearizing the nonlinear responses. The micromechanical predictions are capable in predicting the overall nonlinear electromechanical, time-dependent, and polarization switching responses of active composites available in literature. Parametric studies are also performed to illustrate the effects of microstructural geometry and volume content of the piezoelectric inhomogeneities as well as loading history on the overall nonlinear and hysteretic responses of active composites.
