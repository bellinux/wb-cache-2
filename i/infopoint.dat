The largest facility dedicated to the leader capuano Ettore Fieramosca has a height of nine meters, a diameter of six and a weight of 15 tons and will be the place of reception, a physical and virtual space {{of the city of}} Capua, a window on the world, but especially local icon. The helmet itself as a kind of urban-scale structure, the only example in Italy, whose artistic value is combined with the info-point function for tourists and usable inside. But Fieramosca <b>Infopoint</b> Monument is also and above all a monumental work in a new context, which is the architectural and urban Cosmo16, a multipurpose space to serve the city and the traveler. In this urban space helmet it stands as a thoughtful sentinel to defend the territory. Piazza Umberto I becomes an area of services capable of hosting a multi-storey car park which offers, for its strategic position and the geometry of space, to serve as a support of the complex knot of collective public activities, trade and services included in the walls of the nearby historic town. The vast space of about 6,000 square meters will house, therefore, a two-level underground parking for a total of about 250 cars. The initiative is not missed the support of CIRA, the Italian Aerospace Research Centre, capuana excellence in the technology sector, which has given its contribution by sharing innovative path linked to the event.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although a {{ubiquitous}} computing has been widespread and computers embedded into physical objects and living environments have been increased, personal portable devices are still necessary for various interactions with embedded computers. Despite of importance of those devices, {{input and output}} capabilities of them are limited and relatively impoverished compared to those of laptop computers. Moreover, users must pay an explicit attention to an interaction with portable devices. To solve these problems, we propose a smart device collaboration for a {{ubiquitous computing}}, which aims to realize that each embedded computer complements the lack of capability of a portable device in the ubiquitous computing environment. Our proposed smart device collaboration allows users to have appropriate interactions with embedded computers, without explicit attentions to existences of these computers and interfaces to them. This paper describes <b>InfoPoint</b> and Smart Furniture which are our experimental devices demonstrating smart device collaboration. We also observe {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these devices, present future works, and conclude a scheme of the smart device collaboration. ...|$|E

40|$|For {{some years}} now the General Directorate for the Protection of Nature of the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea, and the Department of "Fisica Tecnica" of the "Sapienza" University of Rome have been collaborating {{on issues such}} as {{sustainable}} development in protected areas and new technologies concerning innovative low-impact materials to be used in areas of particularly high environmental sensitivity. The first case study presented for the Protected Areas deals with a pilot project in a suburban green area jointly individuated with the "Assessorato all'Ambiente" of the Municipality of Rome designed to evaluate low-impact building in contexts of environmental "Excellency", such as parkland in urban areas, city outskirts, green areas and national parks. In line with the Strategic Environmental Evaluation, the reversibility of such buildings has been evaluated with particular care, although other considerations, such as aspects related to the education towards sustainability in architecture, were also looked into. Research has been oriented towards pinpointing 'new' envelope technologies in which to assembly components and technical solutions already known as "sustainable" and/or "energy efficient" (such as coat insulation, roof garden, ecologically compatible materials such as wood, etc.), but whose combined application has not yet been tested as a whole complex system. During the realization of this 500 mq eco-sustainable structures the following technologies have been included: wooden structures and sheathing for a low energy consumption and naturally recyclable material; green roof coverings; systems for water cycle management; solar collectors for hot water production and photovoltaic systems; high performance glass in terms of light transmission, solar control and thermal insulation. The second case study, coming from the experience of the pilot project, is the realization of a 15 mq <b>infopoint</b> that is energetically self sufficient in the protected area of the Asinara island (Ardito S., Parks of Italy - the protected areas system, Italian Environmental Ministry - Carsa Edizioni, 2004, 226 - 230 - abstract). This structure is made of a light architecture supporting a controlled and didactical use and fruition of a critical environment; this bungalow is made of a wooden modular shape with low technological equipments, based on the principals of prefabrication and low energy consumption, fed only by 1, 5 kWp photovoltaic system integrated into the roof. In this paper are summarized the first preliminary results of the monitoring campaign actually performed in both structures...|$|E
40|$|In {{the report}} of late 2001 Safe, What is Safe?, SWOV {{indicated}} how the annual number of traffic casualties could be reduced considerably. These proposals were {{to be regarded as}} an addition to the proposals as were developed in the then National Traffic and Transport Plan of the Ministry of Transport. In Safe, What is Safe?, we, among other things, calculated that, using measures in the field of roadside safety (shoulders), several dozens of lives would be saved annually on 80 km/h roads. This of a total of 160 road deaths resulting from roadside accidents on such roads. The Ministry of Transport asked SWOV to determine whether such a saving was realistic, and how it could be achieved. Are road authorities at all prepared {{to pay attention to the}} problem of roadsides and, if so, how? To obtain information about roadside safety, orientation meetings with road authorities were held and telephone interviews made; mainly with municipalities and provinces. They were asked about recognition of the problem, possible solutions (and hindrances), and costs of measures. We concentrated on the measure 'surfacing or semi-surfacing of shoulders'. This included the future categorisation according to Sustainable Safety. What it did nót involve was a methodologically sound inventory, but it did provide insight into the current situation. A literature study was carried out to determine the effectiveness of the (semi) surfaced shoulder. With this information, we made a (re) calculation of the number of casualties that can be saved with roadside measures. From the meetings with road authorities it appeared that they included the obstacle and shoulder problem in their responsibility. A lot of attention is paid to the (semi) surfacing of shoulders. This is mainly the result of the attention paid to roadside measures in Phase 2 of Sustainably Safe and the Measure-Pointer of the <b>Infopoint</b> Sustainably Safe Traffic. Many provinces and some municipalities are experimenting with designs of the (semi) surfaced shoulder. It appears that the construction of the (semi) surfaced shoulder is often included in large-scale maintenance. Half of the road authorities also reported that the shoulder surfacing is financed from the large-scale maintenance budget. In a few cases the safety budget was used. There is a term of about 15 years for large-scale maintenance for provinces as well as municipalities. If all road authorities could find sufficient budget for shoulder surfacing, this would save more than 30 deaths a year in about 15 years time. These are the results of this study. A cost-benefit analysis showed that these savings are profitable with the investment of € 675 million during 15 years. Much can be learnt from the current experimental projects with (semi) surfaced designs. A successful shoulder approach can serve as an example to other road authorities. SWOV is also extremely pleased with the establishment of the CROW working group 'Safe Shoulder Design' that aims at the non-motorways. Apart from shoulder surfacing, a sufficiently obstacle-free zone is important for reducing the number of shoulder accidents. It there is too little room, a protection device as the WICON comes into picture. It appears that this is hardly ever used, partly because of the heavy design and the costs. It is desirable to see if an adapted construction meets the needs more. Inquiries were made in Sweden about the cable barrier. Since recently, this has been applied in the shoulder as a protection device. We recommend investigating whether this barrier is also suitable for the Dutch situation...|$|E
