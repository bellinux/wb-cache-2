25|$|He {{believed}} that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others. Ford also {{believed that}} union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis {{as a way to}} maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to <b>do</b> <b>right</b> by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E

500|$|A {{motion picture}} soundtrack album for The Commitments, with music {{produced}} by Kevin Killen and Paul Bushnell, {{was released on}} 13 August 1991, by MCA Records. The soundtrack features fourteen songs, most of which appeared in various scenes in the film. Niamh Kavanagh performed as both a lead and backing vocalist in songs such as [...] "Destination Anywhere" [...] and [...] "Do Right Woman, <b>Do</b> <b>Right</b> Man". The soundtrack album was a commercial success, reaching the number one position of the New Zealand Albums Chart. The Commitments was present {{for a total of}} 76 weeks on the Billboard 200, and peaked at number 8 [...] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album [...] "a bit generic", while Robert Christgau called it [...] "a cross between The Big Chill and The Blues Brothers" [...] with performers who [...] "sacrifice idiosyncrasy for competence".|$|E

[...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E

500|$|Instead {{of being}} about Marty's love for Shiloh, {{most of the}} novel occurs in Marty's {{thoughts}} such as when he ponders about telling falsehoods to his parents. Because the book was considered [...] "very internal" [...] by the major film studios, director Dale Rosenbloom labored over making the film more external. Rosenbloom added new characters and scenes to the story and faxed each change to the novel's author. Naylor was neither fearful of Rosenbloom's changes nor unhesitant at suggesting changes. After the film was released, Naylor said that Rosenbloom [...] "did a very good job", and Rosenbloom said, [...] "We did <b>do</b> <b>right</b> by the book and her ... She lives by her code and if you honor it, she appreciates it." [...] By June 1997, Naylor had seen the film six times. In an interview that month, she noted that she was always struck by the hush of the theater and by how the film entrances everyone, even the children.|$|E
500|$|In late 2006, St. John and Howarth {{simultaneously}} began {{contract negotiations}} with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from OLTL, leaving room for Howarth, {{who was with}} the soap opera As the World Turns at the time, to return as Todd. TV Guide sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although {{he was not able}} to comment on contracts, the producers were [...] "doing our best to make sure that we <b>do</b> <b>right</b> by the audience". [...] In 2007, TV Guide received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. [...] The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show's viewers wanted to see Howarth return. [...] Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, [...] "Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John", whose portrayal of Todd he found [...] "very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way".|$|E
500|$|In 1955, Miles Davis {{recorded}} the song with Charles Mingus as bassist. The recording {{for the song}} was filled with tension due to an ongoing conflict between Davis and Mingus, resulting in a charged version of the song. They were assisted by Teddy Charles on vibraphone and Elvin Jones on drums. Another version was recorded by singer Bobby Darin, released in 1961. A psychedelic rock version was recorded in 1965 by 1960s San Francisco rock band The Great Society, with lead vocals from singer Grace Slick, released on their 1968 post-breakup album How it Was. Same year, Marvin Gaye recorded and released his version on the Cole tribute album, A Tribute to the Great Nat [...] "King" [...] Cole.

Abbey Lincoln recorded a version of the song for her 1995 album A Turtle's Dream.

500|$|... "Trust No 1" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter along with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz; it was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode features former leading star David Duchovny via the use of previously shot footage. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode includes themes [...] "about Orwellian surveillance." [...] "Trust No 1" [...] was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in [...] "This is Not Happening"/"DeadAlive". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, [...] "The only thing I thought we didn't <b>do</b> <b>right</b> during seasons eight and nine was {{that a lot of}} the shows were about Mulder, and I thought it was a mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera."

500|$|Months later, {{during an}} April 1988 {{appearance}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump discussed his displeasure with the United States' {{status as a}} [...] "debtor nation" [...] and its seeming inability to compete with Japan.

I just don't think I have the inclination to do it." [...] Furthermore, he asserted that if he ever did run, he would win the election. [...] He later appeared at the 1988 Republican National Convention. [...] In an interview on the floor, NBC News reporter Chris Wallace asked whether Trump's visit to his first national convention would induce him to [...] "take the plunge" [...] into a presidential campaign. [...] In response, Trump downplayed his prior exploration into presidential politics, though repeated that he would win if he ever ran, and praised then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush. [...] During another convention interview on Larry King Live, Trump dismissed the speculation that he had considered running for president and commented, [...] "I doubt I’ll ever be involved in politics beyond what I <b>do</b> <b>right</b> now."

500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to <b>do</b> <b>right</b> by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} sparked criticisms {{from some}} parents {{on social media}} who believed the performance was [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "inappropriate" [...] due to its risqué nature; Melissa Henson, {{a representative of the}} Parents Television Council {{said in a statement that}} the performance was [...] "suggestive" [...] before adding, [...] "We have seen pretty consistently enough inappropriate material , that a lot of parents have written these off." [...] Contrastingly, writing for ThinkProgress, Alyssa Rosenberg said of the controversy: [...] "This may not be the vision of marriage conservatives intended to try to promote [...] if marriage is a product that conservatives desperately want to sell, the smartest thing they could <b>do</b> <b>right</b> now is to hire Beyoncé and Jay-Z as a product spokescouple... they made marriage look fun, and sexy, and a source of mutual professional fulfillment." [...] On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago." [...] On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the DirecTv pre-Super Bowl party. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone referred to the pair's chemistry as the highlight of the event and said the performance was [...] "smiles and hugs and laughs, with one of the most famous rappers in the world gladly playing hypeman" [...] in contrast to the Grammy performance. Nekesa Mumbi Moody writing for the Associated Press felt that it was the set's highlight. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2014, Beyoncé performed [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. The performance featured the singer dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and a singalong from the audience. She started the performance on a set of steps, with numerous dancers in headstands around her and went to the stage afterwards. Nadeska Alexis from MTV News commented that when the song opened, [...] "the crowd really started to lose their composure". Writers of The Hollywood Reporter described the song's performance as [...] "booty-popping".|$|E
