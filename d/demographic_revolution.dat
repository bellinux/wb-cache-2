Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.|$|E

This book delves {{into the heart of}} Georgian Britain to explore the role that {{the men and women of}} the Scottish Borders played in the mass emigration of the early nineteenth century. Although most never departed themselves, their perceptions of wealth, poverty, morality and community shaped the flow of emigrants from the rural south to the wide and expanding British Empire, as well as its North American rival, the United States.

Nonetheless, he explained that:Miss Peters's central thesis is that a substantial immigration of Arabs to Palestine took place during the first half of the twentieth century. She supports this argument with an array of demographic statistics and contemporary accounts, the bulk of which have not been questioned by any reviewer, including Porath.Porath replied with an array of demographic data to support his position. He also wrote that Peters's demographic statistics were inexplicable: ...nowhere in her main text or in the methodological appendices (V and VI) did Mrs. Peters bother to explain to her readers how she managed to break down the Ottoman or Cuinet's figures into smaller units than subdistricts. As far as I know no figures for the units smaller than subdistricts (Nahia; the parallel of the French commune), covering the area of Ottoman Palestine, were ever published.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the causal effect of life expectancy on economic growth by explicitly {{accounting for the}} role of the demographic transition. In addition to focusing on issues of empirical identification, this paper emphasizes the role of the econometric specification. We present a simple theory of the economic and demographic transition where individuals' education and fertility decisions depend on their life expectancy. The theory predicts that before the demographic transition improvements in life expectancy primarily increase population. Improvements in life expectancy do, however, reduce population growth and foster human capital accumulation after the onset of the demographic transition. This implies that the effect of life expectancy on population, human capital and income per capita is not the same before and after the demographic transition. Moreover, a sufficiently high life expectancy is ultimately the trigger of the transition to sustained income growth. We provide evidence supporting these predictions using data on exogenous mortality reductions {{in the context of the}} epidemiological <b>revolution.</b> <b>Demographic</b> Transition; Epidemiological Revolution; Heterogeneous Treatment Effects; Life Expectancy...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{argues that}} {{the rapid expansion of}} international trade in {{the second phase of the}} industrial revolution has played a significant role in the timing of demographic transitions across countries and has thereby been a major determinant of the distribution of world population and a prime cause of the Great Divergence in income per capita across countries in the last two centuries. The theory suggests that international trade affected the evolution of economies asymmetrically. The gains from trade were channeled towards population growth in non- industrial nations while in the industrial nations they were directed towards investment in education and growth in output per capita. International trade enhanced the specialization of industrial economies in the production of skilled intensive goods. The rise in the demand for skilled labor induced an investment in the quality of the population, expediting the demographic transition, stimulating technological progress and further enhancing the comparative advantage of these industrial economies in the production of skilled intensive goods. In non-industrial economies, in contrast, the specialization in the production of unskilled intensive goods that was brought about by international trade reduced the demand for skilled labor and provided limited incentives to invest in population quality. The gains from trade were utilized primarily for an increase in the size of the population. The demographic transition was therefore delayed, increasing further the abundance of unskilled labor in these economies and enhancing their comparative disadvantage in the production of skilled intensive goods. The focus on the interaction between population growth and comparative advantage generates an important new insight regarding the distribution of the gains from trade. The theory suggests that even if trade equalizes output growth of the trading countries, (due to the terms of trade effect), income per capita of developed and less developed economies will diverge since in less developed economies growth of total output will be generated primarily by population growth, whereas in developed economies it will be generated by an increase in output per capita.

40|$|Learning History {{implies the}} {{acquisition}} of historical and social concepts, analyzing its mutual relationships in the explanation of historical change. The comprehension of Industrial Revolution in England {{requires the use of}} at least four main concepts: Agrarian <b>Revolution,</b> <b>Demographic</b> Increase, Technological Innovations and the need of Accumulated Capital. The understanding of these concepts and the establishment of its relationships is a quite demanding cognitive task. Therefore, the crucial role of working memory in these cognitive processes is hypothesized. This paper presents a study on the teaching and learning of this subject matter by first-grade of high school subjects. The main objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the process of understanding and acquisition of this complex subject, testing the influence of three variables: working memory capacity, prior knowledge and attitude for meaningful learning. Pretest examined subject’s knowledge of some basic concepts and their ability to describe and explain the phenomenon, as well as to summarize and comment a text and to represent their knowledge by means of a concept map. Differences in working memory capacity were controlled by means of the reading span test. Finally, subject’s attitude for meaningful learning was tested on line using an observation record. Teaching was developed during 6 classes following the usual scheme and methodology focused on reaching a gradual and overall understanding of the phenomenon. Learning results were checked in a post-test where we used the same test than before. There was a highly significant increase in all the post-test measures. Students with higher reading span learnt more and better than students with lower reading span. Therefore, working memory seems to play a crucial role when our subjects are building up historical knowledge as to Industrial Revolution. The significant correlation between knowledge in pretest and post-test showed that pretest scores are a quite good predictor of posttest ones, as all the cognitive theories held. As to the attitude, its high correlation with both knowledge measures (pre and post-test) bears out our prediction about the relevant role of this variable. Finally the analysis of subjects concept maps in pretest and posttest confirmed an improvement on subjects’ organization of knowledge, increasing its levels of depth and connectivity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract During {{the past}} century, humans have gained {{more years of}} average life {{expectancy}} than in the last 10, 000 years; we are now living in a rapidly ageing world. The sharp rise in life expectancy, coupled to a steady {{decline in birth rates}} in all developed countries, has led to an unprecedented <b>demographic</b> <b>revolution</b> characterized by an explosive growth in the number and proportion of older people. Ageing is a complex process that negatively impacts the development of the immune system and its ability to function. Progressive changes in the T and B cell systems over the life span {{have a major impact on}} the capacity to respond to immune challenge. These cumulative age-associated changes in immune competence are termed Immunosenescence: some immunological parameters are commonly notably reduced in the elderly and, reciprocally good function is tightly correlated to health status. Hence, a better understanding of Immunosenescence and the development of new strategies to counteract it are essential for improving the quality of life of the elderly population. </p...|$|E

We merge data from the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey with community-level data from Chinese censuses {{to examine the relationship between}} cohort- and community-specific sex ratios and women’s partnering behavior. Consistent with demographic-op-portunity theory and sociocultural theory, we find that high sex ratios (indicating more men relative to women) are associated with an increased likelihood that women marry before age 25. However, high sex ratios are also associated with an increased likelihood that women engage in premarital and extramarital sexual relationships and have more than one sexual partner, findings consistent with demographic-opportunity theory but inconsistent with sociocultural theory. A <b>demographic</b> <b>revolution</b> of sorts has been occurring in the People’s Republic of China.

40|$|Western {{countries}} are facing an increasing poverty among seniors {{related to the}} <b>demographic</b> <b>revolution</b> and lengthening of life span. The so-called over-indebtedness {{is one of the}} "modern" causes and also consequences of poverty. This thesis discusses the relationship between over-indebtedness and poverty with emphasis on senior population (65 +). An empiric analysis is employed to explore causes and consequences of over-indebtedness. The increasing over-indebtedness is already being targeted by public policies, however their effectiveness is low. Sufficient material and personal resources are lacking as well as not being optimally utilized. There is only limited cooperation between civil and public-law sectors.
