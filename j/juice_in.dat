5|$|At {{the time}} of Jif's product launch in 1956, it was marketed with the tagline 'Real lemon <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> a Jif'. In 1956, Jif was the sole brand of lemon juice {{packaged}} in a squeeze pack container in the United Kingdom. The new Jif brand used the packaging developed by Edward Hack.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. company Borden {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the ReaLemon brand of lemon <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> the United States in 1962 when it purchased the ReaLemon-Puritan Company for around $12.4 million. ReaLemon had begun production in the U.S. in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers {{was the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the lemon juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E

5|$|The {{institution}} of marriage is stated to have come into existence after he married {{to set an example}} for other humans to follow. His life is also credited by Jains with starting the {{institution of}} charity (daana) from layperson to mendicants, when he received surgarcane <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> his hand from king Sreyamsa, to break his fast. This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E
5|$|The plastic lemon {{container}} {{and the idea}} of marketing lemon <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner's plastic lemon was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for a lemon juice product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design. It is of intrigue to some that both Pugh and Wagner were both former Royal Air Force pilots.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the {{ordinance}} proposal was reported in December 1976, a small ripple of protest spread from local churches. Northwest Baptist Church announced it from the pulpit. The news worried one of the church members named Anita Bryant, who was a 36-year-old singer celebrity. Bryant began her career as a local child star on a television show in Oklahoma City and on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Her young life was marked by frequent moves; her parents divorced each other twice, and she often lived in poverty conditions, but she became a born again Christian at eight years old, and counted her faith and her participation at church as the stabilizing influences in her life. As a child, she asked God to make her a star. She was, by her own admission, remarkably driven and ambitious. In her older teens she became a beauty pageant contestant, winning Miss Oklahoma and second runner-up as Miss America. In 1960, she married a Miami disc jockey named Bob Green and became a professional singer, finding some success with three gold records featuring popular, patriotic, and Gospel standards. She performed with the Bob Hope Christmas tour, entertaining troops serving overseas, and sang at President Lyndon Johnson's funeral in 1973. Since 1969 she had been employed regionally by the Florida Citrus Commission endorsing Florida orange <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> television commercials. She also advertised for Coca-Cola, Tupperware, Kraft Foods and Holiday Inn. Bryant's talent agent was married to Ruth Shack; Bryant had contributed $1,000 to her campaign.|$|E

25|$|The Methodist Church {{has long}} used non-alcoholic wine (grape <b>juice)</b> <b>in</b> {{the sacrament of}} Holy Communion. In 1869, an American Methodist dentist named Thomas Welch {{developed}} a method of pasteurising grape <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> order to produce an unfermented communion wine for his church. He later founded Welch's grape juice company. By the 1880s, this non-alcoholic wine had become commonplace in Methodist churches worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Orange {{juice is}} {{obtained}} by squeezing the fruit {{on a special}} tool (a juicer or squeezer) and collecting the <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> a tray underneath.

25|$|One of {{the controversies}} that beset the Cambodian {{election}} {{before it even}} began {{was the use of}} an ostensibly indelible ink that was used to mark which voters had already voted.

25|$|When a {{winemaker}} {{desires to}} impart more tannin and color to a red wine, {{some of the}} pink juice from the must can be removed {{at an early stage}} in {{what is known as the}} Saign√©e (from French bleeding) method. The red wine remaining in the vats is intensified as a result of the bleeding, because the volume of <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> the must is reduced, and the must involved in the maceration becomes more concentrated. The pink juice that is removed can be fermented separately to produce ros√©.|$|E

Instead of being irrigated, the vineyards are left to the care of the Mediterranean climate and make use of the natural rain and sun. The grapes, which are harvested in late September and October, are crushed and put in barrels together with the <b>juice</b> (<b>in</b> Arabic el romeli) and left to ferment for three weeks. Occasionally the whole mix is stirred to release the CO2.|$|E

25|$|After being sorted, {{washed and}} chopped up, they proceed into large steel vats for preservation/precooking {{and also to}} destroy any {{bacteria}} that could be harmful {{for the rest of}} the processing period as well as for the consumer after production. The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E

25|$|Each of {{the major}} {{communities}} of the municipalities have their annual festival, set {{on the day of}} their patron saint.

Municipality wide there is the annual ‚ÄúLa Molienda‚Äù from the beginning of February to the middle of March. This is related to the harvest of sugar cane although nowadays, there are fewer fields that grow this crop. The tradition includes cutting a cane to extract its <b>juice</b> <b>in</b> a press or mill. With the juice boiled down and the remaining dry cane used as fuel or animal feed. The boiled sugar cane juice is made into a syrup, which is then molded into small pillars called piloncillos.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGrapefruit (Citrus paradisii) and {{shaddock}} (Citrus maxima) <b>juices</b> {{are used}} <b>in</b> folk medicine {{for the management}} of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanism of action by which they exert their therapeutic action is unclear.

Grapefruit juice had higher total phenol and flavonoid contents than shaddock juice, while both juices inhibited ACE activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of the juices to rats fed a high-cholesterol diet caused a significant reduction in plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein‚Äìcholesterol levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein‚Äìcholesterol levels. The inhibition of ACE activity in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo hypocholesterolemic effect of the juices could explain the use of the <b>juices</b> <b>in</b> the management of cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
