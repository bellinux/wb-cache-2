5000|$|A hunting {{sword is}} a type of single-handed short sword that dates to the 12th Century but was used during hunting parties among Europeans from the 17th to the 19th centuries. [...] A hunting sword usually has a straight, single-edged, pointed blade {{typically}} no more than 25 inches long. This sword was used for finishing off game in lieu of using and wasting further shot. Adopted by many Europeans, and in past centuries sometimes worn by military officers as a badge of rank, hunting swords display amazing variety in design. Some hilts featured a thin knuckle-bow to protect the fingers. Others sported a serrated saw edge {{on the back of the}} blade.

40|$|Abstract – Several {{studies have}} clearly {{demonstrated}} {{the capability of}} suitable algorithms based on satellite images to detect fires scars by using optical and radar data. In the near infrared region (0. 7 - 1. 3 micron) green vegetation shows high reflectance values compared to the most other natural surfaces. In general this region of the spectrum contains the most useful information on burned surface detection. After a fire occurs, in fact, a strong reflectance decrease {{can be found in}} the burned area. Generally, in a burned surface, the reflectance falls to a low level (5 - 15 %) because of the presence of ash and carbon over the soil. For this reason the NIR is the more appropriate spectral region for burned areas detection, allowing high contrast between burned and unburned surfaces. Taking the advantage of using the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for mapping forest volume or above ground biomass in big area, within the burned area, this instrument has been used to detect <b>deep</b> <b>fire</b> scars in order to provide more information on the fire event...|$|E
5000|$|Wind {{played a}} key role in volcano {{explanations}} until the 16th century. Lucretius, a Roman philosopher, claimed Etna was completely hollow and the fires of the underground driven by a fierce wind circulating near sea level. Ovid believed that the flame was fed from [...] "fatty foods" [...] and eruptions stopped when the food ran out. Vitruvius contended that sulfur, alum and bitumen fed the <b>deep</b> <b>fires.</b> Observations by Pliny the Elder noted the presence of earthquakes preceded an eruption; he died in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE while investigating it at Stabiae. His nephew, Pliny the Younger gave detailed descriptions of the eruption in which his uncle died, attributing his death to the effects of toxic gases. Such eruptions have been named Plinian in honour of the two authors.|$|R

To God, {{they are}} all in subjection (set devils and men aside) even the very dragons, and all <b>deeps,</b> <b>fire,</b> hail, snow, and vapours (Psa 148:7,8), fulfilling his word. Yea, the winds and seas obey him (Mark 4:41). Thus, I say, by their obedience to God they teach thee obedience, and by their obedience shall thy disobedience be condemned in the judgment (Psa 147:15-18). (b.) Their obedience to thee, also teacheth thee obedience to all superiors; for every kind of beasts, and of birds, and serpents, and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed, and brought into obedience by mankind. Man only remains untamed and unruly, and therefore by these is condemned (James 3:7,8).|$|R
5000|$|Many {{soldiers}} on Napoleonic battlefields were coerced into staying in battle. To overcome their individual inclination to self-preservation {{and to provide}} effective firepower, the infantry regiments fought shoulder-to-shoulder, {{at least two or}} three lines <b>deep,</b> <b>firing</b> in volleys. The officers and non-commissioned officers carried swords and halberds which could be used to keep the infantrymen in the firing line. Should a soldier shirk duty and flee from the field of battle, each army normally had a picket line of cavalry at its rear encouraging the soldier to return to their regiment. To assist with command and control of the infantry, each soldier would wear a colorful military uniform visible from a distance, even through the black-powder clouds hovering over the Napoleonic battlefields. Napoleon himself did not underestimate the importance of morale and said once that, [...] "Moral force rather than numbers decides victory.|$|R

50|$|Cuisine: Tamil Jains are ardent vegetarians. Until {{the turn}} of the 20th century, they were a {{self-sustained}} rural based farming community. They were landowners and used contract labourers for their agricultural activities. Their household included large tracts of land, cattle, and milch cows. They had kitchen gardens growing vegetables for their daily need. Dairy food such as milk, curd, butter and ghee were cooked in house. Daily food was very simple consisting of a brunch with rice, cooked lentils (paruppu), ghee, vegetable sambar, curd, sun dried pickles of mango, lemon or citron, deep fried sun dried 'crispies' (vadavam) made from rice pie. Evening snacks of <b>deep</b> <b>fired</b> lentil preparations and before sunset dinner consisting either idli, dosa or rice with buttermilk and lentil chutney (thogaiyal). While seniors, people undergoing religious fast and ardent followers of religious principles avoided garlic, onions and tubers in their daily food, these were occasionally used by others in the household.|$|R

The gun elevation and traverse ranges are -1° to +70° vertically and −85° to +85° horizontally. The initial deployment time and the redeployment times are each less than 30 seconds. The system provides precision strike and high sustained firepower for support and for <b>deep</b> <b>firing</b> operations with more than 25 t of ammunition per gun and 24-hour operation. The howitzer has a continuous fire rate of 75 rounds per hour, an intensive fire rate of 20 rounds (i.e., a full magazine) in 2.5 minutes (effective rate, 480 per hour), and a salvo fire rate of three rounds in 15 seconds (effective rate, 720 per hour). The MRSI capability, multiple round simultaneous impact, is up to 6 rounds. Direct-sighting can be used for target ranges up to 2,000m.|$|R

6000|$|Consider, again, another {{wonderful}} {{proof of}} God's goodness {{in what we}} call the Tides of the sea. God has made the waters so, that they can never stand still--the sea is always moving. Twice a day it rises, and twice a day it sinks and ebbs again all along the shore. It would take too long to explain why this is--but it is enough to say, that it must be so, from the way in which God has made the earth and the water. So that it did not come from accident. God planned and intended it all when He made the sea at first. His all-foreseeing love settled it all. Now of what use are these tides? They keep the sea from rotting, by keeping it in a perpetual stir. And the sea, as it ebbs and flows, draws the air after it, and so keeps the air continually moving and blowing, therefore continually fresh, and continually carrying in it rich food for plants from one country to another. There are other reasons why the winds blow, which I have not time to mention now; but they all go to prove the same thing.--How wisely and well the Psalmist said, [...] "Praise the Lord upon earth ye rivers and all <b>deeps.</b> <b>Fire</b> and hail, snow and vapour, wind and storm, fulfilling His word" [...] (Ps. cxlviii.).|$|R
