High quality imaging and chemical analysis are used to study the kinetic process. The in situ electrical test is integrated into the TEM to provide an elevated electrical field to the dielectrics.

In this way, semi-finished metal sheets with sensor and actuator functions can be produced in high-volume production. In further forming steps, these semi-finished products can be formed into complex 3 D structural parts, which is not readily possible with conventional piezoelectric patch transducers. Ensuring the component function of the piezoceramic parts {{in the form of}} parallel <b>interconnected</b> <b>lead</b> zirconate titanate (PZT) fibers is a key aspect during the forming process.

For this purpose, experimental tests are carried out using fabricated test samples and supplemented by numerical studies. Integrated fibers are visually inspected for cracks and fractures as well as checked for their functionality. Additional tests determine the load limits of the fibers by incrementally increasing the forming force until the impedance signal fails.

An eight-site probe for simultaneous neural recording and stimulation has been designed that includes on-chip amplifiers that can be individually bypassed, allowing direct access to the iridium sites for electrical stimulation. The on-probe ampli-fiers have a gain of 38. 9 dB, an upper-cutoff frequency of 9. 9 kHz, and an input-referred noise of 9. 2 V rms integrated from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. The low-frequency cutoff of the amplifier is tunable to allow the recording of field potentials and minimize stimulus arti-fact. The amplifier consumes 68 W from 1 5 V supplies and oc-cupies 0. 177 mm 2 in 3 m features. In vivo recordings have shown that the preamplifiers can record single-unit activity 1 ms after the onset of stimulation on sites as close as 20 m to the stimulating electrode. A second neural recording array has been developed which multiplexes 32 neural signals onto four output data leads. Providing gain on this array eliminates the need for bulky head-mounted circuitry and reduces motion artifacts. The time-division multiplexing circuitry has crosstalk between consecutive channels of less than 6 % at a sample rate of 20 kHz per channel.

The scaling of the effect with current and temperature is used for accelerated testing and predictive analysis. Despite the great technological relevance of such measurements, there exists no widely used protocol to characterize electromigration. However, certain approaches are somewhat established, such as the variation of current and temperature. One of the unresolved challenges of electromigration are self-amplification effects of electromigration through self-heating at defects in <b>interconnect</b> <b>leads.</b> The local temperature rise due to current crowding across such defects {{is typically}} unknown. Since the underlying processes are typically thermally activated, the lack of precise knowledge of the local temperature makes the field of electromigration studies challenging, resulting in a lack of reproducibility and inter-comparability of different experimental approaches. A combination with in-situ temperature measurement is therefore desirable.There are numerous methods for thermometry and the measurement of thermal conductance of devices and structures on a length scale of microns to macroscopic. However, the quantitative thermal characterization of nanostructures is described as an unsolved challenge in the current scientific literature. Several methods have been proposed using Raman spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, infrared microscopy, self-heating methods and scanning thermal microscopy. However, on the length scale relevant to single CNTs and their defects, i. e. the 1 nm-scale, no established solution exists applicable to CNT-based materials (our interconnects) and dielectrics (our insulators and matrix materials). Scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and thermometry [...] is the most promising technique for its versatility, but restrictions in tip fabrication, operation modes and signal sensitivity have limited the resolutions to 10 nm in the most cases. To increase the resolution of such technique is an open challenge which is attracting lot of attention from the industry and scientific community.|$|R
