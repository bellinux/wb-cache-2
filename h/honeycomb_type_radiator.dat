40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of {{a series}} of hexadehydrotribenzo[12]annulene (DBA) derivatives has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the liquid/solid interface in the absence and presence of nanographene guests. In the absence of appropriate guest molecules, DBA derivatives with short alkoxy chains form two-dimensional (2 D) porous <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> patterns, whereas those with long alkoxy chains form predominantly dense-packed linear type patterns. Added nanographene molecules adsorb in the pores of the existing 2 D porous <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> patterns or, more interestingly, they even convert the guest-free dense-packed linear-type patterns into guest-containing 2 D porous <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> patterns. For the DBA derivative with the longest alkoxy chains (OC 20 H 41), the pore size, which depends on the length of the alkoxy chains, reaches 5. 4 nm. Up to a maximum of six nanographene molecules can be hosted in the same cavity for the DBA derivative with the OC 20 H 41 chains. The host matrix changes its structure in order to accommodate the adsorption of the guest clusters. This flexibility arises from the weak intermolecular interactions between interdigitating alkoxy chains holding the honeycomb structure together. Diverse dynamic processes have been observed {{at the level of the}} host matrix and the coadsorbed guest molecules. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Composites {{are formed}} by a {{connection}} {{of two or}} more types of different materials what provides a specific combination of properties not existing in particular source materials. An interesting thing of composite technologies is a possibility to design their structures to obtain required directional properties. For this reason composites are widely used now and their development trend is strong. The <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> laminates belong to such group of composites. They consist of the honeycomb cells core covered by thin layers of different materials on both sides what results in their low weight and great mechanical resistance against mechanical charges. These composites are often used in space and aviation equipment, cars, boats and yachts. The separation of covering from the core cracks in covering and defects of core are their typical defects. An experimental testing method for detection of defects in different <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> composites by the infrared thermography is presented in the paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|Excellent sensing {{performance}} for CO gas is demonstrated using inexpensive sensor devices based on <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> ZnO nanostructures, fabricated by colloidal lithography and lift-off process. This newly proposed method for gas sensors is cost effective and provides significant enhancement of both sensitivity and selectivity of CO detection. <b>Honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> ZnO nano films developed in similar to 21 nm ZnO layer consisting of 1 mu m period hexagonal lattice of air-holes with diameter varying from similar to 600 - 900 nm are investigated for CO sensing. These structures are fabricated {{by a combination}} of self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) spheres, their size reduction by oxygen plasma and magnetron-sputtering of ZnO followed by PS mask removal. The hole diameter and hence the width of ZnO honeycomb walls are determined by size reduction of PS spheres. Fabricated ZnO <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> sensors show superior sensing performance compared to planar ZnO films, and response as high as similar to 81. 2 % at 300 degrees C for a 3 ppm CO with a detection resolution of 500 ppb and response and recovery times of similar to 180 and similar to 210 s, respectively, were obtained. The repeatability of the observed results is confirmed and in addition, the CO selectivity is shown for gas mixtures consisting of CH 4, H 2 S, CO 2, NO 2, SO 2 and H- 2. The developed nanostructuring method is generic and can be adapted for improving performance of other metal-oxide based gas sensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{considers}} filling of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> cores with foam to produce sandwich constructions. The {{potential benefits of}} this approach are enhancement of damage resistance, and ability to process <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> sandwich structures through cost-effective {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} molding (VARTM). As weight penalty is incurred in complete filling of honeycomb cells with foam, an alternative approach to reduce weight is partial filling of the cells, without losing the advantage of VARTM processing of the core. Two cores are considered, a polyurethane foam for full filling of honeycomb cells, and syntactic foam for partial filling, in conjunction with carbon–epoxy facesheets. Their impact response was investigated under low and high velocity impact (LVI and HVI respectively). For both cores, the foam filling was found to provide confinement to the cells. The resistance to penetration, energy absorbed and damage modes in LVI and HVI were a function of core stiffness, extent of filling and number of facesheet plies. The results illustrate that partial syntactic foam filled sandwich plate (with reduced weight penalty in comparison to full filling) can provide LVI response improvement in the order of 56 % increase in peak load, and for HVI about 74 % improvement in ballistic limit.

30|$|Dissection and {{microscopic}} examination exhibited that <b>honeycomb</b> <b>type</b> aerenchyma, {{characterized by the}} irregular and large air spaces, was observed in the shoots of A. ulvaceus (Fig.  2 c, d). Freshly cut transverse sections of leaf midrib revealed that {{a large proportion of}} the cellular volume is occupied by an air-filled lacunae system (Fig.  2 d). Parenchyma cells that surround the lacunae and at least seven vascular bundles occupied the remaining cellular volume. The same midrib cross section showed the presence of small hexagonal diaphragm cells in some of the lacunae (Fig.  2 e). Together, these results demonstrate the successful adaptation of A. ulvaceus to a submerged aquatic environment, as anatomical modifications of the shoot such as the existence of air-filled aerenchyma, the extensive lacunae system and cellular diaphragms are evident.|$|R
