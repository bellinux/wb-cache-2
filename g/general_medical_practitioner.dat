60|$|Now the {{schoolmaster}} is not {{to blame}} for this {{any more than he}} is to blame for sticking to Latin. It is no more possible for schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, whose lives are encumbered with a voluminous mass of low-grade mental toil and worries and reasonable and unreasonable responsibilities, to find the energy and mental freedom necessary to make any vital changes in the methods that text-books, traditions, and examinations force upon them, than it is for a <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> to invent and make out of the native ore the steel implements some operation of frequent occurrence in his practice may demand. If they are made, and accessible by purchase and not too expensive, he will get them; if they are not he will have to fumble along with the next best thing; and if nothing that is any good can be got, then there is nothing for it, though he be the noblest character, the finest intelligence that ever lived behind a brass plate, but either to shirk that operation altogether or to run the chance of making a disastrous mess of it.|$|E

40|$|Background: An {{association}} between oral {{conditions such as}} periodontal diseases and systemic conditions is noted. As such, periodontal disease is {{associated with an increased}} risk of systemic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy outcome, atherosclerosis, stroke and hospital acquired pneumonia. The concept of diagnosing and treating a potential patient to minimize the deleterious effects of this chronic infectious and inflammatory condition on systemic conditions represents both an unprecedented challenge and opportunity to our profession. Keeping this in view, the present survey was designed to evaluate the acquaintance, orientation and behavior of <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> practitioners; concerning the effects of periodontal disease on systemic health. Materials and Methods: A typed questionnaire carrying four sets of questions was distributed among <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> of seven different government and private medical colleges and hospitals. Questionnaire was developed to assess the acquaintance, orientation and behavior of <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> toward periodontal disease. Results: Most of the respondents have knowledge regarding the signs and symptoms of periodontal disease and its association with cardiovascular disease. However, majority of them do not know about the potential effect of periodontal disease on other organ systems. Conclusion: <b>General</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> have inadequate knowledge regarding periodontal diseases.

40|$|Background: Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is a significant}} public health problem. Prudent use of antibiotics is crucial in reducing this resistance. Acute bronchitis is a common reason for consultations with <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners,</b> and antibiotics are often prescribed even though guidelines recommend not prescribing them for uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Objective: To analyse the antibiotic prescription patterns of South African (SA) <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> {{in the treatment of}} acute bronchitis. Methods: The 2013 claims for members of 11 health insurance schemes were analysed to assess antibiotic prescription patterns for patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The patterns were assessed by type of bronchitis, chronic health status of the patients, sex and age group. The types of antibiotic prescribed were also analysed. Results: Of 166 821 events analysed, an antibiotic was prescribed in more than half (52. 9 %). There were significant differences by type of bronchitis and chronic health status. Patients with viral bronchitis {{were more likely to be}} prescribed an antibiotic than those with bacterial bronchitis (odds ratio (OR) 1. 17, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 08 - 1. 26). Patients with a chronic illness were less likely to be prescribed an antibiotic than those without (OR 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 57 - 0. 60). More than 70 % of the antibiotics prescribed were cephalosporins, penicillins and other beta-lactams. Conclusions: Prescription rates of antibiotics for acute bronchitis by SA <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> are high. There is an urgent need to follow the guidelines for antibiotic use for acute bronchitis to reduce the likelihood of increasing resistance to available antibiotics. IS...|$|R

40|$|Background: Bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), is a rare, yet significant, {{adverse effect}} of bisphosphonate therapy. A {{multidisciplinary}} {{approach to the}} prevention of BRONJ is recommended due to the difficulties in treating the condition and the significant morbidity associated with a diagnosis. Current evidence suggests that practitioners have limited knowledge of the condition and that preventative strategies are frequently not implemented. Objective: To explore the attitudes and perceptions of <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> and community pharmacists, on the risks and preventative strategies {{for the development of}} bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw. Design: Qualitative interview study Participants: 8 community pharmacists and 7 <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Setting: Primary Care in the North East and Cumbria. Methods: Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim; a grounded theory approach, with constant comparison, concurrent data collection and analysis was utilised. Framework analysis was used to focus and develop emerging concepts. Results: 4 inter-related themes emerged: (1) Uncertain knowledge – limited exposure to BRONJ, awareness of the implications of a diagnosis, risk factors and preventative strategies. (2) Patient specific – complexity of patients, patient education and prioritising aspects of care. (3) Wider context – Lack of communication and referral processes between professions, work loading pressures, access and patient receptivity to dental services. (4) Professional – Professional roles and responsibilities, authority and educational initiatives Conclusions: Current practice does not facilitate collaborative care in the prevention of BRONJ. Strategies to improve interprofessional prevention involving pharmacists, <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners,</b> dentists and patients are required to reduce the incidence of BRONJ...|$|R
