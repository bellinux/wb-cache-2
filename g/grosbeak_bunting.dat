50|$|The Wilkins's finch (Nesospiza wilkinsi), {{also known}} as Wilkins's bunting or the <b>grosbeak</b> <b>bunting,</b> is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is {{restricted}} to Inaccessible Island (subspecies dunnei) and Nightingale Island (nominate wilkinsi) of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. Its natural habitats are temperate shrubland and subantarctic grassland.|$|E
5000|$|Sailing from London for the Southern Ocean on 17 September 1921, {{the ship}} reached South Georgia on 4 January 1922 while {{preparing}} to enter Antarctic waters. The following night Shackleton, {{the commander of}} the expedition, died aboard the vessel while she was at anchor in Grytviken. This ended all prospects of the expedition's carrying out its original program of exploring the Antarctic coastline of Enderby Land. [...] Led by Frank Wild, Quest carried out a desultory survey of the Weddell Sea area before returning to the South Atlantic. Quest touched the Tristan da Cunha archipelago in early May, and at Inaccessible Island, ornithologist Hubert Wilkins took type specimens of the <b>grosbeak</b> <b>bunting.</b>|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} on a small {{collection}} of birds from the Tristan da Cunha group and Gough Island in the southern Atlantic Ocean made by Mr. N. SCHEER, Officer in Charge of the Weather Station at Tristan da Cunha in the years 1958 — 1960. The collection consists of 13 specimens from Tristan, 23 from Nightingale Island and 7 from Inaccessible Island, as well as 7 from Gough Island. A total of 22 species is represented. Field records by Mr. SCHEER {{have been added to}} the report; local names of most of the species, as noticed by Mr. SCHEER, have been given in quotation marks. Considering the recent publications on the birds of these islands (BROEKHUYSEN & MACNAE, 1949; HAGEN, 1952; RAND, 1955; ELLIOTT, 1957) the collection contributes hardly any new facts to the knowledge of this interesting insular fauna. Still it contains members of any of the known species of land birds, including one specimen of the remarkable Inaccessible Island Flightless Rail (Atlantisia rogersi) and two of the rare <b>Grosbeak</b> <b>Bunting</b> from Nightingale Island (Nesospiza wilkinsi winkinsi); only the <b>Grosbeak</b> <b>Bunting</b> from Inaccessible Island (N. w. dunnei) is lacking in the collection. Both the most abundant bird species in the islands (Great Shearwater, Puffinus gravis: probably at least two million breeding pairs, according to ROWAN, Ibis, 94, 1952, p. 97 - 121), and the scarcest (<b>Grosbeak</b> <b>Bunting,</b> Nesospiza wilkinsi: probably less than 100 breeding pairs, according to ELLIOTT, 1957) are represented in the collection by a few specimens...|$|E

The deer population, which was extirpated by 1895, has rebounded since re-introduction by park ranger Arthur Woody during the 1930s. Over 100 {{species of birds}} inhabit or migrate through the area, including native songbirds such as the Canada warbler, Blackburnian, black-throated blue, black-throated green and chestnut-sided warblers. Also found are hawks, owls, woodpeckers, kinglets, thrushes, vireos, cuckoos, phoebes, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, brown creepers, wrens, tanagers, <b>grosbeaks,</b> indigo <b>buntings</b> and red crossbills. Migratory species are present during the late spring and early fall, making the area popular among birdwatchers The creeks surrounding the lake are rich with species of salamanders.|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of a grand evolutionary experiment are evident throughout Nebraska. During the Pleistocene, many taxa were apparently separated into eastern and western populations. Today many of these eastern and western counterparts meet in the Great Plains, especially in Nebraska. Some pairs now hybridize freely (towhees. orioles. flickers), while others do not (<b>buntings,</b> <b>grosbeaks,</b> meadowlarks) (see Rising 1983). The Marsh Wren is still another, previously unrecognized, taxon that consists of an eastern and western counterpart. Data from Nebraska and elsewhere in North America {{suggest that there are}} two forms of the Marsh Wren, perhaps as vocally different from each other as are the two Sternella meadowlarks. These two forms meet in Nebraska, and are perhaps sufficiently different and distinct that they should be called two separate species...|$|R

40|$|Cedar Point Biological Station was {{established}} in 1975 at a site approximately one mile below Kingsley Dam in Keith County, Nebraska. Since that time, summer ornithology classes have been periodically offered beginning in 1977 when it was taught by Dr. Stephen Fretwell. A variety of ornithologists have kept records of the summer birds of the area. Beginning in 1970, when he first visited the area, the senior author has accumulated {{a large amount of}} data covering all seasons of the year, which form the primary basis for the seasonal information in this paper. In addition, much information was contributed by C. Fred Zeillemaker from late 1977 to early 1982, when he was Manager at nearby Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Other contributors include: Charles Brown, Craig Faanes, Don Mahoney, Dorothy and Mark Rasche, and Melly Zeillemaker. Because of the unusual diversity of terrestrial and aquatic habitats within the rather circumscribed area of Lake McConaughy and adjoining localities, it is of special interest to ornithologists. Furthermore, the area is essentially {{in the middle of the}} east-west faunal transition zone in the Great Plains, so that a number of closely related species-pairs (<b>buntings,</b> <b>grosbeaks,</b> tanagers, orioles, et al.) are represented. Finally the annual concentration of biologists at Cedar Point makes it desirable that a comprehensive bird list for the area be prepared. The following is largely limited to the North Platte River Valley from Oshkosh east to the vicinity of Keystone as indicated in Figure 1. Major birding areas include the Oshkosh sewage lagoons, the Lewellen area, Ash Hollow State Historical Park, Clear Creek State Game Management Area, Lake McConaughy, Lake Ogallala, Keystone Lake, and Cedar Point Biological Station. Except where otherwise indicated, the observations are those of the authors...|$|R
60|$|The Limits of the Palæarctic Region.--The {{boundaries}} of this region, as nearly {{as they can}} be ascertained, are shown on our general map {{at the beginning of this}} chapter, but it will be evident on consideration, that, except in a few places, its limits can only be approximately defined. On the north, east, and west it extends to the ocean, and includes a number of islands whose peculiarities will be pointed out in a subsequent chapter; so that the southern boundary alone remains, but as this runs across the entire continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, often traversing little-known regions, we may perhaps never be able to determine it accurately, even if it admits of such determination. In drawing the boundary line across Africa we meet with our first difficulty. The Euro-Asiatic animals undoubtedly extend to the northern borders of the Sahara, while those of tropical Africa come up to its southern margin, the desert itself forming a kind of sandy ocean between them. Some of the species on either side penetrate and even cross the desert, but it is impossible to balance these with any accuracy, and it has therefore been thought best, as a mere matter of convenience, to consider the geographical line of the tropic of Cancer to form the boundary. We are thus enabled to define the Palæarctic region as including all north temperate Africa; and, a similar intermingling of animal types occurring in Arabia, the same boundary line is continued to the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Persia and Afghanistan undoubtedly belong to the Palæarctic region, and Baluchistan should probably go with these. The boundary in the north-western part of India is again difficult to determine, but it {40} cannot be far one way or the other from the river Indus as far up as Attock, opposite the mouth of the Cabool river. Here it will bend to the south-east, passing a little south of Cashmeer, and along the southern slopes of the Himalayas into East Thibet and China, at heights varying from 9,000 to 11,000 feet according to soil, aspect, and shelter. It may, perhaps, be defined as extending to the upper belt of forests as far as coniferous trees prevail; but the temperate and tropical faunas are here so intermingled that to draw any exact parting line is impossible. The two faunas are, however, very distinct. In and above the pine woods there are abundance of warblers of northern genera, with wrens, numerous titmice, and a great variety of <b>buntings,</b> <b>grosbeaks,</b> bullfinches and rosefinches, all more or less nearly allied to the birds of Europe and Northern Asia; while a little lower down we meet with a host of peculiar birds allied to those of tropical Asia and the Malay Islands, but often of distinct genera. There can be no doubt, therefore, of the existence here of a pretty sharp line of demarkation between the temperate and tropical faunas, though this line will be so irregular, owing to the complex system of valleys and ridges, that in our present ignorance of much of the country it cannot be marked in detail on any map.|$|R
