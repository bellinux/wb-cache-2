5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand–Edgeworth {{models with}} {{strictly}} convex costs. Francis Edgeworth developed {{the analysis of}} the model of Bertrand competition in a setting where firms had constant marginal cost up to capacity. Dixon explored <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be generalized to the case of convex costs. He established the existence of a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, and of an Epsilon-equilibrium in a large market, and in other aspects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} , Data beams Picard off an enemy ship before {{destroying}} it, sacrificing himself and saving {{the captain and}} crew of the Enterprise. However, Data previously copied his core memories into B-4, his lost brother who is introduced in the movie. This {{was done with the}} reluctant help of Geordi La Forge who voiced concerns about <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> cause B-4 to be nothing more than an exact duplicate of Data.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} patches are moved {{to the rear of the}} cell by direct attachment to the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanism for <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be achieved is unclear, since, when glycolipids or GPI-bound proteins (in the outer monolayer of the cell's surface bilayer) are crosslinked, they cap, just like any surface protein. As these molecules cannot themselves interact directly with the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton, this scheme seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Eliade {{provided}} {{two distinct}} explanations {{for not having}} met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the Gestapo, and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend. Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the Israeli magazine Toladot, who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the Final Solution in Romania and of <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> affect Sebastian (see Holocaust in Romania). In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could {{have contributed to the}} clash between the two literary figures.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} literary themes connected with the figure of Circe was her ability to change men into animals. There was much speculation concerning <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be, whether the human consciousness changed at the same time, and even {{whether it was a}} change for the better. In the first century CE, Plutarch took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his Moralia is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human. They then engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} of the crisis, al-Mu'tazz was {{concerned}} with portraying himself as the legitimate caliph. He had been proclaimed as heir-apparent during his father's lifetime, and according to the succession arrangements he should have become caliph after the death of al-Muntasir. When he had signed away his rights to the caliphate in 862, he had been under duress to do so, with the Turks threatening to kill him if he refused, and therefore he considered the deed of abdication to be void. He also sought to convince the people that they could switch their allegiance to him without breaking the oath they had taken to serve al-Musta'in, and went through the effort to explain in detail <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be done in a letter to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah.|$|E
25|$|Oedipus summons {{the blind}} prophet Tiresias for help. When Tiresias arrives {{he claims to}} know the answers to Oedipus's questions, but refuses to speak, instead telling him to abandon his search. Oedipus is enraged by Tiresias' refusal, and {{verbally}} accuses him of complicity in Laius' murder. Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer ("You yourself are the criminal you seek"). Oedipus cannot see <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon {{in an attempt to}} undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself is blind. Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche {{not so much as a}} result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of testing}} the {{implosion}} device {{was brought up}} in discussions at Los Alamos in January 1944, and attracted enough support for Oppenheimer to approach Groves. Groves gave approval, but he had concerns. The Manhattan Project had {{spent a great deal of}} money and effort to produce the plutonium and he wanted to know whether there would be a way to recover it. The Laboratory's Governing Board then directed Norman Ramsey to investigate <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be done. [...] In February 1944 Ramsey proposed a small-scale test in which the explosion was limited in size by reducing the number of generations of chain reactions, and that it take place inside a sealed containment vessel from which the plutonium could be recovered.|$|E
500|$|A draft Bribery Bill was {{announced}} in the 2002 Queen's Speech, but {{was rejected by the}} joint committee examining it. A second consultation paper was issued in 2005 examining the committee's concerns, before the government announced in March that [...] "there was broad support for reform of the current law, but there was no consensus as to <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be achieved". Following a white paper in March 2009, the Bribery Bill, based on the Law Commission's 2008 report Reforming Bribery, {{was announced}} in the Queen's Speech. Initially given all-party support after its introduction by Jack Straw in 2009, the Bill was, according to The Guardian, subject to an attempted filibuster by Members of Parliament from the Conservative Party. This followed pressure from the Confederation of British Industry, who worried that the Bill in its original form would hamper the competitiveness of British industry.|$|E
500|$|Starting at the {{beginning}} of July 1992, Gaven appeared in a new musical called The Who's Tommy at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. It was based on the rock opera album Tommy by The Who. Gaven starred as Mrs. Walker, the mother of the boy Tommy who is traumatized when he sees his father murder Mrs. Walker's new boyfriend. Tommy ultimately becomes non-responsive, leading people to believe that he is deaf, mute, and blind, and his parents try to find a cure for his condition. Gaven later told TheaterWeek that she initially did not want to do the musical, since she [...] "had no idea <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be staged as a theatrical piece. I hoped my agents wouldn't call me and ask me to audition." [...] However, they did, and she was cast as Mrs. Walker after an audition in which she sang the song [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] that she performed in Chess, also a rock musical. The Who's Tommy was La Jolla Playhouse's biggest success yet and as a result its run was lengthened by several weeks. Later that year, Gaven once again played Doris in Here's Love—this time in a Theatre Under The Stars production.|$|E
