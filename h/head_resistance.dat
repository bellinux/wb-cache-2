2500|$|Before {{construction}} {{began an}} experimental section was constructed. This {{used a variety}} of construction techniques: one end used hollow timber spars, the centre frame used a combination of timber and aluminium, while the other end used aluminium only. Although wood proved the most satisfactory, the Admiralty preferred metal. In late 1909 duralumin became available, and it was decided to use this new alloy, which would allow a considerable weight saving while also forming a stronger structure. The hull was made up of [...] 40 twelve-sided transverse frames spaced [...] apart: some of which were cross-braced by wires, dividing the structure into 17 bays of irregular length, varying from 12.5ft to 37.5ft (3.8m to 11.4m). The frames were connected by 12 longitudinal girders and a triangular section keel below the main structure. The hull shape was based on work by the American aerodynamicist Albert Zahm, and its <b>head</b> <b>resistance</b> was claimed to be 40% of that of contemporary Zeppelins. [...] A fully streamlined shape had been proposed, but was rejected by the Admiralty as being too difficult to construct. It was not until 1917/18 that a truly streamlined airship, the R80, was constructed.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{requirement}} of a cooling radiator {{is that it}} shall dissipate heat; and for cooliug the engines of aircraft {{it is essential that}} the <b>head</b> <b>resistance</b> shalI be low. But both heat transfer and <b>head</b> <b>resistance</b> are greatly affected not only by the speed of air past the cooling surfaces, but by the character of the flow-whether the air passes through the radiator in smooth streams, or with eddies and vortices. If the flow is turbulent, the questions arise whether the turbulence can be increased by changes in construction, and if so whether the result is beneficial or harmful to the general performance of the radiator. This report presents experimental evidence bearing on the problem, and presents some conclusions based on that evidence.|$|E

Two <b>head</b> smut <b>resistance</b> QTL were identified, located on Chromosome 2 (q 2. 09 HR) and Chromosome 5 (q 5. 03 HR), q 2. 09 HR is co-localized with a previously reported QTL for <b>head</b> smut <b>resistance,</b> and the effect of q 5. 03 HR has been validated in backcross populations.

50|$|Effects of {{turbulence}} upon radiator performance: {{in considering}} such effects, {{it is necessary}} to bear in mind the importance of the quantity of air flowing through the core, and the fact that at a given speed of flight rather widely different amounts of air flow through different radiators. The comparisons made in this report were based on a given airflow through the core, but speed of flight is the proper basis for comparing ihe general performance characteristics of a radiator. Any form of construction that imparts additional turbulence to the air may be expected to increase the resistance to flow of air and consequently to decrease the flow through the radiator for a given flying speed, {{while at the same time}} increasing the <b>head</b> <b>resistance.</b> If, then, there is to be a gain in general performimce, any device for producing turbulence must, by increasing the amount of cooling surface, or by causing the air to scour the surface more thoroughly, or both, increase the heat transfer enough to overbalance both the decrease in amount of air flow (which tends to decrease the heat transfer), and the increase in <b>head</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is {{noticeable}} that at {{the higher}} speeds the flat plate and square cell types show much higher figure of merit {{than the other two}} types, although at a speed of 20 miles per hour the type with spiral vanes would perhaps be better than any of the others. The figures of merit as drawn apply only to radiators mounted in ‘unobstructed’ positions, such that the flow of air through and around them is practicably unaffected by other parts of the aircraft. For use in such positions at high speeds, every form of turbulence device known to this bureau is detrimental to the general performance of the radiator. On the other hand, if the radiator is to be used in such a position as the nose of the fuselage, the airflow through it at best is low, and an increase in airflow is accompanied by an increase in <b>head</b> <b>resistance</b> of the combination of fuselage and radiator. In this case, heat must be transmitted as rapidly as possible to the small amount of air that does flow through, and it may be profitable to use turbulence devices. It is possible that the rate of heat transfer for the whole radiator may be increased, while added air resistance of the core may actually reduce the <b>head</b> <b>resistance</b> of the fuselage and radiator.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the [...] "ugliest" [...] dirigibles ever made, production Coastals looked very similar, but used a bespoke gondola with canvas sides built over a wooden frame. The trilobe envelope allowed the gondola to be hung closer to the envelope, reducing the overall height of the aircraft and slightly reducing <b>head</b> <b>resistance.</b> Four ballonets, two in each of the two lower lobes, were used to maintain the envelope's shape and pressure. These were kept inflated by a metal air scoop mounted in the slipstream of the forward propeller on earlier examples, and at the rear propeller on later versions. The nose of the envelope was made of aluminium sheet reinforced with bamboo canes to prevent it deforming due to the airflow pressure as the airship moved. Three tailfins were used. The two upper ones were mounted in a shallow V-tail configuration and carried the elevators, while the single vertical fin below the envelope incorporated a rudder. Ten main suspensions were incorporated in the Coastal envelope, of which seven supported the weight of the gondola, and the remaining three took the guys that allowed the 196 ft (60 m)-long airships to be handled on the ground. No landing gear was fitted, apart from two wooden skids {{at either end of the}} gondola which also protected the propellers.|$|E

Furthermore, {{in order to continue}} to increase drive capacities, new read-write head technologies(vertical recording and TGMR heads) are demanding innovative preampli&# 64257;er circuitsolutions. Today's production preampli&# 64257;ers possess a wide band response of 2. 5 MHz- 600 MHz; however next generation preampli&# 64257;ers willrequire response greater than 250 KHz- 1 GHz. Low corner frequencies below 250 KHz present read recovery (sleep-to-read, write-to-read, etc) challenges which can limit drive capacity. This project targets a > 2 Gb/s TGMR (tunneling giantmagneto-resistive) read path for verticalrecording HDDs.

40|$|This article {{describes}} aerodynamic losses of damping, or aerodynamic instability, which we observe in experiments and in engineering practice. As applied to industrial high-voltage lines {{this phenomenon is}} usually called galloping (dancing) of phase line wires. This phenolmenon {{can be explained by}} Lyapunov’s instability of equilibrium state of wires profile (cross-section). In addition to known condition of Grauert-den-Hartog’s instability there was obtained practical condition of instability, which depends only on stationary aerodynamic profile’s factor – dimensionless coefficient of <b>head</b> <b>resistance</b> and lift coefficient, and also on their derivative with respect to the angle of attack. There was suggested an effective numerical-analytical method of investigation of stability for equilibrium of profile’s state in flow, which was developed at the department “Applied mathematics” of Bauman MSTU. This method allows to determine the stationary aerodynamics characteristics of profile by numerical simulation of profile flow under different angles of attack by vortex element method and later on the application of analytical conditions of stability and Lyapunov’s instability of equilibrium positions. The obtained results during the investigation of rhombic and square profiles stability, as well as general profile of iced wire, and their comparisons with the known experiments’ results in aerodynamic tubes indicate the precision of developed methods and algorithms. The usage of mesh-free Lagrange method of vortex elements and software for their realization allows to solve also dual problems of aerohydroelasticity and to carry out direct numerical simulation of profile movement in flow.
