In the European Parliament, the EDP and ELDR Europarties formed the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the party, {{along with}} Italy's Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy, {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the <b>European</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> intended to be home to all those Christian democrats and centrists who were disillusioned with the new course of the European People's Party, which had welcomed the Rally for the Republic and later the UMP. With the exit of the most conservative, Christian-democratic and conservative-liberal components of the UDF in 1998 and 2002, the UDF was now more of a centrist party with socially liberal tendencies.|$|E

Rutelli's own group, {{composed}} of Paolo Gentiloni, Roberto Giachetti, Renzo Lusetti, Ermete Realacci, Gianni Vernetti, Luigi Lusi, Rino Piscitello, Maurizio Fistarol and Riccardo Villari. This group was {{supportive of the}} idea of forming a 'Democratic Party' with DS, but they wanted to model it on the United States Democratic Party and for this reason they supported the foundation of the <b>European</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> Many Rutelliani, including Francesco Rutelli himself, eventually left the Democratic Party in order to found the [...] Alliance for Italy on 11 November 2009.|$|E

50|$|The {{team was}} formed in Taormina (Italy) during the XVII European Congress of Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Parties,</b> between 9 and 12 December 1965.

The initial {{members of the team}} were Democratic Left (ID), Basque Nationalist <b>Party</b> (PNV) and <b>Democratic</b> Union of Catalonia (UDC).|$|R
50|$|As a {{catch-all}} party, the DC {{differed from}} other <b>European</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties,</b> {{such as the}} Christian Democratic Union of Germany that were mainly conservative parties, with DC comprising conservative as well as social-democratic and liberal elements. The party was thus divided in many factions and party life was characterised by factionalism and by the double adherence of members to {{the party and the}} factions, often identified with individual leaders.|$|R
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> over {{the issues of}} war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions, while Plekhanov and other social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the Swiss Socialist Party, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, The War and the International, and the pro-war position taken by the <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties,</b> primarily the German party. As a war correspondent for the Kievskaya Mysl, Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) Nashe Slovo ("Our Word"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of [...] "peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered." [...] Lenin advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the Second International.|$|R

50|$|Initially {{the party}} was broadly pro-market, {{although}} less so than the Civic Platform. It has adopted the social market economy rhetoric {{similar to that of}} western <b>European</b> Christian <b>democratic</b> <b>parties.</b> In the 2005 election, the party shifted to the protectionist left on economics. As Prime Minister, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz was more economically liberal than the Kaczyńskis, advocating a position closer to Civic Platform. However, unlike Civic Platform, whose emphasis is the economy, Law and Justice's focus is fighting corruption.|$|R
50|$|The RSDLP(b) {{denounced the}} war as imperialist. Moreover, the party denounced the <b>European</b> Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties,</b> who {{supported}} the war efforts of their respective countries, as 'social-chauvinists'. From the very outbreak of the war Lenin began to muster forces {{for the creation of}} a new International, the Third International. In the manifesto against the war it issued in November 1914, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party already called for the formation of the Third International in place of the Second International.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} was severely {{won by the}} right pole parties, winning 5 of the 8 seats for the European People's Party (EPP). Igor Šoltes won one seat for The Greens-European Free Alliance (Greens-EFA), whose member the party became after the election. Ivo Vajgl won a seat for the new Slovenian <b>European</b> <b>party</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Pensioners (DeSUS), which became member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, after election in the European Parliament. The leader of the Social Democrats (SD) Igor Lukšič, was not elected in the parliament {{even though he was}} the president of the party and its main candidate. He was beaten by Tanja Fajon by preferential voting with 11.691 against 6.882 votes for her party colleague.|$|R

Allied with the Liberals in the ALDE Group but opposed to Olli Rehn, the <b>European</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> welcomed the candidature of Guy Verhofstadt, ALDE Group leader.

Today, many <b>European</b> Christian <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> are {{affiliated}} with the European People's Party (or the more Right-wing and soft Eurosceptic European Christian Political Movement, part of the European Conservatives and Reformists group) and many American Christian democractic parties are affiliated with the Christian Democrat Organization of America.|$|R
500|$|Social {{democratic}} {{movements in}} Europe {{have been of}} great interest to the CPC since the early 1980s. With the exception of a short period in which the CPC forged party-to-party relations with far-right parties during the 1970s in an effort to halt [...] "Soviet expansionism", the CPC's relations with <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> were its first serious efforts to establish cordial party-to-party relations with non-communist parties. The CPC credits the European social democrats with creating a [...] "capitalism with a human face". Before the 1980s, the CPC had a highly negative and dismissive view of social democracy, a view dating back to the Second International and the Marxist-Leninist view on the social democratic movement. By the 1980s that view had changed, and the CPC concluded that it could actually learn something from the social democratic movement. CPC delegates were sent all over Europe to observe. It should be noted that by the 1980s most <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> were facing electoral decline, and were in a period of self-reform. The CPC followed this with great interest, laying most weight on reform efforts within the British Labour Party and the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Germany. The CPC concluded that both parties were re-elected because they modernized, replacing traditional state socialist tenets with new ones supporting privatization, shedding the belief in big government, conceiving a new view of the welfare state, changing negative views of the market, and moving from their traditional support base of trade unions to entrepreneurs, younger members and students.|$|R

Includes bibliographical references. This master’s {{thesis is}} a general {{overview}} of the practical and ideological implications of the post- 1980 transformation of Western <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> with specific reference to Britain, Germany and Sweden and the reflections of this transformation on Turkish center-left parties. Within this framework, the roots and developmental trend of Western European Social Democracy have been narrated throughout {{the first chapter of}} this study to clarify which social democratic principles and policies have changed during the most recent transformation of these parties. In the following chapters, which concentrate on the post- 1980 period, the reasons for the electoral erosion of the Northwestern <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> during the 1980 ’s and the way they transformed themselves during the 1990 ’s to stop the decline have been analysed with reference to societal and economic changes {{on the one hand and}} to the strategical and structural changes of the parties on the other. The implications of these changes in terms of the shift in the equality principle and the changing function of pragmatism have been highlighted to draw a main profile of the social democratic transformation often referred to as the “Third Way”. The last part of my study focuses on the common and divergent patterns of the Turkish and Western European center-left, both past and present, and compares the current situation of the so-called social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> in Turkey with those of Western Europe presently being conquered by a la mode Third Way currents.

50|$|In 1979 {{the party}} {{abandoned}} its definitive Marxist theses {{at the hands}} of its then secretary general Felipe González, not before overcoming great tensions and two congresses, the first of which preferred to maintain Marxism. Before this situation, notable internal leaders like Pablo Castellano or Luis Gómez Llorente founded the internal faction of Left Socialists, which included the militants who would not renounce Marxism. This allowed for the consolidation of the leftist forces in PSOE. From this moment, the diverse events both outside and within the party led to projects that resembled those of other <b>European</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> and acceptance of the defence of the market economy.|$|R
