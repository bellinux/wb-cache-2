5|$|Since the musical's 1927 premiere, Show Boat {{has both}} been {{condemned}} as a prejudiced show based on racial caricatures and championed as a breakthrough work {{that opened the}} door for public <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> the arts about racism in America.

5|$|Folk-stories told in {{the nineteenth}} century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic {{minorities}} in place of elves in an essentially racist <b>discourse.</b> <b>In</b> an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.|$|E
5|$|Her {{choice to}} {{film in the}} Kingdom met some resistance. In discussion, Bigelow found that her cast and crew shared {{stereotypes}} of the region from American culture. “Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions,” she said. “But once you {{get off the plane}} you realise it's like Manhattan without the trees,” she continued. As Iraq dominated <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.|$|E
40|$|This article {{brings into}} focus the {{question}} of alternative <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> the social sciences. Alternative discourses are works that attempt to debunk ideas that have become entrenched in the social sciences, {{partly as a result}} of colonialism and the continuing Eurocentrism in the social sciences. In the context of Southeast Asia as well as much of the non-Western world, alternative <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> the social sciences could also be referred to collectively as counter- Eurocentric social science. This paper discusses the emergence of alternative <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia, the defintion of alternative discourse, and the future of these <b>discourses</b> <b>in</b> our regio...|$|R

5|$|During the Japanese colonial era, Japanese {{settlers}} mainly used Japanese {{in their}} daily discourse, and Japanese was the lingua franca used for communication between Japanese and Palauans. English was also recognised as a co-official language along with Japanese, and many Japanese had at least some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to Palauan, especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The Japanese also introduced {{the use of the}} Katakana script in Palauan, which was also used in informal settings. After the Japanese surrender, the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of Palauan and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use Palauan {{in their daily}} <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> favour of Japanese or English, although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry. As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s, Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections.|$|E
5|$|Prose {{works in}} Sanskrit was {{prolific}} during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, {{a native of}} Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was Ganitasarasangraha, a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote {{in the court of}} Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada. He was the author of Yasastilaka champu, Nitivakyamrita and other writings. The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of Arthashastra from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called Kalyanakaraka. He delivered a <b>discourse</b> <b>in</b> the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every <b>discourse,</b> <b>in</b> the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
