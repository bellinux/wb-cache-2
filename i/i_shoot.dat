[...] She was {{fingerprinted}} and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline stating: [...] "Actress Shoots Andy Warhol." [...] Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement {{that she was an}} actress.

[...] Solanas told the judge that [...] "it's not often that <b>I</b> <b>shoot</b> somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me." [...] She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she [...] "was right in what I did!
