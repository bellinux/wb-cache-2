2500|$|In a {{conventional}} thyristor, {{once it has}} been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current {{to remain in the}} on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (IL). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> (IH). In normal working condition the latching current is always greater than <b>holding</b> <b>current.</b> In the above figure IL [...] has to come above the IH on y-axis since IL>IH.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the most}} basic of {{circuits}}, if the current falls below the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> even briefly, the circuit is turned 'OFF' (becomes blocked). However, complex circuits and devices may have different delays built-in between the time the current falls below this level and the time the device turns 'OFF'. Whether a device turns 'ON' when current is restored is a design issue. The current necessary to restore the circuit to the 'ON' state, called the [...] "threshold current" [...] (See threshold voltage), may be much greater than the <b>holding</b> <b>current,</b> or only very slightly more. Nevertheless, where the device is designed to turn back 'ON' upon restoration of the current and where the device is running at or about the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> level, slight variations in the current can cause flicker as the device cycles 'OFF' and 'ON'. If flicker is undesirable, it can be reduced by the use of capacitors or other circuits, on the other hand, flicker can be used to measure small events as in a Geiger-Müller tube.|$|R

Only 802 CCIE Voice certified engineers <b>hold</b> <b>current</b> certificates as of September 9, 2008. Most candidates pass after three or four lab attempts, but some have required more than six. Many have reputed that the lab exam seems as much a test of time management and planning as of technical expertise. The widely dissimilar platforms used sets the Voice lab exam apart from other CCIE lab exams. One must make configurations on the Windows 2003 Server environment, a CallManager web-based GUI, and the IOS command line. As such, it involves a lot of back-and-forth fine tuning between the numerous platforms.|$|E

50|$|When {{power is}} removed, the heating {{due to the}} <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> will stop and the PPTC device will cool. As the device cools, it regains its {{original}} crystalline structure and returns to a low resistance state where it can <b>hold</b> the <b>current</b> as specified for the device. This cooling usually takes a few seconds, though a tripped device will retain a slightly higher resistance for hours, slowly approaching the initial resistance value. The resetting will often not take place even if the fault alone has been removed with the power still flowing as the operating current may be above the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> of the PPTC. The device may not return to its original resistance value; it will most likely stabilize at a significantly higher resistance (up to 4 times initial value). It could take hours, days, weeks or even years for the device {{to return to a}} resistance value similar to its original value, if at all.|$|R
