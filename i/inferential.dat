5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the <b>inferential</b> web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is <b>inferential</b> and speculative, though {{numerous}} clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and <b>inferential</b> statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
25|$|The <b>inferential</b> past or miş-past can be {{understood}} as asserting that a past participle is applicable now; hence it is used when the fact of a past event, as such, is not important; in particular, the <b>inferential</b> past is used when one did not actually witness the past event.|$|E
25|$|As {{everything}} in <b>inferential</b> statistics {{it relies on}} sample size, and therefore under fat tails p-values may be seriously mis-computed.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} TOTs are largely unknown but {{numerous}} explanations have been offered. These explanations mainly {{fall within the}} realms of two overarching viewpoints: the direct-access view and the <b>inferential</b> view.|$|E
25|$|Grammatical evidentiality may be {{expressed}} in different forms (depending on the language), such as through affixes, clitics, or particles. For example, Eastern Pomo has four evidential suffixes that are added to verbs, -ink’e (nonvisual sensory), -ine (<b>inferential),</b> -·le (hearsay), -ya (direct knowledge).|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{different}} <b>inferential</b> evidentials {{also indicate}} epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see epistemic modality below). For example, one evidential {{may indicate that}} the information is inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that the information is inferred but unlikely to be true.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{educational}} psychology {{is the study}} of the relation between inherent folk knowledge and abilities and accompanying <b>inferential</b> and attributional biases as these influence academic learning in evolutionarily novel cultural contexts, such as schools and the industrial workplace. The fundamental premises and principles of this discipline are presented below.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{archaeology}} {{represents the}} application of the experimental method to develop more highly controlled observations of processes that create and impact the archaeological record. In the context of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving the scientific rigor of archaeological epistemologies the experimental method gained importance. Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the <b>inferential</b> frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.|$|E
25|$|The <b>inferential</b> view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from {{clues about the}} target that the rememberer can piece together. This {{is to say that}} the rememberer infers their {{knowledge}} of the target word, and the imminence of retrieval depends upon the information that they are able to access about the target word from their memory. These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative research includes studies that use <b>inferential</b> statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods {{in order to test}} their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an initial}} {{assessment}} which utilises the 'Strange Situation' procedure, (Ainsworth 1978), observations, a videotaped interview using the Parent Development Interview (Aber et al. 1989) and the Adult Attachment Interview (George et al. 1984) and caregiver questionnaires regarding the child. The child's attachment pattern is classified using either Ainsworth or the PAC (Preschool Attachment Classification System). The therapy is then 'individualized' according to each dyads attachment/caregiver pattern. The programme, {{which takes place}} weekly over 20 weeks, consists of group sessions, video feedback vignettes and psycho-educational and therapeutic discussions. Caregivers learn, understand and then practice observational and <b>inferential</b> skills regarding their children's attachment behaviors and their own caregiving responses.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{statistical}} methods {{are used in}} data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and <b>inferential</b> statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes {{the extent to which}} members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning. This idea of content contrasts sharply with the <b>inferential</b> role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career. [...] Fodor criticizes <b>inferential</b> role semantics (IRS) because its commitment to an extreme form of holism excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental. But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms.|$|E
500|$|Bosley Crowther {{wrote that}} the film had [...] "a strangely obscure, <b>inferential,</b> almost studiedly perplexing quality". Variety staff praised the film's visuals for reminiscence to Japanese prints, costumes and set design, and the {{performances}} of Masayuki Mori and Machiko Kyō. The film appeared in Sight and Sound magazine's top 10 critics poll of the greatest films ever made, which is held once every decade, in 1962 and 1972.|$|E
500|$|For Fodor, this formal {{notion of}} thought {{processes}} {{also has the}} advantage of highlighting the parallels between the causal role of symbols and the contents which they express. In his view, syntax plays the role of mediation between the causal role of the symbols and their contents. The semantic relations between symbols can be [...] "imitated" [...] by their syntactic relations. The <b>inferential</b> relations which connect the contents of two symbols can be imitated by the formal syntax rules which regulate the derivation of one symbol from another.|$|E
