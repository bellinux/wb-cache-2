5000|$|Marking a {{transition}} from identity politics to a unitary human rights framework on equality, the Declaration provides guidance {{on some of the}} most complex and controversial issues that arise in any attempt to develop comprehensive equality legislation at the national level. For example, it defines the right to equality, equal treatment, and the right to non-discrimination, and gives a legal definition of discrimination, {{as well as of the}} most important types of discrimination (direct, indirect, harassment, <b>discrimination</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and by perception); through these, it provides guidance on the question of how the right to non-discrimination relates to the right to equality. The Declaration also provides general principles on how to approach the question of the grounds on which discrimination must be prohibited: should the right to non-discrimination apply only to a closed list of grounds? Are new grounds emerging that should require equal pro-tection? Is there a hierarchy of the ground of discrimination, and what should be the approach to defining exceptions? ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} EU {{anti-discrimination}} law. On {{the basis of}} the ECJ’s judgment in “CHEZ RB” the paper examines the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination and analyses the scope of the concept of <b>discrimination</b> <b>by</b> <b>association,</b> acknowledged, for the first time, in the ECJ’s judgment in “Coleman”. Emphasis will be put on the question whether the ECJ has established <b>discrimination</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> as a general concept in EU anti-discrimination law, valid for all types of discrimination, direct or indirect, and irrespective of the referred ground or the degree of association...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>{{discrimination}}</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> is {{the form of}} discrimination that occurs when the discriminatory ground applies to a person, but another person is detrimentally treated in consequence. Until recently it has had a low profile, appearing in {{just a handful of}} race relations cases concerning instructions to discriminate. However, the European Court of Justice, after a reference made to it by an employment tribunal, will rule on whether it has a wider application. If it does so, the effect in English law will be wide-ranging and of great importance. In addition, the government's Green Paper on the Single Equality Bill also addresses the issue. The present state of the law and the arguments for and against extending <b>discrimination</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> are discussed...|$|E
25|$|The {{rights of}} LGBT {{students}} and staff in an educational institution vary considerably {{depending on whether the}} institution is religious and/or open to the public, since human rights acts only partially prohibit discrimination against pupils of private schools and the Charter only partly prohibits <b>discrimination</b> <b>by</b> churches, <b>associations</b> and businesses, while section 2 of the Charter protects freedom of religion and section 93 of the Constitution recognizes the right to denominational schools in some provinces.|$|R

40|$|The author {{examines}} third-degree price <b>discrimination</b> <b>by</b> an upstream monopolist in {{an intermediate}} good market. <b>Discrimination</b> is motivated <b>by</b> {{the fact that}} downstream firms differ in their abilities to integrate backward into supply of the input. The author shows that under reasonable specifications of equilibrium, price discrimination leads to all buyers facing higher input prices. In other cases, discrimination raises some prices and lowers others. The author derives conditions under which <b>discrimination</b> lowers welfare <b>by</b> reducing total output and shows that in some markets discrimination will raise welfare by preventing socially inefficient backward integration.

40|$|There are {{currently}} more than 33, 000 people {{known to have}} dementia in Ireland. Due to its complex and multi-faceted nature, the impact of dementia on all those affected is extensive. Existing theories of stigma posit that possessing a disability such as dementia {{can result in a}} perception of difference between the person and others in the community, and potentially predispose the person with dementia to stigmatisation and <b>discrimination.</b> <b>By</b> <b>association</b> carers/family members of the person with dementia may also be subject to the effects of stigma or its components. It has been suggested that dementia related stigma is a concern in terms of the provision of dementia care and that it poses an obstacle to the well-being and quality of life of persons with dementia and their carers. To date this subject has not been explored in-depth from an Irish perspective. Consequently, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland commissioned this exploratory research, to better understand this issue and gain insight into how to respond to dementia related stigma in an Irish contex...|$|E
