40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} image simplification techniques as a first stage to define a multiresolution registration framework. We propose here a new approach for image registration based on the partitioning of the source images in binary-space (BSP) and quad-tree structures. These partitioned images have been obtained with a maximum mutual information gain algorithm. Multimodal registration experiments with downsampled, BSP and quadtree partitioned images show an outstanding accuracy and robustness by using BSP images, since the <b>grid</b> <b>effects</b> are drastically reduced. The obtained results indicate that BSP partitioning can provide a suitable framework for multiresolution registration. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>grid</b> {{orientation}} <b>effect</b> is {{a long-standing}} problem plaguing reservoir simulators that employ finite difference schemes. A {{rotation of the}} computational grids yields a substantially different solution under certain circumstances. For example, in a five-spot pattern, the predicted recovery, water cut performance and {{the locations of the}} fronts depend on the type of grid system used. A Cartesian grid with one axis parallel to the line joining an injector and producer gives a solution significantly different from a grid that has the axes oriented at 45 ?? to this line. This study develops a unique grid-block assignment where rectangular grid blocks are interspersed with octagonal grid blocks. This grid block system is called the Hybrid Grid Block (HGB) system. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> of the HGB grid to see whether it is an improvement over the conventional Cartesian grid system. In HGB, flow can progress in four directions in the octagonal grid blocks and two in the square grid blocks. The increase in the number of flow directions in the octagonal grid blocks is expected to reduce the <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> in the model. Hence, this study also evaluates the <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> of the HGB and compares it with the Cartesian grid system. To test the viability of HGB, a general purpose finite difference IMPES-formulated two-dimensional black oil simulator was developed in this study, while retaining the familiar finite-difference discretization of the flow equations. Several simulation cases were conducted to compare HGB and conventional grid block systems. Comparisons with commercial simulator are also made. Despite the fact that the reservoir is isotropic and homogeneous, <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> was still observed when rectangular Cartesian grid models are run at mobility ratio, M = 1. 0. Grid refinement can help to reduce the <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> in rectangular Cartesian grid models when there are favorable mobility ratios, i. e. M = 1. 0 or less. However, at an unfavorable mobility ratio of M = 10. 0, it is found that neither parallel nor diagonal orientation can be used reliably for the displacement problems run in this study. This is because as the number of grid blocks is increased, the performance of diagonal and parallel models actually diverges for the grid spacings investigated here. On the other hand, HGB grid is able to reduce the <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> even for unfavorable mobility ratio displacement problems (up to M = 50. 0), with maximum relative difference in pore volume recovered of 6 % between parallel and diagonal HGB grid models for all the cases run in this study. Comparisons between the conventional Cartesian and HGB grid show that the HGB grid is more effective in reducing the <b>grid</b> orientation <b>effect</b> than the Cartesian grid. The HGB grid performs better by consistently giving a smaller relative difference between HGB parallel grid and HGB diagonal grid in pore volume recovered (6. 0, 4. 5, 3. 3, and 2. 2 %) compared to the relative difference between Cartesian parallel grid and Cartesian diagonal grid in pore volume recovered (17. 0, 13. 0, 9. 3, 7. 9 %) at similar averaged area per grid block for all the four comparison cases studied...|$|R

The boundary and the embedding e#ect is present with all placement approaches, though the embedding e#ect may be (partly) nullified by the <b>grid</b> <b>effect</b> that may occur with some partitioning-based placement algorithms. One of the main applications of Rent's rule is the estimation of wire length distributions. Both flat and hierarchical placement models can be applied, though experiments show that for the current state-of-the-art estimation techniques the latter produces better results, even for layouts that were generated using a flat placement approach. Which Rent parameters and occupation probability function should be used depends on the placement algorithm.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of modern day power grid is increasing with penetration of large-scale renewable resources {{at various levels}} of the networks. Inclusion of communication networks, to facilitate data transfer for ensuring reliability and security of the power system, with the electricity network extends the complexity to a new scale in a contemporary smart power grid.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{off-grid}} direction of arrival (DOA) estimation based on sparse representations in the situation of multiple measurement vectors (MMV). A novel sparse DOA estimation method which changes MMV problem to SMV is proposed. This method uses sparse representations based on weighted eigenvectors (SRBWEV) to deal with the MMV problem. MMV problem can be changed to single measurement vector (SMV) problem by using the linear combination of eigenvectors of array covariance matrix in signal subspace as a new SMV for sparse solution calculation. So the complexity of this proposed algorithm is smaller than other DOA estimation algorithms of MMV. Meanwhile, it can overcome the limitation of the conventional sparsity-based DOA estimation approaches that the unknown directions belong to a predefined discrete angular grid, so it can further improve the DOA estimation accuracy. The modified Rife algorithm for DOA estimation (MRife-DOA) is simulated based on SRBWEV algorithm. In this proposed algorithm, the largest and sub-largest inner products between the measurement vector or its residual and the atoms in the dictionary are utilized to further modify DOA estimation according to the principle of Rife algorithm and the basic idea of coarse-to-fine estimation. Finally, simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can reduce the DOA estimation error caused by <b>grid</b> <b>effect</b> with lower complexity...|$|E

Electric and plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}} (EVs/PHEVs) can have a large impact on greenhouse gases (GHGs) reduction, increase in fuel economy and higher fuel efficiency. This thesis seeks to investigate the Well-to-Wheels (WTW) energy efficiency analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Canada. The main idea behind this research work is to analyze step by step energy efficiency, {{which is one of the}} key factors for EVs technology acceptance. Penetration of battery electric and more electric vehicles (BEVs/MEVs) into vehicle fleet, affects load demand as well as electricity market. Smart charging of EVs can remove a lot of stress from electricity <b>grid.</b> <b>Effect</b> of home charging of EVs/PHEVs on electricity demand in the province of Quebec was analyzed. More recently, EVs have been looked at as distributed sources of energy, whereby they could back up the power grid during critical high demand periods. With the help of an on-board battery pack, EVs can act as distributed generators and feedback energy to the AC grid. However, efficiency of energy conversion could become an issue in this power flow. Hence, in this thesis stage-by-stage efficiency of vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) power flow was evaluated. In addition, feasibility of using EVs in international islanding to sustain the local grid in the event of an emergency was analyzed. ...|$|E

Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of dose grid resolution on bladder wall dose-volume histogram (DVH) calculations for prostate IMRT plans. Materials and Methods: The planning computed tomography scans and clinical plans from 15 prostate cancer patients were included in this analysis. For each study computed tomography, the entire inner and outer bladder surfaces were delineated. Nine versions of the clinical plan were created, varying interval between the dose grid calculation points uniformly in three dimensions, whereas all other plan parameters were kept constant. The dose grid increments tested were 1 - 10 mm. The plans were recalculated and the bladder wall DVH compared against the study benchmark (1 mm grid). Results: All the dose grid increments evaluated resulted in a systematic overestimation of the bladder wall volume receiving low doses and an underestimation of the volume receiving high doses. Grid increments 5. 0 mm resulted in mean volume differences greater than 2 cm³. Individual patient analysis revealed that only the 1. 5 mm increment resulted in maximum volume differences ≤ 1 cm³ for every patient across {{the full length of}} the DVH curve. Bladder wall thickness ranged from 1. 7 to 4. 4 mm and displayed no correlation with the magnitude of the dose <b>grid</b> <b>effect.</b> Conclusions: For an accurate DVH calculation for bladder wall during IMRT planning for prostate cancer, a 1. 5 mm dose grid increment is recommended.

40|$|The CALIOPE Air Quality Forecast System (CALIOPE-AQFS) {{represents}} {{the current state}} of the art in air quality forecasting systems of high-resolution running on high-performance computing platforms. It provides a 48 h forecast of NO 2, O 3, SO 2, PM 10, PM 2. 5, CO, and C 6 H 6 at a 4 km horizontal resolution over all of Spain, and at a 1 km horizontal resolution over the most populated areas in Spain with complex terrains (the Barcelona (BCN), Madrid (MAD) and Andalusia (AND) domains). Increased horizontal resolution from 4 to 1 km over the aforementioned domains leads to finer textures and more realistic concentration maps, which is justified by the increase in NO 2 /O 3 spatial correlation coefficients from 0. 79 / 0. 69 (4 km) to 0. 81 / 0. 73 (1 km). High-resolution emissions using the bottom-up HERMESv 2. 0 model are essential for improving model performance when increasing resolution on an urban scale, but it is still insufficient. Decreasing grid spacing does not reveal the expected improvement in hourly statistics, i. e., decreasing NO 2 bias by only ~ 2 µg m- 3 and increasing O 3 bias by ~ 1 µg m- 3. The <b>grid</b> <b>effect</b> is less pronounced for PM 10, because part of its mass consists of secondary aerosols, which are less affected than the locally emitted primary components by a decreasing grid size. The resolution increase has the highest impact over Barcelona, where air flow is controlled mainly by mesoscale phenomena and a lower planetary boundary layer (PBL). Despite the merits and potential uses of the 1 -km simulation, the limitations of current model formulations do not allow confirmation of their expected superiority close to highly urbanized areas and large emissions sources. Future work should combine high grid resolutions with techniques that decrease subgrid variability (e. g., stochastic field methods), and also include models that consider urban morphology and thermal parameters.

40|$|All {{radiographic}} imaging modalities are imperfect; {{they produce}} {{images that are}} affected to some degree by loss of object information or details. This can be addressed by exposing the subject being imaged to beams of different exposure values or extending the exposure time, but this result {{in an increase in}} the radiation dose delivered to the subject, a factor which must be minimised in clinical applications. In order for radiographic imaging modalities to be calibrated to minimise the dose delivered to a patient while still capturing images of sufficient detail to facilitate diagnosis, various methods of image quality (IQ) assessment have been developed which determine the efficiency and low contrast detectability of these modalities. A further approach to the reduction of the dose delivered is applied in the latest types of Computed Tomography (CT) modalities, in which incomplete slices are obtained and utilised in the reconstruction of images. These slices are made through very short periods of time which also reduces the dose to the patient but leads to some artefacts in the image in addition to some extra information loss. IQ assessment is therefore critical to these new types of CT modalities as well [1]. Assessing IQ is normally either done by using equipment (objective method) or by visualisation of images by professionals (subjective method) [more information about different methods of image quality evaluation is discussed in (Chapter 2, Section 2. 8) ]. Objective assessments of image quality associated with diagnostic imaging systems are most often equipment-based, such as noise analysis or modulation transfer functions [2]. These methods do not consider the effects of the image assessor, who is typically a radiologist, nor the effects of the viewing system and conditions. Image quality can also be assessed subjectively. The subjective method is based on the observer&rsquo;s perception of the assessor. This method requires multiple observers who individually identify a visible object (threshold details) for every detailed parameter available in the image. The human decision criteria are considered a fundamental element, as they can be included in the imaging chain when evaluating image quality, due to their crucial role in the medical diagnosis process. In this method, the radiologists usually assess the diagnostic images with the receiver operator characteristics (ROCs) to compare the performance of different imaging systems [more details about the ROC in (Chapter 2, Section 2. 8. 3) ]. Despite the fact that ROC analysis considers the whole imaging chain, such as human observers and equipment, this analysis is a time-consuming process and cannot be readably adopted as a quality assurance (QA) method in a busy clinical practice [3]. The most common alternative approach to assess IQ is the use of a contrast detail phantom (CDP). A CDP can provide useful information on contrast detail detectability and is considered the most reliable form of IQ assessment, particularly in low-contrast conditions [3]. In fact, the CDP is referred to as a low-contrast detail (LCD) phantom, and the commercially available phantom is called CDRAD 2. 0. The CDRAD phantom is made of acrylic (Perspex; polymethyl methacrylate) which is 10 mm thick and in which 225 cylindrical holes of various sizes and depths are drilled. The diameter of the holes varies in size from 0. 3 mm to 8 mm. This range is equally distributed across 15 depths. These depths range from 8 mm (providing high contrast) to 0. 3 mm (providing low contrast). Hence, the CDRAD phantom uses the air&ndash;acrylic interface to create image contrast [3]. This method involves both equipment and observers. This thesis is mainly focused on the use of CDPs in the evaluation of IQ in two X-ray-based modalities: Conventional radiography and CT. The evaluation of the former modality includes computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) systems. A modified CDRAD phantom which is based on the CDP approach is proposed and evaluated. This modified phantom utilises a smaller attenuation differential than unmodified CDRAD and it is more closely representative of the tissues found in the human body. The three main aims of this thesis are then as follows: The first aim: To modify the current CDRAD phantom by replacing the air-filled holes fully with water or contrast media. Replacing the air-filled holes at the same phantom with the contrast media can create a gradation of contrast measurements that can be varied and extended by adding different amounts (concentrations) of contrast media into the holes (Chapter 5) because air attenuates much less radiation compared with other media, including Perspex. After creating a low contrast phantom by replacing the air-filled holes with water at the CDRAD, the LCD of these two interfaces (air-Perspex and water-Perspex) is investigated by utilising of information loss (IL) theory in the DR system (Chapter 6). The investigation of applying the IL theory with the CDRAD is extended to include the evaluation of the image quality of the CR system using two different techniques anti-scatter grid and non-grid on the unmodified CDRAD containing air filled holes (Chapter 7). Finally, the study of the <b>grid</b> <b>effect</b> includes the flat panel direct (DR) system by using the IQFinv factor to assess the image quality of different DR systems with and without the grid by using the CDRAD phantom containing air-filled holes (Chapter 8). The second aim: To create a special contrast-detail phantom to evaluate the IQ and assess the LCD of CT scanners more efficiently than the commercially available Catphan phantoms by including a wide dynamic range that can be modified to assess any required level of LCD, which will be called CTCDP. Like the CDRAD phantom used in conventional radiography, the CTCDP incorporates a central slide that contains holes of different diameters. The diameter of these holes incrementally increases in size {{from the middle of the}} phantom to the phantom edge, as follows: 1. 0 mm, 2. 5 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7. 5 mm, 9. 0 mm, 10. 0 mm, 11. 0 mm and 12. 5 mm (more details about the CTCDP in Chapter 9). The detection of the LCD at this phantom is measured by two factors: IQF and IL (Chapters 9 and 10). This phantom complements the existing Catphan and extends its applicability to much lower contrast values and also it extends its contrast dynamic scale. The third aim: To investigate the effects of the contrast media on the CTDI value and relate it to the CT numbers by using theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical method employed a new derivation of the known CTDI formula. This new derivation accounts for the presence of the contrast media as a factor when determining the dose enhancement. The experimental part includes the determination of the dose enhancement by using the contrast media and Gafchromic films (Chapter 11). These studies will be of great value to the radiology community and to all the CT users because it develops a method of estimating the level of information loss during imaging procedures that significantly enhances the X-rays based modalities currently employed...|$|E

In order to help the nuclear industry in the optimization of fuel assembly design, it is necessary to develop new simulation tools at smaller scales than those used in current industrial tools (system codes, sub-channel codes). Based on a better understanding of local flow processes, such CFD tools should help developing more general DNB-type CHF predictions; indeed, they should allow to replace industrial methods by the Local Predictive Approach (LPA) which consists in developing DNB predictors based on local flow parameters, as soon as they are validated for bubbly boiling flows in fully representative conditions (complex geometries and real flow parameters). <b>Grid</b> <b>effects,</b> non-uniform heat flux impact, channel shape/size effect should be predicted in a more generalized way. The development of such CFD tools is one of the main objectives of the NEPTUNE Project (joint development by CEA and EDF with a complementary support of AREVA-NP and IRSN) which wil...|$|R
40|$|Dispensing {{technology}} in crystalline silicon solar cell metallization offers {{the possibility to}} improve contact finger geometries compared with the dominating screen-printing approach. However, an optimum contact formation strongly depends on paste rheology and process parameters. In this study, a method is introduced to predetermine dispensed contact geometries by extracting specific rheological parameters from oscillating strain sweeps, allowing for paste optimization prior to printing tests. For this reason, four different dispensing pastes were processed and compared with a commercially available screen-printing paste. Oscillating strain sweeps were conducted with all pastes, {{in order to determine}} characteristic values for complex shear modulus G* and yield stress y. In the following, p-type Cz-Si solar cells were processed, which were equipped with dispensed contact fingers using the four rheologically investigated dispensing pastes and compared with samples with a n all screen-printed front-side <b>grid.</b> <b>Effects</b> like paste spreading or necking could be isolated and referred to the different pastes and printing processes. Various form parameters that describe specific characteristics of resulting finger geometries were introduced. The elastic part G of the complex shear modulus G* was found to have the major impact on resulting finger widths, aspect ratios, and a macroscopic contact angle between the finger and the wafer surface...|$|R

To mitigate the possible bias introduced by having a fixed origin of the grid map, we add a random offset for each participant chosen randomly from a uniform distribution on [0, Δ s].|$|R
30|$|In several hydro- and MHD-codes {{that include}} non-Cartesian grids such as Pluto (Mignone et al. [2007]), the {{geometric}} source terms are coded explicitly for several geometries (polar, cylindrical, spherical), {{and not only}} for the artificial viscosity flux. The suggestions made e.g. in Vinokur ([1974]) lead to geometrical source terms that correct curvilinear <b>grid</b> <b>effects.</b> However the strong conservation form as elaborated in Warsi ([1981]) would need to appeal to our differential geometrically consistent approach {{in order to deal with}} the viscosity in an intrinsically consistent way. Especially when the metric tensor itself is not only a function of space but also time-dependent (as discussed in Section  1), the latter approach reaches its limits. Our correction affects curvilinear coordinates in multiple dimensions, whereas it is not necessary that the coordinates are orthogonal, i.e., the metric tensor does not need to be diagonal. Our initial motivation to study more general coordinates comes from the idea to generate problem-oriented coordinate systems for astrophysical numerical calculations. In a following paper we want to present some feasible approaches to grid generation under certain physical restrictions. Such nonlinear grids that are adaptive in multiple dimensions have time-dependent metric tensors and thus benefit directly from our consistent definition. On the contrast, when using adaptive mesh refinement, the metric tensor remains geometrically constant in time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We present {{visualization}} {{tools for}} analyzing molecular simulations of liquid crystal (LC) behavior. The simulation data consists of terabytes of data describing {{the position and}} orientation of every molecule in the simulated system over time. Condensed matter physicists study the evolution of topological defects in these data, and our visualization tools focus on that goal. We first convert the discrete simulation data to a sampled version of a continuous second-order tensor field and then use combinations of visualization methods to simultaneously display combinations of contractions of the tensor data, providing an interactive environment for exploring these complicated data. The system, built using AVS, employs colored cutting planes, colored isosurfaces, and colored integral curves to display fields of tensor contractions including Westin's scalar cl, cp, and cs metrics and the principal eigenvector. Our approach has been in active use in the physics lab for over a year. It correctly displays structures already known; it displays the data in a spatially and temporally smoother way than earlier approaches, avoiding confusing <b>grid</b> <b>effects</b> and facilitating the study of multiple time steps; it extends the use of tools developed for visualizing diffusion tensor data, re-interpreting them {{in the context of}} molecular simulations; and it has answered long-standing questions regarding the orientation of molecules around defects and the conformational changes of the defects...|$|R
40|$|The band shapes {{corresponding}} {{to both the}} absorption and emission spectra {{of a set of}} 20 representative conjugated molecules, including recently synthesized structures, have been simulated with a Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory model including diffuse atomic orbitals and accounting for bulk solvent effects. Six hybrid functionals, including two range-separated hybrids (B 3 LYP, PBE 0, M 06, M 06 - 2 X, CAM-B 3 LYP, and LC-PBE) have been assessed in light of the experimental band shapes obtained for these conjugated compounds. Basis set and integration <b>grid</b> <b>effects</b> have also been evaluated. It turned out that all tested functionals but LC-PBE reproduce the main experimental features for both absorption and fluorescence, though the average errors are significantly larger for the latter phenomena. No single functional stands out as the most accurate for all aspects, but B 3 LYP yields the smallest mean absolute deviation. On the other hand, M 06 - 2 X could be a valuable compromise for excited-states as it reproduces the 0 − 0 energies and also gives reasonable band shapes. The typical mean absolute deviations between the relative positions of the experimental and theoretical peaks in the vibrationally resolved spectra are ca. 100 cm− 1 for absorption and 250 cm− 1 for emission. In the same time, the relative intensities of the different maxima are reproduced by TD- DFT with a ca. 10 − 15 % accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{numerical}} activity aiming at investigating the spray structure originated by a new-generation GDI injector. The spray is analyzed under quiescent conditions, injecting the fuel {{in a test}} vessel at non-evaporative ambient conditions. Results from 3 D-CFD simulations are compared to experimental measurements available in literature: commer-cial gasoline at two different injection pressures (10 and 20 MPa) was injected and the spray evolution was ana-lyzed throughout the injection duration. The spray was investigated along the jet axis by the phase Doppler anemometry {{in order to provide}} droplet size and velocity, in terms of both axial and radial components. Data were analyzed using the ensemble averaging technique in order to provide mean values. Experimental measurements briefly described above are used to test and validate some lagrangian spray numerical sub-models and numerical parameters such as grid density, numerical setup, primary and secondary fuel breakup and droplet to droplet interaction. Particular care is devoted to the accurate representation of the spray primary breakup, in view of the lack of ad-hoc developed models available in literature. A wide CFD activity is then performed in order to investigate <b>grid</b> <b>effects</b> on the prediction of liquid spray penetration and droplet velocity. Results from the CFD analyses show a relevant dependency of the spray structure on both the computational cell size and the adopted CFD model ensemble...|$|R
