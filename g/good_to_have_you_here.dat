This thesis {{would not have been possible}} without <b>you.</b> I <b>have</b> been lucky <b>to</b> <b>have</b> someone with such a depth and breadth of knowledge about high energy physics as my advisor. I learned a lot from <b>you.</b> Also, I <b>have</b> really appreciated your positive attitude, availability, and willingness to do whatever it took to help take my project to completion. And, it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> on my side as an advocate within the BABAR collaboration. Not all graduate students are this fortunate. Thank you. In addition, I {{would like to}} thank Gregory Dubois-Felsmann, a post-doc who, along with David and me, formed the radiative leptonic analysis group at Caltech. In so many ways, this thesis is a product of your vision. Working with you on a regular basis and getting constant, insightful feedback was what took me from a green, clueless graduate student to a fairly competent and knowledgeable analyst. Along with Dave, you are really one of the top physicists on BABAR in terms of knowledge and experience. Plus, you are one of the sharpest persons I have <b>had</b> the opportunity <b>to</b> meet in my life. I always had confidence that when I got stuck, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> some insight that would get me unstuck. I really appreciate that you took time to teach me and help me develop as a physicist. Thank you. iv I also owe many thanks to the other members of the Caltech BABAR group. Professor Frank Porter has been an integral part of my graduate school experience, both as a teacher and a researcher. His knowledge of statistics (not to mention physics in general), especially applied to high energy physics analyses, is tremendous, and I <b>have</b> been grateful <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had him as a resource. Also, post-docs Yury Kolomensky, Anders Ryd, Ilya Narsky, Scott Metzler, and Justin Albert have both helped me and taught me much.

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over.
