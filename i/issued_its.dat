5|$|On April10, Colorado State University (CSU) <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> first {{forecast}} for the season, {{calling for a}} potentially hyperactive season with 18named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165. The probabilities of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast and East Coast were well above average. On May15, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) predicted 14named storms, with a 70% chance that the number would be between 10 and 18, and ninehurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would be between 4 and 14. It also predicted an ACE index of 130 with a 70% chance that the index {{would be in the}} range 76 to 184. On May 23, 2013, NOAA <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> first seasonal outlook for the year, stating there was a 70% likelihood of 13 to 20named storms, of which seven to eleven could become hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes; these ranges are greater than the seasonal average of twelve named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. On May30, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to ten would further intensify into hurricanes; no forecast was given for the number of major hurricanes. In addition, an ACE index of 135 units was forecast.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 2005, Klotzbach's team <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> initial extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2006 season, predicting an above average of 17named storms, {{nine of them}} hurricanes, and five classified as Category3 intensity or higher.|$|E

5|$|On May17, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> {{seasonal}} {{forecast for}} the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected {{largely as a result}} of a Neutral ENSO. The organization <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E
5|$|On September25, the Canadian Hurricane Centre <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> first {{information}} bulletin ever {{related to a}} tropical cyclone as Emily was moving into Canadian offshore waters.

5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E

5|$|On May 16, 2005, 16days {{before the}} season began, NOAA <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> outlook for the 2005 season, {{forecasting}} a 70% chance of above-normal activity. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value for the season was predicted to be 120–190% of the median ACE of 87.5 × 104 kt2. Shortly thereafter, on May 31, the day {{before the season}} officially began, Gray's team revised its April forecast upwards to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Preparations and {{planning}} have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when Hurricane Ophelia was forecast to brush near Nova Scotia in early September 2005. Hurricane Juan has {{also resulted in}} several changes to the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Hurricane Centre, which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage. CHC's hurricane warning system has also been improved; traditionally, CHC did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings, just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings, which were often not heeded by local residents. Beginning in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, CHC began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting Canada. Canada <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> first hurricane warning in 2008 in anticipation of Hurricane Kyle and in 2009, <b>issued</b> <b>its</b> second hurricane watch in anticipation of Hurricane Bill.|$|E
