5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular <b>faceting</b> shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to <b>faceting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the one and}} a {{half months}} after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, {{underwent}} tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12–13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic <b>faceting.</b> The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C-5– on 16November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.|$|E

The research society consisted of 3316 published terms in Islamic Ethic Thesaurus which have correlated relationship together. The method of data collecting was documentary (Library).

40|$|<b>Faceted</b> search enables {{users to}} {{navigate}} a multi-dimensional information space by combining keyword search with drill-down options in each <b>facets.</b> For example, when searching “computer monitor” 2 ̆ 7 in an e-commerce site, users can select brands and monitor types from the the provided <b>facets</b> “Samsung”, “Dell”, “Acer”, [...] . and “LET-Lit”, “LCD”, “OLED”, [...] It {{has been used}} successfully for many vertical applications, including e-commerce and digital libraries. However, this idea is not well explored for general web search in an open-domain setting, even though it holds great potential for assisting multi-faceted queries and exploratory search. The goal of this work is to explore this potential by extending <b>faceted</b> search into the open-domain web setting, which we call <b>Faceted</b> Web Search. We address three fundamental issues in <b>Faceted</b> Web Search, namely: how to automatically generate <b>facets</b> (<b>facet</b> generation); how to re-organize search results with users 2 ̆ 7 selections on <b>facets</b> (<b>facet</b> feedback); and how to evaluate generated <b>facets</b> and entire <b>Faceted</b> Web Search systems. In conventional <b>faceted</b> search, <b>facets</b> are generated in advance for an entire corpus either manually or semi-automatically, and then recommended for particular queries {{in most of the}} previous work. However, this approach is difficult to extend to the entire web due to the web 2 ̆ 7 s large and heterogeneous nature. We instead propose a query-dependent approach, which extracts <b>facets</b> for queries from their web search results. We further improve our <b>facet</b> generation model under a more practical scenario, where users care more about precision of presented <b>facets</b> than recall. The dominant <b>facet</b> feedback method in conventional <b>faceted</b> search is Boolean filtering, which filters search results by users 2 ̆ 7 selections on <b>facets.</b> However, our investigation shows Boolean filtering is too strict when extended to the open-domain setting. Thus, we propose soft ranking models for <b>Faceted</b> Web Search, which expand original queries with users 2 ̆ 7 selections on <b>facets</b> to re-rank search results. Our experiments show that the soft ranking models are more effective than Boolean filtering models for <b>Faceted</b> Web Search. To evaluate <b>Faceted</b> Web Search, we propose both intrinsic evaluation, which evaluates <b>facet</b> generation on its own, and extrinsic evaluation, which evaluates an entire <b>Faceted</b> Web Search system by its utility in assisting search clarification. We also design a method for building reusable test collections for such evaluations. Our experiments show that using the <b>Faceted</b> Web Search interface can significantly improve the original ranking if allowed sufficient time for user feedback on <b>facets...</b>|$|R

25|$|Several factors mobilized {{the shift}} from a {{representational}} art form to one increasingly abstract; a most important factor would {{be found in the}} works of Paul Cézanne, and his interpretation of nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone. In addition to his tendency to simplify geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with rendering the effect of volume and space. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the complex treatment of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a planar <b>faceting</b> effect. In his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, with larger, bolder, more arbitrary <b>faceting,</b> with dynamic and increasingly abstract results. As the colors planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.|$|E
25|$|The Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra may be {{constructed}} from the Platonic solids {{by a process}} called stellation. The reciprocal process to stellation is called facetting (or <b>faceting).</b> Every stellation of one polyhedron is dual, or reciprocal, to some facetting of the dual polyhedron. The regular star polyhedra can also be obtained by facetting the Platonic solids. This was first done by Bertrand {{around the same time}} that Cayley named them.|$|E

25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The <b>faceting</b> however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in <b>faceting</b> to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E
