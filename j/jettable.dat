40|$|Ink-jet {{printing}} is {{a relatively}} straightforward fabrication process. The targeted material deposition avoids material spill-over and is therefore very much applicable for processing of high-cost materials such as biological substances. Our objective is to identify biocompatible fluids that meet the needs for a stable piezo ink-jet printing process. We will present results concerning substrateactivation, ink-preparation, {{and the maintenance of}} biological functions during the ink-jet process. Recently, ink-jet printing technology has been used to fabricate electronic, medical, optical and polymeric devices [1, 2, 3, 4]. In contrast to classical coating techniques as spin-coating, dip-coating or spray-coating printing allows for patterned material deposition. Many formats of 2 -D drawings can be rasterized into X- and Y-coordinates and directly be converted into multi-material patterns via the printing process. The physico-chemical properties of inks determine their jettability: surface tension and viscosity are two primary chemical properties that determine printing success. The optimum viscosities for <b>jettable</b> fluids in piezo drop-on-demand printheads are 5 mPa s to 12 mPa s, surface tension has to be in the range of 24 mN/m to 33 mN/m. However, most biological materials are water-based and exhibit very low viscosities (0. 1 mPa s to 1 mPa s) and very high surface tension values (58 mN/m to 60 mN/m). In order to enable economical biofunctional substrate-coating and to integrate substrate-functionalization in a process capable of being fully automated we develop ink formulations containing biomolecules or (bio-) functional components...|$|E
40|$|The main {{challenge}} for the Dutch and European {{textile and clothing sector}} is to make a paradigm shift from labour intensive industry to knowledge based industry. This shift is essential for gaining a competitive edge and to develop innovative products and eco-friendly processes. A promising technology to achieve this is digital printing. This future oriented process is aimed to achieve high energy, water, and chemical savings and therefore a drastic reduction of waste. The technology breakthrough is based on a novel Eco-friendly flexible digital process. The basic components of Inkjet printers are hardware, software, inks and the substrate, which in this case is a textile. Inkjet processes can be divided in two main categories, image printing and functional printing. Image printing is already a mature technology and commercially available. The biggest advantages of inkjet printing over screen printing techniques is ease of operation, cost savings and most importantly ability to handle smaller volume (mass customisation). The functional printing is still in the research and development stage. It offers immense possibilities to bring various functional and nano-materials on textile surface on demand in a continuous process at atmospheric conditions and room temperature. Additionally functionality can be delivered at specific location on the textile with a possibility to apply more than one functionality either side by side or layer by layer. Inkjet processes could replace conventional high temperature and wet textile processes. Digital micro-disposal of fluids is expected to alter textile economics in terms of production speeds and on demand production. Nevertheless inkjet printing/finishing on textiles surfaces with different functional formulations is a major challenge. This is because of the close interaction between ink properties and chemistry, the piezo inkjets and the textile substrate. A typical process involves the development of stable <b>jettable</b> colloidal functional inks that will be delivered on well prepared textile substrate, followed by proper curing/fixation. The case we discuss in the manuscript is the development of a smart textile based heatable pair of trousers especially designed for people with disabilities. The inkjet printed textile samples were prepared and compared with conductive samples produced with well-established techniques such as weaving, knitting, nonwoven techniques and embroidering...|$|E
40|$|Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) {{is a solid}} {{freeform}} fabrication process used to generate solid parts directly from three-dimensional computer models. A part geometry is created by selectively depositing binder into sequentially spread layers of powder. In slurry-based 3 DP, a suspension of powder in a solvent is used to form the powderbed layer. This slurry-based powderbed yields higher green density and part resolution than dry powder-based 3 DP because of smaller particle size. Vector printing requires that the printhead trace and define the external geometries of a part before raster filling the interior, a new approach in comparison to conventional, raster-only printing. Drop-on-demand (DOD) printheads allow binder droplets to be ejected when needed rather than relying upon charge-and-deflect mechanisms used in continuous jet printheads. Integrating these concepts for vector, DOD printing {{has the potential to}} enhance the 3 DP process by providing greater part resolution and surface finish. The 3 DP slurry-based process and vector, drop-on-demand printing are examined as potential methods to produce Tungsten Carbide-Cobalt (WC-Co) tooling inserts. The research focuses on three fundamental process steps: (1) development of a stable slurry, (2) determination of jetting parameter values for optimal powderbed deposition, and (3) implementation of vector, DOD printing for the binder. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the first two objectives are only briefly introduced in Chapter 1 and summarized in Chapter 3. Further details may be found in the Diplomarbeit document of Olaf Dambon. Two approaches are explored to develop a stable, <b>jettable</b> slurry. One method involves using a water-based Tungsten Carbide slurry and a(cont.) Cobalt Acetate binder; the other method utilizes an alcohol-based Tungsten Carbide-Cobalt slurry and an organic binder. Various suspension properties, such as sedimentation density and viscosity, are measured to assess the degree of slurry stability. After adequate slurry formulations are developed, an investigation of powderbed formation is conducted. Due to the low solubility limit of the Cobalt salt in water and the persistent defects in water-based slurry powderbeds, the alcohol-based approach is pursued and, because of its greater efficacy, is used for optimizing powderbed jetting parameters. An effective combination of line spacing, flow rate, and drying time is determined for producing powderbeds with minimal surface roughness and high packing density. Experiments are subsequently conducted in vector DOD printing of various geometries using a piezo-actuated, drop-on-demand printhead and Bridgeport three-axis milling machine. A Hewlett-Packard inkjet cartridge is initially used for vector testing of the milling machine; a Siemens PT- 88 S printhead is used to assess and optimize binder droplet formation parameters, such as voltage waveform and fluid properties. Functional conditions for vector printing and DOD droplet generation are developed and deliver acceptable performance. Successfully printed geometries with high-definition lines (140 - 170 [mu]m line width) and smooth surface finish are produced using sanded, jetted alumina slurry powderbeds. Following necessary refinements in slurry redispersion and slurry-binder compatibility, the same vector process can be repeated with jetted WC-Co slurry powderbeds. by David Guo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audienceFabrication at {{low cost}} of {{transparent}} p-type semiconductors with suitable electronic properties is essential toward the scalability of many electronic devices, especially for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. In this context, {{the synthesis of}} mesoporous NiO films through inkjet printing of a sol−gel ink was investigated for the first time. Nickel chloride and Pluronic F- 127, used as nickel oxide precursor and pore-forming agent, respectively, were formulated in a water/ ethanol mixture to prepare a <b>jettable</b> ink for Dimatix printer. Multilayer NiO films were formed, and different morphologies could be obtained by playing on the interlayer thermal treatment. At low temperature (30 °C), a porous nano-particulate−nanofiber dual-pore structure was observed. On the other hand, with a high temperature treatment (450 °C), nanoparticulate denser films without any dual structure were obtained. The mechanism for NiO formation during the final sintering step, investigated by means of X-ray photolectron spectroscopy, shows that a Ni(OH) 2 species is an intermediate between NiCl 2 and NiO. The different morphologies and thicknesses of the NiO films were correlated to their performance in a p-DSSC configuration, using a new push−pull dye (so-called " RBG- 174 ") and an iodine-based electrolyte. Moreover, the positive impact of a nanometric NiO x layer deposited by spin-coating and introduced between FTO and the NiO mesoporous network is highlighted in the present work. The best results were obtained with NiO x /four layer-NiO mesoporous photocathodes of 860 nm, with a current density at the short circuit of 3. 42 mA cm − 2 (irradiance of 100 mW cm − 2 spectroscopically distributed following AM 1. 5). ■ INTRODUCTION Solar energy is the ideal source of energy because of its cleanliness, high power, and ready availability. However, for a massive use, the development of low-cost and efficient conversion devices is still needed. Among the different emerging cost-effective solar-cell technologies, nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promised to an industrial success. Indeed, DSSCs that consist of a photoactive anode and a passive cathode sandwiching an electrolyte (n-DSSCs) have shown high photon to energy conversion efficiencies (PCE), up to 13 %. 1 Moreover, the propensity of DSSCs to operate under diffuse light conditions is an important asset regarding market-dominating silica-based technology, which require direct light for optimized performance. The idea of tandem-DSSC (t-DSSC), in which both the anode and cathode are photoactive, has been raised over the last twenty years. 2 − 4 These devices show theoretical PCEs over 40 %, 5, 6 which is superior to the one photoelectrode configuration. However, with record PCE at 2. 42 %, 3 t-DSSCs have not beaten yet classical n-DSSCs. Indeed p-DSSCs (which consist of one photocathode and a passive anode) have presented moderate yields compared to n-DSSCs, with record PCE at 2. 51 %, with an iron-based electrolyte. 7 These low yields stem from (1) the low short-circuit (J sc) current densities that can be delivered, where J sc values of 7. 65 mA cm − 2 were reported with the record p-DSSC device, and (2) the poor fill factors (FF) obtained, as FF of 0. 51 in the same device were hardly reached. It is commonly assumed that the p-type oxide which is mostly used to build the photocathode, nickel oxide (NiO), is mainly responsible for the poor activity of the devices. However, a replacing material to NiO {{is yet to be}} found as p-type oxides are scarce. 8 − 10 Thus, research on NiO itself remains an important axis of work in the field of DSSCs. 11 − 16 This wide band gap semiconducting oxide should indeed also be a choice material for low-cost and carbon-free solar fuel production devices, 17 and then research on NiO, especially on its synthesis, is also crucial for this domain. A wide range of methods exists for the preparation of NiO, 16 among which is polymer-templated sol−gel synthesis, which has provided one of the current best NiO-based DSSCs. 4 However, for this preparation method, Scotch tape doctor-blading is used to deposit the ink onto the TCO glass substrate, and several authors reported a reproducibility issue. An alternative to doctor-blading is inkjet printing (IJP), and i...|$|E
