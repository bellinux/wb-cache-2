500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, {{there was no way she}} was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. <b>He</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|By mid-July, the composers had {{completed}} {{most of the}} score, but still were missing the title tune. Loewe was at the piano while Lerner was indisposed in the bathroom, and when the former began playing a melody the latter liked, he later recalled <b>he</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> [...] " [...] trousers still clinging to [...] ankles, {{and made his way}} to the living room. 'Play that again,' he said. And that melody ended up being the title song for Gigi." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24 Scates {{moved from}} player to coach. When the UCLA volleyball coach took a sabbatical, he offered Scates the job. Scates was {{surprised}} but accepted. He then went to meet with Athletic Director Wilbur Johns. [...] "He didn't even tell me to sit down," [...] Scates recalled. [...] "I told him that I cannot accept a salary for coaching volleyball because I {{wanted to be in}} the Olympics in 1964, and at that time if you coached a sport for money or played for money you were not considered an amateur and couldn't participate in the Olympics. [...] "When he heard that <b>he</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> shook my hand, and said, 'Congratulations, son, you're hired.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> {{from the}} throne, {{where he had}} seated himself. [...] "That is my call, and I am still the Royal Chamberlain, and will be until I appoint another in my place." ...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the singer}} {{was not always}} sweet and {{friendly}} towards women. When Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of Joan Crawford, visited Presley, they were watching Bonanza in the TV room. [...] "Elvis had been puffing on a cigar ... as Christina tickled him and kidded around, apparently seeking more direct attention." [...] Suddenly, as Buzz Cason relates, [...] "she slung the contents of her cocktail glass right into Elvis's face. ... The cigar went 'phhhtttt' and <b>he</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up.</b> ... He grabbed her by the hair. 'Get this bitch out of here!' he screamed, leading her {{toward the front door}} as she struggled {{to keep up with the}} rather quick pace as he was pulling her locks. Turmoil ensued as the 'boys' scrambled to assist trying to prevent too big of a scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, Callas {{was engaged}} to re-open the opera house in Chicago as Turandot, but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, who also was to star in this opera, was aware that Tullio Serafin {{was looking for a}} {{dramatic}} soprano to cast as La Gioconda at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being [...] "amazing—so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. I knew in a big outdoor theatre like Verona's, this girl, with her courage and huge voice, would make a tremendous impact." [...] Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition, Zenatello became so excited that <b>he</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> and joined Callas in the act 4 duet. It was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut.|$|E
2500|$|Yorke had {{recorded}} an early demo of [...] "The National Anthem" [...] when {{the band was}} still in school. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it for an OK Computer B-side, but decided to save it for their next album. For Kid A, Greenwood added ondes Martenot and sampled sounds from radio stations, and Yorke's vocals were processed with a ring modulator. In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the [...] "organised chaos" [...] of Town Hall Concert by the jazz musician Charles Mingus. Yorke and Greenwood directed the musicians {{to sound like a}} [...] "traffic jam"; according to Yorke, <b>he</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> and down so much during his conducting that he broke his foot. Radiohead also worked on several songs that were not completed until recording sessions for future albums, including [...] "I Will" [...] and [...] "A Wolf at the Door" [...] (released on Hail to the Thief), [...] "Nude" [...] (In Rainbows), [...] "Burn the Witch", and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] (A Moon Shaped Pool).|$|E
