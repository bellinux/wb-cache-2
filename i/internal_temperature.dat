5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its <b>internal</b> <b>temperature.</b> Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little <b>internal</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E

25|$|Because of ammonia's {{vaporization}} properties, it is {{a useful}} refrigerant. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of chlorofluorocarbons (Freons).

Along with its use in modern vapor-compression refrigeration it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in absorption refrigerators. The Kalina cycle, which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture.

40|$|The Egg Safety Action Plan {{released}} in 1999 raised questions concerning egg temperature {{used in the}} risk assessment model. Therefore, a national study was initiated to determine the <b>internal</b> and external <b>temperature</b> sequence of eggs from oviposition through distribution. Researchers gathered data from commercial egg production, shell egg processing, and distribution facilities. The experimental design was a mixed model with 2 random effects for season and geographic region and a fixed effect for operation type (inline or offline). For this report, internal and external egg temperature data were recorded at specific points during shell egg processing {{in the winter and}} summer months. In addition, <b>internal</b> egg <b>temperatures</b> were recorded in pre- and postshell egg processing cooler areas. There was a significant season × geographic region interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) for both surface and <b>internal</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Egg temperatures were lower in the winter vs. summer, but eggs gained in temperature from the accumulator to the postshell egg processing cooler. During shell egg processing, summer egg surface and <b>internal</b> <b>temperatures</b> were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than during the winter. When examining the effect of shell egg processing time and conditions, it was found that 2. 4 and 3. 8 °C were added to egg surface temperatures, and 3. 3 and 6. 0 °C were added to <b>internal</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the summer and winter, respectively. <b>Internal</b> egg <b>temperatures</b> were higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the preshell egg processing cooler area during the summer vs. winter, and <b>internal</b> egg <b>temperatures</b> were higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the summer when eggs were ¾ cool (temperature change required to meet USDA-Agricultural Marketing Service storage regulation of 7. 2 °C) in the postshell egg processing area.

25|$|Like all sauropods, Brachiosaurus was homeothermic (maintaining {{a stable}} <b>internal</b> <b>temperature)</b> and {{endothermic}} (controlling body temperature through internal means), {{meaning that it}} was able to actively control its body temperature ("warm-blooded"), producing the necessary heat through a high basic metabolic rate of its cells. In the past, Brachiosaurus has been used an example of a dinosaur for which endothermy is unlikely, because of the combination of great size (leading to overheating) and great caloric needs to fuel endothermy. However, these calculations were based on incorrect assumptions about the available cooling surfaces (the large air sacs were not known), and a grossly inflated body mass. These inaccuracies resulted in the overestimation of heat production and the underestimation of heat loss. The large nasal arch has been postulated as an adaptation for cooling the brain, as a surface for evaporative cooling of the blood.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes.

Another alternative use for sprinkler irrigation systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When temperature drop below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing frost damage that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against frost damage is to use the sprinkler irrigation system to coat the vines with a protective layer of water that freezes into ice.
