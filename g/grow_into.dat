5|$|Banksia menziesii {{has several}} horticultural {{features}} including patterned buds and follicles, attractive pinkish new growth, and showy flowerheads. A dwarf form is commonly sold in nurseries. Byron Lamont has observed that dwarf plants may <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> taller single-trunked plants in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E

5|$|Bulb offsets {{and tissue}} culture produce genetic clones {{of the parent}} plant and thus {{maintaining}} genetic integrity of the cultivars. Bulb offsets usually require {{at least a year}} before flowering. Commercially, plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> plants large enough to sell.|$|E
5|$|Calvin did {{not live}} to see the {{foundation}} of his work <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas to break out of their city of origin, to succeed far beyond their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Vasily Andreyev, a salon violinist, {{took up the}} {{balalaika}} in his performances for French tourists to Petersburg. The music became popular and soon Andreyev had organized a club of balalaika players. This club <b>grew</b> <b>into</b> an orchestra, which in time <b>grew</b> <b>into</b> a movement.|$|R

5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> civil strife.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Allison became {{involved}} in defence-related work. He was {{a consultant to the}} National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as a neutron moderator. The team he assembled in Chicago would <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Larger species often {{break up}} when stimulated, and the {{fragments}} often <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> full individuals. Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. All reproduce sexually, and most species are gonochoric (the sexes are separate), {{but all the}} freshwater forms are hermaphroditic.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} capital to feed rapid {{economic}} expansion also saw Birmingham <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> a major financial centre with extensive international connections. Lloyds Bank was founded in the town in 1765, and Ketley's Building Society, the world's first building society, in 1775. By 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London.|$|E
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, Bombay began to <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> a major trading town, and {{received}} a huge influx of migrants from across India. Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the Treaty of Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776), and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} at Johns Hopkins continued to <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> the next season. The school's {{attitude towards the}} series worsened {{to the point where}} the 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E

5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to <b>grow</b> <b>into</b> one of Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E
