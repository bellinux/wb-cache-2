50|$|The group {{participated in}} AFSWC Development Directorate {{investigated}} {{projects such as}} adding a parachute to a bomb to delay delivery, which allowed for the combat crew to release the bomb and escape before it exploded. The goal {{of one of the}} early lay-down projects was to determine the feasibility of delivering a parachute-retarded thermonuclear weapon weighing more than 40,000 pounds, the heaviest nuclear weapons in the stockpile, from altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet. One early effort was the development of a system that could retard the fall of either a TX-14 or a TX-16 weapon, heavy airburst bombs, from altitudes of 40,000 feet to 4,000 feet in 167 seconds from a B-36 Peacemaker.In 1956, however, AFSWC was directed to establish a permanent USAF Air Task Group for atmospheric tests. Thus, in 1956, the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was created, holding equal stature to the 4925th Test Group (Atomic). At that point, the atmospheric test participation of the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) was cut back and the group focused on the aircraft/weapon marriage mission. The group evaluated equipment for the installation of special weapons into aircraft.This included sway braces, bomb suspension and control systems, pylons and racks, <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> equipment, and control and monitor apparatus.|$|E
50|$|Their main {{armament}} of nine 16 in {{guns were}} mounted in triple turrets, the only RN battleships designed in this manner. The guns themselves deviated from standard British designs. Where previous RN weapons fired heavy shells {{at a moderate}} velocity, the Nelsons weapons followed the German practice of a lighter shell at a higher velocity. This change in Director of Naval Ordnance policy was due to British testing of surrendered German equipment after World War I, although much later, subsequent testing proved contradictory. Two different rifling rates were tried, and for some {{time there was a}} mixture of barrel types in different turrets, even sometimes within the same turret. The guns suffered considerable barrel wear and had a fairly large dispersion pattern, due mainly to the different riflings that each barrel had as they were refurbished over their lifespan. To compensate for barrel wear, muzzle velocities were reduced and a heavier (longer) shell was tried to offset this; but the cost of producing new shells, modifying shell handling and storage equipment came at a time when RN funding had been heavily reduced. Nevertheless, these weapons were not generally considered by the RN to be as successful as the previous BL 15 inch Mark I, although they were considered more successful than the BL 14-inch Mark VII fitted to the subsequent King George V-class battleships. The need to reduce displacement led to the use of triple mount turrets, which had early problems with the ammunition <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> machinery. The heavier weight of the triple in comparison to a twin turret meant increased stresses on the roller bearings when training the turrets. This was solved by the incorporation of spring-loaded vertical as well as conventional horizontal roller bearings. The triple mount turret proved itself when, in October 1929, a turret crew with two years' experience loaded and fired 33 consecutive rounds without mishap. The incorporation of many safety features, achieved with lighter materials, meant that the complex and relatively fragile equipment had to be serviced regularly over the ships' lifetime. These ships were fitted with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk I for surface fire control of the main armament.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} study of automatizing the manipulation process of tanned natural leather plies is presented. The considered leather plies are partially refined and their surface {{is suitable for}} grasping by suction grippers. The particular features (non-rigid structure, irregular shape and size, etc.) of such a material make the <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> on the workstations very critical and difficult to be approached. To increase the reliability of grasping, the development of customized vacuum cups seems to be advisable. In the paper, an innovative vacuum cup model is proposed. Its performances are quantitatively compared with a other models by means of appropriate measuring methods. Another problem concerning the automatic manipulation of leather plies is to avoid the grasping {{of more than one}} ply at a time, due to the irregularity of the ply profile. A device able to solve this problem, using an innovative equipment for moving the entire stack from the store to the workstation and for separating the plies, is also shown and discussed...|$|E

The shells alone weighed about 13 pounds including an explosive bursting charge of 0.81 pounds for anti-aircraft (AA) rounds or 1.27 pounds for High Capacity (HC) rounds, {{the remainder of the}} weight being the steel casing. Maximum range was 14,600 yards at 45 degrees elevation and ceiling was 29800 ft at 85 degrees elevation. Useful life expectancy was 4300 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel.|$|R
40|$|Twenty goats {{which served}} as the {{experimental}} group were administered ascorbic acid (AA) per os at a dosage rate of 100 mg/kg body mass, while 20 others served as controls and were given 10 mt each of sterile water. Forty minutes after the administration and loading, the goats were transported for 12 h. <b>Handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> of the experimental and control groups of goats decreased (P < 0. 05) the potassium and sodium serum concentrations. The concentration of serum chloride, sodium and calcium increased significantly (P< 0. 05) immediately post-transportation, while potassium and magnesium decreased (P < 0. 05) in the control goats. In AA-treated goats sodium and magnesium concentrations decreased abruptly (P< 0. 05), while calcium increased significantly (P< 0. 05) after transportation. Handling, loading and transportation adversely affected the electrolyte balance of the goats which suggested respiratory alkalosis, dehydration and muscular damage in the transported goats, and the administration of AA alleviated the adverse effects of road transportation stress on serum electrolytes. </span...|$|E
40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} are {{the cells}} of the immune system that may recognize glycolipids as antigens. T cells recognize lipids associated with the non-polymorphic molecules of the CD 1 family present on the membrane of antigen-presenting cells. CD 1 molecules contain hydrophobic pockets, which bind a large variety of lipid molecules in various manners. Lipid antigenicity is determined by their mode of uptake, membrane trafficking properties, degradation within endosomal compartments and capacity to form stable complexes with CD 1. Extracellular and intracellular lipid binding proteins participate in lipid <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> on CD 1 molecules within antigen-presenting cells. Recent crystal structures have disclosed how the T cell receptor contacts CD 1 -lipid complexes, revealing the contribution of both CD 1 and lipid residues in making functionally relevant contacts. Lipid-specific T cells are important in autoimmunity, cancer surveillance, protection during infections, and in immunoregulation. The immunogenicity of lipids is being exploited in novel approaches to immunotherapy, including inhibition of autoimmunity and anti-cancer and bacterial vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The non-adherence to agreed Train Handling Times (THT) {{can cause}} fines {{of up to}} R 250   000 for XCSA. Train {{resources}} are under pressure and the THT process is unstable. Several factors are contributing to the THT not achieving the target of 12 hours. This document explains the study undertaken to establish the causes for poor THT performance and provides time study results, as well as recommendations to improve THT’s for Boschmans Colliery. The train <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> activities at Boschmans require {{a number of different}} resources and stakeholders to work together effectively. Coordination, measurement and reporting are critical management tools that should be used to effectively manage the process. The root cause of the problem is multi dimensional, which also explains the variance of the THT measures over the last six months. This study therefore recommends the implementation of key measures to manage the important parameters as identified earlier in this report. Thesis (B Eng.

40|$|Abstract — The {{effectiveness}} and scalability of MapReducebased implementations of complex data-intensive tasks depend {{on an even}} redistribution of data between map and reduce tasks. In the presence of skewed data, sophisticated redistribution approaches thus become necessary to achieve load balancing among all reduce tasks to be executed in parallel. For the complex problem of entity resolution, we propose and evaluate two approaches for such skew <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>load</b> balancing. The approaches support blocking techniques to reduce the search space of entity resolution, utilize a preprocessing MapReduce job {{to analyze the data}} distribution, and distribute the entities of large blocks among multiple reduce tasks. The evaluation on a real cloud infrastructure shows the value and effectiveness of the proposed load balancing approaches. I...|$|R

40|$|Previously, GNB of Essen, Germany {{developed}} the CASTOR series of {{ductile cast iron}} container systems for the storage and shipping of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The CASTOR system has been accepted and deployed internationally by GNB.

40|$|Cross-docking is a {{logistic}} {{strategy in}} which products arrive at terminals, are handled and then {{shipped to the}} corresponding destinations. Cross-docking consists of unloading products from inbound trucks and loading these products directly into outbound trucks {{with little or no}} storage in-between. Cross-docking aims to reduce or eliminate inventory by achieving an efficient synchronization of unloading trucks, material <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> trucks. This thesis introduces an integrated dock-door assignment and vehicle routing problem that consists of assigning a set of origin points to inbound doors at the cross-dock, consolidating commodities in-between inbound and outbound doors, and routing vehicles from outbound doors to destination points. The objective is to minimize the sum of the material handling cost at the cross-dock and the transportation cost for routing the commodities to their destinations. Five mixed integer programming formulations are presented and computationally compared. A column generation algorithm based on a set partitioning formulation is developed to obtain lower bounds on the optimal solution value. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is used to obtain upper bounds.

They were the fusil Mle 1902 ("rifle, model of 1902") and the fusil Mle 1907, which were issued respectively to Indochinese and Senegalese Tirailleur troops. Lighter <b>and</b> easier to <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> <b>load</b> than the Mle 1886/M93 Lebel rifle, the Berthier rifles proved more suitable for offhand shooting and easier to maintain in tropical environments. In comparison to the Mle 1886 Lebel, the Berthier's sights were also wider, higher and more substantial. Like their shorter carbine counterparts, these Berthier rifles also featured a Mannlicher-type 3-round en bloc clip-loaded magazine and used 8 mm Lebel ammunition.
