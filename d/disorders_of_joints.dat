5000|$|Children's Island was {{for many}} years the {{location}} of a failed Island House (Lowell island house), and was finally donated by its final owner, Mr. Fredrick Rindge, to develop {{what became known as the}} [...] "Children's Island Sanitarium, a corporation duly established...subject to the following conditions ‘That said property shall be used by the Children's Island Sanitarium only for the use and purpose for which said corporation was organized...and the property will revert and reinvest in me and my heirs and assigns.'” Additionally, he stressed that “children of every race, color and religion should be received there." [...] The Sisterhood of Margaret of Boston were chosen to run the Sanitarium. This society was already very involved in the Children's Hospital in Boston and the Sea-Shore Home in Winthrop, so its members had experience with the recovery of ill or crippled children. In the late 19th century, “sea air was looked upon as almost a panacea for that class of disorders of nutrition which is shown in the <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> and bones,...(and) in adopting the sea coast plan for their Institute the managers of the Lowell Island Sanitorium...hope that the beneficial effect of sea air would be especially manifest in children suffering from chronic malnutrition, a belief which is entertained by all medical authorities.”. On July 11, 1886 the Children's Island Sanitarium was opened for nearly two months and hosted a total of 150 children “exposed to the summer diseases of crowded cities, or to children...troubled by the affliction popularly called ‘rickets’.” The children were carefully selected and initially “boys under 10 and girls of any age or race, suffering from the chronic diseases which are benefited by a marine atmosphere, such as rickets, hip, spinal diseases, etc.; also, for children convalescing from severe operations” were eligible for admission. “Children (were) admitted free when circumstances demand(ed).

40|$|A {{child with}} obesity - {{education}} of parents In recent years children obesity {{is taking the}} character of worldwide epidemics. This tendency is among others caused by the change of eating habits and composition of diet rich in fats and sugars. The occurrence of obesity is further caused by gene base of a child and lifestyle in which the physical activity of children is decreasing and children spend their free time especially in front of televisions and computers. Obesity itself worsens health state and the life quality of a child, who consequently suffers from health and psychical problems. These children are often exposed to laughter and bully by their contemporaries. This condition leads to their effacing themselves to seclusion, feelings of anxiety; the children become solitaires and compensate everything by higher intake of food. Obesity in children is a very hardly curable diagnosis. In {{quite a lot of}} them combating obesity is not successful and obesity outlasts in adulthood. Health complications as <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure or various heart problems are also linked to this disorder. A nurse {{plays an important role in}} care of children with obesity. Together with a doctor she works on detecting children with obesity and his or her preventive actions can lead to decreasing of risks and complications connected with children obesity. A nurse educates children and parents about the problem of obesity, possible consequences and complications connected with this diagnosis, and provides advice and emotional support at changes of lifestyle of obese children and their families. The thesis was processed using quantitative research by the method of questioning and the technique of a questionnaire. Researched group was composed of children with obesity or overweight children and their parents. Questionnaires were distributed in outpatient clinics of general practitioners for children and teenagers and also children hospitalized in teaching hospital in Pilsen. We chose two aims of the thesis. First we wanted to find out the parents´ informedness of the problem of obesity and second to find out lifestyle in the family with an obese child. We can conclude that parents are informed of the problem and complications of obesity; however they do not follow healthy lifestyle. Further we chose three hypotheses. Parents are informed of the problem of obesity. This hypothesis was proved. Parents are not informed of complications in connection with obesity in their children. This hypothesis was disproved. Children with obesity do not follow healthy lifestyle principles. This hypothesis was also proved. The results of this thesis research can serve as a study material and are offered to parents who participated in the research...|$|E

In mice, a complete loss of noggin protein leads to multiple malformations including joint fusion, whereas mice heterozygous for Nog loss-of-function mutations are normal. In humans, heterozygous NOG missense mutations {{have been found in}} patients with two autosomal dominant <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> development, multiple synostosis syndrome (SYNS 1) and a milder disorder proximal symphalangism (SYM 1). This study investigated the effect of one SYNS 1 and two SYM 1 disease-causing missense mutations on the structure and function of noggin. The SYNS 1 mutation abolished, and the SYM 1 mutations reduced, the secretion of functional noggin dimers in transiently transfected COS- 7 cells. Coexpression of mutant noggin with wild-type noggin, to resemble the heterozygous state, did not interfere with wild-type noggin secretion. These data indicate that the human disease-causing mutations are hypomorphic alleles that reduce secretion of functional dimeric noggin. Therefore, we conclude that noggin has both species-specific and joint-specific dosage-dependent roles during joint formation. Surprisingly, in contrast to the COS- 7 cell studies, the SYNS 1 mutant was able to form dimers in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This finding indicates that there also exist species-specific differences in the ability to process mutant noggin polypeptides...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Two {{cases of}} {{synovial}} chondromatosis <b>of</b> the temporomandibular <b>joint</b> (TMJ) are presented, including correlation of CT and MR imaging characteristics with surgical and pathologic findings. The usefulness of CT and MR imaging {{in the diagnosis}} <b>of</b> TMJ <b>disorders</b> is discussed. Synovial chondromatosis is a benign tumorlike <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>joint</b> characterized by chondrome-taplasia of the synovial membrane, in which carti-laginous nodules form and may become peduncu-lated and/or detach from the synovial membrane, becoming loose bodies within the joint space.

Synovial chondromatosis of the TMJ, first described by Auhausen in 1933, is rare, with only about 40 cases reported in the literature.

40|$|Background Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} auto-inflammatory <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints.</b> The present study aimed {{to identify the}} key genes in RA for better understanding the underlying mechanisms of RA. Methods The integrated analysis of expression profiling was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RA. Moreover, functional annotation, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and transcription factor (TF) regulatory network construction were applied for exploring the potential biological roles of DEGs in RA. In addition, the expression level of identified candidate DEGs was preliminarily detected in peripheral blood cells of RA patients in the GSE 17755 dataset. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the expression levels of identified DEGs in RA. Results A total of 378 DEGs, including 202 up- and 176 down-regulated genes, were identified in synovial tissues of RA patients compared with healthy controls. DEGs were significantly enriched in axon guidance, RNA transport and MAPK signaling pathway. RBFOX 2, LCK and SERBP 1 were the hub proteins in the PPI network. In the TF-target gene network, RBFOX 2, POU 6 F 1, WIPF 1 and PFKFB 3 had the high connectivity with TFs. The expression status of 11 candidate DEGs was detected in GSE 17755, the expression levels of MAT 2 A and NSA 2 were significantly down-regulated and CD 47 had the up-regulated tendency in peripheral blood cells of patients with RA compared with healthy individuals. qRT-PCR results of MAT 2 A, NSA 2, CD 47 were compatible with our bioinformatics analyses.
