50|$|The railway {{has four}} {{passenger}} carriages, all built on site {{and based on}} those built for the Manx Electric Railway, Torrington and Marland Railway and the Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway. There are also several ex. RNAD box vans, slate <b>wagons</b> and <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{acquired}} four locomotives, {{of which}} numbers 3 and 4 were 0-4-0 saddle-tank engines, built in 1881 by Ruston, Proctor and Company with works numbers 7272 and 7273. They were supplied through agents Sinclaire, Hamilton and Company in 1881, along with 150 four-wheel <b>tip</b> <b>wagons</b> built by Brown, Marshall and Company.|$|R
5000|$|Types of wagon {{produced}} by Robert Hudson Ltd were many and varied. Principal types included the <b>tipping</b> <b>wagon</b> mentioned above, in all gauges up to standard gauge, and typified by the [...] "Rugga" [...] <b>tipping</b> <b>wagon,</b> {{introduced in the}} 1930s to replace the earlier Victory skip wagons. Rugga wagons were primarily produced for [...] and [...] gauges, but like all Hudson products, could be manufactured to any gauge required. Although it is not often appreciated, Rugga wagons were built {{in a range of}} sizes from the smallest at 13.5 cubic feet (0.5 cubic yard or 0.38 cubic metres) up to a huge 54 cubic feet (2 cubic yards or 1.53 cubic metres). Variations included [...] "light" [...] versions for hand-tramming, medium duty for light work using locomotives, through to heavy duty for more extreme conditions and materials such as rocks. The heavier duty versions had thicker metal bodies, double ball bearing races in each axlebox and usually a central stiffening girder. Hudson s boasted that [...] " [...] at any time several thousand Rugga wagons are in stock, for immediate delivery" ...|$|R
25|$|There was {{a dispute}} with Manlove Alliot in May 1894 over the number of railway wagons to be supplied. The Corporation thought they had ordered 20 <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> for the {{transport}} of the sludge cakes, but only four were supplied by Manlove Alliot, and eight extra wagons, which they had used during construction, were also being used for this purpose. The Corporation eventually ordered eight more. The wagons were moved using both manual labour and horses.|$|R
50|$|The {{necessary}} {{land was}} acquired by the LSWR with the War Department's assistance, and construction was completed within 18 months {{at a cost of}} £30,000. In total, 155 men using three locomotives, four <b>tip</b> <b>wagons</b> and three horses were involved. The line was officially opened on 11 December 1905 from a bay platform at Bentley station. Eight trains were run from Bentley to Bordon on weekdays, with seven return services (except for Saturday when there were eight). Two trains ran each way on Sundays.|$|R
500|$|The railway also developed, {{with the}} {{acquisition}} of [...] of portable track and six <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> in 1889, a steam crane later the same year, and more wagons in 1891 and 1892. The first locomotive arrived in 1898, after its purchase from the Yorkshire Engine Company. It was an 0-4-0 saddle tank, which had been built in 1875 {{for use as a}} contractor's engine, and had been refurbished by the manufacturer. A maintenance contract for the wagons lapsed in 1900, as the men at the works had become proficient at repairs.|$|R
50|$|When the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1916 {{suffered}} from the appalling ground conditions, which restricted the supply of materials to the front line, a report by Sir Eric Geddes of the North Eastern Railway recommended implementation for 60 cm gauge railways, following which the War Office ordered 7,000 miles of prefabricated track, the majority of which was sent to France, along with around 6,000 <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> and 5,000 bogie wagons of varying designs. Almost everything supplied was made to Robert Hudson designs, albeit by various manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The spoil {{from the}} shaft was emptied into the <b>tipping</b> <b>wagon</b> {{which was then}} pushed along the spoil heap on the tracks to the end where it was tipped off, thus forming the {{characteristic}} 'finger' spoil heaps of most small Black country pits. The machine also on the rails behind the spoil wagon is an early electrical coal cutter the arm extending from the front moved through an arc and cut a corresponding arc in the coal seam which then allowed the coal to drop down in big lumps. One the shaft was established the sinking engine would either be dismantled and sold on or kept to use in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|A {{sand and}} gravel pit was {{established}} in the south-west of the parish in the 1930s, located parallel and south of Pant Drain, the site's development was driven by the 1930s building boom. The extracted material, which lay less than 1 foot below the ground was washed and grade separated on site by a rotary screen. By 1938 a rail tramway had been built to transport the excavated material to the main road - the line ran southwards from the midpoint of the B1445 between Welwick and Patrington, passing west of Haverfield House, to Oxlands Hill, and used a diesel shunting locomotive capable of hauling 120 tons; the material was transported in short wheelbase side <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{were used}} almost {{exclusively}} within slate quarries. They transported waste slate from the mills to the dumps. These were often crude vehicles that were heavily abused during service. They typically {{consisted of a}} basic flat waggon with a three-sided iron body that held the waste. The waste slate was usually <b>tipped</b> from the <b>wagon</b> onto the slate tips, usually by physically <b>tipping</b> the entire <b>wagon</b> and its contents.|$|R
50|$|The company's main {{products}} were their 3-ton and 5-ton wagons, {{and these were}} produced in {{a whole range of}} variations, including Articulated 6-wheeler, Gully cleaning wagon, Brewers wagon, Bus bodied wagon, Municipal dustcart, Street watering wagon, Tar spraying <b>wagon,</b> <b>Tipping</b> <b>wagon</b> and many more. In addition the company produced a range of tractors for both road and agricultural use. Another popular product for municipal use was their lightweight patching roller, used for road repair. In 1924 the company introduced their superb Mann Express wagon, with shaft drive, high-speed engine and fully enclosed cab. Unfortunately this wagon was not a commercial success and by 1926 Mann's Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company was in trouble. Despite attempts to provide additional finance {{it was not possible to}} save the company, and in 1929 the works closed completely.|$|R
50|$|Other {{exhibits}} {{include a}} working steam winch, hauling a narrow gauge incline railway using side <b>tipping</b> skip <b>wagons</b> {{to assist with}} the ash removal; various other engines (steam and otherwise); a print room with a large collection of old printing technology including a Linotype machine; a large collection of electrical apparatuses and more.|$|R
5|$|In 1976, a new diesel {{shunting}} locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now look at that!" [...] said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son {{stood on}} the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled a little group in {{silhouette}} against the sky, a horse, a small truck, and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens. At the end the man <b>tipped</b> the <b>wagon.</b> There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.|$|R
25|$|Coal was {{stored at}} a 'linhay' (a lean-to shed {{with an open}} front) which stood {{opposite}} the Company's engine and carriage sheds. It was originally carried across from Bideford L Station on horse carts and <b>tipped</b> into railway <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
2500|$|At the tunnel's {{southern}} end, {{the canal}} {{was on the}} [...] contour, and Taylor constructed an inclined plane to drop the level by [...] to the quay at Morwellham. There were two tracks, one running to the quay, and a second which ended some [...] higher at ore-chutes above the Lower Copper Quay. The rails were initially [...] "L" [...] shaped cast iron plate rails, spaced [...] apart between the flanges, although trough-shaped rails were used in places on the quay, particularly where roads crossed the tracks. Four-wheeled <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> which had larger wheels at the front than at the rear were used on the twin tracks, which operated independently. The system was powered by a large overshot waterwheel, [...] in diameter and [...] wide, situated alongside the winding house {{at the head of}} the incline, which was fed with water from the canal. It drove a declutchable winch, to which the wagons were attached by chains. Wagons arriving at the top of the incline passed onto a sloping platform, which moved to a horizontal position due to the weight of the wagon, and this disconnected the waterwheel from the drum holding the chain. The rails were later replaced by wrought iron edge rails, and the chains by cables.|$|R
5000|$|At the tunnel's {{southern}} end, {{the canal}} {{was on the}} 250 ft contour, and Taylor constructed an inclined plane to drop the level by 237 ft to the quay at Morwellham. There were two tracks, one running to the quay, and a second which ended some 30 ft higher at ore-chutes above the Lower Copper Quay. The rails were initially [...] "L" [...] shaped cast iron plate rails, spaced 46 in apart between the flanges, although trough-shaped rails were used in places on the quay, particularly where roads crossed the tracks. Four-wheeled <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> which had larger wheels at the front than at the rear were used on the twin tracks, which operated independently. The system was powered by a large overshot waterwheel, 28 ft in diameter and 4 ft wide, situated alongside the winding house {{at the head of}} the incline, which was fed with water from the canal. It drove a declutchable winch, to which the wagons were attached by chains. Wagons arriving at the top of the incline passed onto a sloping platform, which moved to a horizontal position due to the weight of the wagon, and this disconnected the waterwheel from the drum holding the chain. The rails were later replaced by wrought iron edge rails, and the chains by cables.|$|R
5000|$|To get the {{ironstone}} {{from the}} new quarries to the station, the Partnership's standard-gauge line was extended down the hillside where it passed under {{the north end of}} the B&CDR's viaduct. A tipping-dock here enabled ore to be <b>tipped</b> into standard-gauge <b>wagons</b> from a one foot eight inch tramway above. The tipping dock was known locally as the [...] "tip-up" [...] or [...] "kick-up".|$|R
50|$|Before the Capture of Tucson (1846) a Mormon Battalion marched across {{southern}} Arizona {{along the}} San Pedro River, north of Tucson, there the Mormon soldiers fought the humorously named Battle Of the Bulls. The Mormon soldiers encountered wild cattle {{along the banks}} of the San Pedro River where several bulls charged their column, <b>tipping</b> over <b>wagons</b> and killing mules and injuring two soldiers. The soldiers shot and killed a number of the wild cattle. The soldiers sarcastically named the encounter the “Battle of the Bulls.” On December 16, 1846, they marched into Tucson. The smaller Mexican garrison of Fort Tucson, quickly fled without conflict. A brief occupation ensued and then the Mormons continued their march to the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, {{the era of}} the Great Depression, {{the city}} of Hanover lacked the {{necessary}} finance for the commencement of the Maschsee project, even though the project had already been planned some ten years earlier. The project was favourable for the Nazi Party that came to power in January 1933 as it would help reduce unemployment levels, which was a central theme of their propaganda. On 28 November 1933 the project was approved {{at a meeting of the}} city council. On 21 March 1934 the first ground was broken in the Leine swamp. Despite the unsettled financing of the project, it provided many people with work. Driven by the harshness of the economic situation of the time, they took on tough working conditions and low pay which was barely much higher than unemployment support. During construction fourteen locomotive trains with 365 <b>tipping</b> <b>wagons</b> were used along a 15 km track as well as diggers and five crawler tractors. Many workers though had to supply their own tools. Initially there were 100 people working on the project, but by its completion 1,650 people had been involved to excavate roughly 780,000 square metres of earth to create the lake basin. With the Maschsee project fully completed by early 1936, the official opening took place on 21 May 1936. Hundreds of thousands of Hanoverians and guests looked on from the edge of the lake as the event began with the then-typical trooping of the Nazi Party. In addition some 6,000 sporting persons took part in a rally along with the armed forces and public officials. During World War II the lake was covered up with canvasses and fake landscapes created on floating islands created, in an attempt to confuse Allied bomber pilots of their whereabouts during air raids on Hanover.|$|R
50|$|The {{wagon body}} {{consisted}} of vertical steel profiles filled in with wooden planks, {{held together by}} a steel frame at the top. The body was reinforced with diagonal ties that ran {{from the top of}} the body to the bottom nearer the door. In the centre of the wagon was a pressed steel double door. The sides were 1,550 mm high. These wagons were built with and without a brakeman's cab, the cab where present being set directly on the chassis. The end walls folded down so that the truck could be emptied by <b>tipping.</b> These <b>wagons</b> were designed to a payload of 20 tonnes, had a carrying capacity of 21 tonnes, length over buffers 9,800 mm with brakeman's cab and 9,100 mm without. The wheelbase was standardised at 4,500 mm and the loading volumen was 33 m³.|$|R
5000|$|From 1951-57, Evans and Rogers {{starred in}} the highly {{successful}} television series The Roy Rogers Show, in which they continued their cowboy and cowgirl roles, with her riding her trusty buckskin horse, Buttermilk. Alice Van-Springsteen served as a double for both Evans and Gail Davis, the actress who {{starred in the}} syndicated series Annie Oakley, often performing such tasks as <b>tipping</b> over <b>wagons</b> and jumping railroad tracks. In addition to her successful TV shows, more than 30 films and some 200 songs, Evans wrote the well-known song [...] "Happy Trails". In later episodes of the program, she was outspoken in her Christianity, telling people that God would assist them with their troubles and imploring adults and children to turn to Him for guidance. In late 1962, the couple co-hosted a comedy-western-variety program, The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show, which aired on ABC. It was canceled after three months, losing in the ratings to the first season of The Jackie Gleason Show.|$|R
50|$|Specific wagons {{were built}} for special traffics, {{including}} diagrams O12 and O13 with end doors that allowed china clay to be unloaded into ships by <b>tipping</b> the whole <b>wagon.</b> Diagram O25 were built with hopper discharge {{in the floor}} for grain traffic, while O27 had strengthened underframes for their heavy tinplate traffic. Diagrams N23, N24, N31 and N32 were large 20 ton iron opens built for coal traffic, {{many of which were}} hired to specific collieries or coal merchants at cheap rates as these were more efficient for the railway to haul than the 12 ton wooden vehicles that these businesses generally owned and operated themselves at the time.|$|R
5000|$|At the ashpits, the grate, ashpan and smokebox of {{the steam}} {{locomotive}} were cleaned {{as part of}} its disposal routine after duties. The combustion of coal left behind about 20% of combustion residue. This was scraped off with various implements (scrapers, hooks and special brushes) and emptied into the ashpit (Schlackegrube or Schlackekanal) which were located on special ashpit tracks in the open. The ash and cinders were left in the pit until it was emptied. This was either carried out by hand or with a hoist (Schrägaufzug) (see photograph right). By this means, the ash was shovelled into trolleys, which were lifted and <b>tipped</b> into a <b>wagon</b> that then transport the ash away.|$|R
500|$|The western dam caused {{much more}} trouble, since it rested on mud that varied in depth to upwards of [...] The {{ends of the}} dam were formed by <b>tipping</b> earth from <b>wagons</b> run out from the {{mainland}} and the island. In the centre, the earth sank into the deep mud and slid away with it. A viaduct of timber piles was built across the gap, to carry loaded trucks from which the earth was thrown out. As the ends approached each other, the tide current was too fast. The contractor twice tried {{to close the gap}} with earth at low-water neap tide, but each time the water broke through to make a gap [...] wide through which the tide poured at [...]|$|R
5000|$|As at Colton the {{workings}} at Timwood used [...] gauge hopper wagons underground, but the mine entrance {{was so close}} to the WSMR and so close to its level that wagons could be hand worked to a movable crossing over the WSMR line then <b>tipped</b> direct into <b>wagons</b> bound for the harbour, thereby avoiding multiple handling. Apart from small amounts discovered while pursuing their main target, this method of working remained an aspiration, because the Syndicate ran out of money in 1909, it had many costs and almost no income. It voted to be wound up on 24 March 1910 and its assets were auctioned off on 28 June that year, with Timwood's tunnel 1600 ft long [...] "but still well short of ore-bearing ground".|$|R
50|$|The western dam caused {{much more}} trouble, since it rested on mud that varied in depth to upwards of 40 ft. The {{ends of the}} dam were formed by <b>tipping</b> earth from <b>wagons</b> run out from the {{mainland}} and the island. In the centre, the earth sank into the deep mud and slid away with it. A viaduct of timber piles was built across the gap, to carry loaded trucks from which the earth was thrown out. As the ends approached each other, the tide current was too fast. The contractor twice tried {{to close the gap}} with earth at low-water neap tide, but each time the water broke through to make a gap 80 ft wide through which the tide poured at 5 mph.|$|R
5000|$|By 1857 a small {{ironworks}} {{was established}} called Heyford Ironworks. It was on {{east of the}} west coast main railway {{on a piece of}} land bounded by the railway, the road to Upper Stowe (Furnace Lane) and the canal. It used ore from the Blisworth area mostly, but also for a short time local ore from a quarry {{on the other side of}} the raiway,a little to the south at Heyford Hills. The ore was possibly transported to the works by horse and cart or by an inclined tramway up to the railway where it would have been <b>tipped</b> into railway <b>wagons</b> for the very short trip to the works. The quarry was in operation from 1863 to 1868. The works closed in the early 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Some {{professional}} tools used by surgeons, blacksmiths, carpenters, farmers, etc. {{were carried}} by nearly all. Shovels, crow bars, picks, hoes, mattocks, saws, hammers, axes and hatchets {{were used to}} clear or make a road through trees or brush, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon where necessary. In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often {{along the top of}} ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys. Because the <b>wagons</b> <b>tipped</b> over easily on a side hill they were often dragged straight up a steep hill, with multiple teams if necessary and then skidded straight down the opposite side with chained up wheels if required.|$|R
5000|$|A Roman coin {{was found}} in old {{workings}} at Kennesome Hill, suggesting great age. In Victorian times it had been worked {{on a small scale}} before 1867. In 1871 [...] "Curtis's Drift" [...] was started, reaching 100 ft by September 1874. Considerable development took place at Kennesome Hill, including an aerial ropeway (referred to locally as the [...] "Flying Machine") to convey output to a siding next to Langham Hill pit, where it was <b>tipped</b> into WSMR <b>wagons.</b> This arrangement lasted until 1876, after which ore was taken from the mine to Gupworthy by a 660 yd horse-drawn tramway. The mine closed with its neighbours in 1879, but re-opened later the same year, going on with the Gupworthy pits to become the most productive of the orefield's final years; it closed for good in September 1883. In November 1877 the company was fined for not providing a proper platform for workers at the mine.|$|R
5000|$|Iron Ore was quarried to {{the east}} of Halstead {{on the north side of}} the Oakham Road between 1880 and about 1900, between 1912 and 1921 and between 1924 and 1961. Between 1880 and 1950 the {{quarries}} were on the west side of railway and from 1950 to 1961 on the east side. At first the ore was taken by standard gauge tramway to a tipping stage north of Tilton station where it was <b>tipped</b> into railway <b>wagons</b> in sidings. Horses pulled wagons on the tramway. From 1912 a narrow gauge tramway was used, still with horse haulage. Steam locomotives replaced the horses in 1928 which operated until 1950 [...] When the new quarries in the east of the railway were opened in that year and the old tramway closed, the ore was taken to the tipping dock by lorries which crossed over the railway by a new Bailey Bridge. Quarrying was done by hand with the aid of explosives until 1933 when a petrol parafin machine was brought in. From 1936 diesel machines were used.|$|R
50|$|In 1866, Savage took a tour {{of major}} {{photography}} studios in the United States, both to improve his photography skills and to publish reproductions of his photos. In San Francisco, he met Carleton Watkins, who described his method for producing large works by placing developed negatives in a water bath until {{he was ready to}} finish them. Savage noted that Watkins's method was cumbersome, but envied his results. Savage traveled by boat to New York city, where progress in photography instruction and technology inspired him. After having a darkroom wagon custom-made, he traveled with a group of Mormon settlers back to Salt Lake City. While in New York City, Savage made an agreement with Samuel R. Wells, who sold photos that Savage took, while Savage sold Wells's publications in his photography studio back in Utah. Savage made similar agreements with other distributors. Savage spent $3,400 on photographic supplies from E. and H.T. Anthony Co. in New York City. Most of the supplies were lost when his <b>wagon</b> <b>tipped</b> over while crossing the Platte River on his return trip. Savage paid back some of the debt over nine years, but stopped paying {{when he was on the}} verge of bankruptcy. The company sued him, and after a long legal battle, the debt was settled in 1883.|$|R
5000|$|During the First Battle of Bull Run, [...] Brig. Gen. [...] Thomas J. Jackson and his [...] Confederate {{soldiers}} {{had taken up}} positions on Henry House Hill. During the battle General Jackson was pushed off of the hill many times by the 14th Brooklyn. The General gave the 14th its famous nickname, [...] "Red Legged Devils" [...] because of their relentless charges up the hill. Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, commander of the Federal forces, had been ordered by Abraham Lincoln to engage a large Rebel force that was led by Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard {{in an effort to}} end the Civil War with one decisive battle. Union {{soldiers had}} been ordered up the hill. Under huge amounts of enemy fire the Southerners held back the Federal soldiers with heavy losses. Brig. Gen. [...] Barnard Bee shouted to his men, [...] "There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Follow me." [...] That gave Thomas Jackson the famous nickname Stonewall. In the retreat from the hill, a Union <b>wagon</b> <b>tipped</b> over on Cub Run Bridge, blocking the Federal retreat, causing many of the undisciplined volunteers to drop their rifles and run.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mine was}} {{substantial}} both {{above and below}} ground. In 1857 an extensive and expensive adit was driven from the lower workings {{to emerge from the}} hillside below Sea View House. This involved extensive trialling of a tunnel boring machine which proved [...] "greatly underpowered and in danger of knocking itself to pieces". This adit drained the mine to a depth of 110 ft, but considerable machinery was needed to drain the mine's eventual depth of 692 ft (achieved in 1879, the year the orefield first closed) and to wind ore to the surface. Raleigh's cross mine {{was the only one in}} the orefield to require an engine for each role. The engine which wound ore to the surface was mounted in the first floor of the substantial pithead buildings, it pulled the mine's narrow gauge tramway wagons along the sloping drift out of the ground and onto a platform above a standard gauge siding so the ore could be <b>tipped</b> directly into <b>wagons</b> beneath. The same building also housed a heated room for miners to dry their clothes and a Miners' Literature Institute. Raleigh's Cross and the two Carnarvon mines formed the nucleus of the mining community of Brendon Hill.|$|R
