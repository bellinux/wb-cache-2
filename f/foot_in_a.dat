5|$|Barton {{stayed on}} with Newcastle United {{after they were}} relegated to the Championship, playing six out of Newcastle's opening eight league matches, but {{suffered}} an injury to his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 win against Plymouth Argyle on 19 September. He returned in April for Newcastle, playing all nine of Newcastle's remaining league fixtures and scoring his only goal of the campaign from a free kick in a win over Peterborough United. Due to the form of Danny Guthrie and Kevin Nolan, Barton had to play left wing when he returned.|$|E

5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{footprint}} carved in stone, signifying {{that they would}} {{follow in the footsteps}} of their predecessors. The kingship of the unified kingdom of Alba had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practices. Iona, the early centre of Scottish Christianity, became the burial site of the early kings of Scotland until the eleventh century, when the House of Canmore adopted Dunfermline near Scone.|$|E

5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal bone in his right <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth {{on one of his}} testicles. The medical team quickly did tests to check for testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E

When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues.

5|$|After {{his single}} season at Reedley, McCarty {{transferred}} to Western Washington University and played football for the Vikings. McCarty was immediately {{a significant factor}} in the Vikings' gameplan. In the season opener, he rushed for 139 yards and three touchdowns on 30 carries against the Humboldt State Lumberjacks. He also played a large role in the passing game early in the season, making eight receptions for 126 yards through the first two games. After starting the first seven games for the Vikings, McCarty broke his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game against the South Dakota Hardrockers. At the time of his injury, he led the Vikings in rushing and receiving yards. He finished the season with 492 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 130 carries, as well as 30 receptions for 278 yards. McCarty was also named a second-team all-star of the North Central Conference.|$|E
5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, Matthew, and sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small for his age, standing less than five feet tall when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having the talent to play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid growth spurt, growing a full <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing {{dropped out}} of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois. He played for the mine's company {{baseball}} team as an outfielder and first baseman. After he lost four toes from his left <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mining accident, he became unable to run in the field, and switched to pitching. He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox. After struggling with Boston, pitching to a 36–93 win–loss record, the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees, where he became successful, pitching as the Yankees' ace through 1946. After one season with the White Sox, Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching. He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox, a pitching coach for the New York Mets, and a scout and minor league instructor for the Cleveland Indians.|$|E

5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E
5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game against the Montreal Canadiens. He was sidelined for 18games, marking {{the first time in}} Henrik's career that he played without his brother for an extended period. In Daniel's absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November 2009, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to Daniel's 22 November return, Henrik scored seven goals in seven games. He continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25points (five goals, 20assists) in 15games to be named the NHL's First Star of the Month. The following month, he was named Second Star, having recorded 25points in 13games. On 7 January 2010, Henrik moved into top spot in the NHL scoring race, ahead of San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton with a three-assist night against the Phoenix Coyotes. It marked {{the first time in nearly}} five years, since Näslund was tied with Robert Lang on 18 February 2004, that a Canucks player held the League lead in scoring. During a 3–1 win against the Calgary Flames on 14 March, Henrik recorded his 416th career assist to pass Trevor Linden as Vancouver's all-time leader. On 27 March, he scored two assists against the San Jose Sharks to become the fourth Canuck in team history to record a 100-point season (after Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Markus Näslund). He was named Third Star of the Month for March after scoring 24points in 15games.|$|E
5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The Scottish {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{footprint}} in stone, signifying {{that they would}} {{follow in the footsteps}} of their predecessors. The Kingdom of Alba, unified in the ninth century and which would develop into the kingdom of Scotland, had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practice, but which was claimed to date back to the first arrival of the Scottish kings from Ireland. It was here that Scottish kings before the wars of independence were crowned, on the Stone of Scone, before its removal by Edward I in 1296. The first ceremony for which details survive is that for Alexander III in 1249. They describe a ceremony that combined elements of ancient heritage, the Church and secular lordship. He was consecrated by the Bishop of St Andrews and placed on the throne by the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife and his genealogy recited in Gaelic back to his Dalriadric Scottish ancestors by a royal poet from the Highlands. There was no anointment or crowning ceremony, as was common elsewhere in Europe. Later kings seem to have resented this omission and attempted to remedy it by appeals to the Pope. However, Scottish kings are usually depicted wearing crowns and carrying the normal regalia associated with kingship.|$|E

5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking his <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game against the Montreal Canadiens. He suffered the injury after {{being hit by a}} slapshot from teammate Alexander Edler. Although Daniel finished the game and recorded three assists, x-rays several days later revealed a fracture. He was sidelined for 18 games, returning to the ice on 22 November against the Chicago Blackhawks. Soon after his return, he notched his third career NHL hat-trick in a 4–2 win against the Atlanta Thrashers on 10 December. Four days later, he was named the NHL's Second Star of the Week with seven points {{over the course of the}} week. In the final game of the regular season, on 10 April 2010, against the Calgary Flames, Daniel scored his fourth career NHL hat-trick in a 7–3 win. All three goals were assisted by his brother, helping Henrik pass Alexander Ovechkin for the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading point-scorer. The last goal was chosen by TSN in a fan-voted poll as the NHL's play of the year; Daniel received a between-the-legs tip pass from Henrik near the corner boards before beating goaltender Miika Kiprusoff with a between-the-legs deke. Daniel finished the season with a career-high 56 assists and 85 points despite playing an injury-shortened 63-game campaign. His 1.35 points per game rate was third in the League behind Henrik and Ovechkin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Daniel recorded ten points in the opening round against the Los Angeles Kings, including the series-winning goal in the late stages of Game 6. Against Chicago the following round, his production decreased to four points as the Canucks were eliminated in six games. In the off-season, Daniel was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. It marked the first time since 1973–74 that two brothers were named post-season NHL All-Stars, as Henrik had been named to the First Team. They were also chosen to appear together on the cover of EA Sports' European version of the NHL 11 video game.|$|E
