40|$|Apart {{from being}} a safety arrangement, the {{protective}} earth, PE, is also defined as an equipotential plane {{which serves as a}} reference voltage for a circuit. Interest in the PE for EMC reasons is focused on an <b>equipotential</b> <b>point.</b> Still, most PE installation on site is carried out as a safety arrangement. In order to fulfill EMC standards regarding low emission, equipment is shielded and the shield is connected to the PE wire. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that electrical equipment distributes its electrical fields using the PE wire. Measurements have been taken on light fittings.

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} {{commonly}} used {{definitions of the}} ideal ground are inconsistent with Maxwell's laws. First, a ground cannot be a 2 ̆ 2 perfect sink or source for currents 2 ̆ 2; not even the large capacitance of our globe acts as a sink. Secondly, a 2 ̆ 2 perfect <b>equipotential</b> <b>point</b> or plane 2 ̆ 2 can be a reality for small dc currents only. For alternating currents however, distributed magnetic fluxes near ground leads make the potential concept, as used in Kirchhoff's laws, meaningless. In this situation where network theory fails, we should concentrate on the ground currents and on the circuits in which these currents flow. Examples are given how these current loops should be designed to minimize impedance and interference. A proper design leads to compact and local grounding and to much reduced currents flowing to Mother Earth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs the {{classical}} ones among the fractal sets, Julia set (abbreviated as J set) and Mandelbrot set (abbreviated as M set) have been explored widely in recent years. In this study, J set and M set under additive noise perturbation and multiplicative noise perturbation {{are created by}} <b>equipotential</b> <b>point</b> algorithm. Changes of the J set and M set under random noise perturbation {{as well as the}} close correlation between them are studied. Experimental results show that either additive noise perturbation or multiplicative noise perturbation may cause dramatic changes on J set. On the other hand, when the M set is perturbed by additive noise, it almost changes nothing but its position; when the M set is perturbed by multiplicative noise, its inner structures change with the stabilized areas shrinking, but it keeps the symmetry with respect to X axis. In addition, the J set and the M set still share the same stabilized periodic point in spite of noise perturbation...|$|E
40|$|Note: Author’s {{signature}} redacted from title page. When {{the work}} of designing and building a null detector was undertaken as a thesis, the initial research was broken up into two phases. The first phase consisted of analyzing the conditions necessary for balancing impedance bridges of various types. The second phase consisted of analyzing the properties necessary for the functioning of a null detector. The bridge is essentially a comparator and its basic property is to attain two <b>equipotential</b> <b>points</b> to compare the bridge arms to each other. The customary types of null detectors used in balancing impedance bridges may be classified under the following headings-, :- (1) Headphones with or without amplification; (2) Tuned vibration galvanometers; (3) A. C. galvanometers of the dynamometer type; (k) D. C. galvanometers of the d’Arsonval type, preceded by suitable rectification; (5) Electronic visual indicators of the cathode-ray oscillograph type. A more detailed discussion of {{the various types of}} detectors will be discussed in the following paragraph. Literature on as many types of commercial null detectors as possible was studied. The reasons for the various limitations of these units were studied. The purpose of this thesis was to try to incorporate the best qualities of all of these units into a single unit. An effort was made to overcome these limitations. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} representing and recognizing motion trajectories. We first propose to derive scene-related <b>equipotential</b> lines for <b>points</b> in a motion trajectory and concatenate them to construct a 3 D tube for representing the trajectory. Based on this 3 D tube, a droplet-based method is further proposed which derives a "water droplet " from the 3 D tube and recognizes trajectory activities accordingly. Our proposed 3 D tube can effectively embed both motion and scene-related information of a motion trajectory while the proposed droplet-based method can suitably catch {{the characteristics of the}} 3 D tube for activity recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R
