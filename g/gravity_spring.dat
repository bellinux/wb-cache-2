40|$|The {{response}} of hitherto known practical forms of seismographs {{depends upon the}} relative motion of a pendulum and the moving ground to which its supporting structure is fastened. The various kinds of seismographs differ {{in the type of}} pendulum used, such as <b>gravity,</b> <b>spring,</b> torsion, and/or they differ in the type of magnifying and recording elements which they employ. They all measure or indicate the vibratory motion of the ground at a giver point. In contrast to these earlier forms, the strain seismograph is a nonpendular instrument. It does not respond directly to vibratory movements Its operation depends upon variations in the distance between two points of the ground. Such variations or linear strains are set up by seismic waves. A schematic drawing of the seismometer is shown in figure 1. A and B are two piers separated by a distance of 20 meters. One end of the rod R is rigidly fastened to the pier B. The other end extends to within a short distance of pier A. Earth strains resulting from a seismic wave train produce variations in the separation of the two piers, and these variations are observable as changes in the distance between the free end of the rod and pier A. These small movements {{of the end of the}} rod relative to the adjacent pier actuate an electromechanical transducer which generates an e. m. f, proportional to the rate of change of the relative displacement. Recording is accomplished by means of galvanometers. A photograph of the seismometer is reproduced in figure 2...|$|E

5000|$|A zero length spring can be {{attached}} to a mass on a hinged boom {{in such a way}} that the force on the mass is almost exactly balanced by the vertical component of the force from the spring, whatever the position of the boom. This creates a horizontal [...] "pendulum" [...] with very long oscillation period. Long-period pendulums enable seismometers to sense the slowest waves from earthquakes. The LaCoste suspension with zero-length springs is also used in gravimeters because it is very sensitive to changes in <b>gravity.</b> <b>Springs</b> for closing doors are often made to have roughly zero length so that they will exert force even when the door is almost closed, so it will close firmly.|$|R

A team of structural engineers at TU Delft have discovered a mathematical method of determining the stability of an equilibrium involving any number of forces of any nature, including <b>gravity,</b> <b>springs,</b> and magnetism. In addition the researchers have developed an elegant graphical method to determine the stability of certain states of equilibrium practically at first sight.

40|$|Fran (Functional Reactive Animation) is a {{collection}} of data types and functions for composing richly interactive, multimedia animations. The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to e#ectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving <b>gravity,</b> <b>springs,</b> velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary di#erential equations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{practical}} simulation program for rigid part mechanisms, such as feeders, locks, and brakes. The program performs a kinematic simulation {{of the behavior}} produced by part contacts and input motions along with a dynamical simulation of the behavior produced by <b>gravity,</b> <b>springs,</b> and friction. It describes the behavior in a compact, symbolic format and with a realistic, three-dimensional animation. The program is more efficient and informative than traditional simulators. It examines roughly 1 / 6 as many degrees of freedom because the kinematics module eliminates the blocked ones. It spends little time on coffision detection because the kinematics module precomputes the configurations where parts collide, It covers more mechanisms than do previous model-based simulators, generates fuller behavioral descriptions, and exploits kinematics more fully. It uses a simple model of dynamics that captures the steady-state effect of forces without the conceptual and computational cost of dynamical simulation. We demonstrate that our simulation algorithm captures the workings of most mechanisms by surveying 2500 mechanisms from an engineering encyclopedia...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater springs are {{significant}} landscape features for humans and the biota that occupies their habitat. Many springs become inactive where groundwater exploitation by humans has lowered {{the water table}} or artesian pressure. In order to assess this impact, {{it is important to}} identify and locate active, and with more difficulty, inactive springs. Using a variety of archival, environmental and field-based data, this study presents a protocol for the determination of the location and status of springs across the Great Artesian Basin of Australia. This protocol underpins a database of springs, which is not only important for the assessment of spring ecosystems, but also contributes to understand groundwater extraction impacts and hydrogeological processes. The database indicates that 30. 0 % of discharge (artesian) springs in the Great Artesian Basin are entirely inactive and another 11. 8 % are partially inactive. For the outcrop (<b>gravity)</b> <b>springs</b> of the Basin, only 1. 9 % are entirely inactive and 7. 4 % partially inactive, and for the outcrop springs in the Tertiary sandstone overlying the Basin 30. 9 % are inactive and 18. 2 % are partially inactive...|$|R
40|$|Guidelines for {{controlling}} hazardous energy during maintenance and service operations of machines, processes, or systems are provided. The guidelines {{are intended to}} protect workers from injury by the unexpected and unrestricted release of energy due to pressure, <b>gravity,</b> <b>springs,</b> electrical release, and thermal energy resulting from high or low temperatures. Accident reports are analyzed and categorized by fire, explosion, impact, fall, caught between, or others. The major identified hazard causes include maintenance activities initiated without deactivation of the equipment or system; inadequate energy blockage or isolation; failure to dissipate residual energy; and accidental activation of energy. A systems analysis approach is used to provide a logical system for performing maintenance and servicing activities safely. The logic tree provides a step by step diagram {{for controlling}} hazardous energy that {{should be used in}} the formulation of specific maintenance and servicing procedures. The authors indicate that existing Federal and State safety regulations of energy control during maintenance, with the exception of Michigan and California, are inconsistent. Most of these regulations use the concept of power off to prevent injuries and do not provide guidance on how to discern when to apply power locks, tags, or a combination of locks and tags.

50|$|Fire dampers can {{be found}} in the same places as smoke dampers, {{depending}} on the application of the area after the firewall. Unlike smoke dampers, they are not triggered by any electrical system (which is an advantage in case of an electrical failure where the smoke dampers would fail to close). Vertically mounted fire dampers are gravity operated, while horizontal fire dampers are spring powered. A fire damper's most important feature is a mechanical fusible link which is a piece of metal that will melt or break at a specified temperature. This allows the damper to close (either from <b>gravity</b> or <b>spring</b> power), effectively sealing the duct, containing the fire, and blocking the necessary air to burn.|$|R

40|$|A linkage of rigid bodies under gravity loads can be statically counter-balanced by add-ing {{compensating}} gravity loads.

In the current literature, among the techniques that add springs, some achieve perfect static balance while others achieve only approximate bal-ance.

We present a perfect static balancing technique that adds only springs but not auxiliary bodies, {{in contrast to the}} existing techniques. This technique can counter-balance both <b>gravity</b> loads and <b>spring</b> loads. The technique requires that every joint that connects two bodies in the linkage be either a revolute joint or a spherical joint. Apart from this, the linkage can have any number of bodies connected in any manner. In order to achieve perfect balance, this technique requires that all the spring loads have the feature of zero-free-length, {{as is the case with}} the existing techniques. This requirement is neither impractical nor restrictive since the feature can be practically incorporated into any normal spring either by modifying the spring or by adding another spring in parallel.
