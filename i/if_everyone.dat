5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} <b>if</b> <b>everyone</b> knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: <b>if</b> <b>everyone</b> helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders <b>if</b> <b>everyone</b> in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E

50|$|Weinberger characterizes Jürgen Habermas as {{a proponent}} of a {{consensus}} theory of truth, and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds: First, even <b>if</b> <b>everyone's</b> opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous. Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, {{it has not been}} proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards one single limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.|$|R

50|$|Absolute {{poverty is}} the level of poverty as defined in terms of the minimal {{requirements}} necessary to afford minimal standards of food, clothing, health care and shelter. For the measure to be absolute, the line must be the same in different countries, cultures, and technological levels. Such an absolute measure should look only at the individual's power to consume and it should be independent of any changes in income distribution. The intuition behind an absolute measure is that mere survival takes essentially the same amount of resources across the world and that everybody should be subject to the same standards if meaningful comparisons of policies and progress are to be made. Notice that <b>if</b> <b>everyone's</b> real income in an economy increases, and the income distribution does not change, absolute poverty will decline.|$|R
40|$|I analyse informational e ¢ ciency of two-candidate {{elections}} {{where the}} utility of the voters depends on the realisation of an uncertain state variable. I show that large elections aggregate information for any voting rule in the unique equilibrium if and only <b>if</b> <b>everyone’s</b> ranking over the alternatives changes in the same direction with a change in the state. This condition is similar to the “common values ” assumption in Feddersen-Pesendorfer (1997). If there are any two groups of voters whose rankings change in opposite ways with a change in state, then for large classes of voting rules we always have equilibria with outcomes di¤erent from the full information outcome. I also show that the “common values”condition is hard to satisfy if the space of policies is multidimensional. ...|$|R
500|$|French theologian Henri Blocher criticised the universalism of John Hick's theory. Blocher {{argued that}} universalism contradicts free will, which {{is vital to}} the Irenaean theodicy, because, <b>if</b> <b>everyone</b> will receive salvation, humans cannot choose to reject God. Hick did attempt to address this issue: he argued that a free action is one which {{reflects}} that character of a person, and that humans were created with a [...] "Godward bias", so would choose salvation. Blocher proposed that Hick must then accept a level of determinism, though not going all the way.|$|E

5000|$|... 21st century {{globalization}} {{and its impact}} on gender equality remains highly influenced by the past. The World Bank openly admitted to the influence of the past by claiming, “even among those who have benefited from higher access to economic opportunities, old patterns of employment segregation by gender can emerge”. Furthermore, the ability to undermine these old patterns is by continually raising awareness. The ability to raise awareness and counter old patterns is prominent in the U.S and visible through globalizing organization-sponsored groups. One important group that has worked to raise awareness is known as WomenWatch, a United Nations inter-agency website on gender equality reducing women’s and girls’ time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances”.

Tucker concluded that the film was [...] "the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds me why Austen remains such a vital writer". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a [...] "faithful parade of Austen's world", and praised Root as the film's [...] "crown jewel" [...] for playing a [...] "fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance".

Shabery cited Article 182 of the Constitution, which grants the royalty certain legal immunities, as an example of Malay supremacy. However, some prominent members of the royalty such as the Raja of Perlis and former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed Jamalullail have themselves been critical of ketuanan Melayu; in early 2009, the Raja stated that [...] "In Malaysia, every race is tuan ...

The coach was {{reluctant}} to stake the game's outcome on the usually sure-footed Cockroft, who had missed two field goals and an extra point earlier in the game. The play he called was Red Right 88, a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. <b>If</b> <b>everyone</b> was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, [...] "if you feel you have to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers." [...] Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety Mike Davis leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win.

500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and {{that many of our}} big problems and scandals would go away <b>if</b> <b>everyone</b> could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as <b>if</b> <b>everyone</b> making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away."

The double standard perspective of international refugee law may have profound implications to the protection of internally displaced persons. Therefore {{there is a need to}} underscore the social, economic, cultural and political rights of internally displaced persons within mainstream international humanitarian protection regime.
