A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> citizens.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2006 state election, the Democractic Action Party (DAP) has derived the {{majority}} of its support <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> centres and became the largest opposition party in Sarawak.

Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia where West Malaysia-based component parties in the BN coalition, especially the UMNO, have not been active in state politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} power vacuums in {{the weeks}} following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans. Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas to avoid confrontations.|$|E

Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> stream syndrome, partially {{due to the}} amount of impervious surfaces within its watershed.

As of 2016, a Vassar–Cornell University program is monitoring the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E

5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 {{percent in the}} university), most were <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with higher scores on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.|$|E
5|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{nature of}} the study has resulted in information being gathered on subjects ranging <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> planning to gender studies. By using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, and by including considerable amounts of oral history, it has allowed for a vivid recreation of the society of early urban New Zealand. Several books have resulted from the project, among them Sites of Gender: Women, Men and Modernity, 1890–1939, edited by B. Brookes, A. Cooper, and R. Law (Auckland University Press, 2003) and Class and Occupation: The New Zealand Reality by E. Olssen and M. Hickey (University of Otago Press, 2005).|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal material, as well as food waste <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E

5|$|As the 1880s progressed, {{the balance}} of power within English {{football}} began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as Wanderers and Old Etonians. However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working-class team, Blackburn Olympic. At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed. Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction. By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from Lancashire, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted. An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, {{and was one of the}} few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players. Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's William Sudell, McGregor was well respected. The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium.|$|E
5|$|Setting up an encampment in the jungle, the survivors, {{including}} the Castros, Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos, began launching raids on small army-posts to obtain weaponry. In January 1957 they overran the outpost {{near to the}} beach at La Plata; Guevara treated the soldiers for any injuries, but the revolutionaries executed the local mayoral (land-company overseer) Chicho Osorio, whom the local peasants despised and who boasted of killing one of the MR-26-7 rebels several weeks previously. Osorio's execution aided the rebels in gaining the trust of locals, who typically hated the mayorals as enforcers of the wealthy landowners, although they largely remained unenthusiastic and suspicious of the revolutionaries. As trust grew, some locals joined the rebels, although most new recruits came <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas. With increasing numbers of volunteers, who now numbered over 200, in July 1957 Castro divided his army into three columns, keeping charge of one and giving control of the others to his brother and Guevara. The MR-26-7 members operating in urban areas continued agitation, sending supplies to Castro, and on 16 February 1957 he met with other senior members to discuss tactics; here he met Celia Sánchez, who would become a close friend.|$|E
5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far <b>from</b> <b>urban</b> areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E
