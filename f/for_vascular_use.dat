40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} the clinical and haemodynamic safety of NC 100100, a new transpulmonary ultrasound contrast agent intended <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>use.</b>  DESIGN—Pulmonary artery pressures and gas exchange, left ventricular and systemic {{blood pressure and}} ECG were measured at baseline, after saline injection, and after each of two increasing doses of NC 100100 injected intravenously.  PATIENTS— 30 patients who were evaluated for suspected coronary artery disease.  RESULTS—No change was detected {{in any of the}} haemodynamic variables, or in haematological or clinical chemical parameters. Blood gases were unchanged, as were heart rhythm and arterial oxygen saturation. No serious adverse reactions were reported.  CONCLUSIONS—NC 100100 appeared to be haemodynamically inert and safe in patients with coronary artery disease.    Keywords: NC 100100; ultrasound; safet...|$|E
40|$|There {{are only}} a few reports in the {{veterinary}} literature describing the use of stapling equipment and techniques for pulmonary surgery. These reports indicate that complications associated with these procedures are minimal. Although pulmonary lobectomy procedures originally described independent isolation and ligation of the hilar vessels, it became apparent that, {{with the use of the}} smaller staples, especially the ones designed <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>use,</b> this was unnecessary. Therefore, en bloc hilar stapling is the procedure of choice. This makes the surgical procedure extremely quick to perform. Similarly, there is no indication to routinely oversew staple lines when performing a partial lobectomy. This is a tedious procedure and may actually increase the chance of air leakage. If point areas of leakage do occur, these can be independently occluded either with sutures or individual vascular clips. Selecting the correct size of TA stapler and staples to create the correct length of staple line is critical. It is important that all the tissue to be ligated lie comfortably within the staple line. It is better to use a stapler that is too long and collect the extra staples on a sponge than to use one that is too short that results in leakage from nonstapled tissue. In general, the 4. 8 -mm staples should not be used for pulmonary surgery in the dog and cat. They do not compress the tissue enough to prevent leakage. For most complete lobectomies, where the hilus of the lung can be adequately isolated, the TA 30 V 3 is the stapler of choice. When performing a partial lobectomy, a longer stapler is often required. If a TA 55 or TA 90 is necessary, it should be used with 3. 5 -mm staples. Even though stapling techniques have made pulmonary surgical procedures safe, easy, and quick to perform, they are not totally free of problems and complications. Experience in the use of the equipment is essential, as is good surgical judgment as to when to use or not to use these techniques. The absence of reported clinical complications, either short- or long-term, attests to the success of these techniques.

40|$|Background: Vascular {{transplantation}} {{has become}} an alternative for prosthetic grafts. Suitable storage methods <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> allografts are therefore necessary. For small caliber arterial allografts, cryopreservation and cold storage showed discouraging results. Since glycerol preservation proved effective for the storage of skin allografts, this preservation method was investigated <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> allografts <b>using</b> a rat aortic transplantation model. Methods: Glycerol-preserved allografts (GA) were transplanted to the infrarenal aorta (n = 18) in Wistar rats. A control group (n = 18) underwent immediate autotransplantation (AU) of an equal length of aorta. Results: Cumulative graft patency at 90 days' follow-up was 93 % for AU and 78 % for GA (ns). No aneurysm formation was detected in both groups. Intraluminal endothelial cell coverage, integrity {{of the media and}} smooth muscle cell repopulation were comparable in both groups. Intimal thickness was less in GA than in AU and inflammatory reaction in the adventitia was diminished in GA.

We investigated {{the effect of}} time elapsed since an access flow measurement on test accuracy of a novel flow monitoring method called variable flow (VF) Doppler. A retrospective review was conducted in 36 patients with prosthetic grafts <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> access <b>using</b> access thrombosis as the clinical endpoint. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and test sensitivity and specificity were determined for various follow-up time intervals. ROC analysis showed increasing test discrimination for shorter time intervals. Sensitivity and specificity for a commonly used surveillance threshold (600 ml/min) showed specificity that was little changed (88 – 93 %) from follow-up time intervals of 15 days to 6 months. However, sensitivity was low (21 %) at 6 months, increased to 50 % at 2 months, 67 % at 1 month, and 100 % at 15 days (a single event). Low access blood flow using VF Doppler predicts near-term thrombosis. These data further imply that the discriminative value of access flow monitoring appears to be highly dependent on time from the flow measurement, improving with shorter time intervals from the measurement...|$|R

According to international recommendations 3 to 5 [*]minutes of resting is needed before blood pressure measurement. Surprisingly, no study has modelled {{the time course of}} BP decrease and the minimum resting-time before BP measurement. A cross-sectional bicentric observational study was performed including outpatients addressed <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> examination. <b>Using</b> two automatic BP monitors we recorded the blood pressure every minute during 11 consecutive minutes. The data was analyzed by non-linear mixed effect regression. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic BPs were studied and we tested the effect of covariates on its evolution through log-likelihood ratio tests. We included 199 patients (66 +/- 13 years old). SBP was found to decrease exponentially. Simulations based on the final model show that only half the population reaches a stabilized SBP (defined as SBP[*]+[*] 5 [*]mmHg) after 5 [*]min of resting-time while it takes 25 [*]min to ensure 90 % of the population has a stabilized SBP.

40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} the deletion of 26 to 28 genes, including elastin, on human chromosome 7. Elastin insufficiency leads to the cardiovascular hallmarks of this condition, namely focal stenosis and hypertension. Extrapolation from the Eln+/- mouse suggests that affected people may also have stiff vasculature, a risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. NCF 1, one of the variably deleted Williams genes, is a component of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex and is involved in the generation of oxidative stress, making it an interesting candidate modifier <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> stiffness. <b>Using</b> a case-control design, vascular stiffness was evaluated by pulse wave velocity in 77 Williams cases and matched controls. Cases had stiffer conducting vessels than controls (P< 0. 001), with increased stiffness observed in even the youngest children with Williams syndrome. Pulse wave velocity increased with age at comparable rates in cases and controls, and although the degree of vascular stiffness varied, it was seen in both hypertensive and normotensive Williams participants. Use of antihypertensive medication and extension of the Williams deletion to include NCF 1 were associated with protection from vascular stiffness. These findings demonstrate that vascular stiffness is a primary vascular phenotype in Williams syndrome and that treatment with antihypertensives or agents inhibiting oxidative stress may be important in managing patients with this condition, potentially even those who are not overtly hypertensive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a method <b>for</b> forming <b>vascular</b> atlases <b>using</b> <b>vascular</b> distance maps and a novel vascular model-to-image registration method. Our atlas formation process begins with MR or CT angiogram data from a set of subjects. We extract blood vessels from those data using our tubular object segmentation method.

Each of the remaining vascular network models is then registered with the DM template <b>using</b> our <b>vascular</b> model-to-image affine registration method. The DM images from the registered vascular models are then computed. The mean and variance images formed from those registered DM images are the vascular atlas. In this paper we apply the atlas formation process to build atlases of normal brain and liver vasculature.

Additionally, we explain the clinical potential of those atlases and conduct z-score analyses to compare individuals with the atlases to detect abnormal vessels. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo help {{understand}} {{past and}} future trends in vascular intervention, we examined changes {{in the rate of}} utilization, patient demographics, and length of stay from 1980 to 2000. MethodsWe reviewed the ICD- 9 codes <b>for</b> all <b>vascular</b> procedures <b>using</b> the National Hospital Discharge Survey of non-federal United States hospitals (1980 - 2000). ResultsThe number of vascular procedures performed in this country increased from 412, 557 in 1980 to 801, 537 in 2000 (per capita increase of > 50 %). This increase was most evident in elderly patients (> 75 years, 67 % per capita increase in discharges). Long hospital stays (≥ 7 days) <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> procedures fell 41 %, and short hospital stays (< 24 hours) increased 15 % over the period of study. The frequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs remained relatively constant. Except for an interval in the late 1980 s, and a minor decrease from 1997 to 2000, the frequency of carotid endartarectomy rose dramatically (69 %). Lower extremity revascularizations increased steadily until 1990 but then declined 12 %. From 1995 to 2000, there was a 27 % per capita {{decrease in the number of}} renal-mesenteric operations. Correspondingly, over the past 5 years there has been a 979 % growth in the number of percutaneous/endovascular interventions. Despite a substantial number of interventions <b>for</b> lower extremity <b>vascular</b> disease, there was a concomitant increase in the number of major and minor amputations.

Overexpression of KLF 2 or the ETS transcription factor ERG is sufficient to induce ectopic Flk 1 expression in the Xenopus embryo. Inhibition of KLF 2 function in the Xenopus embryo results in a dramatic reduction in Flk 1 transcript levels. Furthermore, we show that KLF 2 and ERG associate in a physical complex and that the two proteins synergistically activate transcription of Flk 1.

METHOD: Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by comparing the clinical with the neuropathological diagnosis of 89 autopsied patients with dementia from a geriatric and psychiatric hospital. All cases were reviewed by a clinician and a neuropathologist who were blind to each other's findings. RESULTS: Neuropathologically there were 20 cases of vascular dementia, 23 cases of mixed dementia, and 46 cases of Alzheimer's disease among the autopsied patients. The sensitivity was 0. 50 for DSM-IV criteria <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> dementia, 0. 70 for ADDTC criteria <b>for</b> possible <b>vascular</b> dementia, 0. 55 for NINDS-AIREN criteria <b>for</b> possible <b>vascular</b> dementia, 0. 20 for ICD- 10 criteria <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> dementia, 0. 25 for ADDTC criteria <b>for</b> probable <b>vascular</b> dementia, and 0. 20 for NINDS-AIREN criteria <b>for</b> probable <b>vascular</b> dementia. Specificity was 0. 84, 0. 78, 0. 84, 0. 94, 0. 91, and 0. 93, respectively. The proportion of cases clinically classified as vascular dementia ranged from 0 % to 13 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of Alzheimer's disease and 9 % to 39 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of mixed dementia. There was no statistically significant relationship between the neuropathological diagnosis {{and three of the}} clinical criteria sets studied (ICD- 10 criteria <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> dementia and ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN criteria <b>for</b> probable <b>vascular</b> dementia).

Despite this, rates of complications from venous and arterial access procedures remain a significant cause of morbidity. We hypothesized {{that the use of}} a new technique of <b>vascular</b> access <b>using</b> an ultrasound with a novel needle-guidance positioning system (GPS) would lead to improved success rates of <b>vascular</b> puncture <b>for</b> both in-plane and out-of-plane techniques compared with traditional ultrasound. MethodsA prospective, randomized crossover study of medical students from all years of medical school was conducted using a phantom gel model. Each medical student performed three ultrasound-guided punctures with each of the four modalities (in-plane no GPS, in-plane with GPS, out-of-plane no GPS, out-of-plane with GPS) for a total of 12 attempts. The success or failure was judged by the ability to aspirate a simulated blood solution from the model. The time to successful puncture was also recorded. A poststudy validated NASA Task Load Index workload questionnaire was conducted to assess the student's perceptions of the two different techniques. ResultsA total of 30 students completed the study. There was no significant difference seen in the mean times of <b>vascular</b> access <b>for</b> each of the modalities. Higher success rates <b>for</b> <b>vascular</b> access <b>using</b> the GPS for both the in-plane (94 % vs 91 %) and the out-of-plane (86 % vs 70 %) views were observed; however, this was not statistically significant. The students perceived the mental demand (median 12. 0 vs 14. 00; P =. 035) and effort to be lower (mean 11. 25 vs 14. 00; P =. 044) as well as the performance to be higher (mean 15. 50 vs 14. 00; P =. 041) for the GPS vs the traditional ultrasound-guided technique. Students also perceived their ability to access vessels increased with the aid of the GPS (7. 00 vs 6. 50; P =. 007).

The mechanism explaining the abnormal fluid accumulation and the transient nature of NT remains unexplained. METHODS: The nuchal regions of normal and trisomy 16 mouse embryos were examined <b>for</b> (lympho) <b>vascular</b> abnormalities <b>using</b> immunohistochemical markers against lymphatic vessels (LYVE- 1) and smooth muscle (1 A 4) and endothelial (CD 34) cells. Additionally, an ultrasonographic study was carried out on 17 human fetuses with an increased NT. Two of these fetuses were examined morphologically. RESULTS: In both abnormal human and mouse specimens, we found a mesenchyme lined cavity within the posterior nuchal region as well as bilaterally enlarged jugular LYVE- 1 positive lymphatic sacs. The persistence of jugular lymphatic sacs was also confirmed by ultrasound in 14 human fetuses with increased NT. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify the cause of increased NT as mesenchymal oedema {{in the presence of}} distended jugular lymphatic sacs, detected by the hyaluronan receptor LYVE- 1. The delayed organization and connection of these lymphatic sacs to the venous circulation might explain the transient nature of NT. Disturbance in timing of endothelial differentiation might be a common denominator in the origin of NT, linking cardiovascular and haemodynamic abnormalities...|$|R
