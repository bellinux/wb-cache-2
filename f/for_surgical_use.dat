25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although no differences were found after 21 days.

We have learnt from non-mesh repairs that accidental tears into the bladder during the dissection are minor complications that will not affect outcome. It is not known if this is true also when a synthetic mesh is used in the repair. Mesh erosions into the bladder or urethra were reported following TVT and obturator slings [2, 3]. Additionally, a few cases of bladder erosions following Perigee® or Prolift® have been published [4, 5].

40|$|A {{reflectance}} volume holographic imaging (VHI) endoscope {{has been}} designed for simultaneous in vivo imaging of surface and subsurface tissue structures. Prior utilization of VHI systems has been limited to ex vivo tissue imaging. The VHI system presented in this work is designed for laparoscopic use. It consists of a probe section that relays light from the tissue sample to a handheld unit that contains the VHI microscope. The probe section is constructed from gradient index (GRIN) lenses that form a 1 : 1 relay for image collection. The probe has an outer diameter of 3. 8 mm and is capable of achieving 228. 1 lp/mm resolution with 660 -nm Kohler illumination. The handheld optical section operates with a magnification of 13. 9 and a field of view of 390 mu m x 244 mu m.

All data was prospectively collected in a dedicated database, and reviewed retrospectively. A total of 32 lobectomies, three bilobectomies, and three pneumonectomies were performed. The indication was a malignant tumor in 28 cases. There were nine cases with benign pathology. Mean operating time was 209  min (range: 105 - 380  min). Six conversions were required (15. 8 %) and there was one postoperative death (2. 6 %). Four postoperative complications occurred (10. 5 %). Median hospital stay was 10  days (range: 3 - 24  days).

30|$|There are {{two main}} types of TMR lasers that are {{currently}} approved <b>for</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>use,</b> the carbon dioxide (CO 2) and the holmium:yttrium–aluminum–garnet (Ho:YAG) laser system (Allen et al. 2008; Horvath 2008). Both create 1  mm wide channels within the myocardium that traverse the ventricular wall (Deckelbaum 1994). The CO 2 laser system uses carbon dioxide gas excitation to generate infrared light and ablate surrounding tissue. Since the CO 2 laser can only be delivered to a beating heart, the laser should be pulsed when the heart is quiescent or when it is electrically minimally active, {{to reduce the risk}} of arrhythmias (Samuels et al. 2004). This state corresponds to the time lapse between the R and T wave of an ECG rhythm. By avoiding laser pulsation during myocardial contraction, the CO 2 laser prevents interruption of electrical signaling within the heart, increases laser accuracy and prevents laser firing to non-targeted areas of the myocardium, ultimately reducing the risk of fibrillation (Rudko and Linhares 1992). Once the laser is deployed in a single pulse, the lased energy is transmitted through the myocardial tissue and dissipated within the ventricular blood, preventing excessive thermal injury to surrounding tissue. The CO 2 laser can deliver 800  W in one pulse lasting from 1 to 99  ms at energies of 8 – 80  J (Allen et al. 2008).|$|E

We aim to elucidate {{the anatomy of}} the CL and the roles it plays in gynecological surgery. Methods Studies employed sharp dissection of 28 formalin-fixed cadaveric hemipelves and 10 unembalmed cadaveric hemipelves. Results The CL (total length averaging 10. 0 cm) can be subdivided into three sections: a distal (cervical) section, on average 2. 1 cm long, attached to the lateral aspect of the cervix (posteriorly, it was confluent with the attachment of the uterosacral [USL] ligament to form the cardinal–uterosacral confluence [CUSC]); an intermediate section, on average 3. 4 cm long, running laterally (slightly posteriorly) from the cervix; a proximal (pelvic) section, relatively thick, triangular-shaped on cross-section, averaging 4. 6 cm long, attached to the lateral pelvic sidewall, with its apex at the first branching of the internal iliac artery. Only the distal section is free of any significant neural or vascular component (ureter is in the intermediate section) and therefore safe <b>for</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>use.</b> The CUSC (first pedicle of a vaginal hysterectomy and later pedicle of an abdominal hysterectomy), if attached to the vaginal vault at hysterectomy {{has the potential for}} both lateral (CL) and supero-posterior (USL) surgical support. This pedicle would not be subsequently accessible for other surgeries. Conclusions Suggested cardinal points at hysterectomy are: know the CL anatomy; the distal section (as part of the CUSC) can provide vaginal vault support; the intermediate and proximal sections are surgically dangerous...|$|E

In this first article, we describe and discuss the current published knowledge about the use of PRP and PRF during tooth avulsion or extraction, mucogingival surgery, Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) or bone filling of periodontal intrabony defects, and regeneration of alveolar ridges using Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR), in a comprehensive way and {{in order to avoid the}} traps of a confusing literature and to highlight the underlying universal mechanisms of these products.

The use of L-PRF also allowed to define new therapeutic principles: NTR (Natural Tissue Regeneration) for the treatment of periodontal intrabony lesions and Natural Bone Regeneration (NBR) for the reconstruction of the alveolar ridges.
