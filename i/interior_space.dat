5|$|Inside, the Hatfield Library {{contains}} a 24-hour study area, private study rooms, a classroom, the university's archives, and listening rooms. On {{the main floor}} is the circulation desk, reference section, and work stations, among others. The building also holds a formal reception area, the Mark O. Hatfield Room, and the Hatfield archives that contain the former Senator's papers, both located on the second floor. <b>Interior</b> <b>space</b> was left mainly open to allow for flexibility with the evolving needs and technology of the library. Artist Dean Larson painted the portrait of Hatfield that hangs in the library.|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} is transforming {{interior design}} by allowing utilities, goods and {{information to be}} delivered where and when we need them. How will new information technologies impact the design of <b>interior</b> <b>spaces?</b> Intelligent <b>interiors</b> can be more flexible and expressive than traditional spaces. Automation, personal fabrication and augmented reality {{can be applied to}} <b>interior</b> <b>spaces</b> with new interaction modes that operate at an architectural scale.

5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for <b>interior</b> <b>space</b> station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|The VB series {{retained}} 96percent of {{the preceding}} HZ Kingswood's <b>interior</b> <b>space,</b> despite being 14percent smaller in overall dimensions, although fivepercent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel-efficient. This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses {{were thought to be}} unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140percent, putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize, a change that Holden had already done.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{opened on}} October 3, 1998, with a two-story atrium gallery, curves located throughout the <b>interior</b> <b>space,</b> marble panels, and an enclosed garden on the exterior. Additionally, the brick faced structure has an exterior patio constructed of slate. There are {{a total of}} six galleries at the museum, with four used for permanent collections and two galleries used for traveling exhibits. In 2008, colored reflector panels were added to the narrow second floor windows in order to provide more color to the exterior. Measuring 69.5 inches high by 21.75 inches wide, some of the panels are illuminated from the interior.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 114 - 115. The {{reflection of}} domestic <b>interior</b> <b>spaces</b> in selected Turkish paintings of {{late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries is studied. The selected paintings stand out as a time chart during the identified period. The treatment of domestic <b>interior</b> <b>spaces</b> has changed in the course of time, and these changes, mainly related to the organization of the domestic <b>interior</b> <b>spaces,</b> furniture and their usage and clothing of the people, have been reflected in the paintings. As a result of this study, a conclusion is reached to the effect that inherent in the paintings examined there is distinct documentary proof of the evolvement of domestic <b>interior</b> <b>spaces,</b> material used and goods and furniture during the above mentioned period.

5|$|In 1567 Qi Jiguang and Tan Lun, {{successful}} generals who fended off {{the coastal}} pirates, were reassigned {{to manage the}} Ji–Chang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital region. Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers were built along the Great Wall from 1569 to 1571. These included the first large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: up until this point, most previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the Ji–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers <b>interior</b> <b>space</b> to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows.|$|E
5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised <b>interior</b> <b>space.</b> In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E

5|$|Another wooden palace, Tranovola ("Silver House"), {{was under}} {{construction}} {{at the same}} time as Bevato and is considered by historians to represent the first true hybrid of Creole and traditional Merina aristocratic architecture. Its innovations included a roof of wood shingles, a second storey, the addition of a veranda, glass windows, multiple interior rooms (as opposed to a single open <b>interior</b> <b>space)</b> and the use of curved shapes as design elements. Historic sources offer conflicting accounts of these two buildings. Some maintain that Bevato was relocated and remodelled to become Tranovola, while others maintain the buildings were separate but debate which of the two houses was the first two-storey building in the Rova (still other sources award this innovation to Marivolanitra). The design of Radama's tomb likewise embodies the hybrid style that was to influence and inspire not only the majority of the buildings built at the Rova in the 19th century, but ultimately architecture throughout the entire highland region of Madagascar—particularly in its use of equidistant pillars supporting the overhanging roof to create a veranda.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the <b>interior</b> <b>space.</b> In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's <b>interior</b> <b>space</b> took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E

Two covered party decks are located on the second level—one at each end—both of which can accommodate up to 75people each. Between {{the end of the}} lower seating bowl in left field and the outfield berm lies a group area which can accommodate up to 600individuals. This area consists of a covered picnic area, round picnic tables, rearrangeable chairs, and stadium seats.
