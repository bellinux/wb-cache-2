50|$|Midland Railway Company Engine ShedThe {{opening of}} Lifford curve in July 1892 {{allowed for a}} more {{intensive}} local service. New sidings were opened at Cadbury’s and Selly Oak in 1885 and by 1892 Selly Oak was handling over 55,000 tons of goods traffic and Lifford over 17,000 tons. The Midland Railway Company identified an available site near Stirchley Street which was bordered by the Birmingham West Suburban main line, Cotteridge Park, Breedon Road, and Mary Vale Road. Land was purchased from the Trustees of the late J Hock. The engine roundhouse was built by Messrs. Garlick and Horton {{at a cost of}} £11,546 and Eastwood Swingler gained the contract for a 50’ turntable. Construction began in 1893 and the shed opened on 12 March 1894. Although named Bournville Engine Shed it was unrelated to Bournville Model Village. The shed was significant during World War I and drivers and firemen were classified as being in a Reserved occupation. The lighter Engines required for the Dowery Dell viaduct operated from Lifford taking <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> the outward <b>journey</b> and returning with loads, usually steel tubes and coil, manufactured in the Halesowen area. The arrival of diesel driven units and the 1950s rationalisation of the railway programme meant the end of the shed. It closed on 2 February 1960. It became the new ‘Parkside’ distribution centre for Cadbury’s. By 1971 Cadbury’s had switched from rail to road transport so the depot became surplus to requirements and was demolished and replaced with a housing estate.|$|R
50|$|Cable haulage did prove viable {{where the}} {{gradients}} were exceptionally steep, {{such as the}} 1 in 8 gradients of the Cromford and High Peak Railway opened in 1830. Cable railways generally have two tracks with loaded <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> one track partially balanced by <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> the other, to minimise fuel costs for the stationary engine. Various kinds of rack railway were developed to overcome the lack of friction of conventional locomotives on steep gradients.|$|R
50|$|The adits {{were about}} 60 ft apart vertically, {{according}} to Horswill, who {{wrote to the}} Mining Journal in 1874. The upper levels are around 1425 ft above sea level, whereas the mill is just below the 1120 ft contour. A double-track inclined plane connected the level 'C' adit to the mill level, although wagons from level 'B' could also use it. Most of it was at an angle of 30 degrees, but it became shallower at the bottom. It was worked by gravity, with full wagons running down it raising <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> the other track. Three tracks entered the mill, and additional tracks to the south carried rubbish onto tips. The mill was powered by a 30 ft waterwheel, which was 4 ft wide. Water was brought down the hillside in leats fed by several streams, {{and there were two}} sections of raised aqueduct or launder. Several of the slate pillars which supported the final launder to the wheel pit are still in situ.|$|R
50|$|In May {{a company}} of thirty <b>wagons</b> started <b>on</b> <b>journey</b> across the plains. They had covered wagons and were {{provided}} with tin stoves and all the arms and provisions needed for such a journey. The emigrant party later exchanged their horses for oxen. They were able to travel nearly twenty-five miles a day, and arrived at Milwaukie, Oregon on September 8, 1848.|$|R
30|$|The {{axle load}} of a wagon {{is the total}} <b>wagon</b> weight (<b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> weight[*]+[*]load <b>on</b> the <b>wagon)</b> resting <b>on</b> the axle. Higher axle load means fewer {{requirements}} of wagons, which is good from the operator and customer point of view. Axle load is therefore an important design factor in the engineering of railways, designed to tolerate a maximum weight‐per‐axle (axle load). If it exceeds the maximum rated axle load, it will cause more damage to the track so, for infrastructure managers, a lower or safer axle load limit is desirable. In this regard [23] remind us that: ‘the negative impacts of increased axle loads occur primarily {{in the areas of}} track and bridge maintenance and renewal, and freight car maintenance’.|$|R
40|$|Derailments are a {{significant}} cost to the Australian sugar industry with damage to rail infrastructure and rolling stock in excess of $ 2 M per annum. Many factors can contribute to cane rail derailments. The more prevalent factors are discussed. Derailment statistics on likely causes for cane rail derailments are presented with the case of <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> the main line being the highest contributor to business cost. Historically, the lateral to vertical wheel load ratio, termed the derailment ratio, {{has been used to}} indicate the derailment probability of rolling stock. When the derailment ratio reaches the Nadal limit of 0. 81 for cane rail operations, there is a high probability that a derailment will occur. Contributing factors for derailments include the operating forces, the geometric variables of the rolling stock and the geometric deviations of the railway track. These combined, have the capacity to affect the risk of derailment for a cane rail transport operating system. The derailment type that is responsible for creating the most damage to assets and creating mill stops is the flange climb derailment, as these derailments usually occur at speed with a full rake of <b>empty</b> <b>wagons.</b> The typical forces that contribute to the flange climb derailment case for cane rail operations are analysed and a practical derailment model is developed to enable operators to better appreciate the most significant contributing factors to this type of derailment. The paper aims to: (a) improve awareness of the significance of physical operating parameters so that these principles can be included in locomotive driver training and (b) improve awareness of track and wagon variables related to the risk of derailment so that maintainers of the rail system can allocate funds for maintenance more effectively...|$|R
50|$|When the ECMR {{line was}} built, the incline {{was taken over}} by the railway company. There is {{evidence}} of realignment of the incline: the later route was higher up the hillside and reduced the sharp curve near the bottom. It is likely that this was done at the time of adoption of the incline as part of the ECMR. A 14 hp (9 kW) stationary steam engine was provided by the ECMR. An electric bell system was installed for the operation of the incline, later replaced by a telephone. Two loaded or three <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> were moved <b>on</b> the incline at a time.|$|R
25|$|On Tuesday, 18 April 1967 {{at about}} 2.31pm, a <b>wagon</b> <b>on</b> a goods train of 69 <b>empty</b> mineral <b>wagons,</b> {{travelling}} <b>on</b> the down line to Northampton, derailed {{just south of}} the village. The train travelled a further 1½ miles before more wagons derailed, a little distance north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the up line from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery.|$|R

5000|$|Both {{white and}} black laborers from the Panhandle as well as {{adjoining}} parts of Alabama and Georgia were recruited to build the track and bridges. After some disputes among competing groups of laborers, wages were set at $1.50 a day for all workers. [...] Delays were caused by outbreaks of swamp fever all along the line, causing many men to fall ill; no medical help was available in the very thinly settled section between Milton and Marianna. When a bridge contractor from Macon, Georgia, died from the fever, his body had to be carried by <b>wagon</b> <b>on</b> a <b>journey</b> of several days from the work camp at the Choctawhatchee River to Troy, Alabama, the nearest point served by a railroad connection to Macon, for shipment to his hometown for burial. [...] Nevertheless, despite all the difficulties of working in such an isolated region, with no repair shops and a largely inexperienced work crew, construction proceeded at a rapid pace.|$|R
50|$|From early 1831, the {{locomotive}} Seguin hauled twenty-four to twenty-eight <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> between Givors and Rive-de-Gier or seven full <b>wagons.</b> <b>On</b> 3 April 1832, the section up to Lyon {{was used for}} freight transport with a few passengers being accepted, who sat on straw in the wagons. The last section, to Saint-Étienne, was opened on 1 October 1832 for passenger use only, freight being accepted a few months later. On 4 April 1833 the line was opened in its entirety.|$|R
50|$|The <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> {{would be}} winched off the cradle and run down onto a second {{weighbridge}} {{to calculate the}} tare and then run down a gradient of 1 in 70 to the empties siding.

5000|$|The Scotch express {{had left}} Peterborough at 6.24, about 6 minutes late. It did not slacken speed {{for the bad}} weather; it passed through Holme at about 6.37, the signals all showing clear, and arrived at Wood Walton at 6.40. The {{signalman}} there had set his signal levers to put his signals to 'danger' to protect the shunting at Abbots Ripton, but had not left his levers to set detonators at the home signal, nor did he supplement his fixed signals by displaying a hand-lamp from the signal box. He told the inquiry he was busy stopping a train of <b>empty</b> coal <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> the down line, {{and because of the}} weather he did not hear the express until it ran past his cabin at full speed. At 6.44 the Scotsman reached Abbots Ripton, its driver having seen [...] "nothing but white lights all the way from Peterboro". It was at full speed (40-45 mph) when it crashed into the coal train, which had not yet cleared the main line. Some coal wagons were smashed, but the coal train engine itself was largely unscathed. The express engine derailed and veered to the right. It ended up lying on its side, beyond the down line. Behind it, its tender and two passenger carriages were obstructing the down line.|$|R

40|$|The Study Group {{was asked}} to develop a {{methodology}} to allow more efficient and effective direction of <b>empty</b> <b>wagon</b> movements. The Study Group chose to develop two linear programming approaches. One was for allocating <b>empty</b> <b>wagons,</b> and the other modelled both <b>empty</b> and full <b>wagons.</b> Although large in size, the models were otherwise feasible, showing that, conceptually, the method would work.

50|$|In February 1862 {{the company}} {{prohibited}} the carriage of any {{persons in the}} <b>wagons</b> <b>on</b> the line as the entire capacity of the 20 wagons was required for the transport of the ore. Horses hauled the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> up to the mine in the mornings, and once loaded they departed for the port under gravity at 13:15. The distance {{was expected to be}} covered in 45 minutes to Third House, with a further 1 hour and 30 minutes to the Alton Street depot. Any trip conducted in less than the allotted time could lead to the dismissal of the brakeman for speeding. On 23 March 1862 the capacity of the line was increased with the arrival of an additional 25 wagons.|$|R

50|$|There were steep {{gradients}} on the line; from Seghill to Prospect Hill {{rising as}} steep as 1 in 61, and from Prospect Hill to the Tyne falling gradients, the steepest {{of which was}} 1 in 25. The line was worked mainly by stationary engines, one at Prospect Hill, near the Allotment, which hauled up the loaded wagons from Holywell, and the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the Newcastle and North Shields road. The other engine was at Percy Main, hauling the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the staiths. From Prospect Hill to Percy Main and from Percy Main to the staiths the loaded wagons ran by gravity, unwinding as they descended a tail rope from the drum of the engine, to bring hack the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons.</b> The remainder of the line from Seghill to Holywell was worked by locomotives; those used at first were the Samson and the John, both built by Timothy Hackworth.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the tight}} {{economic}} conditions facing the NSW coal mining industry {{at the time}} and the need to rationalise some of its operations, Coal & Allied decided it was more economical to ship the coal to port by road and on 28 August 1987 announced the planned closure of the Stockrington to Hexham line from 25 September 1987. The railway operated normally until 18 September when following a dispute between a loco crew and management, coal haulage ceased and only <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> were to be worked to Hexham for storage. The last coal was dumped at the coal preparation plant on 21 September and on 22 September No.25 cleared the <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> from the preparation plant and then made two trips to Stockrington to work the remaining <b>empty</b> <b>wagons</b> to Hexham. However, on 24 September as part of the vigorous protest efforts by the railway employees, No.25 was hijacked and after spending a day at Doghole the loco was moved to Lenaghans Drive road bridge and a protest camp set up. However, {{due to a lack of}} support from their fellow unionists at the other Coal & Allied operations the protest ended with no effect on 15 October 1987.|$|R
