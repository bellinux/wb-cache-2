5|$|In 1995, Trek bought Klein bikes, after Klein <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{to compete}} without the sales network {{of a larger}} company in place.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used {{a special}} away kit when playing at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, {{representing}} the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne {{from the fact}} that the club <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to win there.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was {{to make it as}} hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
60|$|His sigh {{of relief}} was marvellous. She <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> than ever to keep the {{laughter}} from her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Frank <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> {{than he had}} expected. His {{anger was}} {{beginning}} to evaporate and Harry's good humor was embarrassing. Still, he made another effort.|$|R
50|$|The {{publication}} {{began to}} go downhill from 1644 onwards. As the Royalist defeats on the battlefield continued, the Oxford publication <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> and harder to obtain current news and issues became badly delayed. The Mercurius Aulicus finally closed in 1645.|$|R
5|$|After {{law school}} {{he passed the}} bar and began {{practicing}} law in Portland, Oregon in 1939. He <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several Consular attachés at that office, mainly doing clerical work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941.|$|E
5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time {{to carry out the}} works. In July 1855, an Act to make a direct connection to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E
50|$|Vinnicombe won a Scottish league winners' {{medal in}} 1991, {{but over the}} next few years <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to break into the Rangers first team. On 30 June 1994, after only 27 {{appearances}} in nearly five years, he joined Burnley for £200,000.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the debate}} went on, the Pythons <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to be polite, {{especially}} because their opponents barely {{let them get}} a word in. According to Palin, the Bishop was [...] "outrageously dismissing any points we made as 'rubbish' or 'unworthy of an educated man'".|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} season, he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> {{to get into}} the first team and on 17 September 1999 he moved down a division to West Bromwich Albion for £50,000. Townsends high wage demands prevented a move back to Norwich or a loan spell with non-league Boston United.|$|R
5|$|Mildred Walpole <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{to settle}} in New Zealand, and {{something}} of her restlessness and insecurity affected the character of her eldest child. In 1889, {{two years after the}} birth of the couple's daughter, Dorothea ("Dorothy"), Somerset Walpole accepted a prominent and well-paid academic post at the General Theological Seminary, New York. Robert ("Robin"), the third of the couple's children, was born in New York in 1892. Hugh and Dorothy were taught by a governess until the middle of 1893, when the parents decided that he needed an English education.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{had been}} widely criticised, and even booed, by City fans at {{times during the}} {{previous}} season and Eriksson said that he hoped it would not happen again and that he appreciated why Samaras could have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to play under those circumstances. Samaras was behind the likes of Valeri Bojinov and Rolando Bianchi in the pecking order and {{was included in the}} squad for the first time only on 25 September, when he was selected for a League Cup match against Norwich City. He started the match and scored a last-minute winner to put Manchester City into the quarter-final.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E
50|$|After the war, French art {{was rarely}} {{seen in the}} Institute's {{exhibitions}} and avant-garde work from the South {{was not so much}} in evidence. Now seen as part of the art establishment, the Institute (like other established art bodies) <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to attract work by younger artists, and adopted a more conservative stance which lasted until the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|In the 2014-15 season, however, Bacuna <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> {{to break}} into the {{starting}} line-up, starting just one game in the Premier League. On 15 February 2015, he scored the first of two Villa goals in the fifth round of the FA Cup in a 2-1 win over Leicester City, taking the club into the quarter-finals.|$|R
50|$|Plischke and {{his family}} {{struggled}} to integrate into New Zealand society, due to prejudices against their nationality at the time. Plischke <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> {{to be accepted by}} New Zealand architects. He felt he was already a fully qualified architect and internationally renowned, and so wasn't prepared to take examinations to become a registered architect with the New Zealand Institute of Architects.|$|R
5|$|Hobbs {{was summoned}} to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and {{subsequently}} offered {{a contract with the}} ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship—a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to find employment.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Isola {{designed}} the popular pattern Primavera, consisting of stylized Marigold flowers; this {{has since been}} printed in many different colours for tablecloths, plates and other items. In 1976 she returned to Paris, working with Al-Haggagi {{on a series of}} Egypt-inspired prints including Niili (Nile), Nubia, and Papyrus. The next year she accompanied Al-Haggagi to Boone, North Carolina where he was a lecturer. She spent the year painting, walking, and doing yoga, inspired by the scenery of the Appalachian Mountains, which she said reminded her of her home town, Riihimäki. She made some designs but <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to sell any in the American market, as there were few factories that could print fabrics to her specifications.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1945, Smyth {{approached}} Datus C. Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E
2500|$|Barden {{accused the}} others in the race of making him fall, cutting away his front wheel through their riding so he would not win. The National Cyclists Union held an inquiry and Barden made himself more unpopular by accusing the {{witnesses}} of [...] "out and out lies". The issue split fans of cycling but race promoters were more united and Barden <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to get engagements.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Kerr left Motherwell {{and signed}} a two-year {{contract}} with Hibernian. Kerr scored (what {{proved to be the}} winner in a 1-0 victory) on his debut for Hibernian against Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts on 6 August 2007. He played regularly under John Collins, but <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to hold down a first team place under Mixu Paatelainen and was released on 1 September 2008.|$|R

5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{to piece together the}} relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine {{joined the}} Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, {{where he played}} backup for veteran guard Steve Smith. He {{spent much of the}} early season injured, and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team {{at the end of the}} season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the {{defending}} champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|Dickov debuted for Blackburn Rovers as a half-time {{substitute}} against West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2004. He scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} club in the following match, a 3–2 defeat to Southampton. Dickov {{was involved in the}} majority of matches in the 2004–05 season, until a knee injury caused him to miss the last few weeks of the season. He finished the season with ten league goals. In 2005–06, Dickov <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to retain a regular place in the side, with manager Mark Hughes having signed forwards Craig Bellamy and Shefki Kuqi during the summer. A red card against West Ham United caused him to miss most of the first month of the season. He had a run of first team games in the autumn but starting appearances became fewer as the season progressed. He left the club in the summer of 2006 following the expiry of his contract.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} on [...] in the United Kingdom by Bantam Books, and on [...] in the United States by Tom Doherty Associates, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers. Although Erikson <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> {{to finish the}} novel compared to his previous works, Fall of Light won high praise from critics and fellow authors, some even hailing {{it as one of}} Erikson's best works to date.|$|R
60|$|But she <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very <b>hard</b> to {{say what}} {{she had come to}} do. Her voice failed--her eyes filled with tears.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reaction}} of the girls was, on the whole, favourable with the senior girls [...] "almost unanimously" [...] in favour of it. Younger girls however <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to adapt as they [...] "had got {{into the habit of}} depending on teachers for everything". Two surveys of the scheme among the girls and staff twelve months apart indicated that most were in favour, especially as time went on.|$|R
5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E
5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following {{incidents in the}} Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{to talk to his}} players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role in}} the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, she {{continued}} on Broadway with The Light Behind the Shadow, but was soon replaced, with {{a press release}} claiming a tooth infection, though rumors claimed it was her drinking. In 1936, she returned to Hollywood with Youth on Parole. She <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to conceal her drinking. Fewer movie roles were offered, while her drinking worsened. She made her last film appearance in the 1940 film, Triple Justice, opposite George O'Brien.|$|R
50|$|After the 1970s Europe {{experienced}} a downturn {{which led to}} leaders launching of the Single European Act which set to create a single market by 1992. The effect of this was that EFTA states <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to export to the EEC and businesses (including large EFTA corporations such as Volvo) wished to relocate within the new single market making the downturn worse for EFTA. EFTA states began to discuss closer links with the EEC despite its domestic unpopularity.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he hurried}} {{to see what}} was behind the strange wall. What do you think it was? Why, a pond! Yes, Sir, there was a pond {{right in the middle of}} the Green Forest! Trees were coming up right out of the middle of it, but it was a sure enough pond. Spotty <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> work to believe his own eyes now than when he had first seen the strange wall across the Laughing Brook.|$|R
