5|$|In 1974 the {{commission}} was reopened and issued a supplementary report, which remained classified for 25 years until published by the magazine India Today. The report said that 26,000 people were killed, rapes numbered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds,</b> and that the Mukti Bahini rebels engaged in widespread rape and other human rights abuses. Sumit Ganguly, a political scientist, believes that the Pakistani establishment has yet {{to come to terms}} with the atrocities carried out, saying that, in a visit to Bangladesh in 2002, Pervez Musharraf expressed regret for the atrocities rather than accepting responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{sea levels}} caused by global warming are another {{threat to the}} future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have {{steadily}} risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion of the Everglades.

5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} {{of listening to}} shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in {{the technical aspects of}} radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> of millions.|$|E

5|$|The ampullae of Lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs. They number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> to thousands. Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini {{to detect}} the {{electromagnetic}} fields that all living things produce. This helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or to help those in need because of World War I. Later writers have generally admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E
5|$|The most {{comprehensive}} primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence {{between him and}} his younger brother, Theo.

5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba {{for an extended period}} of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds.</b>|$|E
5|$|There was {{a lengthy}} {{battle over the}} design between the Commission of Fine Arts and the Vermont {{commission}} in charge of organizing the coin issue, {{as a result of}} which the original designer, Sherry Fry, left the project, replaced by Keck. Although the eventual reverse design of a catamount satisfied the Fine Arts Commission, it has been severely criticized by later writers. The coins did not sell out; over a fourth of the issue was returned for redemption and melting. The coins sell for at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> of dollars today, depending on condition.|$|E
5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central Asia {{are largely}} unknown, but are estimated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> of thousands based on annual harvests. Since {{the fall of}} the Soviet Union, continent-wide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August the North Korean {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked the North Korean Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for the North Korean units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds,</b> and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, the North Korean force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E
5|$|Falun Gong, a qigong {{practice}} that combines meditation with the moral philosophy articulated by founder Li Hongzhi, first began spreading widely in China in 1992. Li's first lectures outside mainland China {{took place in}} Paris in 1995. At the invitation of the Chinese ambassador to France, he lectured on his teachings and practice methods to the embassy staff and others. From that time on, Li gave lectures in other major cities in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America. He has resided permanently in the United States since 1998. Falun Gong is now practiced in some 70 countries worldwide, and the teachings have been translated to over 40 languages. The international Falun Gong community is estimated to number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> of thousands, though participation estimates are imprecise on account {{of a lack of}} formal membership.|$|E
5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E

5|$|On 21 August 1963, Tung's men, {{acting on}} Nhu's orders, raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda, Saigon's main Buddhist temple. The attacks were {{replicated}} across the nation, leaving a death toll {{estimated to be}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds.</b> The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400 monks and nuns were arrested. The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare martial law. He knew the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country. Following the attacks, U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the special forces unless {{they were used to}} fight communists rather than attacking political or religious dissidents.|$|E
5|$|On a {{surprise}} visit to Damascus {{to celebrate the}} union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds</b> of thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the United Arab States—in place of total integration. While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's plane. As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by {{senior members of the}} Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hundreds,</b> and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E
