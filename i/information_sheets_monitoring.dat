40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most blood donors stop {{donating}} {{blood at}} the beginning of their donor career. This intervention study aims to increase first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors using implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly registered donors (N = 937) received an extra <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> during their medical check-up wherein implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques were tested. Donors were randomly assigned to either the control condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> only condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with explicit commitment condition, or <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition. Logistic regression analyses examined actual first-time return behaviour after an appeal to donate blood. RESULTS: Donors in the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition had an 11 · 5 % higher return rate than donors in the control condition. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition significantly increased the odds on return behaviour compared with the control condition (OR = 1 · 65, 95 %CI = 1 · 08 - 2 · 50). CONCLUSION: This study successfully increased actual first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors by using both implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of combined interventions composed of both quiz/feedback and <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> format change performed after the standard informed consent process on the understanding of clinical study participants. The participants were 117 healthy volunteers: group A (n 50) receiving a standard <b>information</b> <b>sheet,</b> group B (n 50) receiving the photo-novella, and the control group (n 17). The subjective understanding level increased from 82. 5 to 90. 0 out of 100 points (P < 0. 001) and objective understanding level from 13. 9 to 16. 1 out of 20 points (P < 0. 001) for the choice type and 14. 0 to 15. 7 points out of 20 points (P < 0. 001) for the short-answer type after providing quiz/feedback with any type of <b>information</b> <b>sheets.</b> However, photo-novella <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> did not increase understanding levels more than the standard one.

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> designed to aid interpreters in police interviews in recognizing, conveying and inadvertently obstructing rapport-building efforts by police interviewers. The contents of this sheet were informed by past research defining rapport, and rapport uses in police interviews. We used a mixed experimental design to test the <b>information</b> <b>sheet.</b> One group (Intervention, n = 35) was randomly assigned to read an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> before responding to short vignettes of police interviewing foreign non-English speaking suspects about international crimes, while another (Control) group (n = 37) simply responded to the vignettes. Perceptions of rapport cues by the intervention group exceeded that of the control group. However, the groups performed equally well at identifying appropriate methods to convey/avoid obstructing rapport. Feedback from the intervention group on the helpfulness of the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> was largely positive. The findings were used to improve the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> which can be used to alert interpreters to the importance of rapport in suspect interviews...|$|R

40|$|Background: For blood establishments it is {{important}} that blood donors donate blood {{for a longer period of}} time. Unfortunately, many donors stop donating blood in the beginning of their donor career. It is therefore desirable that donors are well informed about, and agree with the blood donation invitation policy before their first donation. In this study new donors received an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> about the invitation policy, wherein two different manipulation techniques were used: implementation intentions and explicit commitment. Implementation intentions are said to delegate control of goal-directed behavior to situational cues, thereby eliciting these responses automatically. In addition, explicit commitment is defined as the binding of a person with a specific behavior. Aim: This study aims to increase return behavior of first-time donors using implementation intention and commitment techniques Methods: The study sample consisted of 503 new donors who came to the blood bank for their medical check-up. The medical check-up consisted of a medical questionnaire and three blood samples. The <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> for this study was handed out after the medical questionnaire and consisted of information about the invitation policy. In the implementation intention condition donors had to read the <b>information</b> <b>sheet,</b> and then fill out their donation preferences (e. g. preference for day and time). In the commitment condition donors had to read the information, sign their name and date the <b>information</b> <b>sheet.</b> All new donors were randomly assigned to one of five experimental conditions: standard procedure (control group), standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet,</b> standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions, standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with explicit commitment, standard procedure plus <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions and explicit commitment. The outcome variable was visiting the blood bank for a first donation after a first appeal to donate blood. Differences between conditions were tested with Chi square tests and statistical significance was considered when P < 0. 05. Results: A total of 320 (63. 6...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The study {{objective}} was to generate an <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> for Canadian manipulative physical therapists (CMPTs) to use when seeking informed consent for high-velocity, low-amplitude cervical manipulation. Methods: A cervical manipulation <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> (CMIS) was created with five sections: Introduction, Benefits, Risks, Procedures and Effectiveness. The content of the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> was generated using the Delphi method, followed by a mail-out survey to {{a random sample of}} CMPTs (N = 307) to determine the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> 2 ̆ 7 s acceptability and clinical utility. The proportion of CMPTs who agreed with the content of the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> and the proportion of CMPTs who indicated a willingness to use the sheet clinically were calculated. Results: The survey response rate was 74 per cent. The proportion (95 per cent confidence interval) of respondents who agreed with the content of the CMIS and approved its clinical acceptability was 0. 95 (0. 94 - 0. 96) and 0. 61 (0. 58 - 0. 64), respectively. Written comments from the CMPTs reflected concern about wording in the Risks section. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CMPTs agreed with the content of the CMIS but not how it was written. Physical therapists should consider the CMIS a proposed guideline for clinician use. Ideally, a patient version should also be created...|$|R
