50|$|Parasitic <b>drag</b> is <b>drag</b> {{that results}} when an object is moved through a fluid medium. In {{the case of}} {{aerodynamic}} <b>drag,</b> the fluid medium is the atmosphere. Parasitic <b>drag</b> {{is a combination of}} form <b>drag,</b> skin friction <b>drag</b> and interference <b>drag.</b> The other components of total <b>drag,</b> induced <b>drag,</b> wave <b>drag,</b> and ram <b>drag,</b> are separate types of <b>drag,</b> and are not components of parasitic <b>drag.</b> Parasitic <b>drag</b> does not result from the induction of lift on the body, hence it is considered parasitic.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Unstructured mesh <b>drag</b> {{prediction}} is discussed using a <b>drag</b> decomposition method. This method decomposes total <b>drag</b> into wave, profile, induced and spurious <b>drag</b> components, the latter resulting from numerical diffusion and errors. Computational {{results show that}} the method reliably predicts <b>drag</b> and is capable of meaningful <b>drag</b> decomposition. The accuracy of <b>drag</b> {{prediction is}} increased by eliminating the spurious <b>drag</b> component from the total <b>drag.</b> It is also confirmed that the physical <b>drag</b> components are almost independent of the mesh resolution or scheme modification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} of a uniform and accelerated motion projectile in viscous incompressible fluid were calculated by numerical simulation and dynamic mesh method. The effect of velocity and acceleration was investigated. The {{results show that}} the variation rules of added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient are basically the same when the projectile moves at different speeds. The added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller and <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of speed. The variation rules of the added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient are the same as uniform motion when the projectile moves at different accelerations. The added mass and <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller and <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of acceleration. These reveal that the motion region, velocity and acceleration have some effect on the added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drag</b> {{reduction}} for aerial vehicles has a {{range of}} positive ramifications: reduced fuel consumption, larger operational range, greater endurance and higher achievable speeds. The aerodynamic <b>drag</b> breakdown of a transport aircraft at cruise shows that the skin friction <b>drag</b> and the lift-induced <b>drag</b> constitute the two main sources of <b>drag,</b> approximately one half and {{one third of the}} total <b>drag.</b> The paper summarizes {{the state of the art}} in aeronautical <b>drag</b> reduction for the `conventional’ <b>drag</b> components of viscous <b>drag,</b> <b>drag</b> due to lift and wave <b>drag,</b> and also will give an overview of the results obtained for the different mentioned topics and will try to evaluate the potential gains offered by the different technologies...|$|R

5000|$|The sum of {{friction}} <b>drag</b> and pressure (form) <b>drag</b> is called viscous <b>drag.</b> This <b>drag</b> component {{is due to}} viscosity.

50|$|<b>Drag</b> {{is a term}} {{applied to}} {{clothing}} and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. <b>Drag</b> performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. <b>Drag</b> can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. <b>Drag</b> queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. <b>Drag</b> artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the term <b>drag</b> queen covers men doing female <b>drag,</b> <b>drag</b> king covers women doing male <b>drag,</b> and faux queen covers women doing female <b>drag.</b> Nevertheless, there are <b>drag</b> artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some <b>drag</b> performers, transvestites, {{and people in the}} gay community have embraced the pornographically-derived term tranny to describe <b>drag</b> queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing; however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transgender people.|$|R
50|$|Wave <b>drag</b> {{is one of}} {{the forms}} of <b>drag</b> created by swimmers, the others being {{pressure}} <b>drag</b> and friction <b>drag.</b> Wave <b>drag</b> is created by every movement a swimmer makes in the water. The more wave <b>drag</b> is created, the more energy a swimmer must put out to make progress through the water. Therefore, anything that reduces wave <b>drag</b> will theoretically make it easier for a swimmer to swim faster. The Aquashift suit is claimed to reduce wave <b>drag</b> by as much as 53%, according to the research done by TYR. Their research also claims that the suit reduces <b>drag</b> overall by as much as 10% and pressure <b>drag</b> by 18%.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} wind-tunnel tests that demonstrate a novel <b>drag</b> reduction technique for blunt-based vehicles. For these tests, the forebody roughness of a blunt-based model was modified using micomachined surface overlays. As forebody roughness increases, boundary layer at the model aft thickens {{and reduces the}} shearing effect of external flow on the separated flow behind the base region, resulting in reduced base <b>drag.</b> For vehicle configurations with large base <b>drag,</b> existing data predict that a small increment in forebody friction <b>drag</b> {{will result in a}} relatively large decrease in base <b>drag.</b> If the added increment in forebody skin <b>drag</b> is optimized with respect to base <b>drag,</b> reducing the total <b>drag</b> of the configuration is possible. The wind-tunnel tests results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a forebody dragbase <b>drag</b> optimal point. The data demonstrate that the base <b>drag</b> coefficient corresponding to the <b>drag</b> minimum lies between 0. 225 and 0. 275, referenced to the base area. Most importantly, the data show a <b>drag</b> reduction of approximately 15 % when the <b>drag</b> optimum is reached. When this <b>drag</b> reduction is scaled to the X- 33 base area, <b>drag</b> savings approaching 45, 000 N (10, 000 lbf) can be realized...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the speed {{fluctuation}} and the <b>drag</b> force in young swimmers between genders. Twenty-three young pubertal swimmers (12 boys and 11 girls) volunteered as subjects. Speed fluctuation was measured using a kinematical mechanical method (i. e., speedo-meter) during a maximal 25 -m front crawl bout. Active <b>drag,</b> active <b>drag</b> coefficient and power needed to overcome <b>drag</b> were measured with the velocity perturbation method for another two maximal 25 m front crawl bouts with and without the perturbation device. Passive <b>drag</b> and the passive <b>drag</b> coefficient were estimated using the gliding decay velocity method after a maximal push-off from the wall while being fully immersed. The technique <b>drag</b> index was also assessed as a ratio between active and passive <b>drag.</b> Boys presented meaningfully higher speed fluctuation, active <b>drag,</b> power needed to overcome <b>drag</b> and technique <b>drag</b> index than the girls. There were no significant gender differences for active <b>drag</b> coefficient, passive <b>drag</b> and passive <b>drag</b> coefficient. There were positive and moderate-strong associations between active <b>drag</b> and speed fluctuation when controlling the effects of swim velocity. So, increasing speed fluctuation leads to higher <b>drag</b> force values and those are even higher for boys than for girls...|$|R

50|$|Fly-reel <b>drag</b> {{systems have}} two {{purposes}} 1.) They prevent spool overrun when stripping {{line from the}} reel while casting 2.)Tire out running fish by exerting pressure on the line that runs in the opposite direction. There are four main <b>drag</b> systems that are used with the fly reel {{and these are the}} ratchet-and-pawl, caliper <b>drags,</b> disc <b>drags,</b> and center-line <b>drags.</b> The ratchet-and-pawl <b>drag</b> clicks automatically while the spool is spinning. The caliper <b>drag</b> causes the calipers to brush up against the reel spool. A disc <b>drag</b> is when pressure is applied on the plates which then applies pressure on the spool. Center-line <b>drags</b> also known as the best kind of <b>drag</b> because the pressure is directly on the spool close to the axis of rotation.|$|R
