We present algorithms for building and ray tracing restricted BSP trees. The build algorithm uses a dynamic programming technique to compute coefficients that allow efficient calculation of the surface area heuristic. This algorithm reduces asymptotic runtime, and has significant impact on tree building time. Additionally, we make several simple observations which lead to very fast ray-tree traversal of RBSPs. Our new traversal algorithm is based on stateof-the-art kd-tree traversal algorithms, and effectively increases the speed of ray tracing RBSPs by an order of magnitude. We show that RBSP trees are not only practical to build, but that RBSP trees are nearly as <b>fast</b> to <b>ray</b> trace as kd-trees, generally accepted as the <b>fastest</b> <b>ray</b> acceleration structure...|$|R

40|$|We present two novel {{parallel}} algorithms for rapidly constructing bounding volume hierarchies on manycore GPUs. The first uses {{a linear}} ordering derived from spatial Morton codes to build hierarchies extremely quickly and with high parallel scalability. The second is a top-down approach {{that uses the}} surface area heuristic (SAH) to build hierarchies optimized for <b>fast</b> <b>ray</b> tracing. Both algorithms are combined into a hybrid algorithm that removes existing bottlenecks in the algorithm for GPU construction performance and scalability leading to significantly decreased build time. The resulting hierarchies are close in to optimized SAH hierarchies, but the construction process is substantially faster, leading to a significant net benefit when both construction and traversal cost are accounted for. Our preliminary results show that current GPU architectures can compete with CPU implementations of hierarchy construction running on multicore systems. In practice, we can construct hierarchies of models with up to several million triangles and use them for <b>fast</b> <b>ray</b> tracing or other applications...|$|E
40|$|Raytracing {{of dynamic}} scenes {{requires}} not only <b>fast</b> <b>ray</b> traversal, but also fast update of acceleration structures. <b>Fast</b> <b>ray</b> traversal is usually achieved through traversing several rays at {{once in a}} packet. Update of acceleration structure {{can be done by}} gradually refitting the structure or by rebuilding it from the scratch every frame. The latter approach puts no requirements on amount or behavior of objects in the scene. In this paper we will describe a raytracing system that combines fast packet traversal with Bounding Volume Hierarchy rebuilt from scratch using approximated Surface Area Heuristic. Vertex culling uses transient frustum in each leaf to quickly eliminate potential intersections with triangles lying strictly outside the frustum. This benefits from large leaves and allows shallow acceleration structure that can be built exceptionally fast with no impact on performance. We will show that combination of these two methods does provide interactive rates even on today’s desktop computers. We will also demonstrate the interactive capabilities on fast relighting of scenes with moving point lights...|$|E

40|$|Ray tracing is a {{graphical}} {{technique that}} provides realistic simulation of light sources and complex lighting effects within three-dimensional scenes, {{but it is}} a time-consuming process that requires a tremendous amount of compute power. In order {{to reduce the number of}} calculations required to render an image, many different algorithms and techniques have been developed. One such development is the use of tree-like data structures to partition space for quick traversal when finding intersection points between rays and primitives. Even with this technique, ray-primitive intersection for large datasets is still the bottleneck for ray tracing. This thesis proposes the use of a specific spatial data structure, the K-D tree, for <b>faster</b> <b>ray</b> casting of primary rays and enables a ray-triangle culling technique that compliments view frustum and backface culling. The proposed method traverses the entire tree structure to mark nodes to be inactive if it is outside of the view frustum and skipped if the triangle is a backface.
