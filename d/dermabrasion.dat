5|$|<b>Dermabrasion</b> is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with <b>dermabrasion</b> due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. <b>Dermabrasion</b> has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike <b>dermabrasion,</b> {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions ("rashes") and neoplasms (dermatological oncology deals with pre-cancers, such as an actinic keratosis; and cancers, including both benign masses, and malignant cancers- such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and most dangerously, malignant melanoma). Non-cancerous conditions include vitiligo, impetigo, purpura, pruritus, spider veins, warts, moles, oral or genital herpes, chancre sores of syphilis, exposure to poison ivy and similar plants or other venom sources, rashes, cysts, abscesses, corns, and <b>dermabrasions</b> or cases dealing with wrinkles, peeling skin, or autoimmune attacks on the skin. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine.|$|R
25|$|While not curable, {{treatment}} usually improves symptoms. Treatment {{is typically}} with metronidazole, doxycycline, or tetracycline. When {{the eyes are}} affected azithromycin eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, ivermectin cream, and isotretinoin. <b>Dermabrasion</b> or laser surgery may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.|$|E
25|$|While tattoos are {{considered}} permanent, {{it is sometimes}} possible to remove them, fully or partially, with laser treatments. Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include <b>dermabrasion,</b> salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), cryosurgery, and —which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.|$|E
2500|$|Ablative lasers such as {{the carbon}} dioxide laser (CO2) or [...] offer the best results for atrophic and acne scars. Like <b>dermabrasion,</b> {{ablative}} lasers work by destroying the epidermis to a certain depth. Healing times for ablative therapy are much longer and the risk profile is greater compared to nonablative therapy; however, nonablative therapy offers only minor improvements in cosmetic appearance of atrophic and acne scars.|$|E
2500|$|Joplin {{stated that}} she was ostracised and bullied in high school. As a teen, she became {{overweight}} and suffered with acne, leaving her with deep scars that required <b>dermabrasion.</b> Other kids at high school would routinely taunt her and call her names like [...] "pig", [...] "freak", [...] "nigger lover", or [...] "creep". She stated, [...] "I was a misfit. I read, I painted, I thought. I didn't hate niggers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regular use of {{lip balm}} and moisturizer is {{recommended}} throughout {{a course of}} treatment to reduce these problems. The dose {{may need to be}} decreased to reduce the severity of these side effects. [...] The skin becomes more fragile—especially to frictional forces—and may not heal as quickly as normal. For this reason waxing of hair, tattooing, tattoo removal, piercings, <b>dermabrasion,</b> exfoliation, etc. are not recommended. Treatment of acne scars is generally deferred until 12 months after completion of a course of isotretinoin.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dermabrasion</b> {{procedures}} are surgical, invasive procedures that typically require a local anaesthetic. Often they are performed in surgical suites or in professional medical centers. Since the procedure can typically remove {{the top to}} deeper layers of the epidermis, and extend into the reticular dermis, there is always minor skin bleeding. The procedure carries risks of scarring, skin discoloration, infections, and facial herpes virus (cold sore) reactivation. In aggressive <b>dermabrasion</b> cases, there is often tremendous skin bleeding and spray during the procedure {{that has to be}} controlled with pressure. Afterward, the skin is normally very red and raw-looking. Depending on the level of skin removal with <b>dermabrasion,</b> it takes an average of 7-30 days for the skin to fully heal (re-epithelialize). Often this procedure was performed for deeper acne scarring and deep surgical scars. <b>Dermabrasion</b> is rarely practiced currently and there are very few doctors who are trained and still perform this surgery. <b>Dermabrasion</b> has largely been replaced all over the world by newer and somewhat simpler technologies including lasers, CO2 or Erbium:YAG laser. Laser technologies carry the advantage of little to no bleeding and are often less operator dependent than <b>dermabrasion.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dermabrasion</b> {{is a type}} of {{surgical}} skin planing, typically performed in a professional medical setting by a dermatologist or plastic surgeon trained specifically in this procedure. <b>Dermabrasion</b> has been practiced for many years (before the advent of lasers) and involves the controlled deeper abrasion (wearing away) of the upper to mid layers of the skin with any variety of strong abrasive devices including a wire brush, diamond wheel or fraise, sterilized sandpaper, salt crystals, or other mechanical means. <b>Dermabrasion</b> {{should not be confused with}} microdermabrasion which is a newer and non-surgical cosmetic procedure performed by non-physician personnel, nurses, estheticians, medical assistants, and most recently untrained individuals in their homes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dermabrasion</b> is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to a true surgical procedure that aggressively abrades away the top to mid layers of the skin. The term microdermabrasion generally refers to a non-surgical procedure that abrades less deeply than <b>dermabrasion.</b> Although the mechanism of the two procedures is similar, the difference in the depth of the abrasion results in different recovery times. <b>Dermabrasion</b> recovery time may take as much as several weeks to several months whereas microdermabrasion recovery time may be as little as one to two days. After microdermabrasion, skin will be much more sensitive to sun exposure. It is best to keep out of the sun and wear sunscreen at all times after the procedure.|$|E

5000|$|Dermabrasion: <b>Dermabrasion</b> {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of large areas with multiple AK lesions. The process involves using a hand-held instrument to [...] "sand" [...] the skin, removing the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. Diamond fraises or wire brushes revolving at high speeds are used. The procedure can be quite painful and requires procedural sedation and anesthetic, necessitating a hospital stay. One-year clearance rates with <b>dermabrasion</b> treatment are as high as 96%, but diminish drastically to 54% at five years.|$|E
5000|$|Reported {{treatments}} include topical agents, <b>dermabrasion,</b> cryotherapy, laser therapy, {{and surgical}} excision. These therapies {{have a high}} failure rate because of incomplete relief of symptoms, scarring, or recurrence [...]|$|E
5000|$|After the mob hitman's failure, Graveline {{has tried}} going with [...] "local talent": a {{disfigured}} felon nicknamed [...] "Chemo" [...] who agrees to kill Stranahan {{in exchange for}} a discount on his <b>dermabrasion</b> treatments.|$|E
50|$|Dermatologists {{can often}} extract open comedones with minimal skin trauma, but closed comedones are more difficult. Laser {{treatment}} for acne might reduce comedones, but <b>dermabrasion</b> and laser therapy {{have also been}} known to cause scarring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dermabrasion</b> is a {{mechanical}} surgical skin planing method which has remained popular partially {{because it may}} afford an overall lower cost (affordable) and may provide similar superior results as newer laser method for certain skin conditions.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{treatment}} options {{are available for}} photoaged skin, including <b>dermabrasion,</b> topical application of retinoic acid, carbon dioxide laser resurfacing, hyaluronic acid injection into the dermis, imiquimod, tacrolimus ointment, and topical oestrogen therapy. These treatments have variable efficacy.|$|E
50|$|Khmer {{traditional}} medicine share with Chinese {{traditional medicine}} three explanatory models of disease: supernaturalistic theory, naturalistic theory, {{and maintenance of}} a hot-cold (yin-yang) balance. Four forms of therapy are delivered by medical and para-medical personnel: spirit offerings, <b>dermabrasion,</b> maintaining hot-cold balance, and herbal medicines.|$|E
50|$|Human skin is also {{subjected}} to abrasion {{in the form}} of exfoliation. Abrasives for this can be much softer and more exotic than for other purposes and may include things like almond and oatmeal. <b>Dermabrasion</b> and microdermabrasion are now rather commonplace cosmetic procedures which use mineral abrasives.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} {{surgical}} <b>dermabrasion</b> {{is to help}} diminish the appearance of deeper scars and skin imperfections.

50|$|As with tattoos, {{permanent}} makeup can {{be difficult}} to remove. Common techniques used for this are laser resurfacing, <b>dermabrasion</b> (physical or chemical exfoliation), and surgical removal. Camouflaging—adding a new pigment which counteracts the tattoo color and attempts to emulate normal skin color is considered a poor choice by professionals. Removal is more painful and laborious than the tattooing itself.|$|E
50|$|Cold sore {{outbreaks}} may {{be influenced}} by stress, menstruation, sunlight, sunburn, fever, dehydration, or local skin trauma. Surgical procedures such as dental or neural surgery, lip tattooing, or <b>dermabrasion</b> are also common triggers. HSV-1 can in rare cases be transmitted to newborn babies by family members or hospital staff who have cold sores; this can cause a severe disease called neonatal herpes simplex.|$|E
5000|$|The {{whole affair}} spirals out of control, though Chemo {{is able to}} steal an amount of cash from Graveline {{that allows him to}} undergo a {{complete}} facial <b>dermabrasion</b> from a competent plastic surgeon.

50|$|According to Princess Merle, the {{biography}} written by Charles Higham with Roy Moseley, Oberon suffered damage to her complexion in 1940 {{from a combination}} of cosmetic poisoning and an allergic reaction to sulfa drugs. Alexander Korda sent her to a skin specialist in New York City, where she underwent several <b>dermabrasion</b> procedures. The results, however, were only partially successful; without makeup, one could see noticeable pitting and indentation of her skin.|$|E
