The prevalence and demographics of hypertensive <b>emergencies</b> <b>and</b> urgencies have changed over the last four decades, but hypertensive <b>emergencies</b> <b>and</b> urgencies are still associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|After Mitag struck Yap, the state's {{governor}} {{declared a}} 30‑day state of <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> asked for {{aid from the}} national government. On May29, United States President George W. Bush declared a major disaster for Yap, which allocated funding for repairing storm damage and storm damage mitigation. Crop damage from Mitag caused food shortages in Yap and Chuuk, and health problems related to the storm killed one person on Nomwin. Residents and businesses in Palau sent $3,000 in donations and other relief supplies to Yap, as well as $3,000 worth of oil. The state government sent about $2,000 to storm victims. Hospitals in Guam sent medical teams to Yap with blankets, clothing, and medical supply.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Due to 10th Mountain Division efforts, {{humanitarian}} agencies {{declared an}} end to the food <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> factional fighting decreased. When Task Force Ranger and the SAR team were pinned down during a raid in what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu, the 10th Mountain Division provided infantry for the UN quick reaction force sent to rescue them. The 10th Mountain Division had two soldiers killed in the fighting, which was the longest sustained firefight by regular US Army forces since the Vietnam War. The division began a gradual reduction of forces in Somalia in February 1994, until the last soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry returned to the United States in March 1994.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} months the communists tried {{repeatedly}} to seize power in Stuttgart {{and other cities}} in Württemberg through armed rebellion, accompanied by large-scale strikes. They seized public buildings and print offices. During one such an attempt - {{at the beginning of}} April 1919 when the Bavarian Soviet Republic was formally proclaimed in Munich - a general strike took place in the Stuttgart area. The government in Stuttgart imposed a state of <b>emergency</b> <b>and</b> 16 people died in street fights. At the time of these events, Rau used his position as chief of the military police in Zuffenhausen to shut down companies that remained operational while the strike was ongoing. However, when the strike collapsed, Rau was removed from office by the government.|$|E
