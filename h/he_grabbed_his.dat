5|$|In {{his fifth}} {{year with the}} Grizzlies, he became the franchise's all-time leading rebounder on March 24 against the New York Knicks when <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> 3,072nd rebound in a Grizzlies uniform. He made 29 {{consecutive}} free throw attempts from January 24 to 28, tying the second best mark in Grizzlies history, including two straight games going 12–12 from the line, tying the best single-game mark in franchise history. Gasol and the Grizzlies returned to {{the playoffs for the}} third time in his and his team's history. Once again, they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Dallas Mavericks.|$|E
5|$|Symes {{was injured}} during {{pre-season}} but made his second Bournemouth debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2010–11 season against Charlton Athletic as a half-time substitute. Bournemouth lost the game 1–0 but played against ten-men for the last half-hour after defender José Semedo was sent off for a bad tackle on Symes. He was again a substitute for his side's League Cup match before he made his first start the following weekend as Bournemouth defeated Peterborough United 5–1 and a week later <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> first Bournemouth goal with a penalty in a 3–0 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, Symes soon suffered a shoulder injury, which required specialist treatment and kept him out for nearly a month. With Bournemouth's form pushing them towards the top of the league, Symes admitted he would have to prove himself again to manager Eddie Howe. Bournemouth, however, suffered a number of injuries to strikers, and they risked bringing Symes back early. He was brought on as a half-time substitute against Carlisle United and helped lead his side to a 2–0 victory by scoring the second goal. He instantly won a place in Bournemouth's starting team and followed up his goal-scoring performance by netting twice against Exeter City to put Bournemouth second in the table. He soon spent another six weeks on the sidelines because of a shoulder injury before returning in November. His injury problems continued during the winter and he struggled to gain a run of games in the team meaning he did not score again until February at which point he scored in three successive matches.|$|E

25|$|Taihō {{was noted}} for his skill and power when <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> opponents' mawashi or belt– {{techniques}} known as yotsu-sumo.

His most frequently used throws were sukuinage (the beltless scoop throw) and uwatenage (the overarm throw).|$|E

25|$|Group B {{produced}} {{two of the}} four semifinalists of this World Cup, and {{was also one of the}} two groups in which two, rather than three, sides would progress to the second round. Brazil and Sweden proved to be far stronger than Cameroon and Russia in every department. The game between the latter two broke two World Cup records. Oleg Salenko of Russia became the first – and remains the only – man ever to score five goals in a single World Cup game as Russia ran out 6–1 winners against their African opponents. The goals also ensured that Salenko finished the tournament joint-top scorer with six goals, having previously bagged one against Sweden. Cameroon left a mark too as Roger Milla, at the age of 42, became the oldest World Cup goalscorer of all time as <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> side's consolation goal in the game. The result was not enough to take Russia through following heavy defeats at the hands of both Brazil and Sweden. Brazil overcame Cameroon with similar ease before a draw with Sweden confirmed top spot.|$|E

[...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip.

Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail.

500|$|In the 19-minute {{music video}} for [...] "Bad"—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not {{previously}} {{seen in his}} work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> crotch, he replied, [...] "I think it happens subliminally" [...] and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. [...] "Bad" [...] garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as [...] "infamous". The video also featured Wesley Snipes; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles. For the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted [...] for the device. Although the music video for [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was not officially released in the US, in 1989 it was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award {{for the quality of}} the special effects used in its production.
