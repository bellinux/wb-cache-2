5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{dismissal}} from Fulham, Adams {{made a quick}} return to management with Swansea City in Division Three, but left after thirteen days and three matches in charge. Adams claimed that the money he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> to strengthen the team had not been forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|An episode {{centered}} on Betty <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> by the crew at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2012. Due {{to the subject}} matter and length of the episode, several scenes had to be cut or trimmed for time, since so much was being placed in the episode. A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards the story, and Sava also applauded Dunham's voice-acting.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{travelled}} to England {{to press}} his case, although Hart later {{claimed that he}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony. He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid was criticised for {{dressing}} his household and servants in clothing fit for royalty. He was accompanied on his travels by a retinue of warriors, one of whom, while at York, Wilfrid sent to abduct {{a young boy}} who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> to the church but whose family had changed their mind. Wilfrid also educated young men, both for clerical and secular careers.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{had some}} {{difficulties}} with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols. He neglected to inform Leonard Nimoy {{of this and}} instead, {{in an effort to}} get him to sign on, told him that he was the only member of the main cast not returning. After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen; Roddenberry acquiesced. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> five full seasons of the new show, but ultimately, only one and a half were produced.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{is passed}} over for an {{appointment}} as United States Secretary of State even though he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press.|$|E

5|$|When {{the group}} reached the village, Alder learned why {{his life had}} been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple who had lost their son, and planned to adopt Alder as a replacement. Alder was forced to run the gauntlet, as a rite of passage, and after he {{exhibited}} bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh. The Indian's other prisoner, Mrs. Martin, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> {{to a man in}} another village, and was taken away during Alder's adoption ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond that which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It {{was clear from the}} outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> help from Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 144 BC, Viriathus {{formed a}} league against Rome with several Celtiberian tribes and persuaded them to rise against Rome too, in the Second Numantine War. Viriathus' new {{coalition}} bested Roman armies at the Second Battle of Mount Venus in 144 BC {{and again at}} the failed Siege of Erisone. In 139 BC, Viriathus was finally killed in his sleep by three of his companions who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> gifts by Rome. In 136 and 135 BC, more {{attempts were made to}} gain complete control of the region of Numantia, but they failed. In 134 BC, the Consul Scipio Aemilianus finally succeeded in suppressing the rebellion following the successful Siege of Numantia.|$|E
5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} a Prewrath rapture {{is one of several}} premillennial views on the end-times events among some evangelical Christians, and states that Christians will be raptured {{at the end of a}} time called the Great Tribulation (which begins at the {{midpoint}} of the seventieth week of Daniel), and before the Day of the Lord. (God's wrath). The prewrath position emphasizes the biblical distinction between Satan's wrath in the Great Tribulation (which Christians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised)</b> and the wrath of God (which Christians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> deliverance/salvation from).|$|R

5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 1832, Black Hawk {{and around}} 1,000 warriors and civilians recrossed the Mississippi River into Illinois {{in an attempt}} to reclaim their land. About half of Black Hawk's band were combatants and the rest were a {{combination}} of women, children, and elderly. The band consisted of Sauk, Fox, some Potawatomi, and some Kickapoo; in addition some members of the Ho-Chunk nation were sympathetic to Black Hawk. Black Hawk's reason for crossing into Illinois was that he wanted to reclaim lost lands, and perhaps, create a confederacy of Native Americans to stand against white settlement. Other Illinois tribes promised aid to the British Band and Black Hawk believed that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> assistance by the British in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised,</b> the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.|$|E

5|$|The {{evacuation}} proceeded without {{interference from}} the PAVN. Aircraft flying air {{cover for the}} evacuation reported being tracked with surface to air radar {{in the vicinity of}} Bien Hoa Air Base (which had fallen to the PAVN on 25 April), but there were no missile launches. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of the evacuation would lessen the risk of American intervention, had apparently instructed General Dũng not to target the airlift itself. Members of the police in Saigon <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> evacuation in exchange for protecting the American evacuation buses and control of the crowds in the city during the evacuation. Disgruntled ARVN troops repeatedly hit American helicopters with small arms fire throughout the evacuation, without causing serious damage. Despite receiving sporadic NVA AAA fire, USAF and USN aircraft made no attacks on AAA or SAM sites during the evacuation.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig {{president}} would give that party the opportunity to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made a very public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> the position of Postmaster General.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>promised</b> replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
