40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{processing}} of non-verbal sounds in the primary progressive aphasias. Here, we investigated the processing of complex non-verbal sounds in detail, in a consecutive series of 20 patients with primary progressive aphasia [12 with progressive non-fluent aphasia; eight with semantic dementia]. We designed a novel experimental neuropsychological battery to probe complex sound processing at early perceptual, apperceptive and semantic levels, using within-modality response procedures that minimized other cognitive demands and matching tests in the visual modality. Patients with primary progressive aphasia had <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> non-verbal sound analysis compared with healthy age-matched individuals. <b>Deficits</b> <b>of</b> auditory early perceptual analysis were more common in progressive non-fluent aphasia, <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> apperceptive processing occurred in both progressive non-fluent aphasia and semantic dementia, and <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> semantic processing also occurred in both syndromes, but were relatively modality specific in progressive non-fluent aphasia and part of a more severe generic semantic deficit in semantic dementia. Patients with progressive non-fluent aphasia were more likely to show severe auditory than visual deficits as compared to patients with semantic dementia. These findings argue for the existence of core disorders of complex non-verbal sound perception and recognition in primary progressive aphasia and specific disorders at perceptual and semantic levels of cortical auditory processing in progressive non-fluent aphasia and semantic dementia, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{analysing}} {{effects of}} intermediate goods, capital goods and consumer goods on both import and export, and at determining the subsector led to <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> balance of payments. To achieve this, various statistical techniques have been applied. To {{carry out the}} present study, data reported by the Central Bank of Turkey {{were used in the}} time period of 2000 – 2013. These results revealed that the economic factors (intermediate, capital, consumer goods) are significantly effective on the <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> balance of payments.

Contrary to common expectation, it is concluded that the <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> balance of payments in the external trade of Turkey stem from the imports of the consumer goods.

40|$|The {{parietal cortex}} is a {{critical}} interface for attention and integration of multiple sensory signals {{that can be used}} for the implementation of motor plans. Many neurons in this region exhibit strong attention-, reach-, grasp- or saccade-related activity. Here, we review human lesion studies supporting the critical role of the parietal cortex in saccade planning. Studies of patients with unilateral parietal damage and spatial neglect reveal characteristic spatially lateralized <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> saccade programming when multiple stimuli compete for attention. However, these patients also show bilateral impairments of saccade initiation and control that are difficult to explain in the context <b>of</b> their lateralized <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> visual attention. These findings are reminiscent <b>of</b> the <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> oculomotor control observed in patients with Bálint's syndrome consecutive to bilateral parietal damage. We propose that some oculomotor deficits following parietal damage are compatible with a decisive role of the parietal cortex in saccade planning under conditions of sensory competition, while other <b>deficits</b> reflect disinhibition <b>of</b> low-level structures of the oculomotor network in the absence of top-down parietal modulation...|$|R
40|$|Neuropsychological {{research}} on adults with ADHD showed deficits in {{various aspects of}} attention.

Twenty-nine adults with ADHD and 30 healthy individuals were assessed on four 20 -min tests of sustained attention, measuring alertness, selective attention, divided attention and flexibility. The deterioration of performance over time (time-on-task effects) was compared between patients with ADHD and healthy individuals to conclude on sustained attention performance. Compared to healthy individuals, patients with ADHD showed significant <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> medium size in selective attention and divided attention. Furthermore, medium sustained attention deficits was observed in measures of alertness, selective attention and divided attention. This study supports the notion <b>of</b> sustained attention <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> adults with ADHD...|$|R

40|$|Pregnenolone {{belongs to}} a class of {{endogenous}} neurosteroids in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), which has been suggested to enhance cognitive functions through GABA(A) receptor signaling by its metabolites. It has been shown that the level of pregnenolone is altered in certain brain areas of schizophrenic patients, and clozapine enhances pregnenolone in the CNS in rats, suggesting that pregnenolone could be used to treat certain symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, early phase proof-of-concept clinical trials have indicated that pregnenolone is effective in reducing the negative symptoms and cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia patients. Here, we evaluate the actions of pregnenolone on a mouse model for schizophrenia, the dopamine transporter knockout mouse (DAT KO). DAT KO mice mirror certain symptoms evident in patients with schizophrenia, such as the psychomotor agitation, stereotypy, <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> prepulse inhibition and cognitive impairments. Following acute treatment, pregnenolone was found to reduce the hyperlocomotion, stereotypic bouts and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in DAT KO mice in a dose-dependent manner. At 60 mg/kg of pregnenolone, {{there were no significant differences}} in locomotor activities and stereotypy between wild-type and DAT KO mice. Similarly, acute treatment of 60 mg/kg of pregnenolone fully rescued PPI <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> DAT KO mice. Following chronic treatment with pregnenolone at 60 mg/kg, the cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>of</b> DAT KO mice were rescued in the paradigms of novel object recognition test and social transmission of food preference test. Pregnenolone thus holds promise as a therapeutic candidate in schizophrenia...|$|R
