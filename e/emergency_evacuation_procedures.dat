40|$|Abstract – In {{the post}} 9 / 11 era, <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> in large {{metropolitan}} areas {{has become a}} subject of national attention. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to simulate an <b>emergency</b> response to <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> in the downtown Baltimore, Maryland area. Proposed traffic modeling for simulating the response to <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> {{in the case of a}} chemical disaster was designed to determine the most efficient response procedure. Using an integrated M&S framework, this paper seeks to describe the design of the Urban Chemical Disaster simulation. Included are the engineering considerations that led to the simulation flow structure using real-time and faster than real-time components. Components of chemical dispersion, chemical concentrations and wind transport media, chemical release rates, and sensing command/control simulations, are contributing factors to traffic flow manipulation. These manipulations will provide an effective <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> response method which could be used in the near future. A number of methodologies were posited by the research group to learn which could effectively mitigate a potential bioterrorist attack. Lessons learned in the collaboration along with feasible alternatives are discussed in further detail...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} in this work that the average {{individual}} egress time and other perfor-mance indicators for egress of people from a building can be improved under certain circumstances if counterflow occurs. The circumstances include widely varying walk-ing speeds and two differently far located exits with different capacity.

As the difficulty of exit signage with counterflow remains one can-not conclude from the result that an <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> with counterflow would really be the better variant. ...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{evacuation}} from transport terminals in {{an emergency}} can be constrained by the complex nature of the buildings. Although emergency signage systems are widely used as a well established means of facilitating evacuation, recent research demonstrates that only 38 % of people 'see' conventional static emergency signage in simulated emergency situations. Besides, conventional signage only conveys single and passive information; therefore, they cannot be adapted to respond to developing evacuation situations. The EU FP 7 GETWAY project addresses this problem for transport terminals {{through the development of}} an Intelligent Active Dynamic Signage System (IADSS), which routes terminal passengers to their optimal exit according to the distribution of occupants {{and the nature of the}} evolving incident. This paper presents the results of two full scale evacuation trials conducted in a rail station to establish the specific benefits of the Active Dynamic Signage System (i. e. ADSS, a subsystem of the IADSS without the intelligent component) over the current standard emergency signage system. These trials demonstrate that the flashing lights of the ADSS do have a greater effect on route choice compared to the standard signage system and therefore are more likely to promote the adoption of <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> than would otherwise be the case, especially where evacuees are required to adopt routes not entirely based on proximity...|$|E
40|$|Problem-based {{learning}} is an instructional strategy that emphasises active and experiential learning through problem-solving activity. Using gaming technologies to embed this approach in a three-dimensional (3 D) simulation environment provides users with a dynamic, responsive, visually engaging, and cost effective learning experience. Representing real world problems in 3 D simulation environments develops {{knowledge and skills}} that are applicable to their resolution. The Simulation, User, and Problem-based Learning (SUPL) Design Framework was developed to inform the design of learning environments which develop problem-solving knowledge for real world application. This framework identifies design factors relative to the user, the problem-solving task, and the 3 D simulation environment which facilitate the transfer, development, and application of problem-solving knowledge. To assess {{the validity of the}} SUPL Design Framework, the Fires in Underground Mines Evacuation Simulator (FUMES) was developed to train mining personnel in <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> at the Challenger gold mine in South Australia.

The effectiveness of the SUPL Design Framework was also demonstrated, as was the need to design learning environments to meet the learning needs of users rather than merely as static simulations of real world problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The safety {{conditions}} regarding an emergency evacuation {{of the building}} of the Faculty of Letters, University of Lisbon, were investigated. Some traps inside the building were found and thus a group of researchers created their own emergency plan. The plan includes escape routes and a meeting point outside of the building. The goals of this experience were to test the emergency plan by conducting a pilot-evacuation exercise and also to analyze the behavior of the participants. In fact, {{this was the first time}} such an emergency evacuation exercise was performed at the Lisbon University main campus. The findings of this study raise some questions that may have policy implications: how to communicate the risk and how to include participation in planning escape; is hazard prevention education and training important for people awareness; are risks awareness a priority of public institutions. building of the University of Lisbon (FLUL), Portugal, located at the main university campus. The authors noticed a chilling reality about the exit doors: most of the doors of the basement are permanently closed, as shown in Figure 1 a, b. Although this is a security measure, the locked basement doors do not ensure the safe and quick evacuation of the building in emergencies. In addi-tion, the building itself has several traps. Figure 1 c shows a door locked with a chain, which allows access to an interior garden but no possible path to the exterior of the building. Constant building modifications, which include the creation of nar-row corridors and the division of wide rooms into smaller ones, full until the roof with books and research objects, also make emergency evacuations from the building challenging. Therefore, FLUL community should be aware of these aspects of the building, which are a threat and should practice <b>emergency</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures.</b> Portuguese Law has several national regulations related to the fire and earthquake safety for educa-tional buildings (ME, 2003, SNBPC-CML, 2005). ...|$|E
