5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle,</b> Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of a Saxon church on the site before the Norman Conquest. In 118790 Adam de Dutton founded a priory on the site for Norbertine canons but this was short-lived and there is now {{no trace of the}} priory. It is likely that the building of the present church began {{in the middle of the}} 13th century. Towards the end of the 16th century, the chancel area was remodelled and a pulpit, altar rails and communion table were installed. In 1645 the church was extensively altered and extended. The south and west walls of the nave were rebuilt and the roof of the nave was lowered. A small chapel and vestry with a stone foundation and timber framed wall were added to the south side of the chancel, while a stone extension was added to the north side. In 1711 the east end of the chancel was rebuilt and a brick tower was added at the east end of the church. In 1722 a gallery was built. Wooden floors were installed in 1813, the vestry was incorporated into the church and a new vestry was built onto the south side of the tower. In 1857 the chancel floor was tiled, the walls were painted with medieval designs and the timber supports and the chancel ceiling were plastered. Stained glass was added to windows and the gallery was removed. By 1880 the church needed major repairs, and because of this the new church was built and the old church ceased to be the parish church. Repairs were undertaken in 1894 for dry rot, in 1927 for <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle</b> and in 1958, again for <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle.</b> In 1971 the church passed into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund, the predecessor of the Churches Conservation Trust.|$|E

50|$|Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, {{the common}} clothes moth and the brown house moth, will attack cloth bindings. Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the larder beetle and the larva of the black carpet beetle and Stegobium paniceum. Larval <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetles</b> and common {{furniture}} beetles will tunnel through wood and paper (if it is nearby the wood).|$|R
50|$|In 1949, it was {{discovered}} that the church tower has become infested with <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetles</b> resulting in problems with ringing the bells. On 1 May 1949, the bells stopped ringing to allow work to begin on repairing the frame and recast the bells. The new ring of bells was dedicated by Michael Parker, the Archdeacon of Aston on 9 September 1950.|$|R
500|$|The library holds 11,000 {{antiquarian}} {{printed books}} and houses {{many of the}} college's rare texts, including a Greek bible dating from 1545 and signed by Philipp Melanchthon and others, much of the library of the scholar and philosopher Lord Herbert of Cherbury and 17th-century volumes by Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. The library also holds the undergraduate thesis of T. E. Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"), entitled [...] "The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture {{to the end of}} XIIth Century". The college launched a restoration appeal in 2007 for work that was anticipated to cost Â£700,000. The roof was leaking, the floorboards had been affected by dry rot and <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle,</b> and new heating and ultra-violet light controls were needed to help preserve the books. The work to remedy these problems, and others, was completed in 2008.|$|E
500|$|The castle site is now {{approximately}} [...] across. As of 2015, the derelict, roofless {{parts of}} the castle are in a poor structural condition and infested with ivy, with other parts suffering from <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle.</b> None of the earthworks or curtain wall survive, except for a small portion next to the gateway; this fragment of [...] wall is [...] thick and shows the original bank to have been as much as [...] high when viewed from the outside, but is now in danger of collapse. The wooden door {{on the left side}} of the gateway probably dates from around 1300, and the right door from the early-17th century, but they are currently unusable.

500|$|The {{house and}} estate {{continued}} to be owned by the Leicester family until the death of Lt.Col.John Leicester Warren in 1975. [...] The first request in his will was that the estate should if possible be taken into {{the care of the}} National Trust, but this was declined by the Trust. [...] The executors then acted on Warren's second request, to pass the estate to a charitable institution, and thus it came into the care of the Victoria University of Manchester. [...] By the time of Warren's death the manor of Nether Tabley, comprising the estate and the halls, had been owned by the Leicester family for almost exactly 700years. [...] Col. Leicester-Warren used the house as a school from the late 1940s until 1984, after his death. In 1988 a 125year lease of the house, the stables, and the associated buildings was sold by the university to Cygnet Health Care, on condition that the suite of rooms {{on the first floor of}} the house, and their contents, should be preserved. [...] Between 1988 and 1990 the health care company carried out structural repairs to deal with damage caused by dry rot and the <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle.</b> [...] The ground and top floors of the house, and the wings, have been converted into nursing accommodation, leaving the appearance of the exterior virtually unchanged. [...] In 1990 the first floor was opened to the public under the care of the Tabley House Collection Trust. [...] The original entrance by the stairway on the south front was re-instated for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Lefroy {{was asked by}} Sir Frank Baines, Principal Architect of the Office of Works, to study ways of exterminating <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetles</b> that {{had been found in}} Westminster Hall, beside England's Houses of Parliament. As a result, he went on to devise various {{successful}} formulations for pest control, and in time Lefroy began receiving regular orders from people who had heard about his work. In 1924, Lefroy and his assistant Miss Elizabeth Eades started supplying bottles of woodworm fluid from a small factory in Hatton Garden, which later led to the formation by them of a company called Rentokil Limited (now Rentokil Initial) in 1925.|$|R
5000|$|Powderpost beetles are a {{group of}} seventy species of woodboring beetles {{classified}} in the insect subfamily Lyctinae. These beetles, along with spider <b>beetles,</b> <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetles,</b> common furniture beetles, skin beetles, and others, make up the superfamily Bostrichoidea. While most woodborers have a large prothorax, powderpost beetles do not, making their heads more visible. In addition to this, their antennae have two-jointed clubs. They are considered pests and attack deciduous trees, over time reducing the wood to a powdery dust. The damage caused by longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) is often confused with that of powderpost beetles, but the two groups are unrelated. Their larvae are white and C-shaped.|$|R
50|$|Inspection of {{the mill}} after {{the loss of a}} sail in 1976 {{revealed}} that the trestle had been weakened by <b>Death</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Beetles.</b> The machinery and millstones were removed from the mill and placed in storage. A steel frame was constructed and used to support the mill whilst the trestle and crown tree were replaced. A new 10 ft diameter brake wheel was constructed and fitted in 1985. One pair of sails was fitted in 1987 The sails were turning in the Great Storm of 1987 although the brake was on. The second pair of sails were fitted in 1988. The roundhouse was rebuilt in 1990 and the restored mill ground {{for the first time on}} 4 April 1991.|$|R
2500|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} church {{goes back to the}} 7thcentury. The present church is believed to be built on the site where Plegmund, later Archbishop of Canterbury, lived as a hermit in the 9th century. The surrounding land used to be a marsh and the church stands in a slightly elevated area which was known as [...] "The Isle of Chester". [...] The original church was built in the 12thcentury but the present building dates mostly from the 15thcentury. [...] This was financed by the Trafford family who lived locally. [...] A tower was added at the west end in 1826. [...] Inscriptions in the church show that there were restorations in 1684, 1711, 1802â03 and 1819. [...] <b>Death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetle</b> was found in some roof rafters and the church was re-roofed in 1958. [...] Electric light was installed in the church in 1966 and central hearing was installed in 1968. [...] Since then a toilet and an entrance for disabled people have been built on to the vestry on the north side. [...] In 2006 new lighting was fitted in the church. [...] The pews were removed from the Barnston Chapel and replaced by modern chairs.|$|E

5000|$|The Company {{was founded}} in 1925 by Harold Maxwell-Lefroy, Professor of {{entomology}} at Imperial College, London, who had been investigating ways to kill <b>Death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetles</b> that had infested Westminster Hall, {{next door to the}} Houses of Parliament. Lefroy and his assistant produced an anti-woodworm fluid called Ento-Kill Fluids ("ento" [...] coming from the Latin name for insect). In 1925 he tried to register the name Entokill, but due to existing trademarks, had to choose Rentokil instead, which became the name of his company, Rentokil Ltd. On 14 October 1925, Lefroy was killed in a laboratory when an experiment produced poisonous fumes. His assistant, Elizabeth Eades, took over the running of the company.|$|R
500|$|The {{millstones}} {{were removed}} from the stone floor, which was then repaired. One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by <b>Death</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>beetles,</b> and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had rotted and the floor had sunk by [...] causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed.|$|R
30|$|The {{work of the}} Forest Research Institution [23] {{examined}} a range of pesticides, but noted only camphor oil penetrated bamboo and effective over long periods [23]. Although protection with the oil had been {{known for some time}} it was not used as it was difficult to obtain in early Edo times (17 th century), so only became popular by the mid 19 th century [24]. From latter half of 1940 â²s the use of plywood from Lauan trees had increased, but insect damage was so great that the Housing Authority prohibited its use in the 1950 â²s. However, more recent decreases in the supply Japanese hardwoods had led to re-adoption of Lauan wood protected using repellents such BHC, DDT, PCP and chloronaphthalene. <b>Death</b> <b>watch</b> <b>beetles</b> (i.e. Anobiidae in Japan) have been a cause of damage, but a lack systematic surveys means they may have occurred earlier, but their presence passed unnoticed [25].|$|R
