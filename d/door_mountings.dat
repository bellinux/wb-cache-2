It was essentially an improvement of the ER1 design, featuring footboards for low platforms, and aprons for high platforms, as well as improved electrical equipment and {{minor changes to the}} bodywork (specifically, the engineer's cab, side walls, headstocks, and <b>door</b> <b>mountings).</b> Since the mid-1960s, the ER2 has been the most widely used type of suburban train in the Soviet Union and its successor states.|$|E
