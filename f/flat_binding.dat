We present the X-ray crystal structure at 1. 5 Å resolution of a lone a-helical antifreeze protein from winter flounder, which provides a detailed look at its ice-binding features. These consist of four repeated ice-binding motifs, the side chains of which are inherently rigid or restrained by pairwise side-chain interactions to form a <b>flat</b> <b>binding</b> surface. Elaborate amino- and carboxy-terminal cap structures are also present, which explain the protein's rich a-helical content in solution. We propose an ice-binding model that accounts for the binding specificity of the antifreeze protein along the axes of the { 2021 } ice planes...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{properties}} of the family 3 carbohydratebinding module {{which is one of}} the modules of a scaffold protein of the cellulosomes from Clostridium josui (CjCBM 3) was evaluated. Although it is classified to a type of binding to surface of crystalline cellulose, it bound to celluloses which have broad amorphous regions and to soluble xyloglucan. Furthermore it is showed CjCBM 3 bound to them though its <b>flat</b> <b>binding</b> site same as it interacts with crystalline surface. This CBM possesses a wider binding surface which includes more hydrophilic residues than other CBMs which are also categorized as crystalline surface binding type. It is revealed that polar hydrophilic residues in the binding site are important to bind to xyloglucan. Additionally it implied they interact with xyloglucan side chains...|$|E

Opposed to existing standard pattern flattening method which took utmost reflection of 3 D body surface forms, this research placed its center on standardization of 2 D flattened pattern forms appropriate for high utilization of final 2 D body surface flattened pattern outputs...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Drug {{resistance}} {{results when}} {{the balance between}} the binding of inhibitors and the turnover of substrates is perturbed {{in favor of the}} substrates. Resistance is quite widespread to the HIV- 1 protease inhibitors permitting the protease to process its 10 different substrates. This processing of the substrates permits the virus HIV- 1 to mature and become infectious. The design of HIV- 1 protease inhibitors that closely fit within the substrate-binding region is proposed to be a strategy to avoid drug resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: Cocrystal structures of HIV- 1 protease with its substrates define an overlapping substrate-binding region or substrate envelope. Novel HIV- 1 protease inhibitors that were designed to fit within this substrate envelope were found to retain high binding affinity and have a <b>flat</b> <b>binding</b> profile against a panel of drug-resistant HIV- 1 proteases. SUMMARY: The avoidance of drug resistance needs to be considered in the initial design of inhibitors to quickly evolving targets such as HIV- 1 protease. Using a detailed knowledge of substrate binding appears to be a promising strategy for achieving this goal to obtain robust HIV- 1 protease inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Depth {{measures}} {{the extent of}} atom/residue burial within a protein. It correlates with properties such as protein stability, hydrogen exchange rate, protein–protein interaction hot spots, post-translational modification sites and sequence variability. Our server, DEPTH, accurately computes depth and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) values. We show that depth {{can be used to}} predict small molecule ligand binding cavities in proteins. Often, some of the residues lining a ligand binding cavity are both deep and solvent exposed. Using the depth-SASA pair values for a residue, its likelihood to form part of a small molecule binding cavity is estimated. The parameters of the method were calibrated over a training set of 900 high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of single-domain proteins bound to small molecules (molecular weight < 1. 5 [*]KDa). The prediction accuracy of DEPTH is comparable to that of other geometry-based prediction methods including LIGSITE, SURFNET and Pocket-Finder (all with Matthew’s correlation coefficient of ∼ 0. 4) over a testing set of 225 single and multi-chain protein structures. Users have the option of tuning several parameters to detect cavities of different sizes, for example, geometrically <b>flat</b> <b>binding</b> sites. The input to the server is a protein 3 D structure in PDB format. The users have the option of tuning the values of four parameters associated with the computation of residue depth and the prediction of binding cavities. The computed depths, SASA and binding cavity predictions are displayed in 2 D plots and mapped onto 3 D representations of the protein structure using Jmol. Links are provided to download the outputs. Our server is useful for all structural analysis based on residue depth and SASA, such as guiding site-directed mutagenesis experiments and small molecule docking exercises, in the context of protein functional annotation and drug discovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the amidinium group and the phenyl ring on the {{thermodynamics}} of binding of benzamidinium chloride to the serine proteinase trypsin has been studied using isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding studies with benzylammonium chloride, α-methylbenzylammonium chloride and benzamide, compounds structurally related to benzamidinium chloride, showed that hydrogen bonding between the amidinium group and the enzyme is primarily enthalpy-driven. Binding of cyclohexylcarboxamidinium chloride and acetamidinium chloride showed that the hydrophobic binding of the phenyl ring in the S 1 pocket is primarily entropy-driven and that a rigid, <b>flat</b> hydrophobic <b>binding</b> site for the inhibitor is favourable. The compounds that have been studied over a range of temperatures exhibit a negative change in heat capacity upon binding and enthalpy–entropy compensation, both characteristic of hydrophobic interactions. ...|$|R

The potential-energy surface (PES) far the 1 : 1 Ne-H 2 O interaction has been scanned at the MP 2 (full) level, with the 6 - 311 + + G(3 df, 2 pd) basis set augmented with bond functions located midway between Ne and O. The most stable neon-water arrangement has r = 320 pm, theta = 120 degrees, with a counterpoise-corrected binding energy of - 0. 54 kJ mol(- 1). The PES is otherwise quite <b>flat</b> (with <b>binding</b> energies of ca. - 0. 4 kJ mol(- 1)) for all a values if r > ca. 310 pm. The off-plane, perpendicular approach is unfavourable.

40|$|We {{describe}} a procedure for a space-time description of protein structures. The method {{is capable of}} determining populations of conformational substates, and amplitudes and directions of internal protein motions. This is achieved by fitting static and dynamic NMR data. The approach {{is based on the}} jumping-among-minima concept. First, a wide conformational space compatible with structural NMR data is sampled to find a large set of substates. Subsequently, intrasubstate motions are sampled by using molecular dynamics calculations with force field energy terms. Next, the populations of substates are fitted to NMR relaxation data. By diagonalizing a second moment matrix, directions and amplitudes of motions are identified. The method was applied to the adhesion domain of human CD 2. We found that very few substates can account for most of the experimental data. Furthermore, only two types of collective motions have high amplitudes. They represent transitions between a concave (closed) and <b>flat</b> (open) <b>binding</b> face and resemble the change upon counter-receptor (CD 58) binding...|$|R
40|$|Excitonic {{properties}} in the Kagome lattice system, which is produced by quantum wires on semiconductor surfaces, are investigated by using the exact diagonalization of a tight binding model. It is shown that due {{to the existence of}} <b>flat</b> bands the <b>binding</b> energy of exciton becomes remarkably large in the two-dimensional Kagome lattice compared to that in one-dimensional lattice, and the exciton Bohr radius is quite small as large as a lattice constant. We also discuss the magnetic field effects on the exciton binding energy and the stability of exciton against the creation of charged exciton and biexciton. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of a}} single domain Si(110) -(16 × 2) surface has been investigated by high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Four semiconducting surface states with <b>flat</b> dispersions, whose <b>binding</b> energies are 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 75, and 1. 0 eV, were observed in the bulk band gap and more than six states were observed within the projected bulk band at binding energies less than 5. 2 eV. The origins of the four surface states and of one state at a binding energy of approximately 1. 5 eV at the Γ̅ point are discussed based on the local density of states mappings obtained by STM. Further, a structural model that can explain all these five states is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs) are important, but poorly understood, cell {{signaling}} enzymes that remove phosphate groups from tyrosine and serine/threonine residues on their substrate. Deregulation of DSPs has {{been implicated in}} cancer, obesity, diabetes, inflammation, and Alzheimer’s disease. Due to their biological and biomedical significance, DSPs have increasingly become the subject of drug discovery high-throughput screening (HTS) and focused compound library development efforts. Progress in identifying selective and potent DSP inhibitors has, however, been restricted {{by the lack of}} sufficient structural data on inhibitor-bound DSPs. The shallow, almost <b>flat,</b> substrate <b>binding</b> sites in DSPs have been a major factor in hampering the rational design and the experimental development of active site inhibitors. Recent experimental and virtual HTS studies, as well as advances in molecular modeling, provide new insights into the potential mechanisms for substrate recognition and binding by this important class of enzymes. We present herein an overview of the progress, along with a brief description of applications to two types of DSPs: Cdc 25 and MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP) family members. In particular, we focus on combined computational and experimental efforts for designing Cdc 25 B and MKP- 1 inhibitors and understanding their mechanisms of interactions with their target proteins. These studies emphasize the utility of developing computational models and methods that meet the two major challenges currently faced in structure-based in silico design of lead compounds: the conformational flexibility of the target protein and the entropic contribution to the selection and stabilization of particular bound conformers...|$|R
40|$|A star {{orbiting}} a {{supermassive black}} hole can be tidally disrupted if the black hole's gravitational tidal field exceeds the star's self gravity at pericenter. Some of this stellar tidal debris can become gravitationally {{bound to the}} black hole, leading to a bright electromagnetic flare with bolometric luminosity proportional to {{the rate at which}} material falls back to pericenter. In the Newtonian limit, this flare will have a light curve that scales as t^- 5 / 3 if the tidal debris has a <b>flat</b> distribution in <b>binding</b> energy. We investigate the time dependence of the black-hole mass accretion rate when tidal disruption occurs close enough the black hole that relativistic effects are significant. We find that for orbits with pericenters comparable to the radius of the marginally bound circular orbit, relativistic effects can double the peak accretion rate and halve {{the time it takes to}} reach this peak accretion rate. The accretion rate depends on both the magnitude of the black-hole spin and its orientation with respect to the stellar orbit; for orbits with a given pericenter radius in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, a maximal black-hole spin anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum leads to the largest peak accretion rate.

50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} on 17 April 1913 by Tómas Tómasson, who began {{production of a}} (1% alc/vol) beverage, malt extract. Today it's the oldest beer-producing factory in Iceland; and now it's also a wholesaler of food and beverages. At first, the operations of Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson were based in two bedrooms {{in the basement of}} the Þórshamar house at Templarasund in Reykjavik, which Tómas had leased. Today, this house is owned by the Icelandic parliament (Althing). A year later, the company moved to the Thomsen house at Tryggvagata, and with this, the operating area grew significantly.The scope of operations was not large at first. The brewing boiler was only 65 litres, and bottles were closed by pushing the cap onto the bottle with a <b>flat</b> palm and <b>binding</b> it with wire. During the first production year, Ölgerðin sold around 38 thousand litres, mostly malt extract and white beer. The light beer Egils Pilsner came to market in the same year, as the ban on alcohol was implemented in 1915, after which it was illegal to produce alcoholic beer with more than 2.25% alcohol content. Generally, brewmasters from Germany and Denmark were hired to oversee the beer production. The company also produces soft drinks (e.g. Egils Appelsín).|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{solution}} conformation and dynamics of molecules with biological relevance, {{as well as}} the impact of their conformation stabilizing weak interactions, is for example important for drug design. Macrocycles have attractive pharmaceutical properties, and are of special interest as drug leads for targets with large, <b>flat</b> and featureless <b>binding</b> sites like protein-protein interfaces. As they are usually flexible and adopt a variety of solution geometries, the description of their ensembles is of high value. Most macrocyclic drugs are peptides or macrolides. Peptides, and in particular β-hairpin peptides, are suitable model systems for studying weak interactions. Due to their resemblance to proteins, studying peptides by solution state experiments provides knowledge gained in a biologically relevant environment. In this thesis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used for investigation of {{the solution}} ensembles of various macrocycles. Using a cyclic β-hairpin model system and NMR analysis of molecular flexibility in solution (NAMFIS), a single interstrand hydrogen bond was shown to provide significant stabilization of the folded conformation. In addition, it was shown that a chlorine-centered halogen bond stabilizes the β-hairpin to a comparable extent. Further, the solution ensembles of four cyclic β-hairpin inhibitors of the MDM 2 /p 53 protein-protein interaction were described, and a higher conformational flexibility was found to correlate with an increased inhibitory activity. In contrast, for cyclic azapeptide inhibitors of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD 36) receptor, higher flexibility correlated to decreased inhibitory activity. An increased population of one of the conformational families in solution was found to be beneficial for the CD 36 inhibitory activity. Lastly, roxithromycin, a macrolide antibacterial agent, was described to convert from a more open conformation in polar media to a more closed and less flexible conformation in non-polar media. This thesis demonstrates that macrocycles are applicable as model systems for the study of weak interaction forces, which have a large influence on their conformational behavior. Furthermore, the obtained results show that the conformational stability of macrocycles vastly influences their bioactivity...|$|R
40|$|International audience: Twenty years ago, {{researchers}} {{considered the}} synthesis of simple rotaxanes a challenging task, but with the rapid development of this field, chemists now view these interlocking molecules as accessible synthetic targets. In a major advance for the field, researchers have developed transition metals or organic molecules as templating structures, {{making it easier to}} construct these molecular systems. In addition, chemists have found ways to introduce new functional groups, which have given these compounds new properties. Today researchers can also construct multirotaxanes consisting of several individual components, but {{the synthesis of}} the most complex structures remains challenging. This Account primarily discusses the cyclic [4]rotaxanes incorporating porphyrins that the Strasbourg group has synthesized and studied during the past few years. These cyclic [4]rotaxanes consist of two rigid rods threaded through the four rings of two molecules of a bis-macrocycle, and the synthetic strategy used for making them relies on the copper(I) -driven "gathering-and-threading" reaction. The formation of the threaded precursors was mostly quantitative, and the quadruple stoppering reaction leading to the target compound produces high yields because of the efficient copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or click chemistry reaction. These rotaxanes behave as receptors for various ditopic guests. We prepared and studied two types of molecules: (i) a rigid compound whose copper(I) complex has a well-defined shape, with high selectivity for the guest geometry and (ii) a much more flexible [4]rotaxane host that could act as a distensible receptor. The rigid [4]rotaxane was crystallized, affording a spectacular X-ray structure that matched the expected chemical structure. In addition, metalation or demetalation of the rigid [4]rotaxane induces a drastic geometric rearrangement. The metal-free compound is <b>flat</b> without a <b>binding</b> pocket, while the copper-complexed species forms a rectangle-like structure. The removal of copper(I) also expels any complexed guest molecule, and this process is reversible, making the rigid porphyrinic [4]rotaxane a switchable receptor. The rigid [4]rotaxane was highly selective for short, ditopic guests in its copper(I) -complexed form, but the flexible copper(I) -complexed [4]rotaxane proved to be a versatile receptor. Its conformation can adjust {{to the size of the}} guest molecule similar to the induced fit mechanism that some enzymes employ with substrates...|$|R
