5000|$|She soon {{settled into}} her new position, and by 22 October 1891, {{she was playing}} Desdemona, to Barrett's Othello, in the first {{performance}} of an entirely new production of Shakespeare's Othello, that Barrett had adapted to accommodate Jeffries [...] "unique new school acting style" [...] (Thomas, 1894, p. 111). Jeffries was an outstanding success and, {{throughout the rest of}} her career, her performances as Desdemona were considered to be amongst her finest roles. Miss Maud Jeffries as Desdemona … At the close of the fourth act, Mr. Barrett's honours are shared with Miss Maud Jeffries, the Desdemona. She is excellent from the beginning, but here her excellence becomes remarkable. None could listen unmoved to the tearless grief expressed in her exquisite delivery of the lines [...] " [...] Am I the motive of these tears, my lord ?" [...] and I am disposed to give her inspiration credit for discovering the source of the deep stream of pathos that flows through this scene. Ordinarily the interest in the tragedy begins hereabouts to fail. But it is scarce too much to affirm that directly Miss Jeffries appears prominently in the play, it acquires a vitality at once surprising and delightful. This is partly owing to the extreme nobility and beauty of her conception, partly to the fact that a bountiful Nature has endowed her with a personality equal to the task of realising that conception, and partly to Mr. Barrett's subdued tone and harmonious accompaniment, so to speak, during this touching scene. The tempest has been sown, the whirlwind will be reaped anon. Between-whiles there is calm. There is a moment even when the old worship regains ascendancy when that lovely [...] "weed that smell'st so sweet" [...] resumes its sway over the aching sense; when with despairing tenderness Othello clasps her to his breast. It is but for a moment. At her innocent question [...] "What sin have I committed" [...] — [...] "committed", that word for ages linked with adultery — the crime and all its revolting images, hideous and maddening memories, drive from his mind all other thoughts, and once more loose the torrent of his righteous wrath and woe. [...] With the last act comes the most beautiful scene of all. To double, treble, the tremendous dramatic appeal, Mr. Barrett opens it with Desdemona's disrobing and the Willow Song. Full of pathos it ever has been, but with this addition its pathos is tenfold. Such a prelude to the sacrifice renders the murder piteous in the extreme. It is not often that players of Shakespeare can move a theatreful to tears, perhaps therefore it is worth recording that this scene as interpreted by Miss Jeffries, with faultless feeling for Desdemona's forlorn sense of desolation, deeply affects her hearers. As does the beauty of the picture she creates. Truly it might be of her, lonely and silent and sad, that Browning wrote: [...] "The same great, griefful air, As stands i' the dusk, on altar that I know, Left alone with one moonbeam in her cell, Our Lady of all the Sorrows." [...] The pathos of her acting indeed could not be deepened. Nor could there be improvement in the child-like innocence with which she combats Emilia's <b>gross</b> <b>estimate</b> of women's honour. The whole passage is exquisitely rendered, and will remain in memory as one of the gems of this most interesting revival … — Addison Bright, The Theatre, December 1891.|$|E

30|$|A {{more recent}} body of {{literature}} suggests a relationship between increasing levels of intramuscular metabolite concentrations analogous with high rates of skeletal muscle contraction, and greater group III/IV afferent firing in humans [110 – 112], which would ultimately act as a protective mechanism against peripheral fatigue by limiting descending central drive [113]. Using an isometric knee extension model in combination with ischemia to enhance the firing frequency of group III/IV afferents [114 – 116], we have observed voluntary activation, a <b>gross</b> <b>estimate</b> of central drive, to be better preserved under NaHCO 3 conditions [117]. The improved activation during alkalosis, however, was not commensurate with changes in net muscle excitation or rapid and maximal force output which declined equally in both NaHCO 3 and control conditions [117]. We speculated that the divergence {{might have been a}} result of the extreme conditions of peripheral fatigue induced by our exercise protocol (2 -min MVC of the quadriceps followed by 2  min of ischemia and ending with a 1 -min ischemic MVC) [117]. The findings may also reflect the relatively minor role afferent feedback may play in these situations of extreme peripheral fatigue, where other factors separate to group III and IV afferents {{may have contributed to the}} down-regulation of descending central drive.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{decoupling}} in the low-velocity zone {{is crucial}} for understanding plate tectonics and mantle convection. Mantle convection models fail to integrate plate kinematics and thermodynamics of the mantle. In a first <b>gross</b> <b>estimate,</b> we computed at > 300 km^ 3 /yr {{the volume of the}} plates lost along subduction zones. Mass balance predicts that slabs are compensated by broad passive upwellings beneath oceans and continents, passively emerging at oceanic ridges and backarc basins. These may correspond to the broad low-wavespeed regions found in the upper mantle by tomography. However, west-directed slabs enter the mantle more than three times faster (~ 232 km^ 3 /yr) than in the opposite east- or northeast-directed subduction zones (~ 74 km^ 3 /yr). This difference is consistent with the westward drift of the outer shell relative to the underlying mantle, which accounts for the steep dip of west-directed slabs, the asymmetry between flanks of oceanic ridges, and the directions of ridge migration. The larger recycling volumes along west-directed subduction zones imply asymmetric cooling of the underlyingmantle and that there is an “easterly” directed component of the upwelling replacement mantle. In this model, mantle convection is tuned by polarized decoupling of the advecting and shearing upper boundary layer. Return mantleflow can result from passive volume balance rather than only by thermal buoyancy-driven upwelling...|$|E

A major drawback of standard DXA is that the bone mineral density (BMD) data cannot be used with certainty to predict who will sustain a vertebral fracture. However, measurement of BMD within vertebral subregions, instead of relying on a <b>gross</b> <b>estimate</b> of vertebral BMD, may improve diagnostic sensitivity. The aim {{of this article was}} to describe a validation study for subregional BMD measurement using lateral-projection DXA and to present preliminary data. Concurrent validity of measuring subregional BMD with DXA was established against measures of volumetric subregional BMD from peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and subregional bone volume fraction from microCT at the L 2 vertebral body in 8 cadaver spine specimens. The novel approaches for measuring subregional parameters with each imaging modality are described. Significant differences in bone parameters between vertebral subregions were observed for each imaging modality (p< 0. 05). Correspondence ranged from R(2) = 0. 01 - 0. 79 and R(2) = 0. 06 - 0. 80 between "DXA vs. pQCT" and "DXA vs. micro-CT," respectively. For both imaging modalities, correspondence with DXA was high for centrally and anteriorly positioned subregions. These data provide a basis for larger studies to examine the biological significance of heterogeneity in vertebral BMD. Andrew M. Briggs, Egon Perilli, Ian H. Parkinson, Tim V. Wrigley, Nicola L.

40|$|Plants offer {{excellent}} {{models to}} investigate how gene flow shapes {{the organization of}} genetic diversity. Their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. We have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers in seed plants. Based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (GST) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. Mode of inheritance {{appears to have a}} major effect on GST. Maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0. 67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (- 0. 10). GST at cpDNA and mtDNA markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas GST at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and GST at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. A model-based <b>gross</b> <b>estimate</b> suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen-to-seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species.

40|$|Increased {{activity}} of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has been thought to be partly re-sponsible for sodium retention in congestive heart failure, since sympatholytic drugs may increase the renal excretion of sodium in dogs (1) and patients (2) with congestive heart failure. Two other observations support the suggestion that changes in adrenergic activity may produce changes in renal function. Infusions of norepinephrine, the neurohumoral transmitter of the SNS, can decrease the excretion of sodium in normal sub-jects and in patients with Addison's disease (3). Patients with autonomic insufficiency excrete sodium at supranormal rates during infusions of normal saline (4). In the present investigation, sodium excretion during infusion of saline and during the administration of a sodium-retaining steroid has been studied before andi after sympa-thetic blockade by guanethidine. The results of these studies provide additional evidence for a role of the SNS in sodium metabolism. Methods The subjects were four normal female volunteers, 17 to 24 years, and two patients, R.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of lava flow advance and velocity is crucial during an effusive volcanic crisis. The effusion rate {{is a key}} control of lava dynamics, and proxies {{have been developed to}} estimate it in near real-time. The thermal proxy in predominant use links the satellite-measured thermal radiated power to the effusion rate. It lacks however a robust physical basis to allow time-dependent modeling. We investigate here through analogue experiments the coupling between the spreading of a solidifying flow and its surface thermal signal. We extract a first order behavior from experimental results obtained using polyethylene glycol (PEG) wax, that solidifies abruptly during cooling. We find that the flow advance is discontinuous, with relatively low supply rates yielding long stagnation phases and compound flows. Flows with higher supply rates are less sensitive to solidification and display a spreading behavior closer to that of purely viscous currents. The total power radiated from the upper surface also grows by stages, but the signal radiated by the hottest and liquid part of the flow reaches a quasi-steady state after some time. This plateau value scales around half of the theoretical {{prediction of}} a model developed previously for the spreading and cooling of isoviscous gravity currents. The corrected scaling yields satisfying estimates of the effusion rate from the total radiated power measured on a range of basaltic lava flows. We conclude that a <b>gross</b> <b>estimate</b> of the supply rate of solidifying flows can be retrieved from thermal remote-sensing, but the predictions of lava advance as a function of effusion rate appears a more difficult task due to chaotic emplacement of solidifying flows...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{investigation}} f valley-wall faulting and {{its relationship}} to bathymetry focuses on the first two segments north of the Kane Fracture Zone. The valley-wall faults imaged by deep-towed sidescan sonar show aspects common to continental normal faults, and a similar erosional pattern, from a fresh fault surface, through eroded, talus covered scarps, to scarps draped with pelagic sediments. The first, southernmost egment is a symmetric graben at the segment centre, and an asymmetric half-graben at the northern end. The second, northern segment isan asymmetric half-graben for its entire length. The gross morphology is reflected in the faulting style, with multiple small faults at he symmetric graben, and one or two large faults on the eastern wall, defining the asymmetic half-graben. This difference in faulting style may reflect differences in depth to the brittle-ductile transition, with asymmetry occurring when the brittle-ductile transition is deep and brittle faults can cross the axial valley, locking faults on the other side. A <b>gross</b> <b>estimate</b> of horizontal strain accommodated by the valley-wall faults correlates well with valley-floor bathymetry, suggesting that bathymetric segmentation is partially due to tectonic thinning at segment ends. Bathymetric segmentation (e. g. Schouten et al. 1985) correlates with variation in the gravity along the ridge axis, expressed as the mantle Bouguer anomaly. Mantle Bouguer anomaly lows at the segment centres may either reflect hot, low density crust or mantle, thicker crust, or some combination of both (Lin et al. 1990). Recent refraction studies in the southern Atlan-tic (Tolstoy et al. 1993) indicate that crust thins at segment ends. Magma chambers at slow spread-ing ridges have not been imaged on seismic reflection surveys (Detrick et al. 1990), and it is believed that they are relatively small, tempo-rary features.
