40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on design of {{adjustable}} in-line skates. Using this design, users can set its length to their shoes. Adjustable length can cover up to three shoe length sizes. Traditional wood and steel designs are now almost fully replaced by plastic. Plastics are modern materials that {{have a lot of}} useful features. They have lower density than steel, while maintaining acceptable stiffness. Major part of the design can be manufactured using plastic injection molding and wheels are made by casting technology. Remaining parts include standardized stainless steel bolts with threaded inserts and aluminum rivets. Major features, setting this design apart include stable 3 -wheel platform, fast Velcro fixing and built-in <b>hex</b> <b>driver...</b>|$|E
30|$|We have {{simulated}} {{clinical conditions}} {{by use of}} saw bone models; we recruited subjects with experience in mounting frames and instructed them to assemble these constructs {{in a manner similar}} to their clinical practice. In the first part of the experiment, loosening torque values were determined. These are not the same as the tightening torque values as different forces are involved (static vs dynamic). Values obtained demonstrate statistically significant higher loosening torque values when bolts are used to secure half pins. This suggests a higher torque is applied when half pins are secured with bolts. We surmise the difference is due to a wrench (spanner) being used in contrast to the straight <b>hex</b> <b>driver</b> for grub screws. The axial compression force (clamp force) applied through either bolt or grub screw would determine the security of hold at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied. The last variable is that under control by the surgeon and may influence the likelihood of these constructs to failure.|$|E
40|$|Background: Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) reconstruction is uncommonly complicated by postoperative infections, {{the causes of}} which are rarely identified. Hypothesis/Purpose: The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the relationship between methodological sterilization failure and ACL reconstruction infection at an army medical center. Study Design: Case series. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected on 5 postoperative infections during a 14 -week period in 2003. All ACL reconstructions completed within the past 6 years at the institution were reviewed to establish a baseline infection rate. Results: There was a 14 -week period in which 5 cases of infection occurred postoperatively, an infection rate of 12. 2 %. Previous and subsequent to the identified period, the established rate of infection after ACL reconstruction was 0. 3 %. There were no violations of sterile technique noted in any of the identified cases. All cases utilized hamstring autograft. All cases also used the DePuy Mitek Intrafix system for tibial fixation of the graft. Two of these cases had positive cultures. Conclusions: An isolated series of increased infection rate led to an investigation into the sterile technique. This revealed gross biomaterial remaining inside instrumentation common to all the cases, the DePuy Mitek Intrafix system. The modular cannulated <b>hex</b> <b>driver,</b> made to fit over a small caliber wire, had no wire brushes of a small-enough diameter for th...|$|E

30|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether there was a difference in the torque applied for securing half pins to Rancho cubes when employing these two methods; the mounting conditions were similar to those encountered in clinical practice. Five participants were asked to secure half pins on Rancho cubes using 5 grub (set) screws and 5 standard 10 -mm bolts (Fig.  1 b) in an alternating fashion to account for fatigue. They were instructed to apply as much torque as they would in clinical practice to the point they were satisfied that the half pin has been secured adequately in the Rancho cube. New Rancho cubes and screws were used on each occasion to avoid threads cutting out and altering the results. Wrenches were used to tighten the standard 10 -mm bolts and straight <b>hex</b> <b>drivers</b> for the grub screws as would be the case when done intra-operatively (Fig.  1 c).|$|R
