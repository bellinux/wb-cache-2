5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way.

I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the Bruneval raid was {{reported}} in the British media for several weeks while Winston Churchill, who had taken a personal interest in the raid, assembled the War Cabinet on 3March to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Major Frost and several other officers who had taken part. On 15May 1942 a special supplement to the London Gazette carried the announcement of nineteen decorations for the mission, including a Military Cross for Frost.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the raid against the Bruneval {{installation}} had two important effects. First, a successful raid against German-occupied territory was a welcome morale boost for the British public, and featured prominently in the British media for several weeks afterwards. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill took a personal interest in the operation, and on 3 March assembled the War Cabinet to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Major Frost and several other officers {{who had participated in}} it. Several medals were awarded as a result.|$|E

5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|One of his few close companions was {{his niece}} Betsy (Elizabeth Etty), fifth {{daughter}} {{of his brother}} John. Betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than William, and became his housekeeper in 1824. She remained in his service {{for the rest of}} his life, and as he grew older William increasingly came to depend on her, suffering distress whenever they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic whenever he did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> her. She became his companion and acted as his assistant, alongside his official assistant George Franklin.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Marion's sister Lila {{arrives in}} Fairvale and confronts Sam about the {{whereabouts}} of her sister. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to update them. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches {{the top of the}} stairs, he is attacked and murdered. When Lila and Sam do not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He finds only Mrs. Bates, who ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates killed herself ten years ago, and concludes that Arbogast lied to confuse them and made off with the $40,000. Still convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam {{make their way to the}} motel. Norman takes his unwilling mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.|$|E
5|$|In {{a memorable}} event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon's 39th {{birthday}} celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides. Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich's {{attendance at the}} Congress of Erfurt; Metternich was later glad to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Talleyrand that Napoleon's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful. In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings {{about the possibility of}} Austria invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain. His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon, that Russia was unlikely to want to fight Austria, and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe. Back in Paris, Metternich was overtly apprehensive about his own safety. When Austria declared war on France, Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna, but the effects of this were minimal. He was allowed to leave France under escort for Austria in late May 1809. After Napoleon's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats.|$|E

5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} her friends Bolo and Sky and her {{acquaintance}} Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves {{three of the}} stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the sky scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to {{a place called the}} Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for her courage, but at the price of never seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> him that it was probably for the better.|$|E
