25|$|The classic <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique</b> is with {{appropriate}} X-rays and hip scoring tests. These {{should be done}} at an appropriate age, and perhaps repeated at adulthood - if done too young they will not show anything. Since the condition is {{to a large degree}} inherited, the hip scores of parents should be professionally checked before buying a pup, and the hip scores of dogs should be checked before relying upon them for breeding. Despite the fact that the condition is inherited, it can occasionally arise even to animals with impeccably hip scored parents.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} woman's life-time {{probability of}} developing {{breast cancer is}} approximately one in seven; {{yet there is no}} causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive to breast cancer than are other breast procedures; because incidences of fat tissue necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: breast biopsy, implantation, radiation therapy, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, and liposuction of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting breast cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique</b> for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable lesion can be visualized ultrasonically and magnetically (MRI); biopsy follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a radiograph.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, when warranted, {{specific}} tests—the mirror test, vasoconstriction examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are {{included to}} the pre-operative {{evaluation of the}} prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique</b> for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} imaging techniques {{are used to}} demonstrate PSS. Ultrasonography is a rapid, convenient, non-invasive, and accurate method for diagnosis of PSS. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of congenital PSS depends on finding an anomalous vessel either in the liver or just caudal to the liver in the dorsal abdomen, usually draining into the caudal vena cava. Ultrasonography {{can also be used}} to estimate hepatic volume and vascularity, and to identify related lesions affecting other abdominal structures, such as urinary calculi. Computed tomography (CT) may be considered when ultrasound expertise is lacking or ultrasonography is considered sub-optimal (e.g. because of the conformation of the patient). Control of respiration and careful timing of CT acquisition after contrast injection is necessary for optimal depiction of PSS. Rectal portal scintigraphy using 99mtechnetium pertechnetate, a technique of imaging involving detection of gamma rays emitted by radionuclides absorbed through the rectum and into the bloodstream, demonstrates the blood vessel bypassing the liver. [...] In certain institutions, scintigraphy is the preferred <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique,</b> but this leaves the patient radioactive for 24h, which may be inconvenient depending on nursing needs. Portal venography is the definitive method for demonstrating PSS, but is invasive, hence it is best reserved for animals with a known shunt or those considered highly likely to have a shunt that was not detectable by ultrasonography.|$|E

Today the major <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> for the toxoplasmosis are serological assays, but its have many limitations. Aim : The goal {{in this study is}} to improve the diagnostic accuracy of T. gondii infection, using direct (Real Time PCR) and indirect (IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG avidity) <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques.</b> Materials and Methods: In the period between 2007 and 2008, 96 non consecutive different clinical samples (38 blood, 40 amniotic fluids, 8 cerebrospinal fluids, 10 vitreous humors) and 96 sera have been studied simultaneously through molecular biology and serological techniques. Results: Direct and indirect <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> used in this study for laboratory diagnosis of T. gondii infection were always concordant. Conclusions : The high correlation between direct and indirect <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> exhibit that serologic <b>techniques</b> are accurate <b>diagnostic</b> assays as screening test in laboratory diagnosis of toxoplasmosis...|$|R
