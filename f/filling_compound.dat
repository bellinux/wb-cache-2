The effect of filler volume fraction on the rheological behaviour is systematically studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With a view {{to improve}} {{degradation}} properties of natural rubber on prolonged cure at moderately high temperature, a study is made using a co-vulcanizable processing aid known as trans-polyocte ylene (TOR) on natural rubber <b>filled</b> <b>compounds.</b> Rheometer results show that reversion resistance im-proves at all curing temperatures {{in the presence of}} TOR-more so with EV (efficient vulcanization) and semi-EV systems compared to CV (conventional vulcanization) systems. Cure rate diminishes and activation energy increases with incorporation of TOR in natural rubber irrespective of the curing system. Modulus and hardness retention also are much better for TOR filled com-pounds under anaerobic conditions. Tensile strength, however, drops unlike modulus and hardness. Heat buildup and loss tangent (tan&delta;) results reveal less heat development in TOR <b>filled</b> <b>compounds.</b> Retention of Vr (volume fraction of rubber) value indicates a similar trend like modulus and hardness, showing preservation of network structure. Such an improvement of reversion prop-erties under anaerobic ageing conditions may be attributed to simultaneous crosslink formation on TOR phase in addition to natural rubber phase which has been explained through DSC studies. ’Author to whom correspondence should be addresse...|$|R

According to Cox-Merz’s study, dynamic complex viscosity obtained by this method showed a good agreement with shear flow viscosity measured by capillary rheometer. A master curve derived from the dynamic properties were then characterized. A crossing point of storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G’’) curves in the master curves was used to identify the final rubbery state, which indicated the transition of rubbery state and molten state. The position of this point depends on quantities and types of reinforcing or non-reinforcing fillers. The final rubbery state was shifted to higher frequency or lower temperature. It {{was found that the}} final rubbery state of CaCO 3 -filled rubber compounds was shifted to higher frequency or lower temperature by approximately 4 decades, while the translation of carbon black-filled rubber compounds was lower than unfilled rubber by about 1 decade. This phenomenon can be used to explain rubber elasticity, i. e. a decreasing of die swell of CaCO 3 <b>filled</b> <b>compounds</b> at any high processing temperature.

The modes of action of a diamine salt of fatty acid with a general structure of [RNHz+(CHz) JNH 3 +(R'COO-) z], {{referred to as a}} multifunctional additive (MFA) in carbon black and silica filled natural rubber (NR) compound have been studied. The mechanical properties have been enhanced by incorporating the MFA. Optimum mechanical properties for the natural rubber filled with carbon black compound are obtained at an MFA level which is estimated to give complete monolayer coverage of the carbon black surface. Studies on silica filled NR show a much higher optimum MFA level than for carbon black <b>filled</b> <b>compounds,</b> which is attributed to a different orientation of the MFA molecules at the silica-rubber interface. The MFA molecules may stand on the filler surface with their polar sites attached to its surface, giving rise to a much higher monolayer value. Filler dispersion, measured by computer-aided image analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showed that MFA gives improved dispersion at equivalent mixing time. The effect of the MFA on crosslink density of carbon black <b>filled</b> NR <b>compounds</b> was found to be small, in contrast to silica <b>filled</b> NR <b>compounds,</b> where the increase in crosslink density enhanced properties significantly. Techniques to examine the properties of compounds with and without MFA at equivalent levels of filler dispersion have been developed.

A mechanism of adsorption to explain the mode of action of the MFA at the elastomer/filler interface has also been proposed...|$|R
