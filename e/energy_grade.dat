40|$|Numerous Hydraulic {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} over the last Century to solve particular problems or develop general relationships. CFD offers {{a unique opportunity to}} combine and adapt this information into new revised configurations. Physical model results of individual culvert sections or configurations can be used to validate the CFD results of similar configurations. These sections can be combined into CFD composite models that are more robust. The Bureau of Public Roads through the University of Iowa conducted numerous tests on culverts, and inlet and outlet geometries. Some of these results were summarized and published in a book called “The Flow of Water Through Culverts” in 1926. The data they presented regarding outlet diffusers effect on increasing culvert capacity provides an excellent test case. Utilizing this data to compare Performance Curves, Hydraulic and <b>Energy</b> <b>Grade</b> Lines, is an effective way to validate the CFD model.

40|$|Three {{kinds of}} {{experiments}} are {{conducted to determine}} flow characteristics inside two intersecting square ducts: flow visualization {{by means of the}} dye injection, hydrogen bubble and string methods, velocity measurement using the laser Doppler anemometry, and pressure measurement using a piezometer. Angle of intersection and Reynolds number are varied. Four distinct flow regimes are disclosed: entrance, initial centrifugal, intersecting and final centrifugal regions. The geometrical dividing line in the intersection zone of the two ducts forms a flow divider separating the flow network into two independent, symmetrical flow units. Each flow unit constitutes a curved passage with a “radius of curvature” whose magnitude varies with the angle of intersection. Hence, the secondary effects prevail in each unit, resulting in complete flow mixing. The mechanisms disclosed by the flow visualization and LDA methods are supported by the quantitative results from the piezometer measurements.

The hydrodynamic energy (<b>Energy</b> <b>grade</b> line or EGL) of venous outflows must also vary considerably between vascular beds. We explored {{the mechanism of}} venous admixture of differing energy flows using a mechanical model. Materials and methods. The model simulated two venous flows coalescing at a venous junction and then flowing through collapsible venous pumps. Flow rates and pressures were monitored when the venous pumps were full (steady state) {{and when they were}} compressed and allowed to refill inducing wall motion (pump flow). Results. With increasing EGL differences between two coalescing venous flows, reduction or cessation (venous flow restriction) of the weaker flow occurred during steady state; higher base EGL of both flows ameliorated venous flow restriction and lower base EGL the opposite. Outflow obstruction favoured venous flow restriction. Pump action {{in the vicinity of the}} venous junction abolished venous flow restriction and maximized both venous flows. Conclusion. The model suggests a pivotal role for vein wall motion in venous admixture and regional perfusion.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{across the}} critical depth in free-surface flows in- volves large streamline curvature, which increases as the flow depth deviates from the asymptotic normal depth. Consideration of the asymptotic {{behavior of a}} free-surface flow to the normal depth re- quires inclusion of turbulent friction. Potential flow methods {{for the analysis of}} near-critical flow are limited to short channel reaches (Fawer 1937; Castro-Orgaz 2010) for the <b>energy</b> <b>grade</b> line to be horizontal, yet in cases including the undular hydraulic jump, a potential flow solution does not exist (Mandrup Andersen 1978; Mandrup Anderson 1980; Montes 1979). The backwater ap- proach of gradually varied flows is known to break down at the critical depth (Montes 1998). Thus, a rapidly varied flow model allowing for turbulent friction is required to simultaneously treat the transition across the critical section and the asymptotic condi- tions at uniform flow. The original model developed by Serre (1953) following Boussinesq (1877) satisfies these requirements, but regretfully, his original work is almost unknown, except in cross-reference to other works (Hager and Hutter 1984 a, b; Montes and Chanson 1998).

40|$|The Clean Water Act {{requires}} {{the establishment of}} Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for quantifying allowable pollutant loads for stream reaches in which the biological integrity of the stream is threatened. Sediment TMDLs in urban streams are particularly difficult to establish because they require (1) reliable measurement of sediment loads and (2) the ability to locate sediment sources. This research has attempted to address these challenges through a field study of North Peachtree Creek located in DeKalb County, Georgia, which has been sampled at the Century Boulevard crossing through automatic point sampling and depth-integrated sampling. Storm events from October 2003 through October 2004 provided a field record of sediment concentration and turbidity data {{over a wide range}} of storm events. Bed and bank sediment samples were collected for comparison with the point samples and depth-integrated samples. A methodology is presented whereby point sampling is used to calculate suspended sediment discharge and turbidity analysis is used to locate and characterize sediment sources. Point samples provide the boundary condition in the Rouse solution for the vertical distribution of suspended sediment to obtain suspended sediment discharge, which is then calibrated through comparison with depth-integrated sampling. The computer model HEC-RAS (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1998) was applied to the stream reach to calculate the <b>energy</b> <b>grade</b> line slope throughout each storm event for input into the sediment discharge calculations. A favorable relationship between turbidity and suspended fine sediment was found at the sampling cross-section and, through comparison with bed and bank sediment samples, was used to identify the contribution of eroded bank sediment to the total sediment discharge.

40|$|Manning's {{empirical}} formula {{in conjunction with}} Strickler's scaling is widely used to predict the bulk velocity from the hydraulic radius, the roughness size and {{the slope of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>grade</b> line in uniform channel and pipe flows at high bulk Reynolds numbers. Despite their importance in science and engineering, both Manning's and Strickler's formulations have waited for decades before finding a theoretical explanation. This was provided, for the first time, by Gioia & Bombardelli (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 88, 2002, 014501), labelled as GB 02, using phenomenological arguments. Perhaps their most remarkable finding was the link between the Strickler and the Kolmogorov scaling exponents, the latter pertaining to velocity fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the turbulence spectrum and presumed to be universal. In this work, the GB 02 analysis is first revisited, showing that GB 02 employed several ad hoc scaling assumptions for the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and, although implicitly, for the mean velocity gradient adjacent to the roughness elements. The similarity constants arising from the GB 02 scaling assumptions were presumed to be independent of, which is inconsistent with well-known flow properties in the near-wall region of turbulent wall flows. Because of the dependence of these similarity constants on, this existing theory requires the validity of the Strickler scaling to cancel the dependence of these constants on so as to arrive at the Strickler scaling and Manning's formula. Here, the GB 02 approach is corroborated using a co-spectral budget (CSB) model for the wall shear stress formulated at the cross-over between the roughness sublayer and the log region. Assuming a simplified shape for the spectrum of the vertical velocity, the proposed CSB model (subject to another simplifying assumption that production is balanced by pressure-velocity interaction) allows Manning's formula to be derived. To substantiate this approach, numerical solutions to the CSB over the entire flow depth using different spectral shapes for are carried out for a wide range of. The results from this analysis support the simplifying hypotheses used to derive Manning's equation. The derived equation provides a formulation for that agrees with reported values in the literature over seven decades of variations. While none of the investigated spectral shapes allows the recovery of the Strickler scaling, the numerical solutions of the CSB reproduce the Nikuradse data in the fully rough regime, thereby confirming that the Strickler scaling represents only an approximate fit for the friction factor for granular roughness...|$|E

Due to its low pressure-resistant, the thermal performance testing for non-pressurized SWHs is {{not as easy as}} the pressurized system. The pressure for the supplied water for the testing must be lower enough to ensure the tested SWH cannot be damaged. So, except the method identified in ISO 9459 - 2, China national standard introduces another way to test the thermal performance for the non-pressurized SWHs. It uses a pump to mix the water in the non- pressurized water tank, records the temperature at {{the beginning and the end}} of the test, and calculates the heat gain under the daily irradiation.

40|$|Today, mobile {{devices such}} as smart phones and tablets have become {{ubiquitous}} and are used everywhere. Millions of software applications can be purchased and installed on these devices, customizing them to personal interests and needs. However, the frequent use of mobile devices has let a new problem become omnipresent: their limited operation time, due to their limited energy capacities. Although energy consumption {{can be considered as}} being a hardware problem, the amount of energy required by today’s mobile devices highly depends on their current workloads, being highly influenced by the software running on them. Thus, although only hardware modules are consuming energy, operating systems, middleware services, and mobile applications highly influence the energy consumption of mobile devices, depending on how efficient they use and control hardware modules. Nevertheless, most of today’s mobile applications totally ignore their influence on the devices’ energy consumption, leading to energy wastes, shorter operation times, and thus, frustrated application users. A major reason for this energy-unawareness is the lack for appropriate tooling for the development of energy-aware mobile applications. As many mobile applications are today behaving energy-unaware and various mobile applications providing similar services exist, mobile application users aim to optimize their devices by installing applications being known as energy-saving or energy-aware; meaning that they consume less energy while providing the same services as their competitors. However, scarce information on the applications’ energy usage is available and, thus, users are forced to install and try many applications manually, before finding the applications fulfilling their personal functional, non-functional, and energy requirements. This thesis addresses the lack of tooling for the development of energy-aware mobile applications and the lack of comparability of mobile applications in terms of energy-awareness with the following two contributions: First, it proposes JouleUnit, an energy profiling and testing framework using unit-tests for the execution of application workloads while profiling their energy consumption in parallel. By extending a well-known testing concept and providing tooling integrated into the development environment Eclipse, JouleUnit requires a low learning curve for the integration into existing development and testing processes. Second, for the comparability of mobile applications in terms of energy efficiency, this thesis proposes an energy benchmarking and labeling service. Mobile applications belonging to the same usage domain are energy-profiled while executing a usage-domain specific benchmark in parallel. Thus, their energy consumption for specific use cases can be evaluated and compared afterwards. To abstract and summarize the profiling results, energy labels are derived that summarize the applications’ energy consumption over all evaluated use cases as a simple <b>energy</b> <b>grade,</b> ranging from A to G. Besides, users can decide how to weigh specific use cases for the computation of energy grades, as it is likely that different users use the same applications differently. The energy labeling service has been implemented for Android applications and evaluated for three different usage domains (being web browsers, email clients, and live wallpapers), showing that different mobile applications indeed differ in their energy consumption for the same services and, thus, their comparison is both possible and sensible. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first approach providing mobile application users comparable energy consumption information on mobile applications without installing and testing them on their own mobile devices...|$|E

Mange prosjekter var preget av såkalte vridde klasserom med en av kortveggene som fasadevegg. (Houck 2012) Denne oppgaven har undersøkt hvordan dagslysforholdene kan være i et slikt representativt dypt og vridd klasserom. Videre er det undersøkt den energimessige effekten av en alternativ helhetlig utforming med dagslys som prioritet. Dette ble gjort gjennom en case studie basert på et eksisterende referanseprosjekt. Dagslysforholdene er vurdert ved bruk av den klimatisk baserte målemetoden Useful Daylight Illuminance. Dynamiske simuleringer tar med stedsavhengige, årlige variasjoner i sol og himmelforhold i betraktning. Et alternativt forslag til klasseromsutforming med tilnærmet lik gjennomsnittlig dagslysfaktor er utsatt for de samme simuleringer. Resultatene viser at de innerste deler av et klasserom med tilnærmet 9, 3 meter dybde kan oppnå belysningsnivåer innenfor intervallet Useful Daylight Illuminance (100 - 2000 lux) for så lite som 21 % av de årlige timer undersøkt. Den årlige prosentandelen Useful Daylight Illuminance falt til under 50 % i en omtrentlig dybde av 5, 3 – 6, 3 meter avhengig av himmelretning. Anslagsvis 32 – 43 % av rommets areal oppnådde Useful Daylight Illuminance {{for under}} halvparten av de årlige timene undersøkt avhengig av himmelretning. Alternativt rom med redusert dybde oppnådde bedre resultater for de indre deler av rommet. Oppgavens simuleringer viser hvordan dagslysforholdene i klasserommet varierer med de årlige variasjoner i vær, samt er avhengig av faktorer som himmelretning, eventuell skyggeanordning, og lystransmisjon i vinduer. Romprogram for referanseprosjekt er løst med en alternativ form på klasserommet, samt prioritering av dagslys til grupperom, som styrende faktorer før utformingsprosessen er igangsatt. Endringene i utforming ga konsekvenser for bygningskroppen som en helhet. Klasserom ble tildelt et større antall fasademeter og 14 grupperom ble gitt tilgang til fasadevegg. Endringene medførte en 14, 8 % økning i totalt areal for prosjektet. Energibehovet for den {{alternative}} utformingen ble simulert med tekniske variabler beholdt tilnærmet likt som for referanseprosjekt. Det samlede forventede energibehov økte med 8, 9 %.

IMT report number 46 from 2012 found similarities between several winning projects in architectural competitions for {{schools around the}} country. Many projects were characterized by so-called twisted classrooms with windows {{on one of the}} short walls of the room. (Houck 2012) This thesis has examined the possible daylight conditions in such a representative deep and twisted classroom. Furthermore it investigated how an alternative building proposal prioritizing daylight may affect the energy consumption. This was done through a case study based on a chosen existing school. The daylight conditions were evaluated with the climate based daylight metric Useful Daylight Illuminance. Dynamic simulations take into account annual variations in sun and sky conditions. An alternative proposal for classroom dimensions with an approximately equal average daylight factor was subjected to the same simulations. The results show that the inner parts of a classroom with an approximate depth of 9, 3 meters can achieve lighting levels within the interval Useful Daylight Illuminance (100 - 2000 lux) for as little as 21 % of annual hours simulated. The annual percentages Useful Daylight Illuminance fall below 50 % at an approximate depth of 5, 3 – 6, 3 meters depending on the orientation. An estimated 32 – 43 % of the room achieves Useful Daylight Illuminance for {{less than half of the}} annual hours simulated depending on orientation. The alternative classroom with a reduced depth achieves better results for the inner parts of the room. The simulations show how the daylight conditions can vary with the variations in weather and depend on factors such as orientation, shading device, and the light transmittance of windows. The room program for the chosen case school was solved with the alternative classroom, and achieving daylight in group rooms, as a first priority in the design process. The changes in design led to an increase in square meters, shape, and subsequently simulated energy consumption. Changes resulted in an approximate 14, 8 % increase in total square meters. Energy simulations with technical factors kept equal to the existing case yielded an approximate 8, 9 % increase in total annual energy consumption. When dividing the total consumption by the respective size of the heated areas of the buildings the value increased by approximately 6, 2 % for the alternative.

The closer the notch tip to the tougher layer, the higher the impact energy of the composite due to increment of energy absorbed by plastic deformation zone ahead of the notch and vice versa. Empirical relationships have been determined to correlate the impact <b>energy</b> of functionally <b>graded</b> steels to the morphology of layers...|$|R

As of 2012, a total of 3030 companies are participating in the Korea eco-label program (KEITI 2014), which covers 9140 products in 155 item categories.|$|R
40|$|My {{starting}} point for the elaboration of this project was the promotion of a dwelling with orientation to the north and <b>energy</b> performance certificate <b>grade</b> B, given that dwelling orientation renders difficult obtaining such certificate, a factor that appeared relevant to me. Therefore, after undertaking the DAC of environmental impact on the building, it was so clear to me that I wanted to focus my final project on energy efficiency that I did not hesitate whatsoever when I was proposed the possibility to collaborate in the elaboration and follow-up of the construction of this project. The main objective of this project was to undertake the full monitoring of the construction of the above-described dwelling thus valuing the use of all the constructive solutions in order to obtain an <b>energy</b> performance certificate <b>grade</b> B. The methodology required to execute this project was focused on three main aspects: preliminary study of the project, follow-up of the construction’s execution through weekly visits on the ground together with the drafting of different minutes, and lastly the analysis of the whole executive process thus reflecting this whole process in this project. Finally, I expose some conclusions where I link the experience lived in this project through the practicum, in addition to the viability of a project execution leading to an <b>energy</b> performance certificate <b>grade</b> B and its possible variations...|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} of the energy generating home (EGH) in the utilization of both on-site and off-site renewable energy such as sources from solar <b>energy,</b> low <b>grade</b> geothermal <b>energy,</b> wind energy and biomass [19]. Through the feed-in tariff (FIT) mechanism, the excess electricity generated by the home can be sold [20], thus reducing carbon dioxide emission in electricity generation for the grid line. In Japan, the feed-in tariff law was just implemented in July 2012 [1]. With the country’s new energy policy of renewable energy utilization {{with the goal of}} eliminating of nuclear energy sources [2], it is expected that utilization of renewable energy sources for the building sector will increase.|$|R
