Over time, the requirements of satellite communication have grown extensively where higher capacity communications systems are needed. Escalating demands of microwave and millimetre wave communications are causing frequency spectrum congestion. Hence, existing and future satellite system operators are planning to employ frequency bands well above 10 GHz. The challenge in operating at such high frequencies for communication purposes is that there exists stronger electromagnetic interaction between the radio signals and atmospheric hydrometeors. Such instances will degrade the performance of such high frequency satellite communication systems.

40|$|Although the {{methodology}} for developing life predictions {{has been in}} use for some years in the industry, it is becoming clear that the implied precision {{in the use of}} a single value in years cannot be scientifically supported due to much variability between the measurement of an assumed exposure and the actual exposure and observation conditions. All print life predictions assume that the print is exposed to only one condition for its complete life. That is, a light <b>fade</b> <b>prediction</b> assumes no ozone exposure (or exposure to any other industrial gases), and no effects from high or low humidity.

A hurdle to this success is the urban Land Mobile Satellite Channel which experiences frequent and extended deep signal fades due to shadowing by man-made structures.

This dissertation evaluates available empirical test data, develops an improved channel model and investigates mitigation strategies focused on improving channel throughput and latency. The improved channel model is developed using continuous transmission mixed-Gaussian hidden Markov models and Expectation-Maximization parameter estimation. The improved model provides a better match to empirical data than previous efforts. Two fade mitigation strategies are examined. The first strategy involves modification of packet routing protocols.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{propagation}} studies within the ACTS Project Office is to acquire 20 and 30 GHz rain fade statistics using the ACTS beacon links received at the NGS (NASA Ground Station) in Cleveland. Other than the raw, statistically unprocessed rain fade events that occur in real time, relevant rain fade statistics derived from such events are the cumulative rain fade statistics as well as fade duration statistics (beyond given fade thresholds) over monthly and yearly time intervals. Concurrent with the data logging exercise, monthly maximum rainfall levels recorded at the US Weather Service at Hopkins Airport are appended to the database to facilitate comparison of observed fade statistics with those predicted by the ACTS Rain Attenuation Model. Also, the raw fade data {{will be in a}} format, complete with documentation, for use by other investigators who require realistic fade event evolution in time for simulation purposes or further analysis for comparisons with other rain <b>fade</b> <b>prediction</b> models, etc. The raw time series data from the 20 and 30 GHz beacon signals is purged of non relevant data intervals where no rain fading has occurred. All other data intervals which contain rain fade events are archived with the accompanying time stamps. The definition of just what constitutes a rain fade event will be discussed later. The archived data serves two purposes. First, all rain fade event data is recombined into a contiguous data series every month and every year; this will represent an uninterrupted record of the actual (i. e., not statistically processed) temporal evolution of rain fade at 20 and 30 GHz at the location of the NGS. The second {{purpose of the}} data in such a format is to enable a statistical analysis of prevailing propagation parameters such as cumulative distributions of attenuation on a monthly and yearly basis as well as fade duration probabilities below given fade thresholds, also on a monthly and yearly basis. In addition, various subsidiary statistics such as attenuation rate probabilities are derived. The purged raw rain fade data as well as the results of the analyzed data will be made available for use by parties in the private sector upon their request.

This thesis studies the effectiveness of Reed Solomon codes and provides a complete characterization of these codes for a class of land mobile satellite communication channels. Earlier studies {{on the performance of}} RS codes in mobile satellite channels did not consider shadowing. Furthermore, they considered only the slow fading case. In our simulation the effect of shadowing is taken into consideration and a fast fading assumption is used with system fading bandwidths of 1 to 10 percent of the transmission rate. This range of normalized fading bandwidths corresponds to vehicle speeds from 15 to 60 mph at bit rate of 2400 bps and 4800 bps for L-band carrier frequency. BER performance results show that RS codes can provide large improvement, however there is still 5 to 20 dB discrepancy between the performance in an AWGN channel and LMSAT channel.

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are self-configuring wireless {{networks that}} lack permanent infrastructure and are formed among mobile nodes on demand. Rapid node mobility results in dramatic channel variation, or fading, that degrades MANET performance. Employing channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter {{can improve the}} throughput of routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. Several routing algorithms in the literature explicitly incorporate the fading signal strength into the routing metric, thus selecting the routes with strong channel conditions. While these studies show that adaptation to the time-variant channel gain is beneficial in MANETs, they do not address {{the effect of the}} outdated fading CSI at the transmitter. For realistic mobile node speeds, the channel gain is rapidly varying, and becomes quickly outdated due the feedback delay. We analyze the link throughput of joint rate adaptation and adaptive relay selection in the presence of imperfect CSI. Moreover, for an 802. 11 network that employs geographic opportunistic routing with adaptive rate and relay selection, we propose a novel method to reduce the effect of the feedback delay at the MAC layer in the presence of Rayleigh fading. This method exploits channel reciprocity and <b>fading</b> <b>prediction</b> and does not require significant modification to the existing 802. 11 frame structure. Extensive network simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio for high mobile velocities relative to previously proposed approaches that employ outdated CSI at the transmitter.

We need to predict such noise and eliminate it. The need of predicting noise and measure of it is referred as Channel state information simply CSI. This is the measurement of noise prediction. But, here the measurement will be observed after some time units. The transmitter selects appropriate modulation technique depending on the Channel state information.

The focus has been on obtaining spectral resource information about the spectrum availability i. e. spectrum sensing for dynamic spectrum access or how to adapt radios and networks in a way that improves the effectiveness of the radio networks, for example rate adaptation. In most of these cases it is assume that the CSI is already known or it is obtained from a method that directly measures the spectrum of interest through channel estimation, <b>fading</b> <b>prediction</b> or forecasting, blind estimation, and many others. In DWEs the wireless channel may change at high rates (i. e. fast fading), and methods that directly measure the channel will not provide accurate and timely CSI needed for a cognitive radio or network. In this thesis a counterintuitive method is presented, indirect channel measurements. Indirect channel measuring is a technique used to determine the transfer function of a desired part of the RF spectrum, which spans several coherence bandwidths, without directly sending a signal through the spectrum of interest, but indirectly through adjacent spectrum. The indirect measuring of the channel has the ability to improve the timeliness and accuracy associated with the obtainment of the CSI in DWEs when using cognitive radios and networks.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} limitations of mobile radio communications is their time-varying fading channel. This thesis addresses the efficient use of channel state information to improve the communication systems, with a particular emphasis on practical issues such as compatibility with the existing wireless systems and low complexity implementation. The closed-loop transmit diversity technique is used to improve {{the performance of the}} downlink channel in MIMO communication systems. For example, the WCDMA standard endorsed by 3 GPP adopts a mode of downlink closed-loop scheme based on partial channel state information known as mode 1 of 3 GPP. Channel state information is fed back from the mobile unit to the base station through a low-rate uncoded feedback bit stream. In these closed-loop systems, feedback error and feedback delay, as well as the sub-optimum reconstruction of the quantized feedback data, are the usual sources of deficiency. In this thesis, we address the efficient reconstruction of the beamforming weights {{in the presence of the}} feedback imperfections, by exploiting the residual redundancies in the feedback stream. We propose a number of algorithms for reconstruction of beamforming weights at the base-station, with the constraint of a constant transmit power. The issue of the decoding at the receiver is also addressed. In one of the proposed algorithms, channel <b>fading</b> <b>prediction</b> is utilized to combat the feedback delay. We introduce the concept of Blind Antenna Verification which can substitute the conventional Antenna Weight Verification process without the need for any training data. The closed-loop mode 1 of 3 GPP is used as a benchmark, and the performance is examined within a WCDMA simulation framework. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms have substantial gain over the conventional method at all mobile speeds, and are suitable for the implementation in practice. The proposed approach is applicable to other closed-loop schemes as well. The problem of (long-range) <b>prediction</b> of the <b>fading</b> channel is also considered, which is a key element for many fading-compensation techniques. A linear approach, usually used to model the time evolution of the fading process, does not perform well for long-range prediction applications. We propose an adaptive algorithm using a state-space approach for the fading process based on the sum-sinusoidal model. Also to enhance the widely-used linear approach, we propose a tracking method for a multi-step linear predictor. Comparing the two methods in our simulations shows that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the linear method, for both stationary and non-stationary fading processes, especially for long-range predictions. The robust structure, as well as the reasonable computational complexity, makes the proposed algorithm appealing for practical applications...|$|R

These robots need steady wireless connectivity with their base station for control and communication. On one hand, the wireless link has to be managed to maintain a stable high quality network connection. On other hand, wireless connection should be continuously monitored to foresee network failure or inadequate link quality situations caused by entering access with low signal strength. This thesis focus on the later where we aim to address the prediction of wireless network connectivity for mobile robots. To indicate wireless connection quality, we use the Radio Signal Strength (RSS) parameter which is readily available by most wireless devices, {{and it has been}} frequently used in the literature to indicate wireless connection quality as the RSS have direct relation to the network throughput. Thus the focus of this thesis is to predict the RSS in future robot positions with reference to the current position of the robot. The solution is not straight forward because of the challenging nature of the radio signal propagation which involves complex phenomena such as path loss, shadowing and multipath <b>fading.</b> The RSS <b>prediction</b> method designed in this thesis has two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the location of radio signal source using an RSS gradient-based approach that can work in both single and multiple receivers arrangements. This information will be applied in the next prediction stage. For RSS prediction, we make use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) due to non-parametric nature, robustness to noise in the RSS data and changes in the environment. We validate our design with extensive experiments conducted using different types of mobile robots and wireless devices in indoor and outdoor environments, and under line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. We are able to achieve results with source localization error of up to 2 meters for indoor and 5 meters for outdoor environment. In terms of RSS prediction, we obtain the mean absolute prediction error of less than 5 dBm on average, for prediction within 5 meters in indoor environment and 20 meters in outdoor environment.
