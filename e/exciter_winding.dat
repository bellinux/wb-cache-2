5000|$|The {{most common}} type of {{resolver}} is the brushless transmitter resolver (other types are described at the end). On the outside, this type of resolver may look like a small electrical motor having a stator and rotor. On the inside, the configuration of the wire windings makes it different. The stator portion of the resolver houses three windings: an <b>exciter</b> <b>winding</b> and two two-phase windings (usually labeled [...] "x" [...] and [...] "y") (case of a brushless resolver). The <b>exciter</b> <b>winding</b> is located on the top; it is in fact a coil of a turning (rotary) transformer. This transformer induces current in the rotor without a direct electrical connection, thus there are no wires to the rotor limiting its rotation and no need for brushes. The two other windings are on the bottom, wound on a lamination. They are configured at 90 degrees from each other. The rotor houses a coil, which is the secondary winding of the turning transformer, and a separate primary winding in a lamination, exciting the two two-phase windings on the stator.|$|E
50|$|Single phase {{units have}} five wires: two for an <b>exciter</b> <b>winding</b> (typically line voltage) and three for the output/input. These three are bussed {{to the other}} synchros in the system, and provide the power and {{information}} to align the shafts of all the receivers. Synchro transmitters and receivers must be powered by the same branch circuit, so to speak; the mains excitation voltage sources must match in voltage and phase. The safest approach is to bus the five or six lines from transmitters and receivers at a common point. Different makes of selsyns, used in interlock systems, have different output voltages. In all cases, three-phase systems will handle more power and operate a bit more smoothly. The excitation is often 208/240 V 3-phase mains power. Many synchros operate on 30 to 60 V AC also.|$|E
40|$|The system {{includes}} a sensor head (2) movable along the overhead wire (1). The sensor head {{has at least}} one sensor element with an <b>exciter</b> <b>winding</b> and a receiver winding, which is guidable over the overhead wire being monitored, and is brought in to contact with this. With the application of an AC HF voltage on the <b>exciter</b> <b>winding,</b> eddy currents are generated in the overhead trolley wire to produce a magnetic field. The magnetic field induces an electric voltage in the receiver winding of the sensor element, which is a measure for the contact surface between the sensor element and the overhead trolley wire, and can be used to determine the wear condition of the overhead trolley wire. A multiple of sensor elements are provided, and so arranged at the sensor head, that the contact surface between wire and sensor head is completely covered by at least one sensor element.

40|$|Behavior {{of models}} of three-phase-to-single-phase rotary {{reversible}} thyristor converters of brushless synchronous compensators in a circuit simulation system is analyzed. It is shown that combined control mode of opposite-connected thyristors {{may result in}} the <b>exciter</b> armature <b>winding</b> short circuits both at the thyristor feed-forward and lagging current delay angles. It {{must be taken into}} consideration when developing brushless compensator excitation systems...|$|R
40|$|Energy-based direct {{methods for}} {{transient}} stability analysis are potentially useful both as offline tools for planning purposes {{as well as}} for online security assessment. In this paper, a novel structure-preserving energy function (SPEF) is developed using the philosophy of structure-preserving model for the system and detailed generator model including flux decay, transient saliency, automatic voltage regulator (AVR), <b>exciter</b> and damper <b>winding.</b> A simpler and yet general expression for the SPEF is also derived which can simplify the computation of the energy function. The system equations and the energy function are derived using the centre-of-inertia (COI) formulation and the system loads are modelled as arbitrary functions of the respective bus voltages. Application of the proposed SPEF to transient stability evaluation of power systems is illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|With an {{ever-increasing}} pentration of wind power into power system, the influence to overall system behavior and stability becomes obviously. Therefore, {{it is so}} necessary to require wind turbines have good grid adaptability. This paper investigates the effect of directly grid-connected front-end speed controlled wind turbines (FSCWT) on transient stability of power system. For this purpose, a voltage based synchronous generator model is used and the drive train model with WinDriver is built. By using a fast excitation control of FSCWT <b>exciter,</b> the FSCWT <b>wind</b> turbines can successfully ride through grid fault and have no problem of angular stability when connected to grid. Simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate and compare the transient performance of the IEEE 5 -machine 14 -bus system with FSCWT replace by double fed induction generators (DFIG) during a three phase fault. Results show that a better transient stability performance is achieved with an intergration of FSCWT in comparsion with DFIG, which can even bring some benefits on power system transient performance and stability. <!
