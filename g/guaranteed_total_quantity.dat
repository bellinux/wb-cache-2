The total cost, modeled as the objective function {{of the problem is}} composed of inventory costs, i.e., ordering, purchase, maintenance, shortage, and last but not least, transportation costs. The second equation determines the order quantity of the ith item from the jth supplier. The third equation <b>guarantees</b> that the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> ordered to the suppliers is equal to the total required amount. The fourth equation makes sure that the order quantity is zero when no purchase order is sent to the suppliers. Fifth equation assesses that the cost of the purchase from suppliers, regarding the considered budget to avoid any budget constraint violation sixth equation takes the space constraint into account regarding the limitations on available storage space. The last equations ensure that each product must be ordered to the supplier or suppliers, in each time period.|$|R

Production is limited through national <b>guaranteed</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>totalling</b> 1. 78 million tonnes. There is a growing emphasis on quality production. The budget for the olive oil sector in 2001 was € 2, 524 million, with € 1, 030 going to Spain, € 848 million going to Italy, € 587 million going to Greece, € 54 million going to Portugal and € 5 million going to France. Some 4 % of the utilisable agricultural area of the EU is under olives, involving some 2. 5 million producers, roughly a third of EU farmers. It also provides winter employment and considerable off farm employment in the processing industry. The EU dominates world olive production, with output having risen steadily in the 1990 s.

30|$|From the {{observations}} {{in the existing}} literature in which the ordering cost is fixed per cycle, it is seen that whenever the number of replenishment cycles is more, the ordering cost be very high than the ordering cost in one cycle though in each case <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> delivered is same in finite time horizon. Practically, in real business world, this concept is not completely error free. Again, whenever number of replenishment cycles is more then the shipment cost is reduced inversely since the quantity delivered is less per cycle. That is, if a_ 1 be the shipment cost for <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> Q to be delivered in one time in the business period then for n replenishment, the shipment cost per cycle will be a_ 1 /n, since {{in this case the}} <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> Q is delivered in n cycle of amount Q/n per cycle. So, the shipment cost per cycle varies inversely with n. Again, if the <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> Q is delivered in more than one cycle, clearly due to the processing the delivery supplier must claim an extra charge which is known as processing cost. Notedly, this type of cost will be increased whenever number of replenishment cycles also increases. That is, the ordering cost can not be constant for a fixed time horizon. But, till now, no one has considered variable ordering cost depending on replenishment cycle in a fixed time horizon.|$|R
