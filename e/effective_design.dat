25|$|In the 19th century, a more <b>effective</b> <b>design</b> for sailing {{trawlers}} {{was developed}} at the English fishing port, Brixham. These elegant wooden sailing boats spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. Their distinctive sails inspired the song Red Sails in the Sunset, written aboard a Brixham sailing trawler called the Torbay Lass. In the 1890s there were about 300 trawling vessels there, each usually owned by the skipper of the boat. Several of these old sailing trawlers have been preserved.|$|E
25|$|In {{his role}} as Inspector General of Armoured Troops, Guderian {{observed}} that Hitler was prone to experiment with too many designs, rather than finding an <b>effective</b> <b>design</b> and produce it in large numbers. He believed this resulted in logistical and repair problems for German forces in the Soviet Union. Guderian would have preferred the production of larger numbers of Panzer IVs and Panthers, and less effort spent on such projects as the Jagdtiger, the Panzer VIII Maus super tank, and the Schwerer Gustav 800mm railway gun.|$|E

The Wankel is a more <b>effective</b> <b>design</b> at high revolutions with no reciprocating parts, far fewer moving parts and no cylinder head.|$|E

25|$|Called the United States' {{first modern}} skyscraper, {{and one of}} the most {{important}} skyscrapers built in the country in the first half of the 20th century, the building featured an innovative and <b>effective</b> <b>design</b> of a T-shaped tower that allowed the maximum amount of natural light and rentable space. The tower sat on a base with a polished marble facade. The first floor of the base contained space for retail, while the second floor featured the banking hall, bank offices and associated facilities. The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's offices and banking hall featured custom-designed furniture, including custom Cartier clocks on every floor. The top of the skyscraper featured the bank's boardroom and other facilities for the board of directors. Office tenants were attracted to the tower by modern facilities such as radio receivers, and the building was also the second high-rise in the U.S. to be equipped with air conditioning. The skyscraper is topped by a red neon sign with the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's initials (PSFS) on it. Visible for , the sign has become a Philadelphia icon. Next to the sign is a television tower erected in 1948.|$|E
500|$|The {{value of}} design can be {{leveraged}} {{if it is}} managed well. Research by Chiva and Alegre shows {{that there is no}} link between the level of design investment and business success, but instead a strong correlation between design management skills and business success. This means that efficient and <b>effective</b> <b>design</b> management is crucial for maximising the value of design. <b>Effective</b> <b>design</b> management increases the efficiency of operations and process management, has a significant positive impact on process management, improves quality performance (internal and external quality), and increases operating performance.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{significant}} expansion of flexible learning in higher education as new communication technologies have broadened the scope and potential for online learning. With this expansion has come the need for pedagogically sound learning experiences and an interest in reusing <b>effective</b> pedagogical <b>designs.</b> The concept of a ‘learning design’ - a formalism for documenting educational practice to facilitate sharing and reuse by teachers, is being researched as one way of supporting dissemination of ‘best practice’. This paper reports an analytical study that sought to advance understanding of what constitutes an <b>effective</b> learning <b>design</b> description based on an analysis of learning designs in an existing repository. The study contended that an <b>effective</b> learning <b>design</b> description comprises a clear description of the pedagogy, a quality rating and advice on potential reuse.

40|$|If an <b>effective</b> {{learning}} <b>design</b> {{could be}} transferred from lecturer to lecturer, from discipline to discipline and/or from university to university, then good {{teaching and learning}} practice could be shared. <b>Effective</b> learning <b>designs</b> promote student engagement, productive learning and optimise student retention (Scott, 2005).

The results from this pilot indicate that this is not only feasible but it will also facilitate the promotion of quality teaching and learning throughout the higher education sector.
