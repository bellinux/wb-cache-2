40|$|Each {{international}} migration stream can be enumerated twice: {{at the time}} of departure from the country of emigration and {{at the time of}} arrival in the country of immigration. In practice, errors in {{international migration}} statistics are a major obstacle to the accurate analysis of migration flows. In connection with the process of <b>harmonization</b> <b>set</b> in train by Eurostat several years ago, a method of correcting defective migration data is proposed here, which makes use of this double enumeration. The method is applied to available data in a preliminary analysis. The correction factors presented here through this mathematical approach should turn out to be useful in more than one respect: to illuminate substantial problems of incompatibility of migration data and to follow the progress of the harmonization of those data...|$|R
40|$|Yeasts produce killer toxin, {{which gives}} them a {{selective}} advantage against susceptible yeasts. In this study we isolated 8 various non-pathogenic yeasts from 12 different food products and detected killer toxin activity in them against a clinical isolate of Cryptococcus neoformans by chloroform exposure method. The experiment was performed in two sets that had 3 replicates each. The first <b>set</b> <b>plates</b> and the second <b>set</b> <b>plates</b> were exposed to chloroform once and twice respectively. Among the 8 yeasts, 5 yeasts namely Sachharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pintolopesii, Candida tropicalis, Pichia anomala and Dekkera spp. showed significant amount of killer toxin activity against Cryptococcus neoformans in all the replicates, followed by candida parapsilosis and Trichosporon asahii, which showed killer toxin activity only {{in two of the}} three replicates. Geotrichum candidum showed no killer toxin activity. Killer toxin activity was observed in vitro in non-pathogenic yeast strains against medically important Cryptococcus neoformans...|$|R

50|$|Jenny {{made use}} of crystal {{oscillators}} and his so-called tonoscope to <b>set</b> <b>plates</b> and membranes vibrating. He spread quartz sand onto a black drum membrane 60 cm in diameter. The membrane was caused to vibrate by singing loudly through a cardboard pipe, and the sand produced symmetrical Chladni patterns, named after Ernst Chladni, who had discovered this phenomenon in 1787. Low tones resulted in rather simple and clear pictures, while higher tones formed more complex structures.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s, {{the name}} “BUR” {{replaced}} “BUR-BEL” on all plates. [...] "BUR" [...] was usually stamped {{on the front}} of every plate intended for sale with BUR <b>sets.</b> <b>Plates</b> cast for other barbell companies did not have this marking. In addition, plates manufactured for ACE Barbell had the name “ACE” stamped where the name [...] "BUR" [...] would normally be; these plates were identical in all other respects. BUR Barbell collars were also stamped [...] "BUR".|$|R

Lilly went out on to the landing, and set the chops to grill on the gas stove. Hastily he put a small table on the hearth-rug, spread it with a blue-and-white cloth, <b>set</b> <b>plates</b> and glasses. Aaron did not move. It was not his nature to concern himself with domestic matters--and Lilly did it best alone.|$|R

The load is transmitted to the user of the machine via a cable and pulley arrangement. The weight used is selected by inserting a pin in the stack that causes each plate above the pin to be pulled by the cable.

Michaels got up after being pinned and began screaming at Jannetty, blaming him for being eliminated. Attempting to help settle their differences, Brutus Beefcake invited both on his interview segment [...] "The Barbershop".

40|$|A {{liquid level}} sensor based on a closed field circuit {{comprises}} a ring oscillator using a symmetrical array of plate units that creates a displacement current. The displacement current varies {{as a function of}} the proximity of a liquid to the plate units. The ring oscillator circuit produces an output signal with a frequency inversely proportional to the presence of a liquid. A continuous liquid level sensing device and a two point sensing device are both proposed sensing arrangements. A second <b>set</b> of <b>plates</b> may be located inside of the probe housing relative to the sensing plate units. The second <b>set</b> of <b>plates</b> prevent any interference between the sensing plate units...|$|R

30|$|Two hundred microlitres of YPD medium {{was placed}} in each well of the microtiter plate (96 wells) under sterile conditions. Each well was inoculated with a single His+ {{transformant}} using a sterile toothpick and stirred to resuspend the cells. The microtiter plates were covered with sterile aluminum foil and incubated at 30 °C for 2  days. Later, sterile microtiter plates were used and added with 190  μl of YPD medium in each well, and inoculated with 10  μl of the culture from the first <b>set</b> of microtiter <b>plates.</b> Second <b>set</b> of <b>plates</b> were marked and oriented {{to keep track of}} the wells. The plates were covered and incubated at 30 °C for overnight. Next day, a third <b>set</b> of microtiter <b>plates</b> were sub-cultured as described above. Again the plates were incubated at 30 °C for overnight. From the third <b>set</b> of <b>plates,</b> 10  μl of culture from each well was spotted on YPD plates containing 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0  mg/ml of G 418.

Plates were incubated at 29 °C, and checked after 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th day for G 418 resistant clones.|$|R
