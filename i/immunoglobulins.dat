40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{investigating the}} responses of <b>immunoglobulin</b> G and <b>immunoglobulin</b> M as the effects of breathing exercise. This is an experimental study using the pretest – posttest group design. The samples involved {{in this study were}} 10 people. This research study was conducted in 6 weeks with the frequency of three times a week. The breathing exercise consisted of 10 movements. The laboratory examination was conducted using the ELISA (Enzyme Linked Imunsorbent Assay) method. Blood samples of the participants were taken from cubital vein ± 5 cc. The results of the first and second measurements on <b>immunoglobulin</b> M show that the levels of <b>immunoglobulin</b> increased by 4, 7 mg/dl, while on the second and third measurements on <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, the levels of <b>immunoglobulin</b> M decreased by 7, 4 mg/dl. On the first and second measurements, the levels of <b>immunoglobulin</b> G increased by 41, 86 mg/dl, while on second and third measurements, it increased by 79, 02 mg/dl. On the first and third measurement, the result shows that the levels of <b>immunoglobulin</b> G increased by 102, 88 mg/dl. The results of t-test on <b>immunoglobulin</b> G and <b>immunoglobulin</b> M on pre-and posttest show that there were significant differences. The increase of the levels of <b>immunoglobulin</b> was caused by physiological adaptation on <b>immunoglobulin.</b> The adaptation was in the form of chances from <b>immunoglobulin</b> M into <b>immunoglobulin</b> G mediated by gamma chain. The process is called Gen Switching which can be defined as the changes of one kind of <b>immunoglobulin</b> to another kind of <b>immunoglobulin,</b> for example the change of <b>immunoglobulin</b> M into <b>immunoglobulin</b> G which is mediated by gamma chain, and the change of <b>immunoglobulin</b> M into IgA mediated by alpha chain. Usually, <b>immunoglobulin</b> M will experience gen switching around day 14. By the increase of the levels of <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, it can be concluded that the body immunity increases as well. Thus, breathing exercise can be used as an exercise model to increase body immunity under the condition of proportional and programmed one.

40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{present a}} case of an unusual {{clinical}} manifestation of Guillain-Barre syndrome following a pre-existing herpes virus infection. Although {{there have been several}} reports describing the co-existence of herpes virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome, we undertook a more in-depth study of the cross-reactivity between herpes viruses and recommend a follow-up study based on serology tests. Case presentation A 39 -year-old healthy Caucasian man with Guillain-Barre syndrome presented to our facility initially with sensory disturbance, followed by an atypical descending pattern of clinical progression. On physical examination, our patient showed hot and cold temperature sensory disturbance under the T 4 vertebrae level, symmetrically diminished muscle power mainly to his lower limbs, blurred vision, a loss of taste and paresis and diminished reflexes of his lower limbs. Serology test results for common viruses on hospital admission were positive for cytomegalovirus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, cytomegalovirus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, herpes simplex virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, herpes simplex virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, and varicella zoster virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, borderline for Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G and negative for varicella zoster virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M. At one month after hospital admission his test results were positive for cytomegalovirus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, cytomegalovirus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, herpes simplex virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, varicella zoster virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, borderline for herpes simplex virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M and negative for Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M and varicella zoster virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M. At his six month follow-up, tests were positive for cytomegalovirus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, herpes simplex virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, herpes simplex virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G and varicella zoster virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> G and negative for cytomegalovirus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M and varicella zoster virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M. Conclusions The clinical manifestation of Guillain-Barre syndrome in our patient followed a combined herpes virus infection. The cross-reactivity between these human herpes viruses may have a pathogenic as well as evolutionary significance. Our patient showed seroconversion at an early stage of Epstein-Barr virus <b>immunoglobulin</b> M to <b>immunoglobulin</b> G antibodies, suggesting that Epstein-Barr virus might have been the cause of this syndrome. Even if this case is not {{the first of its kind}} to be reported, it may contribute to a better understanding of the disease and the cross-reaction mechanisms of herpes virus infections. This case report may have a broader clinical impact across more than one area of medicine, suggesting that cooperation between different specialties is always in the patient's best interest. </p...|$|R
5|$|Initially, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that <b>immunoglobulins</b> in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{preferred}} {{theory of}} immuno-dysregulation held by most researchers, aphthous stomatitis behaves dissimilarly to autoimmune diseases in many regards. There is no association between aphthous stomatitis and other autoimmune diseases, which often accompany each other; common autoantibodies are not detected, the condition tends to resolve spontaneously with advancing age rather than worsen, and usually serum <b>immunoglobulins</b> are at normal levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} severe weakness, prompt {{treatment}} with intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, {{will lead to}} good recovery in the majority. Recovery may take weeks to years. About a third have some permanent weakness. Globally death occurs in about 7.5% of those affected. Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at one or two cases per 100,000 people every year. Both sexes and {{all parts of the}} world have similar rates of disease. The syndrome is named after the French neurologists Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it with André Strohl in 1916.|$|E
40|$|Minnesota {{miniature}} piglets {{obtained by}} hysterectomy and deprived of colostrum were examined {{for the presence}} of <b>immunoglobulin</b> by immunoelectrophoresis, double-gel diffusion, and radial immunodiffusion techniques with specific anti-immunoglobulin chain sera. A large amount of variability existed between different litters of piglets and between different piglets within the same litter, ranging from no detectable <b>immunoglobulin</b> in the serum to very high <b>immunoglobulin</b> levels approaching that of the adult pig. All known classes of porcine <b>immunoglobulin</b> including <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, <b>immunoglobulin</b> M, and <b>immunoglobulin</b> A could be found in the sera from litters where there was extensive placental damage. This contaminating <b>immunoglobulin</b> was shown to have antibody activity to actinophage MSP- 2 even when present in very low concentrations. The low level contamination with <b>immunoglobulin</b> G, which was the most frequently encountered type of contaminant, was demonstrated to be similar to sow <b>immunoglobulin</b> G both antigenically and in its molecular size. The data demonstrates that individual piglets must be tested for <b>immunoglobulin</b> content rather than being assumed to be immunologically "virgin" and emphasizes the need for an intact placenta barrier to obtain piglets free from maternal <b>immunoglobulin</b> and devoid of antigenic stimulation...|$|R

5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., <b>immunoglobulins</b> and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA <b>immunoglobulins</b> in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} <b>immunoglobulins</b> (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within two weeks of the onset of symptoms, and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{variation}} in the rate and extent of recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea before the onset of disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous <b>immunoglobulins,</b> a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E
5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of <b>immunoglobulins,</b> {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E

Our data also show a dissociation between cell proliferation and polyclonal <b>immunoglobulin</b> production induced by protein A coupled to Sepharose CL- 4 B.
