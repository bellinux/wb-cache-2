40|$|At {{least seven}} {{models have been}} {{proposed}} for the epithelial transport of IgA, and each model presents particular features which are not generally appreciated. Much of the confusion in this field has been caused by the many conflicting reports about the cellular origin of the secretory component (SC) and the mode {{in which it is}} expressed by secretory epithelial cells. The transport model proposed in 1973 - 74 on the basis of test-tube experiments and immunohistochemical studies has now gained considerable support from observations made on both normal and neoplastic living epithelial cells According to this model, the <b>J</b> ("joining') <b>chain</b> and SC represent "the lock and key' in the selective external translocation of both dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM through serous-type secretory epithelial cell. Incorporation of <b>J</b> <b>chains</b> into these two Ig isotypes during their production in gland-associated immunocytes induces a configurational fit (binding site) allowing them to combine by specific non-covalent interactions with SC in the plasma membrance of the epithelial cell. After being formed on the basolateral surface of the cell, the SC-IgA and SC-IgM complexes are transported in cytoplasmic vesicles to the gland lumen along with some free SC. Covalent stabilization of human secretory IgA during this process depends on unique possibilities for disulphide-exchange reactions and is not an inherent feature of the transport model...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 2. Some {{alternative}} ways of linking µ chainsA, B) These figures depict two of many possible models of inter-µ chain disulfide bonding in hexameric IgM. As in Figure 1, the Cµ2 disulfide bonds and the Cµ4tp disulfide bonds are represented by a red double arrowhead, and the Cµ3 disulfide bonds are represented by the long double-headed arrows. In both models A and B each type of disulfide bond (Cµ2-Cµ2; Cµ3-Cµ3; Cµ4tp-Cµ4tp) joins µ chains in series {{with each of the}} others. Methods for distinguishing these and other models are discussed in reference 28.C) This representation of pentameric IgM illustrates how <b>J</b> <b>chain</b> might be bonded to µ chains that are not linked via Cµ3 disulfide bonds ...|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} {{cysteine}} in the Cµ3 domain is more subtle. As noted above, Figures 1C and 1D represent possible {{models for}} pentameric IgM. In these models each µ chain is envisaged to bind two other µ chains. However, neither model alone can fully account for the structure of polymeric IgM. For example, the model in Figure 1C predicts that the disulfide bond between the Cµ2 domains is essential for making disulfide-bonded polymeric IgM. The model in Figure 1D predicts that the disulfide bond between the Cµ3 domains is essential. In fact disulfide bonded, polymeric, IgM can still be made if {{any one of the}} three cysteines is absent. In the context of models in which each µ chain interacts with only two other µ chains, these results suggest that some molecules are like Figure 1C and some like Figure 1D. However, the availability of three cysteines for inter-µ chain bonding suggests that the µ chains might each bind three other µ chains, as illustrated in Figure 2. In the same spirit, Figure 2C presents a model for J chain-containing pentamer that reflects evidence that <b>J</b> <b>chain</b> joins µ chains that are not joined to other µ chains by the cysteines in the Cµ3 domains. These and other models, both regular and irregular are discussed elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|The kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) {{chains of}} the {{immunoglobulin}} light chain loci rearrange in a very similar way, except that the light chains lack a D segment. In other words, {{the first step of}} recombination for the light chains involves the joining of the V and <b>J</b> <b>chains</b> to give a VJ complex before the addition of the constant chain gene during primary transcription. Translation of the spliced mRNA for either the kappa or lambda chains results in formation of the Ig κ or Ig λ light chain protein.Interestingly, the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus contains protein-coding genes that can be lost with its rearrangement. This is based on a physiological mechanism and is not pathogenetic for leukemias or lymphomas. However, the rearrangement of several lambda variable subgenes can activate expression of an overlapping miRNA gene, which has consequences for gene expression regulation.|$|R
