The diallel analysis revealed that all the characters were polygenically inherited and exhibited partial dominance with additive gene action. The estimation of component of variation for these characters suggested that the (D) additive component was significant in all the traits under study and was lower than dominant components (H 1 and H 2) of variation except for number of sympodial branches per plant, number of bolls per plant and seed cotton yield per plant, where the dominant components were higher in magnitude than additive. The positive estimate of F indicated that dominant genes were in excess than recessive genes in the parents for all the traits except for <b>ginning</b> <b>out</b> <b>turn</b> percentage and fiber fineness. The ratio of H 2 / 4 H 1 indicated largely asymmetry {{of positive and negative}} genes in parents for number of bolls per plant, seed cotton yield, staple length, fiber fineness and fiber strength, and symmetrical distribution of positive and negative genes in the parents was observed for number of sympodial branches per plant, boll weight and <b>ginning</b> <b>out</b> <b>turn</b> percentage. The h 2 value for number of number of sympodial branches per plant, number of bolls per plant, boll weight, seed cotton yield per plant, <b>ginning</b> <b>out</b> <b>turn,</b> staple length, fiber fineness, and fiber strength was positive and significant which indicated that hetrotic breeding was rewarding for these traits. The correlation between W r + V r and Y i indicated that dominant genes are mainly responsible for the expression of all traits. Mass selection will be an effective method for improving the boll weight and reciprocal recurrent selection method will be helpful for improving the sympodial branches per plant, number of bolls per plant, seed cotton yield, fiber fineness and fiber strength.

The cotton production of country is improving significantly but the yield per unit area is still lower than that of the other countries due to some biotic and abiotic factors. Amongst the abiotic stresses, salinity is a serious threat next to drought. Keeping in view, the present study was conducted to assess the salt tolerance of 32 popular upland varieties released for general cultivation between 1980 and 2001 in India. The study was carried out in normal as well as saline-alkaline condition; in which salinity were created using bore well water irrigation and the average electrical conductivity level of bore well water is 3. 10 ds/m. The 32 upland cotton genotypes under both salinity and normal conditions revealed high GCV and genetic gain for number of bolls per plant, boll weight, lint yield per plant, 2. 5 per cent span length, leaf area index, Na-K ratio and seed cotton yield and these traits could be improved by simple selection.

By regressing NAWF means over time, {{the number of days}} to reach NAWF of 5. 0 (NAWF- 5) was determined. Days to NAWF- 5 were highly correlated with percent first pick of seed cotton yield. It was observed that NIAB- 78 and CRIS- 9 achieved NAWF- 5 earlier-by 109. 86 and 109. 09 days (average of three years). Days to NAWF- 5 provided a focal, point all management decisions. Therefore, it became evident that NAWF technique could be used for monitoring cotton plant after flowering, earliness determination of variety/strain and detecting fruiting problems during growth season. Six upland cotton (G. hirsutum L.) varieties were crossed in all possible. combinations. The parents and F) were sown in a replicated experiment. Hayman's diallel cross analysis was employed to investigate the nature of gene action involved in the " inl 1 eritance of node of first fruiting branch, number of monopodial branches per plant, number of sympodial branches per plant, days taken to first flower, days taken to open first boll, number of flowers per plant, number of bolls per plant, boll weight, yield, percent of seed cotton yield in first pick (percent first pick), <b>ginning</b> <b>out</b> <b>turn</b> %, staple length, fiber fineness and fiber strength. Griffing's {{technique was}} used to estimate the general and specific combining ability of parents and also genetic components of variances for above-mentioned traits. The dialleI analysis revealed that all the characters were polygeneically inherited and exhibited partial dominance with additive gene action. Significant estimates of general combining ability (GCA) were determined for all traits under study. Estimates of specific combining ability were significant for the node of first fruiting branch, number of monopodial branches per plant, number of sympodial branches per plant, days taken to first flower, number of bolls per plant, seed cotton yield, <b>ginning</b> <b>out</b> <b>turn,</b> staple length and fiber fineness. Specific combining ability estimates further indicated that hybrids DPL- 54 x MNH- 93, Reshmi x DPL- 54 and Reshmi x MNH- 93 for seed cotton yield, Reshmi x NIAB- 78 for earliness (node of first fruiting branch, days taken to first flower, days taken to open first boll and percent first pick) and Reshmi x S- 14 for <b>ginning</b> <b>out</b> <b>turn</b> may be preferred for these traits. The cross Reshmi x MNH- 93 is valuable cross for i seed cotton yield and fiber quality which can yield segregates for fiber quality to meet r international standard. The proportion of variance due to GCA was higher than SCA for all the traits which suggested that these traits were controlled by additive genes. Genotypes having good general combining ability (GCA) estimates for earliness related traits exhibited negative GCA estimates for the most fiber quality traits. The genotypes having good GCA estimates for fiber quality exhibited negative GCA for most basic seed cotton yield components. Among these genotypes, three way crosses, modified back cross, or recurrent selection procedure would be required to be exercised for increased seed cotton yield with improved fiber quality and earliness. The F 2 and back crosses were grown in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications to estimate the heritability in broad and narrow sense, interrelationships among the above mentioned traits and their direct and indirect effects on seed cotton yield. Heritability in broad and narrow sense for all the traits under study was moderate to high with reasonable genetic variation. This suggested that major part of the total phenotypic variance was additive. Narrow and broad sense heritability values indicted that pedigree method would be employed to achieve genetic progress for these traits. It is concluded that mass selection should be effective for improving boll weight and reducing days required to open first boll among varieties in this material and some what less effective for improving other traits. Alternatives, such as pedigrees, sib tests, and progeny test must be considered to achieve genetic progress for node of first fruiting branch, days taken to first flower, GOT% and staple length in this material. The reciprocal recurrent selection will provide improvement in sympodial branches per plant, number of bolls per plant, seed cotton yield, percent first pick, fiber fineness and fiber strength. Path coefficient analysis showed that number of boll per plant, boll weight and number of sympodial branches were the morphological traits that contributed directly towards seed cotton yield. The genotypic correlation among all the traits showed that node of first fruiting -branch, days taken to first flower, days taken to open first boll and number of monopodial branches were significantly correlated with percent first pick. Therefore, these traits could be considered as reliable and practical indicators for earliness in breeding programmes due to their significant correlation and high heritability estimates. To study inheritance of CLCuV, nine selected varieties / lines (four resistant five susceptible) of up land cotton (G. hirsutum L.) were used for five F 1 combinations. The F 1 was sown for raising F 2 and back crossing purpose. Subsequently P 1, P 2 F 1, F 2, BC, BC 2 population were established and to ensure the inoculation of CLCuV no pesticide was used to control insect population. The results analysed through chi square test indicated that duplicate dominant epistasis was involved in control of resistance of CLCuV.
