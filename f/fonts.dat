5|$|An {{open-source}} {{adaptation of}} Garamond intended for display sizes, designed by Christian Thalmann and co-released with Google <b>Fonts.</b> It features a delicate style suitable for printing at larger sizes, and considerable contrast in stroke weight in its larger sizes. Thalmann added several unusual alternate designs {{such as an}} upright italic and unicase styles, as well as exaggerated, highly slanting accents.|$|E

50|$|The {{relation}} between pitch <b>font</b> size and typographic <b>font</b> size is usually inverse: a 12 pitch typewriter <b>font</b> is equal in height to 10 point typographic <b>font,</b> while a 10 pitch typewriter <b>font</b> is equal in height to 12 point typographic <b>font.</b> Though this relation is not obligatory: a smaller in the x-height 12 pitch <b>font</b> {{can have the}} body height equal to a 10 pitch <b>font,</b> thus creating a text with increased line spacing.|$|R
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi <b>fonts,</b> commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner. Earlier <b>fonts</b> that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E
5|$|Garamond is {{the name}} of a {{character}} in the Wii game Super Paper Mario. He appears in the world of Flopside (the mirror-image of Flipside, where the game begins). He is a prolific and highly successful author, unlike his Flipside counterpart, Helvetica (a probable recognition of the relative suitability of the two <b>fonts</b> for use in book typesetting).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the rule based approach towards {{the development of}} an Oriya <b>Font</b> Converter that effectively converts the SAMBAD and AKRUTI proprietary <b>font</b> to standardize Unicode <b>font.</b> This can be very much helpful towards electronic storage of information in the native language itself, proper search and retrieval. Our approach mainly involves the Apertium machine translation tool that uses Finite State Transducers for conversion of symbolic data to standardized Unicode Oriya <b>font.</b> To do so it requires a map table mapping the commonly used Oriya syllables in Proprietary <b>font</b> to its corresponding <b>font</b> code and the dictionary specifying the rules for mapping the proprietary <b>font</b> code to Unicode <b>font.</b> Further some unhandled symbols that appear in the intermediate converted file are rectified by Flex scanner tool. The converted text thus obtained is in standard Unicode <b>font</b> and remains unchanged as Unicode <b>font</b> is supported by almost all the platforms.

It was developed to support pictographic East Asian character sets, as these comprise many more characters than the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic writing systems.|$|R

5|$|Mkhedruli {{became more}} and more {{dominant}} over the two other scripts, though Khutsuri (Nuskhuri with Asomtavruli) was used until the 19th century.

5|$|Since its creation, Bembo {{has enjoyed}} {{continuing}} popularity as an attractive, legible book typeface. Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books, the Everyman's Library series, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, the National Gallery, Yale University Press and Edward Tufte.

The {{results revealed that}} only the <b>font</b> style and {{the interaction between the}} <b>font</b> style and <b>font</b> type is statistically significant in the “Pleasure” dimension. Also, “Arousal” and “Dominance” are not affected by the <b>font</b> type/style or their interaction (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, p[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
5000|$|As {{a design}} tool for {{creating}} families of fonts; a <b>font</b> designer {{can create a}} multiple master <b>font</b> from a base <b>font</b> design and then offer customers a wide number of <b>font</b> variations by building them from the multiple axes of an MM <b>font.</b> E.g. by creating a light version and a heavy version of their <b>font</b> design someone could create a multiple master <b>font</b> with a weight axis and then offer clients any custom weight they wanted. Adobe and others continue to use multiple master technology in <b>font</b> design.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{many older}} browsers did not {{implement}} inheritance of <b>font</b> styles within tables; as a result, <b>font</b> styles {{had to be}} specified once for the document as a whole, and again for the table, even though the CSS specification requires that <b>font</b> styling be inherited into the table. If the <b>font</b> sizes are specified using relative units, a standards-compliant browser would inherit the base <b>font</b> size, then apply the relative <b>font</b> size within the table: for example, a page which declared a base <b>font</b> size of 80% and a table <b>font</b> size of 80% (to ensure a size of 80% in browsers which do not properly inherit <b>font</b> sizes) would, in a standards-compliant browser, display tables with a <b>font</b> size of 64% (80% of 80%). As a result, browsers typically do not inherit <b>font</b> sizes into tables in quirks mode.|$|R

5|$|The {{period from}} 1520 to around 1560, {{encompassing}} Garamond's career, {{was an extremely}} busy period for typeface creation. Many <b>fonts</b> were cut, some such as Robert Estienne’s for a single printer’s exclusive use, others sold or traded between them. Confusion about which engravers created which typefaces is natural since many were active over this time, creating typefaces {{not just in the}} Latin alphabet in roman and italic, but also in Greek and Hebrew for scholarly use. These included Garamond himself, Granjon, Guillaume Le Bé, particularly respected for his Hebrew <b>fonts,</b> Pierre Hautin, Antoine Augereau (who may have been Garamond's mentor), Estienne's stepfather Simon de Colines and others. This period saw the creation of a pool of high-quality punches and matrices that would supply the French and European printing industry, to a large extent, for the next two centuries.|$|E
