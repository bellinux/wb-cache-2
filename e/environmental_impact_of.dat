5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{the market for}} natural dyes in the fashion {{industry}} is experiencing a resurgence. Western consumers have become {{more concerned about the}} health and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> synthetic dyes in manufacturing and there is a growing demand for products that use natural dyes. The European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> {{wind power}} when {{compared}} to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the IPCC, in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 (geq/kWh) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed. Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{is increasing}} {{due to the}} increasing demand for air travel in the country. In the past 25 years the UK air transport industry has seen sustained growth, {{and the demand for}} passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase more than twofold, to 465 million passengers, by 2030. Two airports; London Heathrow Airport and London Gatwick Airport, are amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world for international passenger traffic. Whilst {{more than half of all}} passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports, regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade.|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, JAL debuted a Boeing777–300 (JA8941) with {{a special}} Oneworld livery to promote the airlines's entry to the global airline alliance. Previously this {{aircraft}} carried the Shingo Katori and the Saiyuki television livery. In 2008, JAL repainted a single Boeing 777–200 to have a green rather than red arc on its tail, along with a green origami airplane on the fuselage, and named it the Eco Jet, to highlight the company's efforts to reduce the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> commercial aviation. In 2009, JAL repainted JA8941 again, {{as well as a}} JTA 737-400 (JA8933) to promote Kobukuro and their new album Calling as well as a live concert tour in Okinawa and around Japan. This livery was released officially on 30 July 2009. It has since then been replaced {{with a special}} Doraemon livery.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{rejected}} the location {{because of the}} environmental impact. These institutions instead proposed that the track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking {{at the possibility of}} constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> a Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution. However, Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990.|$|E

5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E
