50|$|Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is {{the most}} widely grown type of millet. It has been grown in Africa and the Indian subcontinent since prehistoric times. The center of diversity, and {{suggested}} area of domestication, for the crop is in the Sahel zone of West Africa. Recent archaeobotanical research has confirmed the presence of domesticated pearl millet on the Sahel zone of northern Mali between 2500 and 2000 BC. Cultivation subsequently spread and moved overseas to India. The earliest archaeological records in India date to around 2000 BC, and it spread rapidly through India reaching South India by 1500 BC, based on evidence {{from the site of}} Hallur. Cultivation also spread throughout eastern and southern parts of Africa. Pearl millet is widely grown in the northeastern part of Nigeria (especially in Borno and Yobe states). It is a major source of food to the local villagers of that region. The crop grows easily in that region due to its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions like drought and <b>flood.</b> <b>Records</b> exist for cultivation of pearl millet in the United States in the 1850s, and the crop was introduced into Brazil in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Direct {{statistical}} analysis {{to estimate the}} 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11. [...] For comparison, the total area of the nation is about 3,800,000 sq mi, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of 1,000 sq mi and 300,000 reaches that drain 10 sq mi. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as 1 sq mi. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from indirect {{statistical analysis}} of <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other hydrologic models. Similarly for coastal floods, tide gauge data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 have added information to the global data center since January 2010.|$|E
50|$|The first {{assumption}} is often {{but not always}} valid and should be tested {{on a case by}} case basis. The second {{assumption is}} often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of climate change strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult. The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.|$|E

40|$|Long-term climate {{variability}} {{has been}} shown to affect flood frequency in New South Wales, Australia (Kiem et al., 2003). This study extends this work by developing a Bayesian hierarchical model for predicting floods at ungauged locations. <b>Flood</b> <b>records</b> were stratified using a threshold value of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which characterises the low frequency component of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southern Pacific Ocean. It is shown that the stratified flood distributions differ significantly with ratios of flood magnitudes being approximately 1. 6 times greater during the IPO negative years. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the log-normal distribution fits the stratified <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> satisfactorily. The stratified <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> were then subjected to regional flood analysis using a Bayesian hierarchical approach. The regional model considers at-site floods to be spatially correlated via an intersite distance correlation function. The hierarchical model proposes that the parameters of the flood frequency distribution for any site are random samples from a regional probability model. This allows the inclusion of catchment characteristics, while also explicitly allowing for intersite variability. Model calibration was performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. An important outcome is the quantification of predictive uncertainty at an ungauged catchment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} record-breaking {{processes}} offers {{a framework for}} understanding extreme events which is nearly independent {{of the theory of}} extremes. The mathematical theory of record-breaking processes is applied to the problem of identifying nonstationarity in hydrological records. A record flood event is simply an event which exceeds all previous events. The probability distribution and first four moments of the number of record events in an n-year period, R, are derived for a serially independent process. The variance of estimates of the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation R is also derived. In addition, approximate confidence intervals are derived for the mean number of record-breaking events in a region with spatially correlated flood series. Using these results, in combination with 1571 <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> in the United States, we document that the average number of record breaking flood events over n-year periods ranging from [10, 80] behaved as if the annual flood series were serially independent for all regions of the United States. However, when spatial correlation of the <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> is ignored, {{as is the case in}} many previous studies, it appears as if <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> are not serially independent in the western and Midwestern regions of the United States. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for the spatial correlation structure of hydrologic records when performing regional hypothesis tests. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} evaluation of <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> requires long data series to extrapolate reliable peak discharges and related recurrence intervals.

As the distribution functions are usually fitted to the discharge values historic stage-discharge-relations must be found to convert these values. Regarding the Elbe river at the Dresden gauge {{the history of a}} water course and its morphology is investigated. Using the former flow cross sections water profile calculations are carried out yielding different stage-discharge-curves for each historic period. Checking the flood stages since 1501 A. D. and the related peak discharges, resulted in reduced discharge values. The new peak discharge values allow an update of the <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> as well as recurrence periods and lead to the result that e. g. the 2002 flood seems to have a recurrence period three times longer than it was assumed up to now...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Design flood {{estimation}} is {{an important}} task that is required in the planning and design of many civil engineering projects. In this study, the <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> of more than 23 gauged river basins in Sarawak, Malaysia, are examined using an index-flood estimation procedure based on L-moments. Two homogeneous regions were identified and the Generalized Extreme Value and the Generalized Logistic distributions are found to describe the distribution of extreme flood events appropriately within the respective regions. A regional growth curve is subsequently developed {{for each of the}} regions. These curves can be used for the estimation of design floods in ungauged basins in Sarawak within the limitations identified for the method.

40|$|The Tagus river drains {{the central}} Spanish Plateau (Meseta) and flows east-west into the Atlantic Ocean at Lisbon. It {{is the longest}} river of the Iberian Peninsula (1, 200 km) and its flood regime is mainly related to {{persistent}} rainfalls associated to successive passage of cold fronts during winter months. Historical <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> at four major locations (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alcantara) were derived both from historical documents (Proceedings of the City Council, diaries, chronicles, memoirs, etc.), and indirect sources used at locations where the original documents are non accessible or destroyed. These water levels associated with the different floods (derived from descriptions or epigraphic marks) were converted into discharge values using step-backwater calculations, namely the HEC-RAS software. Flood record stationarity from these censored <b>flood</b> <b>records</b> were checked using Lang¿s test. Some records (e. g. Aranjuez and Toledo) showed problems of stationarity over specific periods. Over the stationary periods, flood frequency analysis using the Maximum Likelihood method was carried out combining historical flood discharges and gauged floods. Because documentary floods are large by definition, their introduction into a flood frequency analysis improved the estimates of the probabilities of rare floods (return periods of 100 years and higher). This was particularly true when 3 -parameter distributions were considered. Flood frequency results were compared with other methods (e. g. probably maximum flood; PMF) used for design of high risk structures.
