40|$|Calibrations {{of shock}} {{acceleration}} are industrially required from {{a view of}} human safety and product development. In NMIJ vibration group, a shock acceleration calibration machine (hereafter ‘calibration machine’) has been developed in response to much demand from Japanese industries, and can calibrate shock transducers in acceleration range from 200 m/s 2 to 5000 m/s 2. For primary calibration, accelerometer is calibrated {{by a combination of}} shock exciter and laser interferometer. In the shock exciter, shock acceleration is generated by rigid body collision between a hammer and an anvil. To avoid any disturbance motion, radial air bearing system is adapted to keep high stiffness in perpendicular directions to the collision. The <b>hammer,</b> <b>supported</b> by the air bearing, is accelerated by an air gun and collides with the anvil through a rubber pad. Thus, acceleration waveform of the anvil strongly depends on viscoelasticity of the rubber pad. Different hardness of the rubber pad is examined to realize various peak accelerations. As another significant issue, optimization of low-pass digital filter is necessary to obtain reliable acceleration waveforms. This manuscript reports not only a procedure of low-pass digital filtering but also cut-off frequency dependence of low-pass digital filter on peak acceleration...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{centrifuge}} modeling {{offers another}} way for geotechnical engineers {{to investigate the}} loaded driven pile behaviors. It {{is well known that}} centrifuge tests take the place of in site tests to perform parametric studies useful to get a database for recommendations and to improve design codes. To accurately simulate loaded driven pile behavior, some conditions must be satisfied. A fundamental one is the checking of similitude laws linked to the pile behavior; the second concern an experimental aspect i. e. the installation of driven pile. To study and to fill these conditions, centrifuge pile hammers must be developed. A first difficulty is to conceive a miniature <b>hammer</b> <b>supporting</b> macro gravity effects and to achieve a model pile driving in flight. The paper describes the similitude laws linked to the driving of a pile and some of them have been already checked and validated during a pile driving centrifuge tests using a miniature pile driver. A recap of centrifuge pile drivers is proposed before to describe in details the last two pile drivers used the LCPC centrifuge. One has been developed to check similitude laws inherent to a pile driving; a second miniature pile driver directly adapted {{on the top of the}} pile has been also tested. For both pile drivers, limits and performances of them are given and taking into account them, a concept of a new one pile driver is given able to drive and to load the model pile...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Hammers</b> flew 28 <b>support,</b> 13 {{reconnaissance}} and 6 combat air patrols during Operation Litani, Israel's March 1978 {{invasion of}} Lebanon. In 1976 the squadron had received two additional RF-4Es, {{and was soon}} flying high-altitude reconnaissance. This led to its participation in the preparations for the 1981 Operation Opera to destroy Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor, which the Hammers were initially planned to conduct. The squadron trained for the raid using the Tadmit, but these plans were dropped when the F-16 entered IAF service in 1980. On November 12, 1980, the squadron carried out the IAF's longest fighter mission hitherto, when two reconnaissance birds photographed the reactor near Baghdad. The mission witnessed three aerial refuelings, including one over enemy territory. Tensions over Lebanon flared once more in 1981, and on May 29, 1981, the squadron carried out Operation Mole 9, striking Libyan SA-9 batteries protecting PLO bases near Beirut.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince 2000, the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) {{has been}} {{constructing}} an Underground Research Laboratory (URL) at Bure (east of the Paris Basin) to perform experiments {{in order to}} obtain in situ data necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of geological repository in the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. An important experimental program is planned to characterize the response of the rock to different drift construction methods. Before 2008, at the main level of the laboratory, most of the drifts were excavated using pneumatic <b>hammer</b> and <b>supported</b> with rock bolts, sliding steel arches and fiber shotcrete. Other techniques, such as road header techniques, stiff and flexible supports, have also been used to characterize their impacts. The drift network is developed following the in situ major stresses. The parallel drifts are separated enough so as they can be considered independently when their hydromechanical (HM) behaviors are compared. Mine-by experiments have been performed to measure the HM response of the rock and the mechanical loading applied to the support system due to the digging and after excavation. Drifts exhibit extensional (mode I) and shear fractures (modes II and III) induced by excavation works. The extent of the induced fracture networks depends on the drift orientation versus the in situ stress field. This paper describes the drift convergence and deformation in the surrounding rock walls as function of time and the impact of different support methods on the rock mass behavior. An observation based method is finally applied to distinguish the instantaneous and time-dependent parts of the rock mass deformation around the drifts...|$|R
