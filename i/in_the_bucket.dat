5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E
25|$|Freeman {{made his}} acting debut at age nine, playing {{the lead role}} in a school play. He then {{attended}} Broad Street High School, a building which serves today as Threadgill Elementary School, in Greenwood, Mississippi. At age 12, he won a statewide drama competition, and while still at Broad Street High School, he performed in a radio show based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1955, he graduated from Broad Street, but turned down a partial drama scholarship from Jackson State University, opting instead to enlist in the United States Air Force and served as an Automatic Tracking Radar Repairman, rising {{to the rank of}} Airman 1st Class.

25|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} in 1982 when work began on building a road across the pond in a new housing development, Windover Farms. A backhoe operator noticed several skulls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> of his machine. The sheriff and medical examiner determined that the burials were not recent. The local forensic expert originally believed he was examining modern Caucasian remains. The developers, Jack Eckerd and Jim Swann, halted construction at the pond and called in archaeologists. Radiocarbon dating on two bones excavated from the pond by the backhoe, {{paid for by the}} developers, yielded dates of 7,210 years and 7,320 years Before Present, establishing the importance of the find. The developers changed their development plans in order to leave the pond intact and donated $60,000 worth of pumping equipment to drain the pond for excavation.|$|E
25|$|Before the 18th century, {{science courses}} were taught almost {{exclusively}} through formal lectures. The structure of courses {{began to change}} in {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, when physical demonstrations were added to lectures. Pierre Polinière and Jacques Rohault were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging a bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that centrifugal force would hold the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> to more impressive experiments involving the use of an air-pump. One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode. Polinière’s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to Louis XV in 1722.|$|E
25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E

A stern decker {{was responsible}} for the stacker, ensuring it did not interfere with the power lines, that it remained clear of the tailings, and that any debris that jammed the conveyor belt was cleared.

500|$|However, {{the flower}} is {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way as to make the surface almost impossible to cling to, with smooth, downward-pointing hairs; the bees commonly slip and fall into the fluid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> and the only navigable route out is a narrow, constricting passage that either glues a [...] "pollinium" [...] (a pollen sack) on their body (if the flower has not yet been visited) or removes any pollinium that is there (if the flower has already been visited). The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, and holds it there for a few minutes, allowing the glue to dry and securing the pollinium. It has been suggested that this process involves [...] "inebriation" [...] of the bees, but this effect has never been confirmed.|$|E
500|$|A more {{sophisticated}} technique {{with a similar}} flavor and with better theoretical performance was developed by [...] They observed that each pass of radix sort {{can be interpreted as}} a range reduction technique that, in linear time, reduces the maximum key size by a factor of; instead, their technique reduces the key size to the square root of its previous value (halving the number of bits needed to represent a key), again in linear time. As in radix sort, they interpret the keys as two-digit base- numbers for a base [...] that is approximately [...] They then group the items to be sorted into buckets according to their high digits, in linear time, using either a large but uninitialized direct addressed memory or a hash table. Each bucket has a representative, the item <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> with the largest key; they then sort the list of items using as keys the high digits for the representatives and the low digits for the non-representatives. By grouping the items from this list into buckets again, each bucket may be placed into sorted order, and by extracting the representatives from the sorted list the buckets may be concatenated together into sorted order. Thus, in linear time, the sorting problem is reduced to another recursive sorting problem in which the keys are much smaller, the square root of their previous magnitude. Repeating this range reduction until the keys are small enough to bucket sort leads to an algorithm with running time [...]|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a generalized {{version of the}} variable elimination algorithm for Bayesian networks. Variable elimination computes the marginal probability for some specified set of variables <b>in</b> a network. <b>The</b> algorithm consists of a single pass through a list of data structures called <b>buckets.</b> <b>The</b> generalization presented here adds a second pass to the algorithm and produces the marginal probability density for every variable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>buckets.</b> <b>The</b> algorithm and the presentation focus on algebraic operations, striving for simplicity and easy of understanding. The algorithm has been implemented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> JavaBayes system, a freely distributed system for the construction and manipulation of Bayesian networks. ...|$|R

The evaporation from <b>the</b> <b>buckets,</b> mainly due to air circulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental room that was needed to create a constant temperature, was replaced with deionised water, and no accumulation of substances occurred from the replaced water. <b>The</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concentrations of <b>the</b> analysed substances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reference treatments (Table  2) were small when compared to the wood/bark treatments, showing that <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood/bark treatments were relevant for the different treatments.|$|R
