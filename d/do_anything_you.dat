In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zito would earn his first win {{as a member of the}} Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. [...] "I've been trying to have a good game", Zito said. [...] "You can't try to <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>You</b> either do or you don't. I tried to get too fine with my pitches. I wasn't aggressive." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week later}} on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped {{off by the}} paper, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time but Jagger, Richards and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were {{subsequently}} charged with drug offences. Richards said in 2003, [...] "When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize {{that this was a}} whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space where you could <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> wanted." [...] On the treatment of the man responsible for the raid he later added: [...] "As I heard it, he never walked the same again." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Jennings {{recalled}} the restrictions of the Nashville establishment: [...] "They wouldn't let you <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>You</b> had to dress a certain way: {{you had to}} do everything a certain way.... They kept trying to destroy me.... I just went about my business and did things my way.... You start messing with my music, I get mean." [...] By 1972, after the release of Ladies Love Outlaws, his recording contract was nearing an end. Sick with hepatitis, Jennings was hospitalized. Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Rashen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing with Reshen, he rejected the offer and hired Reshen.|$|E
2500|$|Lautner {{left the}} Fellowship in early 1938 (primarily because MaryBud was pregnant) to {{establish}} his own architecture practice in Los Angeles, but he told his mentor that, while seeking an independent career, he remained [...] "ready to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> or your Fellowship need". They worked together on around eleven Los Angeles projects {{over the next five}} years and their association continued sporadically. The Lautners arrived in Los Angeles in March 1938 and their first child Karol was born in May. Lautner's first independent project was a low-cost $2500 one-bedroom frame house for the Springer family, built with his contractor friend Paul Speer, but this was to be the only product of their brief collaboration. In September 1938, Wright contacted him and this led to Lautner's supervision of a series of Los Angeles domestic projects, the Sturges, Green, Lowe, Bell and Mauer houses.|$|E

[...] However, {{the moment}} that [...] "represented {{the point of no}} return" [...] came that Wednesday night, as a [...] "clearly liberated" [...] O'Brien made this joke in his monologue: [...] "I'm trying very hard to stay {{positive}} here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E
