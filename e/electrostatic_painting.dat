50|$|Friction is {{the least}} methods which you provide of the six methods of {{producing}} energy. If a cloth rubs against an object, the object will display an effect called friction electricity. The object becomes charged due to the rubbing process, and now possesses an electrical charge. There are two main types of electrical charge: positive and negative. Each type of charge attracts the opposite type and repels the same type. This can be stated in the following way: Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Static electricity has several applications. Its main application is in Van de Graaf generators, used to produce high voltages {{in order to test}} the dialectric strength of insulating materials. Other uses are in <b>electrostatic</b> <b>painting</b> and sandpaper manufacturing. The course grains acquire a negative charge as they move across the negative plate. As unlike charges attract, the positive plate attracts the course grains and their impact velocity enables them to be embedded into the adhesive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>painting</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} in the U.S. by Harold Ransburg {{in the late}} 1940s. Harold Ransburg founded Ransburg Electrostatic Equipment and discovered that electrostatic spray painting was an immediate success as manufacturers quickly perceived the substantial materials savings that could be achieved. In electrostatic spray painting or powder coating, the atomized particles are made to be electrically charged, thereby repelling each other and spreading themselves evenly as they exit the spray nozzle. The object being painted is charged oppositely or grounded. The paint is then attracted to the object giving a more even coat than wet spray painting, and also greatly increasing the percentage of paint that sticks to the object. This method also means that paint covers hard to reach areas. The whole may then be baked to properly attach the paint: the powder turns into a type of plastic. Car body panels and bike frames are two examples where electrostatic spray painting is often used.|$|E
40|$|Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) {{have gained}} {{significant}} interest {{because they have}} outstanding performance that allows cost reduction, weight reduction, and product improvement. This research study focuses on the manufacture and characterization of PNCs in order to explore their potential in automotive applications. More specifically, polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites reinforced with xGnP and nanokaolin were fabricated by manufacturing methods that optimize their performances. Exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP) are promising nanofillers that are cost effective and multifunctional with superior mechanical, thermo-mechanical and electrical properties. Nanokaolin is a newly introduced natural mineral mind in Georgia {{that has not been}} studied as of now. PNCs reinforced with these two nanofillers were characterized in terms of mechanical, thermo-mechanical, and various other properties, and then compared to talc- reinforced PP composites, which are {{the current state of the}} art for rear bumpers used by Honda Motor. Characterization results indicated that xGnP had better performance than talc and nanokaolin. Furthermore, the addition of xGnP introduces electrical conductivity in the PNCs, leading to more potential uses for PNCs in automotive applications such as the ability to be <b>electrostatic</b> <b>painted.</b> In order to fabricate PNCs with a desired conductivity value, there is need for a design tool that can predict electrical conductivity. Existing electrical conductivity models were examined in terms of model characteristics and parameters, and model predictions were compared to the experimental data. The percolation threshold is the most important parameter in these models, but it is difficult to determine experimentally, that is why a correlation between thermo-mechanical properties and electrical conductivity is also investigated in this study.

5000|$|The {{workpiece}} travels down {{a conveyor}} belt towards a paint booth, or paint tank, where it is sprayed with, or dipped into, electrostatically charged paint particles. Integrated into a powder paint booth is a powder recovery unit, which recovers between 95% and 100% of the paint over-spray coatings. After the workpiece is coated, it continues on the conveyor belt to an oven, where the paint is cured. The benefits {{to the process of}} electrostatic coating is the ability to recover the little over-spray and having the process automated which will cut costs. The reason for the little over spray is the paint particles that do not hit the piece will turn in the air {{and go back to the}} piece. There are also some drawbacks to the process: everything in the area of the coating must be grounded to prevent static buildup and can easily arc, damaging the hanging devices and/or the locations where the hanging devices rest on the conveyor. All hangers, conveyors, etc. must be cleaned often to ensure a good ground and prevent anyone in the area from getting a severe shock. In an airborne system, any recesses on the piece that is being coated can be missed because the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>paint</b> is more attracted to corners and sharp edges; this means that another process for coating can be a better option if the piece has recesses. In the dipping process, air entrapment can occur in blind holes and deep recesses, so the positioning of the part as it enters the paint tank is critical in removing any trapped air that will restrict paint coverage.|$|R
40|$|A new {{framework}} for simulation of <b>electrostatic</b> spray <b>painting</b> is proposed based on novel algorithms for coupled simulations of air flow, electromagnetic fields and paint droplets.

To validate the simulation framework an extensive measurement campaign has been performed. Several test plates and car fenders were painted with different process conditions and robot paths.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{conductive}} semistructural composites were produced by injection moulding, combining the mechanical properties of long (glass) fibre thermoplastics (LFTs) with the conductive properties of carbon nanofibres (CNFs). The moulded LFT/CNF parts exhibit percolation behaviour between 2 and 3 wt-%CNF loading, characterised by {{a sharp drop}} in electrical resistivity from 1012 to 102 V cm, accompanied by a step increase in the shear viscosity at low shear rates. At the same time, the main LFT properties are maintained: the modulus increased slightly, strength and viscosity, and thus processability, remained unaffected, while the impact resistance decreased. In addition, a significant improvement in surface quality was observed, largely eliminating the glass fibre printthrough, typically found in LFTs. The results thus show the successful use of small amounts of CNFs in making LFTs conductive, which becomes suitable for, e. g. <b>electrostatic</b> <b>painting</b> at limited additional cos...|$|E

40|$|Advancements in the {{simulation}} of <b>electrostatic</b> spray <b>painting</b> {{make it possible}} to evaluate the quality and efficiency of programs for industrial paint robots during Off-Line Programming (OLP). Simulation of the spray paint deposition process is very complex and requires physical simulation of the airflow, electric fields, breakup of paint into droplets, and tracking of these droplets until they evaporate or impact on a surface. The information from the simulated droplet impacts is then used to estimate the paint film thickness. The current common way of measuring paint thickness on complex geometrical shapes is to use histogram based methods. These methods are easy to implement but are dependent on good quality meshes. In this paper, we show that using kernel density estimation not only gives better estimates but it also is not dependent on mesh quality. We also extend the method using a multivariate bandwidth adapted using estimated gradients of the thickness. To show the advantages of the proposed method, all three methods are compared on a test case and with real thickness measurements from an industrial case study using a complex automotive part.

40|$|In {{the current}} study {{we focus on the}} {{transport}} of the charged particles in the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>painting</b> process, where both aerodynamic and electrical forces play an equal important role. One essential requirement for a successful simulation of such painting is using suitable solver to model complicated turbulent flow and implementation of all relevant electrical effects including static electric field and space charge. Although today some commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) codes, in which different turbulent models are implemented, are available on the flow simulation for industry application, little commercial codes are available on modelling both complicated flow field and inhomogeneous electrical field with space charge. Most of the CFD codes depend on finite volume method, whereas the numerical models for solving space charge field are usually developed using finite difference and finite element method. Therefore there is a modelling gap for the application where both flow field and electrical field are equally important.

40|$|Recent advancements in {{manufacturing}} of light-weight structures have caused high interest in industries toward magnesium alloys {{because of its}} excellent properties such as specific strength, low density, and fatigue strength. Application of magnesium in the vehicle structure saves energy and reduces gas emission which consequently improves {{the performance of the}} vehicle. Magnesium alloys have low corrosion resistance and high tendency to corrode in humid and aqueous environments. The results of recent research show that cold spray coating of pure aluminum powder results in significant improvement in magnesium corrosion. However when tested under cyclic loads, the coated samples developed surface cracks and delamination. Which lead to highly localized corrosion damages underneath of the cracks or any discontinuity in the components. The early cracking was attributed to the low fatigue resistance of pure aluminum. The results of two new approaches in enhancing the corrosion fatigue life of coated magnesium are presented in this thesis.

40|$|The {{process of}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>painting</b> {{has become a}} very {{important}} method of coating {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications including those used in the automobile industry. The general principle of spray coating is to deposit liquid droplets or solid powder particles on coated targets having various shapes. The electrostatic coating process consists of three main stages: droplet formation and charging, transportation and deposition. The complication of this process is caused by various factors, such as the physical properties of the material to be used, the appropriate electrical and mechanical conditions and the target surface to be coated, which affects significantly the deposition uniformity and the finish quality, especially when it contains some sharp edges and recessed areas. In this thesis, a numerical investigation of the charging level on a spherical droplet formed out of a cylindrical ligament in an external uniform electric field is presented. The droplet charge on a single ligament was predicted for different droplet sizes, ligament lengths, ligament diameters and electrode widths. The effect of these model parameters on the charge levels was found to be significant. A mathematical approximation for the charge magnitude as a function of the droplet radius to some exponent and ligament length is also formulated. The value of the radius exponent decreases dramatically with increasing the ligament length. Also, the estimated values of the droplet charge were compared for linear and circular arrays of ligaments, which show a great influence of the geometry of the sprayer on the charge levels. A very good agreement between the experimental and numerical results in the case of a circular array of ligaments, including a specified space charge, was obtained. All numerical simulations were performed using COMSOL, a Finite Element commercial software. A further study is carried out to investigate the deposition thickness profile on a stationary and moving flat target by incorporating a numerical simulation of the industrial electrostatic coating process via ANSYS, a CFD commercial software. A modified injection pattern was suggested to achieve a closer agreement with the experimental data. The injection pattern includes 15 bands of different particle sizes (i. e. polydispersed particles) and charge to mass ratios. A combination of different injection angles and fractions of mass flow rates was suggested in each size band. A very good agreement between the experimental and numerical deposition patterns was obtained in both cases of a stationary and moving target. Also, the deposition thickness profile was calculated on a target surface with a small perturbation at the center using ANSYS numerical model. Different model parameters of a perturbed surface, such as the size of the indentation or the protrusion and the radius of the corner were investigated in this study. The numerical results reveal a very low particle concentration inside the indentation, which is caused by the Faraday cage effect and it is strongly affected by the depth of the indentation, while the edge effect, which shows the high concentration of deposited particles at the corner, increases with decreasing the radius of curvature. The predicted deposition patterns were very consistent with the calculated values of the electric field for different surface perturbations...|$|E
