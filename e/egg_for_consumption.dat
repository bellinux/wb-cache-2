40|$|In {{the period}} from October to December 2011, 61 {{isolates}} of Salmonella were isolated from flocks of laying hens providing <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> human <b>consumption.</b> Most of the isolates belonged to the serovars Enteritidis (n= 35; 57. 38 %), Typhimurium (n= 17; 27. 87 %) and other (n= 9; 14. 75 %). These isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, gentamicin and streptomycin. All of the tested Salmonella were sensitive to cefotaxime, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin. The highest resistance rate was shown to tetracycline with eight (13, 11 %) and streptomycin with nine (14, 75 %) isolates, three (4, 92 %) isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, and one isolate (1, 63 %) exhibited resistance to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin.

25|$|Many {{species of}} ants have been {{observed}} attacking queens and killing them. Predatory ants include: Ectatomma edentatum, Ephebomyrmex spp., Lasius neoniger, Pheidole spp., Pogonomyrmex badius, and Conomyrma insana, which {{is among the most}} significant. C. insana ants are known to be effective predators against founding queens in studied areas of Northern Florida. The pressure of attacks initiated by C. insana increase over time, causing queens to exhibit different reactions, including escaping, concealment, or defence. Most queens that are attacked by these ants are ultimately killed. Queens that are in groups have higher chances of survival than solitary queens if they are attacked by S. geminata. Ants can attack queens on the ground and invade nests by stinging and dismembering them. Other ants such as P. porcula try to take the head and gaster, and C. clara invade in groups. Also, certain ants try to drag queens out of their nests by pulling on the antennae or legs. Small, monomorphic ants rely on recruitment to kill queens and do not attack them until reinforcements arrive. Aside from killing the queen, some ants may steal the <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> or emit a repellent that is effective against red imported fire ants. Certain ant species may raid colonies and destroy them.|$|R

40|$|Clinical and {{epidemiological}} {{characteristics of}} diarrhea associated with Vibrio mimicus {{were identified in}} 33 hospitalized patients referred to the Costa Rican National Diagnostic Laboratory Network between 1991 and 1994. The relevant symptoms presented by patients included abundant watery diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration that required intravenous Dhaka solution in 83 % of patients but not fever. Seroconversion against V. mimicus was demonstrated in four patients, from whom acute- and convalescent-phase sera were obtained. Those sera did not show cross-reaction when tested against Vibrio cholerae O 1 strain VC- 12. All the V. mimicus isolates from these cases produced cholera toxin (CT) and were susceptible to commonly used antibiotics. Attempts to isolate this bacterium from stool samples of 127 healthy persons were not successful. Consumption of raw turtle eggs was recalled by 11 of the 19 (58 %) individuals interviewed. All but two V. mimicus diarrheal cases were sporadic. These two {{had a history of}} a common source of turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption,</b> and V. mimicus was isolated from eggs from the same source (a local market). Among the strains, variations in the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were observed. None of the strains recovered from market turtle eggs nor the four isolates from river water showed CT production. Further efforts to demonstrate the presence of CT-producing V. mimicus strains in turtle eggs were made. Successful results were obtained when nest eggs were tested. In this case, it was possible to isolate CT- and non-CT-producing strains, even from the same <b>egg.</b> <b>For</b> CT detection we used PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Y- 1 cell assay, obtaining a 100 % correlation between ELISA and PCR results. Primers Col- 1 and Col- 2, originally described as specific for the V. cholerae O 1 ctxA gene, also amplified a 302 -bp segment with an identical restriction map from V. mimicus.

40|$|Unlike {{many species}} that are 'occasional' cannibals, the tadpoles of cane toads {{specifically}} target conspecific <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption,</b> ignoring the <b>eggs</b> of sympatric frog species (at least within the toads' current invasive range in Australia). We tested three hypotheses as to the benefits of consuming conspecific eggs: transfer of toxins from eggs (which have high toxin content) to tadpoles (which have lower toxin content), nutritional input, and reduction of future competition. We {{found no evidence of}} toxin transfer, but eggs contained sufficient nutrition for cannibalistic tadpoles to develop through to metamorphosis, and egg consumption enhanced rates of tadpole growth and differentiation through reduction of subsequent competition from younger tadpoles. Features of the cane toads' life history (e. g. synchronized deposition and development of all eggs within a clutch; delay between hatching and onset of feeding; short larval stage relative to interclutch interval of a given adult female) mean that the cannibals are unlikely to be close relatives of the younger conspecifics they consume (either as eggs or as metamorphs). Kin selection may thus favour rather than oppose cannibalism. The end result is that cannibalistic toad tadpoles benefit through nutrition and reduced future competition, with little collateral risk of eating their own siblings. Another potential cost of cannibalism (risk of disease transmission) may be minimal in this system, because the eggs are unlikely to contain pathogens (reflecting their brief embryonic periods and protective jelly layers). The combination of these forces has favoured the evolution of targeted cannibalism by cane toad tadpoles...|$|R
