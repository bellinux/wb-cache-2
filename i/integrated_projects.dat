2500|$|According to the National Energy Board, it {{requires}} about [...] {{of natural gas}} to produce one barrel of bitumen from in situ projects and about [...] for <b>integrated</b> <b>projects.</b> Since a barrel of oil equivalent is about [...] of gas, this represents a large gain in energy. That being the case, {{it is likely that}} Alberta regulators will reduce exports of natural gas to the United States in order to provide fuel to the oil sands plants. As gas reserves are exhausted, however, oil upgraders will probably turn to bitumen gasification to generate their own fuel. In {{much the same way as}} bitumen can be converted into synthetic crude oil, it can also be converted into synthetic natural gas.|$|E

It briefly reviews the background to the growing interest in an <b>integrated</b> <b>project</b> database (IPDB) for construction projects, and examines the fundamental concept of an <b>integrated</b> <b>project</b> database by discussing the various definitions that have evolved, as well as the various approaches to its development. A detailed survey and analysis of recent UK projects that have sought to develop <b>integrated</b> <b>project</b> databases is also presented. The analysis is based on several criteria such as the application area, development environment, modelling approaches used, reusability, hardware and software requirements, and the use of standards. The paper concludes with an identification of gaps in current research and strategic advice on the future development of <b>integrated</b> <b>project</b> databases...|$|R

This project combines three or four department offered compulsory courses each semester. <b>Integrated</b> <b>project</b> delivered to students is chemical/biochemical engineering problems with open solutions. This approach allows the application of generic skills of students such as leadership, work in teams, communicate orally and in writing and learn to find the current information {{through a process of}} lifelong learning. Student achievement in completing the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Project</b> has been measured and assessed through presentations and reports. This study was performed to measure the effectiveness of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Project</b> implemented after four years in JKKP. Therefore, a questionnaire was distributed to the first batch of students who have been through fully <b>integrated</b> <b>project</b> while studying at JKKP, in a graduate friendly event {{at the end of their}} study. Analysis results of the effectiveness of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Project</b> show that it has improved the confidence level in generic skills such as oral and written communication, teamwork, lifelong learning and the identification of current issues in students since it was firstly introduced in session 2006 / 2007.
