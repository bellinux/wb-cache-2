25|$|With music sales {{moving towards}} <b>file-based</b> {{playback}} and streaming {{and away from}} CDs, {{there is a possibility}} that the loudness war will be blunted by normalization technology such as ReplayGain and Apple's Sound Check. Most cloud-based music services perform loudness normalization by default and may reduce the market pressure to overcompress material.|$|E
25|$|Drupal 7 {{extends the}} data {{abstraction}} layer {{so that a}} programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses PHP Data Objects to abstract the database. Microsoft has written a database driver for their SQL Server. Drupal 7 supports the <b>file-based</b> SQLite database engine, {{which is part of}} the standard PHP distribution.|$|E
500|$|A batch <b>file-based</b> tool soon {{surfaced}} on XDA Developers {{to assist}} {{users in the}} process of performing the exploit, and a variety of ported desktop applications began to emerge, such as the emulator Bochs, PuTTY and TightVNC. Afterwards, an emulator known as [...] "Win86emu" [...] surfaced, allowing users to run x86 software on a jailbroken Windows RT device. However, it does not support all Windows APIs, and runs programs slower than they would on a native system.|$|E
500|$|A more {{familiar}} {{version of the}} dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree. [...] Her Housekeeping in Old Virginia described [...] "Gumbo Filit A La Creole", a <b>filé-based</b> gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with allspice, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme. [...] The 1881 cookbook What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking, dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. [...] "Oyster Gumbo Soup" [...] used a filé base, while [...] "Ochra Gumbo" [...] and [...] "Chicken Gumbo" [...] used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook La Cuisine Creole documented eight varieties of gumbo. [...] None used sausage, but {{almost all of them}} contained ham.|$|E

2500|$|A new [...] "Files" [...] app lets users {{browse the}} files stored on their device, {{as well as}} those stored across various cloud services, {{including}} iCloud Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. The app supports organization through structured sub-folders and various <b>file-based</b> options. The [...] "Files" [...] app also includes a built-in player for FLAC audio files. The Files app is available on both iPad and iPhone.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, {{mastering}} engineer Ian Shepherd organised {{the first}} Dynamic Range Day, {{a day of}} online activity intended {{to raise awareness of}} the issue and promote the idea that [...] "Dynamic music sounds better". The day was a success and its follow-ups in the following years have built on this, gaining industry support from companies like SSL, Bowers & Wilkins, TC Electronic and Shure as well as engineers like Bob Ludwig, Guy Massey and Steve Lillywhite. Shepherd cites research showing there is no connection between sales and [...] "loudness", and that people prefer more dynamic music. He also argues that <b>file-based</b> loudness normalization will eventually render the war irrelevant.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{functionality}} of GlusterFS {{is implemented}} as translators, including <b>file-based</b> mirroring and replication, <b>file-based</b> striping, <b>file-based</b> load balancing, volume failover, scheduling and disk caching, storage quotas, and volume snapshots with user serviceability (since GlusterFS version 3.6).|$|E
50|$|Files that don't {{belong to}} {{installed}} programs {{can usually be}} backed up with <b>file-based</b> backup software, and this is preferred because <b>file-based</b> backup usually saves more time or space because they never copy unused space (as a bit-identical image does), they usually are capable of incremental backups, and generally have more flexibility. But for files of installed programs, <b>file-based</b> backup solutions may fail to reproduce all necessary characteristics, particularly with Windows systems. For example, in Windows certain registry keys use short filenames, which are sometimes not reproduced by <b>file-based</b> backup, some commercial software uses copy protection that will cause problems if a file is moved to a different disk sector, and <b>file-based</b> backups do not always reproduce metadata such as security attributes. Creating a bit-identical disk image {{is one way to}} ensure the system backup will be exactly as the original. Bit-identical images can be made in Linux with dd, available on nearly all live CDs.|$|E
50|$|BeeGFS, the {{parallel}} file system, has internal striping (comparable to <b>file-based</b> RAID0) and replication (comparable to <b>file-based</b> RAID10) options to aggregate throughput and capacity of multiple servers and is typically based {{on top of}} an underlying RAID to make disk failures transparent.|$|E
