500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Heartbreak & Triumph, Michaels states [...] "It was about seven o'clock when I {{walked into the}} locker room. There {{were only a few}} people in there and none were close to Earl. He was putting on his referee gear and I started to put my boots on. 'Earl, I need you to listen to me very carefully.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> very softly. 'We are doing a big swerve tonight. I am going to get Bret in the Sharpshooter and I need you to ring the bell.'" [...] However, Hebner states that Brisco was the person to tell him of the plan.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All of you--yes, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>speaking</b> {{of all of}} you; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of you, Gertrude--you in particular. Can {{you ever}} love me well enough to be my wife?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>speaking</b> to you, mother; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> {{of other}} people--the {{people who have}} invented this horrible lie--for it is a lie, mother, isn't it? It is not {{possible}} it can be true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She does not," [...] Lord Nunneley asserted. [...] "Olive is, {{above all}} things, staunch. She <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> believe, too, {{sincerely}} attached to you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> entirely for myself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking,</b> too, {{as the father}} of an only daughter, whose engagement to you was, after all, a little experimental. I should like to see my daughter released from that engagement, Deane." ...|$|R
2500|$|A new president, Mourad Boudjellal, a born-and-bred Toulonnais {{who made}} his fortune in the comic strip business, promised to build a huge team. He said: [...] "I invented the Top 15, with a team that could be {{competitive}} in the Top 14”. He signed {{a high number of}} first-class players, some of them well above 30, like Jean-Jacques Crenca, Yann Delaigue, Gonzalo Quesada and Dan Luger. He created a lot of buzz around the team as he managed to sign former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga, who arrived in Toulon right {{after the end of the}} Air New Zealand Cup on October 26, 2006. The contract was rumoured to be around €300,000 (£200,000), which Boudjellal claimed to pay from his own pocket, for only 8 to 10 matches. In a 2010 interview, Boudjellal would say about his decision to pursue Umaga, [...] "It was incredible, because we were in the second division and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> with the best player in the world. But he said yes and came to play with Toulon." ...|$|E
2500|$|January 1927 began {{similarly}} {{at the new}} Center, and in February, {{though there}} was then a gap until April. In May Ford was on radio station WGL (later bought by WADO) and she was cut off the air while speaking to a banquet audience of the All Nations Association, an international peace organization, in praise of Amelia Gade Corson because the manager declared it a pacifist talk, which, according to him, [...] "was not {{in line for the}} occasion". The news of the action was carried by Associated Press and the story printed variously in the United States. It was one of several incidents with that station. Ford later released a statement:The All Nations association for which <b>i</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> feels Denmark represents the ideal for which it is working, having created peace through disarmament, I said that as Mrs. Corson, a native of Denmark, had married an American, better feeling would be created between the two countries because of the fame of this woman." [...] Congressman Emanuel Celler added the incident to his list of censorship of liberal views published in June. In September Ford herself was in London and Rome. But by October she was noted in New York talking at a race amity meeting.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> rather of the {{transition}} period, which, of course, there must be?--Yes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't he? Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{glad to hear}} it, because I {{thought it}} might be HIS doing. This, you know, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of. This letter." ...|$|R
60|$|That was the {{beginning}} of all things. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of the Universe as viewed from the standpoint of Charles and Mivanway.|$|R
5000|$|... “But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> to you!” {{cried the}} young man, exasperated by this {{combination}} of insolence and good manners, of protocol and disdain.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} I {{have to say}} to you is a word in regard to Judge Douglas's {{declaration}} about the [...] "vulgarity and blackguardism" [...] in the audience, that no such thing, as he says, was shown by any Democrat while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking.</b> Now, I only wish, by way of reply on this subject, to say that while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking,</b> I used no [...] "vulgarity or blackguardism" [...] toward any Democrat.|$|E
60|$|Beam. Faith, madam, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> {{in favour}} of your nation: What {{pleasant}} lives I have known Spaniards to live in England.|$|E
60|$|REV. S. [interrupting him austerely] I was not {{thinking}} of money, sir. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> of higher things. Social position, for instance.|$|E
60|$|But since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of {{the fall}} of a tenth part of Antichrist; a word or two about the means {{of the fall}} thereof.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A really curious resemblance. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> {{only from}} memory; and perhaps it's {{not quite so}} vivid in this light; but still astonishingly clear.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{man ever}} did {{anything}} by moping; and you mope. <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> plainly, {{and you may}} be angry with me, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A psychic--undeveloped, of course. I {{have thought}} once or twice. Only {{a little while}} ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to that man Chaffery about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, MEN--yes. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> of MINISTERS, my dear," [...] said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly. [...] "And you shouldn't flirt so with Mr. Blake--you really shouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say again," [...] {{he burst}} forth, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> agin the {{minister}} and I'll practise on you what I'm awid {{to do to}} her." ...|$|E

60|$|THE CHAPLAIN. [More suavely] It's just at {{this period}} {{that we are}} able to make some {{impression}} on them, sir. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> from my special standpoint.|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly, certainly," [...] {{interrupted}} Delgado, who up to {{this time}} had pretended that he understood no English, the tongue in which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to the interpreter, Sammy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Onything," [...] replied Andrew, [...] "is naething; {{and this}} lad that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> o' kens a' the short cuts and queer by-paths through the hills, and"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not again! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> seriously now. Mr. Penrose {{looked at}} me with a strange kind of interest--I can't {{describe}} it. Have you taken him into our confidence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|While <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of the [...] "Tigris" [...] and our losses, I {{will just}} say that the second boat which left the burning steamer was never heard from.|$|R

60|$|Limping Lucy {{looked me}} {{hard in the}} face, and saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> the truth. Without a word more, she turned about again {{instantly}} towards Cobb's Hole.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am not crazy, and {{you know}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> the truth," [...] {{answered}} Tom, calmly. [...] "Now {{you tell me where}} your uncle is or I'll have you arrested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, we {{have lost}} the game, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> sans rancune. It is not for you, who have won, to bear malice," [...] says my lord, with a bow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Remember that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> {{to you as}} a friend, {{and that}} I trust to you not to mention the effort <b>I</b> <b>am</b> making to clear up the {{misunderstanding}} which causes her so much unhappiness." ...|$|R
