40|$|Ajtai and Dwork [2] have {{recently}} introduced a probabilistic public-key encryption scheme which is secure {{under the assumption}} that a certain computational problem on lattices is hard on the worst-case.

In this paper, we demonstrate how (improved) Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem can be abused. Using this kind of abuses, users can communicate secrets in a <b>key</b> <b>escrowed</b> AjtaiDwork cryptosystem without fearing that their secrets will be revealed later by reconstructing their escrowed private-keys. However, we will also show that users have to trust their implementers because unscrupulous implementers of Ajtai-Dwork cryptosystem can leak their private-keys without their awareness.

50|$|The Clipper chip was not {{embraced by}} {{consumers}} or manufacturers and the chip itself {{was no longer}} relevant by 1996. The U.S. government continued to press for <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> by offering incentives to manufacturers, allowing more relaxed export controls if <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> were part of cryptographic software that was exported. These attempts were largely made moot by {{the widespread use of}} strong cryptographic technologies, such as PGP, which were not {{under the control of the}} U.S. government.|$|E
50|$|<b>Key</b> <b>escrow</b> is proactive, {{anticipating the}} need for access to keys; a {{retroactive}} alternative is key disclosure law, where users are required to surrender keys upon demand by law enforcement, or else face legal penalties. Key disclosure law avoids some of the technical issues and risks of <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> systems, but also introduces new risks like loss of keys and legal issues such as involuntary self incrimination. The ambiguous term key recovery is applied to both types of systems.|$|E

25|$|Another {{instance}} of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended {{to be part of}} the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special <b>escrow</b> <b>key</b> held by the government for use by law enforcement, for example in wiretaps.|$|R
40|$|As {{distributed}} computing systems grow in size, complexity {{and variety of}} application, the problem of protecting sensitive data from unauthorized disclo-sure and tampering becomes increasingly important. Cryptographic techniques {{can play an important}} role in protecting communication links and file data, since access to data can be limited to those who hold the proper key. In the case of file data, however, the rou-tine use of encryption facilities often places the orga-nizational requirements of information security in opposition to those of information management. Since strong encryption implies that only the holders of the cryptographic key have access to the cleartext data, an organization may be denied the use of its own critical business records if the key used to encrypt these records becomes unavailable (e. g., through the accidental death of the key holder). This paper describes a system, based on cryp-tographic "smartcards, " for the temporary "escrow" of file encryption keys for critical files in a crypto-graphic file system. Unlike conventional escrow schemes, this system is bilaterally auditable, in that the holder of an <b>escrowed</b> <b>key</b> can verify that, in fact, he or she holds the key to a particular directory and the owner of the key can verify, when the escrow period is ended, that the escrow agent has neither used the key nor can use it in the future. We describe a new algorithm, based on the DES cipher, for the on-line encryption of file data in a secure and efficient manner that is suitable for use in a smartcard. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In 1994, Matt Blaze {{published}} the paper Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard. It {{pointed out that}} the Clipper's escrow system has a serious vulnerability: the chip transmitted a 128-bit [...] "Law Enforcement Access Field" [...] (LEAF) that contained the information necessary to recover the encryption key. To prevent the software that transmitted the message from tampering with the LEAF, a 16-bit hash was included. The Clipper chip would not decode messages with an invalid hash; however, the 16-bit hash was too short to provide meaningful security. A brute-force attack would quickly produce another LEAF value that would give the same hash but not yield the correct keys after the escrow attempt. This would allow the Clipper chip to be used as an encryption device, while disabling the <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> capability. In 1995 Yair Frankel and Moti Yung published another attack which is inherent to the design and which shows that the <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> device tracking and authenticating capability (namely, the LEAF) of one device, can be attached to messages coming from another device and will nevertheless be received, thus bypassing the escrow in real time. [...] In 1997, a group of leading cryptographers published a paper, [...] "The Risks of Key Recovery, <b>Key</b> <b>Escrow,</b> and Trusted Third-Party Encryption", analyzing the architectural vulnerabilities of implementing <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> systems in general, including but not limited to the Clipper Chip Skipjack protocol. The technical flaws described in this paper were instrumental in the demise of the Clipper chip as a public policy option.
