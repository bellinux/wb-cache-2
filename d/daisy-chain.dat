2500|$|In 1894, Clarke {{published}} The <b>Daisy-Chain</b> (Op. 352), an operetta {{for children}} in two acts, for which he wrote both words and music. He also wrote both the libretto and the score for Hornpipe Harry, in 1897, a well-reviewed show depicting the adventures of sailors cast ashore on a remote island. One of his last compositions was the one-act operetta The Outpost, first produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre in July 1900. [...] It was produced as a curtain raiser to The Pirates of Penzance and Patience until December 1900 and also ran on tour in 1901–02.|$|E

6000|$|Arm in arm we loitered {{along the}} {{pleasant}} walks. The lovely flowers, the bright sun, the fresh fragrant breeze, all {{helped her to}} recover her spirits. She began {{to be like the}} happy Jeanne of my past experience, as easily pleased as a child. When we sat down to rest, the lap of her dress was full of daisies. [...] "Do you remember," [...] she said, [...] "when you first taught me to make a <b>daisy-chain?</b> Are you too great a man to help me again now?" ...|$|E
60|$|No, {{what caused}} this {{disintegration}} in a usually fairly fluent prattler with the sex was her whole mental attitude. I don't want to wrong anybody, so I won't {{go so far}} as to say that she actually wrote poetry, but her conversation, to my mind, was of a nature calculated to excite the liveliest suspicions. Well, I mean to say, when a girl suddenly asks you out of a blue sky if you don't sometimes feel that the stars are God's <b>daisy-chain,</b> you begin to think a bit.|$|E
60|$|Alice was {{beginning}} to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought Alice, without pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a <b>daisy-chain</b> was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.|$|E

50|$|Except for star-based networks, {{the easiest}} way to add more {{computers}} into a network is by <b>daisy-chaining,</b> or connecting each computer in series to the next.

A <b>daisy-chained</b> network can take two basic forms: linear and ring.|$|R

6000|$|I had for fellow-student {{an unhappy}} [...] "village genius" [...] sent to Dublin by some {{charitable}} Connaught landlord. He painted religious pictures upon sheets {{nailed to the}} wall of his bedroom, a [...] "Last Judgment" [...] among the rest. Then there was a wild young man who would come to school of a morning with a <b>daisy-chain</b> hung round his neck; and George Russel, [...] "Æ," [...] the poet, and mystic. He did not paint the model as we tried to, for some other image rose always before his eyes (a St. John in the Desert I remember,) and already he spoke to us of his visions. His conversation, so lucid and vehement to-day, was all but incomprehensible, though now and again some phrase would be understood and repeated. One day he announced that he was leaving the Art schools because his will was weak and the arts or any other emotional pursuit could but weaken it further.|$|E
6000|$|Sanguine he was: a {{but less}} vivid hue [...] Than of that islet in the chestnut-bloom [...] Flamed his cheek; and eager eyes, that still [...] Took joyful note {{of all things}} joyful, beam'd, [...] Beneath a manelike mass of rolling gold, [...] Their best and brightest, when they dwelt on hers. [...] Edith, whose pensive beauty, perfect else, [...] But subject to the season or the mood, [...] Shone like a mystic star between the less [...] And greater glory varying to and fro, [...] We know not wherefore; bounteously made, [...] And yet so finely, that a troublous touch [...] Thinn'd, or would seem to thin her in a day, [...] A joyous to dilate, as toward the light. [...] And these had been {{together}} from the first. [...] Leolin's first nurse was, five years after, hers: [...] So much the boy foreran; but when his date [...] Doubled her own, for want of playmates, he [...] (Since Averill was a decad and a half [...] His elder, and their parents underground) [...] Had tost his ball and flown his kite, and roll'd [...] His hoop to pleasure Edith, with her dipt [...] Against the rush of {{the air in the}} prone swing, [...] Made blossom-ball or <b>daisy-chain,</b> arranged [...] Her garden, sow'd her name and kept it green [...] In living letters, told her fairy-tales, [...] Show'd here the fairy footings on the grass, [...] The little dells of cowslip, fairy palms, [...] The petty marestail forest, fairy pines, [...] Or from the tiny pitted target blew [...] What look'd a flight of fairy arrows aim'd [...] All at one mark, all hitting: make-believes [...] For Edith and himself: or else he forged, [...] But that was later, boyish histories [...] Of battle, bold adventure, dungeon, wreck, [...] Flights, terrors, sudden rescues, and true love [...] Crown'd after trial; sketches rude and faint, [...] But where a passion yet unborn perhaps [...] Lay hidden as the music of the moon [...] Sleeps in the plain eggs of the nightingale. [...] And thus together, save for college-times [...] Or Temple-eaten terms, a couple, fair [...] As ever painter painted, poet sang, [...] Or Heav'n in lavish bounty moulded, grew. [...] And more and more, the maiden woman-grown, [...] He wasted hours with Averill; there, when first [...] The tented winter-field was broken up [...] Into that phalanx of the summer spears [...] That soon should wear the garland; there again [...] When burr and bine were gather'd; lastly there [...] At Christmas; ever welcome at the Hall, [...] On whose dull sameness his full tide of youth [...] Broke with a phosphorescence cheering even [...] My lady; and the Baronet yet had laid [...] No bar between them: dull and self-involved, [...] Tall and erect, but bending from his height [...] With half-allowing smiles for all the world, [...] And mighty courteous in the main--his pride [...] Lay deeper than to wear it as his ring-- [...] He, like an Aylmer in his Aylmerism, [...] Would care no more for Leolin's walking with her [...] Than for his old Newfoundland's, when they ran [...] To loose him at the stables, for he rose [...] Twofooted at the limit of his chain, [...] Roaring to make a third: and how should Love, [...] Whom the cross-lightnings of four chance-met eyes [...] Flash into fiery life from nothing, follow [...] Such dear familiarities of dawn? [...] Seldom, but when he does, Master of all.|$|E
