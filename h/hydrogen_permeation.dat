However, the only available data related to these characteristics are those for the hydrogen permeability, which were obtained from measurements under a given pressure difference through the PEM. Although we can derive the solubility and self-diffusivity from the permeability, the derivation requires a mathematical procedure, such as providing a gas transport model and fitting experimental data with theoretical data from the model. In this study, we developed a measurement system that uses nuclear magnetic resonance and can quantify both the solubility and self-diffusivity in a rather straightforward manner. The system allows us to measure these two properties when hydrogen gas is dissolved in a dry Nafion membrane under a hydrogen gas pressure of up to 1 MPa at room temperature. The solubility increases linearly with increasing pressure, and the solubility coefficient is (1. 3 ± 0. 13) × 10 − 5 mol/(cm 3 MPa).

This membrane {{has the potential}} to be used for hydrogen purification and other applications [1]. A palladium-silver alloy layer (pd-Ag) was prepared by co-sputtering. The thin Pd-Ag alloy has high <b>hydrogen</b> selectivity, high <b>permeation</b> rate as well as high mechanical and chemical stability. Typical flow rates of 0. 5 mol H 2 /m 2. s have been measured with a minimal selectivity of 550 for H 2 /N 2. Anodic bonding of thick glass to silicon was used to package the membrane and create a very robust module. The membrane has high mechanical strength and can withstand pressures up to 4 bars at room temperature. The presented fabrication method allows the development of a module for industrial applications that consists of a stack with a large number of glass/membrane plates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>hydrogen</b> {{solubility}} and <b>permeation</b> in Pd 77 %Ag 23 % membranes {{have been}} determined {{as a function}} of temperature and membrane thickness. Unexpectedly, the solubility of hydrogen is found to systematically increase as the membrane thickness decreases from 11. 2 to 2. 2 µm. Topography studies by atomic force microscopy in conjunction with previously reported characterization suggest linkage of the hydrogen solubility to the density of grain boundaries. A higher average grain boundary density for thinner membranes results from the nucleation and growth proceeding during membrane fabrication by sputtering. For the membranes and conditions (no membrane pretreatment; 300 – 400 °C; ΔpH 2 ≤ 200 kPa) applied here, surface phenomena affect the hydrogen transport at thicknesses below ~ 5 µm. Determination of the solubility constants hence allowed the extraction of the bulk diffusivity parameters from the permeability measurements over the thicker membranes (6. 7 – 11. 2 µm), in good agreement with reported values obtained using other techniques...|$|R
40|$|The <b>permeation</b> {{behavior}} of <b>hydrogen</b> through pure aluminum {{has been investigated}} in the temperature range of 625 K to 778 K by a gas permeation technique. The <b>permeation</b> rate of <b>hydrogen</b> was strongly affected by {{the conditions of the}} surface where the hydrogen was introduced into the sample. They varied characteristically by repeating the permeation run, which was bounded in the temperature range of 690 K to 700 K. At a higher temperature than 700 K, the surface oxide layer was reduced by <b>hydrogen</b> during the <b>permeation</b> run, which resulted in the larger <b>permeation</b> rate of <b>hydrogen</b> in the subsequent permeation runs. At the sensitized surface by the reduction, the temporary poisoning took place and the <b>permeation</b> rate of <b>hydrogen</b> was decreased. The poisoned surface, however, was cleaned by keeping the sample under high vacuum at a higher temperature than 700 K. The poisoning was closely related to the presence of carbon and its compounds on the top surface where the hydrogen was introduced into the sample...|$|R
