5|$|In 1924, Philipp {{attended}} the 4. Volksschule (Pestalozzischule—4th elementary school) in Meissen. Philipp {{was a very}} good student. His mother understood that education was essential to Philipp's future. She worked very hard to raise the funds to pay for higher education in order to send Philipp to a Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1927, she managed to have Philipp admitted to the Franziskaneum in Meissen, the Realgymnasium—a secondary school built on the mid-level Realschule to achieve the Abitur (university entry qualification)—in Meissen. Alma, desperate to secure her son's schooling, wrote to the city council of Meissen in 1932 asking <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> fees could be waived.|$|E

25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E

To serve this growing ethnic population, St. Procopius parish [...] was founded in the summer of 1875, near the intersection of 18th and Allport Streets. The parish was named for Saint Procopius of Sázava, who founded a monastery in Bohemia in the eleventh century and became the first saint from Czechoslovakia. Vilém Čoka served as the first pastor. Planning to build a school, Čoka left it to the community to decide <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> would be secular or Catholic. They chose a Catholic school, despite the fact that only 25percent of Pilsen's Czech population was Catholic. As the parish outgrew his capacity to serve them, Čoka turned for help to the Order of St. Benedict.|$|E
