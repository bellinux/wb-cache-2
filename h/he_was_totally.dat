5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E

25|$|To {{complete}} the subjugation of Lusitania, Rome sent Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, with 15,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry to strengthen Gaius Laelius Sapiens {{who was a}} personal friend of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. The Romans lost most of these reinforcements in Ossuma. When Quintus Fabius risked combat again, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> defeated near what is today the city of Beja in Alentejo. This defeat gave the Lusitanians access to today's Spanish territory, modern Granada and Murcia. The results of Viriatus's effects {{as well as that}} of the Numantine War caused many problems in Rome, the most notable being a drop in Legion recruitment rates.|$|E

He was infatuated with the idea because he spent so much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time." [...] Nelson's impressions were similar: [...] "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," [...] she wrote, [...] "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments." ...|$|E

500|$|Hodgson's release {{has sparked}} {{debate about the}} use of the death penalty, {{particularly}} about its fallibility. Neil Durkin of Amnesty International commented in a piece for The Daily Telegraph: [...] "e had the deeply sad case of Sean Hodgson, the man from Hampshire who ended up being behind bars for 27years, not least because the prosecution service suppressed exculpatory DNA evidence that could have set him free a decade earlier. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> innocent, should never have been imprisoned {{in the first place and}} on release joins the ranks of those– eventually– rescued from their judicial fate". Durkin characterized the Hodgson case as [...] "a warning not to trust a justice system never to be wrong".|$|E
500|$|In March 1969, Harrison gave [...] "Something" [...] to Joe Cocker to record, having {{decided that}} it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax. Referring to this and similar {{examples}} where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying: [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> confident about the songs. The insecurity may have been, if the Beatles kept going, 'How many songs am I {{going to be able to}} get on each album?', and with the backlog sort of mounting up... get it out there, and get something from it." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the British composers, Boult {{extensively}} {{recorded and}} sometimes re-recorded major works by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. He recorded all eight then-existing symphonies by Vaughan Williams for Decca in the 1950s with the LPO, {{in the presence}} of the composer. The recording producer, John Culshaw, wrote that the composer [...] "said very little during the sessions because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> in favour of Sir Adrian's approach to his music." [...] Vaughan Williams was to have been present for the first recording of his Ninth symphony, for Everest Records in 1958, but he died the night before the session took place; Boult recorded a short introduction as a memorial tribute. All these recordings have been reissued on CD. In the 1960s Boult re-recorded the nine symphonies for EMI.|$|E

500|$|Ray Davies' marital {{problems}} {{during this period}} began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was [...] "fucking sick of the whole thing", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness {{as well as his}} depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies [...] "decided to work again ... I don't think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> better, and he's been a different person ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Josh Brolin was {{revealed}} {{as the voice of}} Thanos, with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character. Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula. In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are [...] "the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into Avengers films in the future." [...] On casting Brolin, Feige said, We reached out to him {{and it was one of}} those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it’s very nice, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [...] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of Avengers. Then we shot him and recorded for it.|$|E
500|$|Several decades later, in 1912, Episcopal Bishop Franklin S. Spalding sent {{copies of}} the three facsimiles to eight Egyptologists and semitists, soliciting their {{interpretation}} of the facsimiles; the results were published in a pamphlet entitled, Joseph Smith, Jr. as a Translator: An Inquiry. The eight scholars recognized the facsimiles as portions of ordinary funerary documents, and some harshly condemned Smith's interpretation. Egyptologist James H. Breasted of the University of Chicago noted: [...] "hese three facsimiles of Egyptian documents in the 'Pearl of Great Price' depict the most common objects in the Mortuary religion of Egypt. Joseph Smith’s interpretations of {{them as part of}} a unique revelation through Abraham, therefore, very clearly demonstrates that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> unacquainted with the significance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of the simplest facts of Egyptian writing and civilization." [...] Flinders Petrie of London University wrote: [...] "It may be safely said that there is not one single word that is true in these explanations". Likewise, Archibald Sayce, Oxford professor of Egyptology, stated: [...] "It is difficult to deal seriously with Joseph Smith’s impudent fraud .... Smith has turned the goddess [...] into a king and Osiris into Abraham.” ...|$|E

Grant recalled, [...] "Denny only let me write that story under protest, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> opposed to Joker being Anarky's father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that." [...] Grant persisted, suggesting that the move would generate interest for the comic book, and that the story could be undone later in another story. With O'Neil's permission, the sub-plot of Anarky's unrevealed heritage {{was published in the}} series' first issue. With the eventual series cancellation, the final issue was quickly written to reveal the identity of Anarky's father as the Joker, simply to resolve the plot line, and leaving any future rebuttal to a future publications.|$|E

Arabella took advantage of this and fled with him to Colombia. While in Bogotá on October 5, 1965, Arabella tried to convince Bravo Arciga not to continue bullfighting, fearing for his life. After an afternoon where Bravo Arciga had been gored, he went to a luxurious gentlemen's club in the Colombian capital. Arabella phoned the place pleading to talk to Bravo Arciga, but he ignored her, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> inebriated and in a foul mood after the goring.

Instead he'd appear at the appointed hour for his match, then vanish back into the night without saying a word to anyone. We'd all stay around giving autographs to the fans before {{moving on to the next}} city. Not Pancho. On court, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> professional as well as a fantastic player."
