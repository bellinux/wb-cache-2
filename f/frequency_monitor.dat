40|$|A {{low cost}} scheme to {{determine}} the frequency sweep nonlinearity using atomic saturated absorption spectroscopy is demonstrated. The frequency modulation rate is determined by directly measuring the interference fringe number and frequency gap between two atomic transition peaks of rubidium atom. Experimental {{results show that the}} frequency sweep nonlinearity is ~ 7. 68 %, with the average frequency modulation rate of ~ 28. 95 GHz/s, which is in good agreement with theoretical expectation. With this method, the absolute optical frequency and optical path difference between two laser beams are simultaneously measured. This novel technique can be used for applications such as optical frequency sweep nonlinearity correction and real-time <b>frequency</b> <b>monitor.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: Diseases {{associated}} with laryngeal dysfunction include chronic refractory cough (CRC), paradoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM), muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) and globus pharyngeus. We hypothesized {{the presence of}} a common sensory laryngeal dysfunction, the ‘laryngeal hypersensitivity’ syndrome, in these conditions. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare symptoms and sensory function in patients with CRC, PVFM, MTD and globus. Methods: The 103 participants included healthy controls (n[*]=[*] 13) and four case groups: CRC (n[*]=[*] 33), PVFM (n[*]=[*] 28), globus pharyngeus (n[*]=[*] 11) and MTD (n[*]=[*] 18). Participants completed self-report questionnaires: Symptom Frequency and Severity Scale, Voice Handicap Index and the Laryngeal Paraesthesia Questionnaire; and quantitative sensory testing: capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity, hypertonic saline challenge, the timed swallow test, acoustic voice testing, cough <b>frequency</b> <b>monitor</b> and a voice stress test. Results: All case groups reported a high-symptom burden in comparison to controls. The case groups showed a similar pattern of symptoms, with impairment in each of the cough, respiration, vocal and upper airway symptom domains. Objective testing revealed significant sensory impairment in the case groups compared to controls and also showed an overlap in sensory dysfunction between the four case groups. Furthermore, there was cross-sensory stimulation of symptoms whereby stimulation of a particular response resulted in symptoms in another domain. Conclusions: These discrete clinical laryngeal syndromes display considerable overlap in their clinical features and a common sensory dysfunction, supporting the ‘laryngeal hypersensitivity’ hypothesis. Reconceptualizing functional laryngeal disorders as a form of laryngeal hypersensitivity syndrome provides an alternative approach to management of these perplexing conditions...|$|E

A nonintrusive measuring system is proposed to monitor the integrity of such guy line ground anchors. The natural longitudinal frequency of the partially buried anchor rod with a terminal buried plate attached can be measured periodically with an accelerometer.

40|$|Resting {{sites are}} key {{structures}} for many mammalian species, which can affect reproduction, survival, population density, and even species persistence in human-modified landscapes. As a consequence, {{an increasing number}} of studies has estimated patterns of resting site use by mammals, as well as the processes underlying these patterns, though the impact of sampling design on such estimates remain poorly understood. Here we address this issue empirically, based on data from 21 common genets radiotracked during 28 months in Mediterranean forest landscapes. Daily radiotracking data was thinned to simulate every other day and weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and then used to evaluate the impact of sampling regime on estimates of resting site use. Results showed that lower <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies</b> were associated with major underestimates of the average number of resting sites per animal, and of site reuse rates and sharing frequency, though no effect was detected on the percentage use of resting site types. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> also had a major impact on estimates of environmental effects on resting site selection, with decreasing <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies</b> resulting in higher model uncertainty and reduced power to identify significant explanatory variables. Our results suggest that variation in <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> may have had a strong impact on intra- and interspecific differences in resting site use patterns detected in previous studies.
