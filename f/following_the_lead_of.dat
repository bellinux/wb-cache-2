5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies {{doing business in the}} state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Early Netherlandish artists were {{classified}} by nationality, with Jan van Eyck identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French. Scholars were at times preoccupied {{as to whether}} the school's genesis was in France or Germany. These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> <b>of</b> Friedländer, Panofsky, and Pächt, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as [...] "Early Netherlandish painting", although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.|$|R

5|$|NATO {{air strikes}} that year helped bring the Yugoslav wars to an end, {{resulting}} in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO nations in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto European Union Force Althea. <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> its member nations, NATO began to award a service medal, the NATO Medal, for these operations.|$|E
5|$|The four theses {{stem from}} the synod of 1637, and herein Wheelwright portrays himself as an {{orthodox}} minister <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> such early reformers as Calvin, Zanchi, the Synod of Dort, Beza, Perkins and others. As his theses become repetitious of his propositions, they become abbreviated, and {{he returns to the}} accusations made in Short Story. He ends his work claiming that he was right all along, and that he was not an Antinomian.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E

50|$|Perusal of the {{correspondence}} between SVM headquarters and local Student Volunteer groups {{during this period}} confirms Rowland's analysis of the situation. While the Movement {{had once been a}} powerful force on prestigious campuses, the majority of Volunteer groups during the 1930s existed at small rural colleges and were propelled by local tradition rather than <b>following</b> closely <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national Movement.|$|R

5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling of a shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> Hendrix in rock, psychedelia {{began to}} {{influence}} African American musicians, particularly {{the stars of}} the Motown label. This psychedelic soul was influenced by the civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by Sly and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with male circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual mutilation of women, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the mid-1950s}} in Britain the blues {{was seen as}} a form of folk music. When Broonzy toured England he played a folk blues set to fit British {{expectations}} of American blues, rather than his current electric Chicago blues. Skiffle clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. In its early stages these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues. As the skiffle craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> MacColl, began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music, often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English folk clubs.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners' inaugural {{season was}} {{considered}} a resounding success by most; the team reached the 2006 A-League Grand Final after finishing third during the regular season. Central Coast was defeated by Sydney FC 1–0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 41,689—a competition record at the time. The Mariners also won the 2005 Pre-Season Cup, defeating Perth Glory in the final 1–0. Before the 2006–07 A-League season, the Mariners secured the services of then-Australian international Tony Vidmar from NAC Breda for two years. This was the club's first marquee signing, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> Sydney FC (Dwight Yorke) and Adelaide United (Qu Shengqing). Central Coast again reached the grand final in the 2006 Pre-Season Cup, losing to Adelaide United 5–4 on penalties after the score was tied 1–1 after extra time.

It was only much later that attention switched to a compassionate view of the drowned woman, as in Gustave Doré's illustration of the fable (above) and Marc Chagall's 1952 etching. These follow in the wake of sympathetic treatments of the subject like the [...] "Ophelia" [...] (1852) of John Everett Millais and [...] "A Christian martyr drowned in the Tiber during the reign of Diocletian" [...] (1855) by Eugène Delacroix.|$|R
25|$|Evidence and {{the results}} of {{research}} began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges.

25|$|Although {{the central}} concept of {{marginalism}} {{is that of}} marginal utility, marginalists, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> Alfred Marshall, drew upon the idea of marginal physical productivity in explanation of cost.
