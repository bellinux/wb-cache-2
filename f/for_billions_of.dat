5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E

On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985.

5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years to come.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E
5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

25|$|For {{a star of}} , the {{resulting}} white dwarf is of about , compressed into approximately {{the volume of the}} Earth. White dwarfs are stable because the inward pull of gravity is balanced by the degeneracy pressure of the star's electrons, a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. Electron degeneracy pressure provides a rather soft limit against further compression; therefore, for a given chemical composition, white dwarfs of higher mass have a smaller volume.

Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost {{all the way back to}} the Big Bang, and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} {{the theory is that}} the astronomical cycles have been in {{existence}} <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years, but glaciation is a rare occurrence. Astronomical cycles correlate perfectly with glacial and interglacial periods, and their transitions, inside an ice age. Other factors such as the position of continents and the effects this has on Earth's oceanic currents, or long-term fluctuations inside the core of the Sun that caused Earth's temperature to drop below a critical threshold and thus initiate the ice age in the first place must also be involved. Once that occurs, Milankovitch cycles could act to force the planet in and out of glacial periods.|$|E

25|$|Their {{reasoning}} is that life on Mars {{is likely to}} be hard to find. Any present day life {{is likely to be}} sparse and occur in only a few niche habitats. Past life is likely to be degraded by cosmic radiation over geological time periods if exposed in the top few meters of the Mars surface. Also, only certain special deposits of salts or clays on Mars would have the capability to preserve organics <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years. So, they argue, there is a high risk that a Mars sample return at our current stage of understanding would return samples that are no more conclusive about the origins of life on Mars or present day life than the Martian meteorite samples we already have.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} three ports of entry serving the metropolitan region.

The most trafficked port of entry is the San Ysidro Port of Entry—the busiest international crossing in the world. It serves as the primary entry point for the commuting populace of the metropolitan region. The Cross Border Xpress pedestrian border crossing, which opened December 9, 2015, is for the exclusive use of ticketed passengers at Tijuana International Airport. Further east, the Otay Mesa Port of Entry deals with high volumes of commercial traffic as it is located in the manufacturing zone of the region. The Otay Mesa Port accounts <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> dollars worth of product. Further east, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry is planned. And the farthest east, the Tecate Port of Entry is the smallest port of entry and is not designed for dealing with large volumes of traffic as it follows a long winding road through the Mountain Empire.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu {{points out}} that Earth is a closed system in the {{thermodynamic}} sense of the term: Earth exchanges energy, but not matter (practically) {{with the rest of}} the universe. Hence, mainly two sources of 'low entropy' are available to man, namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the Earth; and the flow of radiation, received from the Sun. Since the Sun will continue to shine <b>for</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years to come, the Earth's mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy. Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the crust of the Earth at a rate of our own choosing (practically), the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the Earth at a constant and fixed rate, beyond human control. This natural 'asymmetry' between man's access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life: The busy urban life, on the one hand, is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals; the tranquil rural life, on the other hand, is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy. Georgescu {{points out that}} this 'asymmetry' helps explaining the historical subjection of the countryside by the town since the dawn of civilisation, and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this subjection properly into account in his theory of historical materialism.|$|E
