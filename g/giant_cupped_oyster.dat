40|$|Experts in {{the oyster}} supply chain (farmers, retailers, and gourmet chefs) in The Netherlands have {{suggested}} that the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) has superior sensory qualities compared to the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas). However, scientific evidence is lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate consumer preferences for these two oyster species and to determine the sensory properties of both species by consumers. Two-alternative forced choice tests were performed with the oysters involving a panel of 74 naïve consumers. No significant differences in preferences between the oyster species were observed by the consumers. Nine sensory attributes of both oyster species were evaluated. Consumers did not observe significant differences between species in the sensory attributes: overall odor intensity, sea odor, mud odor, sweetness, pungency, and firmness. The Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> was perceived as significantly saltier and more intense in greenness than the European flat oyster. We concluded that only a few sensory properties of the European flat oyster and the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> are perceived as being different by untrained consumers. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two important different geographical cultivation areas in the Netherlands (Eastern Scheldt and Lake Grevelingen) on the volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) and Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas). Market size oysters were analyzed for biochemical composition (dry matter, ash, protein, lipid content and fatty acid profile) and VOCs from samples harvested in January and February. Significant differences in fatty acids and in VOC content were observed between the oyster species. The European flat oyster was found to have a higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in comparison with Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters.</b> The main VOC in the European flat oyster was found to be 3 -cyclohexene- 1 -ethanol while 1, 5 -octadien- 3 -ol was the main VOC in the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster.</b> Principle component analysis (PCA) not only showed separation between oyster species, but also between oysters originating from different cultivation areas as well as oysters harvested at different time intervals. </p...|$|R

This species, C. dianbaiensis (named Sumizome-gaki in Japanese), was very recently described as a new â€œtropicalâ€� oyster, although we located it in a temperate water zone (southwestern coast of Shikoku Island, Japan). Our specimens bore a morphological resemblance to the slipper <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> C. bilineata (syn. C. iredalei), consistent with their close phylogenetic relationship.

40|$|Oyster refinement, {{a common}} {{practice}} in France, is aimed at increasing the weight of oyster tissue and influencing the taste properties of the refined oysters. Refinement usually takes place in land-based systems where the oysters are fed with relatively high concentrations of microalgae. In this study the impact of feeding Skeletonema costatum and Rhodomonas baltica on the biochemical composition and sensory characteristics of Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea gigas) from the Eastern Scheldt during land-based refinement was studied. After a feeding period of four and seven weeks market-sized oysters were sampled {{for the analysis of}} fatty acids, free amino acids and volatile organic compounds and for a sensory evaluation by consumers and an expert panel. The algae Skeletonema costatum showed a lower ∑. PUFA, ∑. n. - 3, ∑. n. - 6, C 18 : 2 n 6, C 18 : 3 n 3, C 18 : 4 n 3, C 22 : 6 n 3 content as compared with Rhodomonas baltica. These differences were also reflected in the fatty acid profile of the oysters fed with the corresponding algae diets. Furthermore, general linear model and principal component analysis showed marked differences in free amino acids and volatile organic compound content between Skeletonema, Rhodomonas fed oysters and reference oysters. For example, threonine, glutamine, leucine, histidine, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (E) - 2 octenal, (E) - 2 -octen- 1 -ol, (E,E) - 2, 4 -octadien- 1 -ol, (E,Z) - 3, 6 -nonadien- 1 -ol and (Z,E) - 2, 6 -nonadienal contents were higher in Skeletonema fed oysters compared to Rhodomonas fed oysters. Sensory differences between the experimental oyster groups were shown. Skeletonema fed Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters</b> were characterized by a stronger seaweed flavor, higher perceived sweetness and a firmer texture in comparison with Rhodomonas fed oysters. Naïve consumers were only able to differentiate between Rhodomonas fed oysters and reference oysters. </p...|$|R
