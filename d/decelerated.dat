5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the next few days, the storm <b>decelerated</b> and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} {{distance}} from Neptune, the regular moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, S/2004 N 1, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune's rotational period is 0.6713 day) {{and thus are}} being tidally <b>decelerated.</b> Naiad, the closest regular moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of S/2004 N 1), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the chest is suddenly <b>decelerated,</b> as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the chest cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
50|$|The {{explanation}} is that, although {{all parts of}} the ladder simultaneously <b>decelerate</b> to zero in the garage's frame, because simultaneity is relative, the corresponding decelerations in the frame of the ladder are not simultaneous. Instead, each part of the ladder <b>decelerates</b> sequentially, from front to back, until finally the back of the ladder <b>decelerates,</b> by which time it is already within the garage.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be <b>decelerated</b> to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|Gabrielle {{eventually}} <b>decelerated,</b> and {{by early}} on September10, it curved westward and weakened to a tropical storm. Gabrielle re-curved northeastward on September11 and began paralleling Nova Scotia. It further weakened to a tropical depression on September12 and was then absorbed by a developing storm near Newfoundland on September13. Due to its large size, Gabrielle produced swells and high tides in the Lesser Antilles, Bermuda, the East Coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. Rough seas along the East Coast of the United States caused one fatality in Maine, two in Massachusetts, one in New Jersey, and four in New York. In Nova Scotia, large waves swept one man to sea and eventually caused his drowning.|$|E
5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm <b>decelerated</b> after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south of due west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E
40|$|Historically, the {{elective}} intraoperative ventilatory flow {{in small}} infants has been <b>decelerating</b> flow (DF) [1, 2]. This {{was due to}} because the traditional thinking that a <b>decelerating</b> flow waveform (inherent to pressure control ventilation, PCV) improves oxygenation compared with the square flow waveform (common in volume control ventilation, VCV) related to a better intrapulmonary gas distribution. However, the superiority of <b>decelerating</b> flow compared with square flow {{has not yet been}} demonstrated during ventilation in small infants. Even in adults, the su-periority has been questioned in clinical studies showing contradictory results [3 - 10]. Most studies [3 - 6] used VCV and PCV modes when comparing square vs. <b>decelerating</b> flow waveforms in terms of oxygenation and ventilation. However different VT between both modes could affect gas exchange. I...|$|R

The variable hour is only significant when the following event is unemployment and accelerates time to failure. Income is significant in all cases and <b>decelerates</b> time to failure with increasing income. Household size is significant at the 10 percent level when becoming unemployed and slightly <b>decelerates</b> time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} the cyclic evolutionary behavior of CME accelerations for accel-erating and <b>decelerating</b> CME events in cycle 23 from 1997 January to 2007 December. It is {{found that the}} absolute values of semiannual mean accelerations of both accelerating and <b>decelerating</b> CME events roughly wax and wane in a cycle, delaying the sunspot cycle in time phase. We also {{investigate the}} semiannual number of CMEs with positive and neg-ative acceleration and find {{that there are more}} <b>decelerating</b> CME events than accelerating CME events during the maximum period of a cycle (about three years), but there are more accelerating CME events than <b>decelerating</b> CME events {{during the rest of the}} time inter-val of the cycle. Our results seem to suggest that the different driving mechanisms may be acting accelerate and <b>decelerate</b> CME events: for accelerating CME events, the pro-pelling force (Fp) statistically seems to play a significant role in pushing CMEs outward; for <b>decelerating</b> CME events, the drag (Fd) statistically seems to play a more effective role in determining CME kinematic evolution in the outer corona. During the maximum period of a cycle, because of the V 2 dependence, Fd is generally stronger; because of the magnetic field dependence, Fp is also generally stronger. Thus, the absolute values o...|$|R
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved eastward through the United States {{in the middle}} part of July, and reached the East Coast of the United States on July23. By the {{following}} day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina ahead of the frontal zone, and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression gradually organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July25. Convection developed closer {{to the center of}} circulation as it gradually <b>decelerated</b> while continuing southwestward and on July27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335miles (539.1km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually <b>decelerated</b> as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Early on August11, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} slightly while crossing Florida. It then <b>decelerated</b> {{and reached the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later. Thereafter, the system began to re-strengthen and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200UTC on August12. Early the next day, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 90mph (150km/h). It weakened slightly early on August14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana. At 2100UTC, the storm made landfall near Buras with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Curving northeastward, the hurricane re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico early on August15. However, around 1700UTC, it made another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi at the same intensity. Early on August16, the system weakened to a tropical storm. It then weakened much quicker and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Mississippi at 0000UTC on August17. The remnant extratropical cyclone persisted until late the next day, at which time it dissipated over Indiana.|$|E

5|$|For {{about six}} days, Ginger {{maintained}} minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained {{an unusually large}} eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, Ginger turned {{to the south and}} slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger <b>decelerated</b> before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Erin passed 105miles (170km) east-northeast of Bermuda, its closest {{approach to the}} island. The hurricane maintained peak strength for 18hours before slowly weakening. Its weakening trend was slower than usual due to warmer than usual water temperatures, and by late on September 10 Erin weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. Multiple short-wave troughs weakened the western portion of the subtropical ridge, and on September 11, Erin <b>decelerated</b> as it turned to the east. A strengthening mid- to upper-level trough over eastern Canada turned the hurricane to the northeast. It gradually accelerated its forward motion, and on September 15, after weakening to a strong tropical storm, Erin passed just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Convection gradually diminished as it moved through the north Atlantic Ocean, and later on September 15 Erin became extratropical. The extratropical storm continued northeastward, and after crossing over southern Greenland Erin merged with a high-latitude cyclonic flow {{to the east of}} Greenland on September 17.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{crossed into}} the area of forecast responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center on July24, and upon doing so, its eye disappeared from satellite imagery. Daniel was forecast to track through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm as water temperatures near the islands were warmer, and wind shear {{was expected to be}} minimal. However, it <b>decelerated</b> as the ridge to its north weakened, and due to the combination of cool waters and increasing easterly shear, Daniel weakened to a tropical storm on July25. Later that day, no active convection remained near the exposed circulation center, and early on July26 it weakened to tropical depression status. Thunderstorm activity failed to redevelop, and Daniel degenerated into a remnant low pressure area by 0000UTC on July27. The remnant low continued west-northwestward, dissipating just south-east of the Big Island of Hawaii on July28.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of isolated drops, and binary and ternary systems of drops moving in tandem, in <b>decelerating</b> flows are numerically studied employing a finite-volume interface-tracking numerical scheme and a lattice-Boltzmann method for two-phase flows.

5|$|The remnant {{tropical}} wave gradually curved northwestward {{and brushed}} western Jamaica on August14. As the wave approached the south coast of central Cuba, it rapidly re-organized into a tropical cyclone, becoming a tropical depression again at 18:00UTC on August15. Around 00:00UTC the following day, the depression re-intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and made landfall in Cuba near Playa Girón in Matanzas Province. Dennis moved northward across the island and emerged into the Straits of Florida near Cárdenas shortly after 06:00UTC. While crossing the Straits of Florida, deep convection associated with the cyclone attempted to become concentrated near the center and develop an eyewall. However, interaction with a trough prevented Dennis from intensifying despite passing over warm sea surface temperatures. The storm <b>decelerated</b> while approaching Florida due to weak steering currents.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak intensity, Odette {{had begun}} accelerating northeastward, which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow. The low-level center <b>decelerated</b> as it approached Hispaniola, though the convection continued quickly northeastward. Failing to maintain vertical organization, Odette weakened slightly and made landfall on Jaragua National Park, in the Pedernales Province of the Dominican Republic, around 2300UTC on December 6 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country, and on December 7 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45mph (75km/h). It accelerated {{to the northeast}} ahead of an approaching cold front, and late on December 7 Odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front. The remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on December 9; the frontal zone that absorbed Odette also absorbed Tropical Storm Peter a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Erika {{continued}} to the west-northwest, {{and in the}} early hours of September 4, an eye-like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially exposed from the convection. Despite unfavorable wind shear, Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530miles (850km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. Deep convection re-developed near the center, and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west-northwestward. Hurricane Erika <b>decelerated</b> its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85miles (135km) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane. An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125mph (205km/h) on September 8, while located about 350miles (565km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24hours before weakening over cooler waters.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} of two tropical waves and an upper-level trough {{led to the}} development of a tropical depression over the central Atlantic by 12:00UTC on August2. The depression steadily organized after formation, intensifying into Tropical Storm Colin by 06:00UTC on August3. An abnormally strong ridge to the storm's north steered Colin to the west-northwest; reaching a forward speed up to 30mph (50km/h), the system was unable to maintain a closed circulation and instead degenerated into a trough by 18:00UTC that day. Over the coming days, the trough <b>decelerated</b> and recurved north into a weakness in the ridge while still producing tropical storm-force winds. Satellite imagery showed the reformation of a well-defined circulation by 12:00UTC on August5, and the system was once again classified as Tropical Storm Colin. After attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), an approaching trough sheared the cyclone and turned it northeast. Colin weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on August8 and degenerated into a trough for a second time twelve hours later; the trough dissipated early on August9.|$|E
