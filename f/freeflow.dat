25|$|Free-flow diving helmets {{avoid the}} dead space problem by {{supplying}} far more air than the diver can use, and eliminating the oro-nasal compartment. This makes the whole {{interior of the}} helmet effectively fresh air, as it is adequately flushed during and after each exhalation {{at the cost of}} significantly higher gas usage in open circuit systems. This also minimises work of breathing increases due to breathing apperatus resistance to flow, making <b>freeflow</b> helmets particularly suitable for applications where severe exertion may be required.|$|E
25|$|The N2/M2, {{which the}} Government {{announced}} in March 2005 {{would not be}} tolled, allows thousands of commuters and hauliers to avoid the town, {{which has become a}} major bottleneck for traffic heading south from County Donegal, County Londonderry, County Tyrone, County Monaghan, County Louth and the rest of County Meath. The South Ashbourne Interchange, a large junction taking traffic on and off the N2 near the Nine Mile Stone, allows non-stop transferral of traffic to and from Ashbourne and its new by-pass. Phase II of the M50 upgrade, opened in 2010, links the N2 to the M50 at exit 5 with a partial <b>freeflow</b> junction, meaning most traffic transferring from the M50 to the N2 and vice versa does not have to stop (traffic lights remain where traffic from the M50 southbound meets traffic from the N2 southbound).|$|E

500|$|The game's 'FreeFlow' {{combat system}} allows for basic attacks {{including}} strikes, counters, and dodging {{which can be}} combined to keep Batman attacking while moving between enemies and avoiding being attacked himself. Basic enemies include enemies armed with shields and shock batons, while others are armed with guns which significantly damage Batman. These enemies can perform a charge and tackle attack only used by larger enemies in previous games; precision timed dodging, and a batarang can instantly defeat some charging enemies. The system adds the ability to combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting a combo streak. Batman can counter enemy attacks and throw them into other enemies for increased damage. Batman is also capable of disarming enemies wielding items like baseball bats and using the acquired weapon on several foes before it breaks. Arkham Knight introduces [...] "Dual Play", in which players can seamlessly switch control of Batman {{to one of his}} allies: Robin, Nightwing or Catwoman while in <b>FreeFlow</b> Combat, which the player enters when they have accumulated an uninterrupted combat streak. Each successful, uninterrupted attack adds to the player's combat score, which carries over between each controlled character and unlocks double-team takedowns on opponents at higher scores.|$|E

These points {{can be used in}} a branching upgrade system to enhance Batman's abilities and gadgets, allowing players to upgrade several paths or specialize in one. Enemy attacks are prompted with a warning icon, indicating that the attack can be countered. Enemies are armed with weapons such as knives, lead pipes and shields. The game introduces new enemy types: the Martial-Artist (capable of blocking, evading and countering Batman's attacks), the Armored Enforcer (invulnerable until he is dazed and de-armored) and Venom-infused henchmen (who possess superhuman strength, allowing them to grapple Batman and launch attacks which cannot be countered). Some enemies are armed with guns, which can damage Batman, and a player can use stealth predatory tactics to tilt the odds in their favor. Many areas feature stone gargoyles or high outcrops, helping Batman remain concealed while setting traps and knocking out enemies.|$|E

50|$|Speed flow {{diagrams}} {{are used to}} determine the speed at which the optimum flow occurs. There are currently two shapes of the speed-flow curve. The speed-flow curve also consists of two branches, the <b>freeflow</b> and congested branches. The diagram is not a function, allowing the flow variable to exist at two different speeds. The flow variable existing at two different speeds occurs when the speed is higher and the density is lower or when the speed is lower and the density is higher, which allows for the same flow rate. In the first speed-flow diagram, the <b>freeflow</b> branch is a horizontal line, which shows that the roadway is at <b>freeflow</b> speed until the optimum flow is reached. Once the optimum flow is reached, the diagram switches to the congested branch, which is a parabolic shape. The second speed flow diagram is a parabola. The parabola suggests that the only time there is <b>freeflow</b> speed is when the density approaches zero; it also suggests that as the flow increases the speed decreases. This parabolic graph also contains an optimum flow. The optimum flow also divides the <b>freeflow</b> and congested branches on the parabolic graph.|$|E

50|$|<b>Freeflow</b> (also {{free flow}} and free-flow) in {{underwater}} diving apparatus is a continuous flow of gas from a storage or supply unit. In scuba diving {{it is usually}} undesirable and considered a malfunction, while in surface supplied diving {{it may be a}} malfunction or a user selected option in demand systems, or the standard mode of operation in <b>freeflow</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the <b>freeflow</b> {{will not}} stop when the {{backpressure}} is increased. This {{may be caused by}} very cold water freezing the first or second stage valve open, or a malfunction of either the first or second stages. If the <b>freeflow</b> is caused by freezing it will generally not be corrected except by closing the cylinder valve and allowing the ice to thaw, which requires an alternative air supply to breathe from while the valve is closed. As long as the <b>freeflow</b> continues, the refrigerating effect of the air expanding through the valves will keep the ice frozen, and air will continue to escape until either the cylinder valve is closed, or the cylinder is empty.|$|E

The {{aim is to}} determine the quantity of traffic flow during adverse weather conditions and to see if rainfall inhibits the flow. Data was collected from a single lane carriageway on which traffic flow data was collected for 16 weeks. The data was reorganised to incorporate the current PCE values of vehicles for conversion of flow rates from vehs/hr to PCE/hr. The fundamental diagram method was used to predict the capacity of the roadway and these were used together with the observed flow rates for reliability analysis. The results show that reliability of the road capacity diminished under heavy rainfall when the flow regime is <b>freeflowing.</b> Reliability analysis could be used as an additional measure of effectiveness for flow rates assessment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Congestion {{in urban}} areas causes {{financial}} loss to business and increased use of energy compared with <b>freeflowing</b> traffic. Providing citizens with accurate information on traffic conditions can encourage journeys at times of low congestion and uptake of public transport. Installing the measurement infrastructure in a city to provide this information is expensive and potentially invades privacy. Increasingly, public transport vehicles are equipped with sensors to provide realtime arrival time estimates, but these data are sparse. Our work shows how these data {{can be used to}} estimate journey times experienced by road users generally. In this paper we describe (i) what a typical data set from a fleet of over 100 buses looks like; (ii) describe an algorithm to extract bus journeys and estimate their duration along a single route; (iii) show how to visualise journey times and the influence of contextual factors; (iv) validate our approach for recovering speed information from the sparse movement data.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Grand Gulf Cave {{is located}} {{at the bottom of a}} chasm, some miles West of the town of Thayer in South-Central Missouri (Figure 1). Although the cave had been explored, back to an {{underground}} river or lake of water, in 1884, and in 1898, it has, more recently, been flooded and partially filled with debris. Current seasonal flooding of the cave may also fill the adjacent chasm, making an area of the current Park at the site inaccessible. It is desirable to clear any blockage of the cave, so that it will again be accessible, and <b>freeflowing.</b> In this way it is hoped to stop site flooding and to provide additional facilities for visitors. Figure 1. View of the Cave Entrance from the Top of the Bluff. PROBLEM PARAMETERS The intial problem in carrying out work at the cave relates to the access to its entrance.

40|$|The megalithic monuments of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern {{region of}} {{northern}} Germany are relatively well known from a conventional archaeological perspective, having attracted scientific attention {{for well over}} a century. Cornelius Holtorf approaches them from an entirely different viewpoint, in a search for answers to three questions: How were the megaliths of the area socially and culturally meaningful, and how are they meaningful today? Are there cultural memories which helped the megaliths acquire cultural values in later prehistory? Did later prehistoric people in the area connect the megaliths with their ancestors by endowing them with particular interests, concepts, and ideas? The results of his labours appear not in printed form, but as a hypermedia document presented both on a CD-Rom and on the Web.
