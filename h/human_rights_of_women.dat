Conscience motivated Bunnatine Greenhouse to expose irregularities in the contracting of the Halliburton company for work in Iraq. Naji al-Ali a popular cartoon artist in the Arab world, loved for his defense of the ordinary people, and for his criticism of repression and despotism by both the Israeli military and Yasser Arafat's PLO, was murdered for refusing to compromise with his conscience. The journalist Anna Politkovskaya provided (prior to her murder) an example of conscience in her opposition to the Second Chechen War and then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. Conscience motivated the Russian human-rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted and murdered in Grozny, Chechnya in 2009. The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan arose from conscience-driven protests against the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Female Muslim lawyer Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) has been described as the 'conscience of the Islamic Republic' for her work in protecting the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children in Iran.

[...] Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer in Russia, was arrested, held without trial for almost a year and died in custody, as a result of exposing corruption. On 6 October 2001 Laura Whittle was a naval gunner on HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) under orders to implement a new border protection policy when they encountered the SIEV-4 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel-4) refugee boat in choppy seas. After being ordered to fire warning shots from her 50 calibre machinegun to make the boat turn back she saw it beginning to break up and sink with a father on board holding out his young daughter that she might be saved (see Children Overboard Affair). Whittle jumped without a life vest 12 metres into the sea to help save the refugees from drowning thinking [...] "this isn't right; this isn't how things should be."

40|$|Women’s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> abuse {{has become}} an issue of global concern. It is {{estimated}} that one in three women worldwide has been abused physically, emotionally and psychologically in her lifetime. Evidence {{on the extent to}} which socio-cultural structures support the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>women</b> or protect against them has been sparse and general. Available data often name and describe various forms of abuse but hardly detail out the specific and structured form of the abuse. Using the Kassena of Northern Ghana as a case study, this paper investigates the incidence <b>of</b> women’s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> abuses among a specific cultural setting. Personal interviews, desk reviews and participant observation methods were used to obtain empirical data for the analyses. Key findings reveal high incidence <b>of</b> women’s <b>rights</b> abuse, changing nature of the abuse and factors accounting for the situation. It also reveals that there are some structures, civil and traditional, in place for protecting women but these are weak and ineffective. The paper concludes that in order to protect women’s rights among the Kassena, there is the need to adopt an integrated approach, which blends civil and traditional strategies for dealing with the <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> violation <b>of</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R
