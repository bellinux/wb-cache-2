It was there that Bailey began {{developing}} his own style, mixing in musical parodies with deconstructions of or variations on traditional jokes ("How many amoebas <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to change a lightbulb? One, no two! No four! No eight..."). According to comedy folklore, after a reviewer once criticised his act for its lack of jokes, Bailey returned the following night, at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, to perform a set composed entirely of punchlines. Longworth left to join the RSC in 1989 {{and was replaced by}} Martin Stubbs.|$|E

[...] Not only <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> better account of the terminal impedances but the designer has additional degrees of freedom allowing improved matching. [...] The size and gaps of the teeth are tapered in this method of design. [...] That is, the teeth can be different sizes according to their position in the filter, compared with an image design where all sections are identical. [...] With this approach, the original specification for passband and stopband can be kept while simultaneously improving the impedance matching. [...] The stepped impedance transformers can be dispensed with, or at least significantly reduced in size.|$|E

[...] Use of the phrase as a tu quoque discourse grew in popularity in Russia during the 1960s, and was used as a widespread quip between Russians. In this version, an American and a Soviet car salesman argue which country makes better cars. Finally, the American asks: [...] "How many decades <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> an average Soviet man to earn enough money to buy a Soviet car?" [...] After a thoughtful pause, the Soviet replies: [...] "And you are lynching Negroes!" [...] The phrase garnered numerous iterations during the Cold War period. Its pervasiveness in Russian society reflected a strong sense of Soviet socialist patriotism. When the government faced criticism for discrimination against Jews in the Soviet Union, the idiom was used with excessively sentimental tone to complain about racism in the United States. the accusation 'and you are lynching negroes' became a catchphrase epitomizing Soviet propaganda based on this principle.)}} It was used as an aphorism among fellow Soviets during the Mikhail Gorbachev period, as an answer to complaints about the lack of civil and political rights including freedom of movement. A variant used during this time as a form of reciprocity when faced with criticism over imprisonment and treatment of Refuseniks, was to put the focus on race in the United States criminal justice system. A similar phrase was used to counter complaints about Soviet transportation inefficiency.|$|E

2500|$|To {{measure the}} {{difficulty}} of solving a computational problem, one may wish {{to see how much}} time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated {{as a function of the}} size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices? ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real trouble.
