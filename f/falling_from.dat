5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Most notable was {{the closure}} of the Monitor Ridge trail, which {{previously}} let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers. In February 2010, a climber died after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the rim into the crater.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1817, Kościuszko emancipated {{the peasants}} in his {{remaining}} lands in Poland, but Tsar Alexander disallowed this. Suffering from poor health and old wounds, on October 15, 1817, Kościuszko died in Solothurn at age 71 after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> a horse, developing a fever, and suffering a stroke {{a few days}} later.|$|E

40|$|This Briefing {{provides}} an overview of hospitalised injury due to <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders. Injurious <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders requiring admission to hospital occurred at a rate of 18. 5 per 100, 000 population in the year to June 30 2005 (n= 3, 486). Two-thirds of hospitalised injury incidents due to <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders in this year resulted in fractures and more than 40 % of <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders occurred in the home. Rates increased markedly with age and, unlike most other types of <b>fall</b> injuries, <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders were more common for older males than for older females. Both the number and the rate of injurious ladder-related falls have increased for older Australians in recent years...|$|R
5|$|Welter {{survived the}} war and was {{employed}} at a sugar factory. He was killed on 7 March 1949 in Leck in Schleswig-Holstein waiting at a level crossing, when logs <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> an improperly loaded passing train crushed his car.|$|E
5|$|After the ride's {{relaunch}} in 2011 as the New Texas Giant, {{its popularity}} returned, winning Amusement Todays Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride of 2011 and ranking highly in industry polls. On July 19, 2013, a woman died after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the ride, resulting in modifications and {{additions to the}} ride's restraint system.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E

5|$|Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> a clear sky— a sunshower— {{is called}} kitsune no yomeiri or the kitsune's wedding, in {{reference}} to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions. The event is considered a good omen, but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests, as is depicted in the 1990 Akira Kurosawa film Dreams.|$|E
5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have been badly {{affected}} by avian diseases, with the breeding population <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E

30|$|<b>Falls</b> <b>from</b> heights {{account for}} a {{significant}} percentage of urban trauma; these cases represent a distinctive mechanism of blunt trauma. It has been suggested that patients sustaining injuries <b>from</b> a <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> height have distinctive characteristics with an increased trauma severity and with different pattern of injuries in comparison with other mechanisms of blunt trauma [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16]. A <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> height is associated with the most severe blunt injuries as compared with a motor vehicle crash or other mechanisms [2]. Nguyen-Thanh et al. [16] reported significant differences in ISS and the distribution of fractures when a <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> a height was compared with a motor vehicle accident. This study supports that blunt trauma <b>from</b> <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> height is more severe than other mechanisms of trauma.|$|R
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and moved on to other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E
5|$|After fierce fighting, the Comanches fled. Ross {{and several}} of his men pursued the chief and a second, unknown, rider. As the Rangers neared, the second rider slowed and held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead {{surrounded}} and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. The chief refused to surrender, even after <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> his horse. Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been a captive in Nocona's band, identified the fallen chief as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez fired the shot that took Nocona's life. Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting; 13 Comanche women were also killed. Ross's men suffered no casualties.|$|E
5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the sky.|$|E
50|$|The station uses {{water from}} {{two sets of}} reservoirs. Hardeland H is a 400 m {{vertical}} <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> Løkjelsvatnet, while Hardeland K uses Grindheimsvatnet, Ilsvatnet, Basurde-/Krokavatnet and Hjørnås via a 305 m <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the Hjørnås lake.|$|R
50|$|In a study {{performed}} in 1987 {{it was reported}} that cats who <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> less than six stories, and are still alive, have greater injuries than cats who <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> higher than six stories. It has been proposed that this might happen because cats reach terminal velocity after righting themselves at about five stories, and after this point they relax, leading to less severe injuries in cats who have <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> six or more stories.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Falls</b> <b>from</b> height {{can occur}} {{throughout}} a grain handling facility. Data has illustrated that relatively short <b>falls,</b> <b>from</b> 12 to 20 feet, can be fatal. Examples of surfaces that could present a falling hazard to grain handling employees might include floors, machinery, structures, roofs, skylights, unguarded holes, wall and floor openings, ladders, unguarded catwalks, platforms and manlifts. Additionally, workers are also exposed to potentially fatal falls {{as they move}} from the vertical exterior ladders on grain bins to the bin roof or through a bin entrance.Between 1985 and 1989, <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> heights were the second leading cause of grain-handling worker fatalities [...]Falls from machinery and structures were the second largest single cause of grain- and silage-handling fatalities between 1985 and 1989; <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> structures accounted for 79 percent of these fatalities [...] Data has illustrated that relatively short <b>falls,</b> <b>from</b> 12 to 20 feet, can be fatal [...]|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, the Soviet Union {{retained}} {{about two-thirds}} of the population on the islands (with a third being Norwegians) with the archipelago's population slightly under 4,000. Russian activity has diminished considerably since then, <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> 2,500 to 450 people from 1990 to 2010. Grumant was closed after it was depleted in 1962. Pyramiden was closed in 1998. Coal exports from Barentsburg ceased in 2006 because of a fire, but resumed in 2010. The Russian community has also experienced two air accidents, Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801, which killed 141 people, and the Heerodden helicopter accident.|$|E
5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{actually}} two falls formed here. The Markandeya river takes a first <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> {{a height of}} about 25 metres and flows into a rocky valley.

5|$|The first chorus has Koda {{walking through}} the land, and scenes of her singing. She grabs a compass, {{but it does not}} {{function}} properly. She grabs a drinking bottle, but only filled with little droplets; she tries to drink it, but falls all on her face instead. As she sings the song; {{by the end of the}} second chorus, black projectile smoke is scene <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> the sky in the distance and hits parts of the abandoned city. As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, {{when more than}} 29million working days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of the}} miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E
