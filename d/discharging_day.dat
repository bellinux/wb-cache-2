60|$|Once the Red Mill {{had been}} a pumping station, which, when the huge sails worked, {{delivered}} {{the water from the}} fertile meadows into the great dyke, whence it ran through sluice gates to the North Sea. Now, although the embankment of this dyke still held, the meadows had gone back into swamps. Rising out of these--for it was situated upon a low mound of earth, raised, doubtless, as a point of refuge by marsh-dwellers who lived and died before history began, towered the wreck of a narrow-waisted windmill, built of brick below and wood above, of very lonesome and commanding appearance in its gaunt solitude. There were no houses near it, no cattle grazed about its foot; it was a dead thing in a dead landscape. To the left, but separated from it by a wide and slimy dyke, whence in times of flood the thick, brackish water trickled to the plain, stretched an arid area of sand-dunes, clothed with sparse grass, that grew like bristles upon the back of a wild hog. Beyond these dunes the ocean roared and moaned and whispered hungrily as the wind and weather stirred its depths. In front, not fifty paces away, ran the big dyke like a raised road, secured by embankments, and <b>discharging</b> <b>day</b> by day its millions of gallons of water into the sea. But these embankments were weakening now, and here and there could be seen a spot which looked as though a giant ploughshare had been drawn up them, for a groove of brown earth scarred the face of green, where in some winter flood the water had poured over to find its level, cutting them like cheese, but when its volume sank, leaving them still standing, and as yet sufficient for their purpose.|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of the integration of proteomic profiles and data with clinical bioinformatics was emphasized {{to bridge the gap}} between proteomics and diseases, e.g. acute and chronic organ injury, inflammation, and multiple organ dysfunction [49]. It is easy to understand that proteomics as a powerful tool help investigate the relationship between biological molecules and disease mechanisms, while difficult to integrate proteomics-based DNB with physiological and pathophysiological situations, with organ-, tissue-, type-, function-, disease-specific patterns, or with disease diagnosis, therapies and prognosis. A new protocol of disease-specific DNB identification and evaluation was developed by integrating proteomic profiles of inflammatory mediators with clinical informatics in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) [50, 51]. Serum protein profiles from patients with AECOPD were assessed by different strategies of proteomics on days 1 and 3 of the admission day and the <b>discharging</b> <b>day</b> and correlated with clinical informatics by a Digital Evaluation Score System for assessing severity of patients. A panel of inflammatory mediators with dynamical changes during disease progression was demonstrated to be COPD specific or AECOPD specific biomarkers and correlated well with clinical bioinformatics. Such protocol can integrate proteomics with clinical informatics to explore a new way to validate and optimize disease-special DNB, which might be used clinically after further validation with a larger sample size.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo explore to {{what extent}} patient {{discharge}} from the hospital is a balanced decision between clinical considerations and management policy; specifically: (1) to assess the role of patient risk as a determinant of discharge in comparison with administrative factors such as hospital ownership; (2) to evaluate whether variations in discharge policy were translated into differences in clinical outcomes. MethodsA national study of coronary artery bypass surgery {{was used as an}} example. The population included 4778 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in 14 institutions. The mode of <b>discharge</b> <b>day,</b> rather than the mean, was used as the best indicator of discharge policy. Parametric survival model was used to assess factors associated with the <b>day</b> of <b>discharge.</b> ResultsThe mode of <b>discharge</b> <b>day</b> varied widely among institutions. This variation between 4 and 7 days after surgery corresponded to hospital ownership. The mode of <b>discharge</b> <b>day</b> was almost invariant to the patients' risk, but serious postoperative complications resulted in prolonged stay for a minority of the patients. The influence of hospital ownership prevailed over patient insurance carriers. Differences in discharge policies were not associated with increased risk of late mortality or rehospitalization. ConclusionsDischarge policy beyond the rare occurrence of dramatic patient postoperative complications was mainly dependent on hospital owner's cost-effectiveness considerations. However, despite the weight given to administrative factors in the decision-making process, it did not affect the outcome of care...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Lack of {{adequate}} {{information related to}} disease and self- care after discharge leads to poor self-care, readmissions and {{low quality of life}} for patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of training and post discharge follow-up on self- care behavior of patients with ischemic heart disease. Materials and Methods: In this single blind randomized clinical control trial study (2015), 90 patients with ischemic heart disease hospitalized at Cardiac Care Units and were divided in 1 control group and 2 intervention groups by Block random allocation method. Control group received only usual training for discharge. One intervention group received usual post discharge training and call follow- up for 1 month. Another intervention group received complete training package and comprehensive follow-up for 1 month. Valid and reliable Miller self-care behavior tool for patients with cardiovascular diseases were used for data collection. They were completed at <b>discharge</b> <b>day,</b> 15 and 30 <b>days</b> after <b>discharge</b> for each patient. Results: In complete training package group with comprehensive follow-up, means of self-care score were 60. 2 ± 13. 6, 87. 6 ± 6. 5 and 86. 9 ± 8. 9 at <b>discharge</b> <b>day,</b> 15 and 30 day, respectively. Means of self-care score in usual post discharge training and call follow up were 64. 7 ± 19, 82. 9 ± 8. 6 and 80. 9 ± 9. 5 at <b>discharge</b> <b>day,</b> 15 and 30 days, respectively. In control group, means of score were 69. 6 ± 10. 7, 82. 6 ± 6. 2 and 78 ± 10. 8 at <b>discharge</b> <b>day,</b> 15 and 30 days, respectively. Conclusion: Results showed that self-care score was increased following 15 days and was decreased after 30 days. This reduction was subtle in the group receiving comprehensive training package with follow-up and reflects the impact of this program on the continuation of self-care. © 2017, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} post-discharge telephone intervention with both patients and family caregivers on patient compliance with doctors' advice and rehabilitation progress in total hip replacement patients. Methods: In total, 249 participants were assigned to either the control or telephone intervention group according to the discharge date. The patients in the intervention group were contacted by phone three to seven <b>days</b> after <b>discharge,</b> at one month, and at three months post-discharge. Their family caregivers received were contacted by phone twice a month. Content of the telephone intervention included discussion of exercise, cautions in daily life, and regular examination. The patients in the control group received routine health education and follow-up. All participants were evaluated by the questionnaire of compliance with doctors' advice when they were discharged at one, three, and six months after discharge. The Harris Hip Score of patients was assessed on <b>discharge</b> <b>day</b> and six months after discharge. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the patients' compliance scores in the two groups on <b>discharge</b> <b>day</b> or one month after discharge.

40|$|NHS Trusts face {{considerable}} financial challenges. There is a {{drive to}} reduce costs by increasing day surgery rates, thereby reducing the length of post-operative stay. Some patients will not meet the discharge criteria to go home following day surgery, {{for a variety of}} reasons. They may then require an overnight stay in hospital, creating an unplanned cost. Aims The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the reasons why some adult patients are not suitable for <b>discharge</b> following <b>day</b> surgery. Methods A pragmatic, mixed-methods approach was used to undertake a critical evaluation of the literature and current practice to determine what is already known about <b>discharge</b> following <b>day</b> surgery. Thematic analysis was used to determine the key themes and issues, enabling recommendations to be made to reduce the incidence of patients who are unable to be <b>discharged</b> following <b>day</b> surgery. Findings The main themes or reasons for delayed <b>discharge</b> following <b>day</b> surgery were: post-operative nausea and vomiting, post-operative pain, going late to theatre and social reasons. This was supported by a Trust audit in June to August 2014, which indicated that a patient going late to theatre, had the greatest effect on discharge outcomes. Conclusion Recommendations for practice include: the introduction of post-operative nausea and vomiting risk scoring and prophylactic protocols; reorganisation of theatre lists to ensure patients have enough time to recover; and provision of information at pre-assessment, regarding the requirement for a responsible adult escort to take patients home and stay with them for first 24 hours.

GFR in six hours, one, two and three days after PCNL and in the <b>discharge</b> <b>day</b> were calculated and then compared with preoperative level. Correlation between different variables (Perioperative hemorrhage, co-morbidities, previous stone surgery, renal anomaly, number of access, stone burden and location) and risk of acute postoperative renal function impairment (GFR drop greater than 25 %) were assessed. Results: Mean preoperative GFR was 87. 85 ± 29. 41 ml/min/ 1. 73 m which decreased to 86. 18 ± 28. 77, 78. 45 ± 28. 74, 78. 79 ± 26. 94, 84. 24 ± 29. 71 and 86. 18 ± 28. 77 in 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after surgery and <b>discharge</b> <b>day</b> post PCNL, respectively. GFR significantly decreased in one and two days after surgery (p value< 0. 0001 and p value < 0. 05) but returned to near preoperative values in 3 th post PCNL day.
