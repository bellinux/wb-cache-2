40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> of {{buildings}} {{has become a}} significant issue in Latvia and across Europe. More than a half (by heated area) of Latvian housing stock consists of multi-family buildings. 63 % {{of buildings}} are panel houses built during the Soviet era when no one thought about <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> issue and <b>energy</b> resources was very cheap. Today, energy prices are increasing, the EU sets targets to increase <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> reduce of GHG emissions and promote the use of renewables. Building renovation is a sustainable approach for Latvia to achieve these objectives because the housing sector is a huge consumer of energy – 40 % of total energy consumption. A great way to promote such renovations is to use Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) concept. EPC is a legal contract between the beneficiary and the provider (an ESCO) of an <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measure,</b> verified and monitored during the whole term of the contract, where investments (works, supplies or services) in that measure are paid for {{in relation to a}} contractually agreed level of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement.</b> In Latvia, EPC+ contracting has been recently applied to the comprehensive renovation of multi-family residential buildings. A study is being carried out on 12 projects, which have been implemented over the last 5 years. Measurements and calculations have been carried out. Based on 2013 data, on average space heating consumption of fully completed buildings is down to 77 kWh/(m 2 a) and network circulation losses is down to 4. 5 kWh/(m 2 a), meaning a combined figure of 81. 5 kWh/(m 2 a). The energy savings of the renovated building stock are calculated at 55 %.

40|$|Switzerland {{has plans}} to phase out nuclear energy and reduce heat demand by {{improving}} energy efficiency and increased renewable energy use. Industrial Electric Motor Driven Systems (EMDS) offer an interesting focus area for energy efficiency improvements. EMDS consume roughly 68 % of the industrial electricity consumption globally and saving potential estimates of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> vary from 8 - 15 % of the industrial electricity consumption in the EU and US. It is unknown what role <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> play in the Swiss context. Therefore this research has analysed the share contribution of EMDS in the Swiss industry and analysed the cost-effectiveness of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> implemented in the Swiss industry. The results for the share contribution of EMDS in the Swiss context results in a 68 % share of electricity consumption of EMDS in the Swiss industry. Further three EMDS applications contribute roughly {{to a third of}} the industrial electricity consumption. Pump systems are the largest contributor with 18 %, followed by Fan systems that contribute 10 % and finally Compressed air systems contribute 5 %. The cost-effectiveness analysis was done on 195 <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures</b> targeting Industrial EMDS in Switzerland. These measures were retrieved from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) program ProKilowatt (PKW), which is a subsidy incentivized program in order to stimulate the implementation of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>measures.</b> A third of the measures were identified as cost effective but also some extremely costly measures were identified. Categorizing the measures in distinguishable energy efficiency measure categories and calculating the average cost effectiveness resulted in three cost effective categories: ‘Efficient control systems for Compressed air systems’, ‘Efficient control systems for Fans’ and ‘Adding a Variable Speed Drive to a pump’. Nevertheless the results are found in a context of a lot of limitations. There is a huge spread in the cost effectiveness values of most of the categories, proper reference case is missing, Co-benefits are excluded and all measure categories are based on a limited amount of measures. Further for the complete EMDS picture this research is limited to only Pumps, Fans and Compressed air systems. In light of these limitations caution is advised for interpreting these results...|$|E

40|$|The main {{achievement}} of this thesis {{has been the}} development of an operational system dynamics model of the Indonesian energy system. This model attempts to integrate a wide range of data so that policy-makers can understand the connections between economic, environmental and energy policy objectives. This is the first such model to be developed for Indonesia, building on previous modelling efforts that have been restricted to regression-based forecasting and optimisation modelling. The first part of the thesis provides a systematic analysis of background data, information and the context for the model development. These chapters review the historical and political context of energy developments in Indonesia; review past energy policies as well as emerging energy policy objectives; analyse the determinants of energy demand (by regression and divisia decomposition methods) and review energy supply options. The regression analysis concluded that GDP and household income had the most significant effect on energy demand. The effect of fuel price rises, on the other hand, did not exert a significant effect on energy demand. The divisia decomposition method found that, over the entire Indonesian economy, technical change was found to give a greater contribution to <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvements</b> (as <b>measured</b> by the energy:GDP ratio) than structural changes. The system dynamics model was developed and validated using the extensive data collected, refined and analysed {{in the first part of}} the thesis. The model consisted of an economic module (17 sector input-output model), energy demand module, electric power module, heat and transport fuel module, primary energy supply module and an environmental module. Five scenarios were developed from this model in order to analyse possible energy development pathways for Indonesia, over the 1998 - 2020 period. These scenarios reflected five themes Business-as-Usual, Environmentally Beneficial, Economic Efficiency, Self-Sufficiency and Balancing Trade-Offs. These scenarios were assessed using a number of policy evaluation criteria to measure various energy, economic and environmental policy objectives. All of these scenarios indicated that Indonesia's energy demand and hence CO 2 emissions will grow significantly over the scenario period, even if Indonesia introduces some quite stringent polices to restrict these trends - eg, CO 2 emissions are expected to increase by 189 % under the 'Business-as-Usual' scenario; and even though they can be reduced to a 85 % increase under the 'Environmentally Beneficial' scenario, this is still a significant and somewhat alarming increase in CO 2 emissions. The scenarios also highlighted the trade-offs between different sets of policy objectives as an aid to energy planning and policy-making. Finally, further areas of research that could improve the model and its use were identified: improving the data on energy supply and demand (particularly the end-use characterisation), endogenise the economic growth dynamics into the model rather than depending on regression analysis, possibly converting the input-output structure into a computable general equilibrium model, including more sectoral detail, making the model at least partly spatially-specific, and investigating more participatory approaches for further developing the model so as to enhance its uptake...|$|R

Evaluations of Brutalist buildings’ energy related performances have been restricted to anecdotal observations with particular focus on the building type’s poor thermal performance, {{a result of the}} preferred construction method, i. e. monolithic reinforced concrete used as structure, interior finish and exterior finish. A valid criticism, but one that served to dismiss discussion that the possibility of other positive design strategies limiting energy consumption, while simultaneously maintaining occupant comfort, existed in these buildings. The University of Massachusetts-Amherst Fine Arts Center (FAC) designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Kevin Roche, was the Brutalist building used to develop an evaluation protocol that will serve as a template for energy and/or occupant comfort dissections and evaluations of other Brutalist buildings. A calibrated (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140) and validated energy model (DesignBuilder) was programed with all requisites, i. e. geo-position, ordinal orientation, building geometry, envelope materiality, construction details, local weather and climate, program activities, mechanical systems, occupancy schedules, etc. All inputted data was synchronized and consistent with {{the first year of the}} building’s occupancy, 1976. Analyses using the DesignBuilder model and an Autodesk Ecotect Analysis model were performed with results relating to thermal performance of the envelope, daylight harvesting, glare control, siting advantage, solar defense via self-shading, material solar absorptance impacts, thermal mass, and wind related strategies documented.

We estimate annual <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvements</b> of 1. 0 % per annum (p. a.) for the total industry (excluding non-energy use); even though the results are subject to uncertainties due to errors in the energy statistics, we consider them as strong indication that Dutch industry needs to reinforce its efforts in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Based on historical achievements between 1989 and 2008, Business as Usual (BaU) scenarios project annual improvement potentials of 0. 6 – 1. 8 % p. a. until 2040. Based on literature review, this study estimates that implementing energy saving technologies can accelerate <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvements</b> to 2 % p. a. and beyond. Efficient {{combined heat and power}} technologies could increase these potentials further. These are beyond the historical achievements and BaU scenario projections. New policies will be required for technology development which ensures continuous <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>improvements.</b> The findings of this paper need to be extended by continuous monitoring and more scenario analyses with improved data...|$|R
