The primary aim {{of this research was}} to develop a method for determining the true uniaxial tensile strength of concrete by conducting a series of cylinder splitting, modulus of rupture (MOR) and cylinder/cube compression tests. The main objectives were: • Critically reviewing previous published research in order to identify gaps in current knowledge and understanding, including theoretical and methodological contributions to the true uniaxial tensile strength of concrete. In order to maintain consistency and increase the reliability of the proposed methods, it is essential to review the literature to provide additional data points in order to add additional depth, breathe and rigor to Senussi’s investigation (2004). • The design of self compacting concrete (SCC), normal strength concrete (NSC) and high strength concrete (HSC) mixes and undertaking lab-based experimental works for mixing, casting, curing and testing of specimens in order to establish new empirical evidence and data. • Analysing the data, presenting the results, and investigating the application of validity methods as stated by Lin and Raoof (1999) and Senussi (2004). • To draw conclusions including comparison with previous research and literature, including the proposal of new correction factors and recommendations for future research. 29 batches of NSC, 137 batches of HSC, 44 batches of fly ash SCC and 47 batches of GGBS SCC were cast and their hardened and fresh properties were measured. Hardened properties measured included: cylinder splitting strength, MOR, cylinder compressive strength and cube compressive strength. A variety of rheological tests were also applied to characterise the fresh properties of the SCC mixes, including: slump flow, T 50, L-box, V-funnel, J-ring and sieve stability. Cylinders were also visually checked after splitting for segregation. The tensile strength of concrete has traditionally been expressed in terms of its compressive strength (e. g. ft = c × c f). Based on this premise, extensive laboratory testing was conducted to evaluate the tensile strength of the concretes, including the direct tension test and the <b>indirect</b> <b>cylinder</b> splitting and MOR tests. These tests however, do not provide sufficiently accurate results for the true uniaxial tensile strength, due to the results being based upon different test methods. This shortcoming has been overcome by recently developed methods reported by Lin and Raoof (1999) and Senussi (2004) who proposed simple correction factors for the application to the cylinder splitting and MOR test results, with the final outcome providing practically reasonable estimates of the true uniaxial tensile strength of concrete, covering a wide range of concrete compressive strengths 12. 57 ≤ fc ≤ 93. 82 MPa, as well as a wide range of aggregate types. The current investigation has covered a wide range of ages at testing, from 3 to 91 days. Test data from other sources has also been applied for ages up to 365 days, with the test results reported relating to a variety of mix designs. NSC, SCC and HSC data from the current investigation has shown an encouraging correlation with the previously reported results, hence providing additional wider and deeper empirical evidence for the validity of the recommended correction factors. The results have also demonstrated that the type (size, texture and strength) of aggregate has a negligible effect on the recommended correction factors. The concrete age at testing was demonstrated to have a potentially significant effect on the recommended correction factors. Altering the cement type can also {{have a significant effect on}} the hardened properties measured and demonstrated practically noticeable variations on the recommended correction factors. The correction factors proved to be valid regarding the effects of incorporating various blended cements in the HSC and SCC. The NSC, HSC and SCC showed an encouraging correlation with previously reported results, providing additional support, depth, breadth and rigor for the validity of the correction factors recommended...|$|E

In the UK these vessels are called <b>indirect</b> <b>cylinders,</b> or direct cylinders, respectively. Additionally, if these cylinders form part of a sealed system, providing mains-pressure hot water, they are known as unvented cylinders.

40|$|Gravure {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{processes}} for printing on shrink films, the reason being its consistency for longer runs. However, such printing is accompanied by new challenges. The presence of gels, black specks and other contaminations in these films does not allow the surrounding area to print, thus resulting in print void. The occurrence of this defect in a considerable amount or size on the area of interest leads to the rejection of printed stock that involves wastage of inks, solvents and time. The research involves the investigation of the effect of gravure process variables on the minimization of print voids in Shrink PVC film. The gravure process variables viz. viscosity, pressure, speed and hardness were identified for the <b>indirect</b> laser <b>cylinder.</b> It was established that hardness had a significant impact on minimizing the voids, while viscosity-hardness interaction played another important role. The results showed the reduction in void area with lower viscosity, higher pressure, lower speed and higher hardness...|$|R

This paper shows the performance map of indirect diesel engine fuelled with diesel bioethanol emulsion. Experiment {{was carried out}} on two <b>cylinders</b> <b>indirect</b> diesel engine were coupled to eddy current dynamometer. The engine is loaded by the dynamometer, fuel consumption by AVL fuel balance, air consumption by TGS hot wire anemometer, emission analyzer by Horiba Mexa 720 and Sukyoung SY-GA 401, while Okudakoki DSM 240 for smoke level. The experiment is focused on specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and its emissions such as; nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), and the concentration of the exhaust gas (smoke). Test is conducted on 1, 500 rpm, 1, 750 rpm and 2, 000 rpm with gradual load for every 10 Nm from 0 Nm up to 70 Nm. Various percentages of bioethanol in diesel is tested, start from neat diesel fuel (DE 0), diesel fuel with 2. 5 % bioethanol (DE 2. 5), diesel duel with 5 % of bioethanol (DE 5) and DE 10 for diesel fuel with 10 % of bioethanol with 1 % of emulsifier are added. Performance maps are created using software Uniplot. At 83 % full load (10. 81 kW), the BSFC is reduced up to 2. 62 % at 1987 rpm on DE 10 mixture, while at low rotation (1, 481 rpm) DE 2. 5 mixture will increase fuel consumption up to 4. 51 % compared to neat diesel (DE 0). The result of NOX emissions is inconsistent, but the trends are increasing. Trends for CO emission are reduced, maximum reduction up to 71. 43 % at DE 10 and 1987 rpm. The exhaust gas concentration tends to decrease, maximum reduction up to 65. 87 % on DE 10 mixture, 1, 734 rpm and 83 % full load operation. The addition of bioethanol up to 10 % is tends to improve the combustion process at high speed...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{economy is}} affected, both by fuel and engine {{lubricant}} quality. Engine lubricant quality plays {{a vital role}} in reduction of fuel consumption by effective reduction of friction between the contact surfaces of engine parts (piston ring assembly, bearings and valve train). Engine components are exposed to various lubrication regimes such as hydrodynamic, elasto-hydrodynamic, boundary and mixed lubrication during engine operation. In each of these regimes, the factors which influence engine friction are different. Hydrodynamic friction is influenced by lubricant rheology, film thickness and sliding speed of interacting surfaces, whereas boundary and elasto-hydrodynamic friction is a function of surface properties like roughness and hardness and the type of friction modifier used in engine lubricant. So the principal factors which influence engine friction power are speed, load, and surface topography of engine components, oil viscosity, oil temperature and type of friction modifiers used. It is generally accepted that both the piston assembly and bearings are predominantly in the hydrodynamic lubrication regime, whereas the valve train is in the mixed/boundary lubrication regime. Hydrodynamic friction is proportional to sliding velocity of a pair, oil film thickness, operating temperature, lubricant viscosity and many other physical parameters. To investigate the effect of engine lubricant viscosity on friction characteristics and fuel consumption of a heavy duty and light duty diesel engine, an experimental study was carried out on a 4 -cylinder, Direct Injection off-highway, heavy-duty, diesel engine and 4 - <b>cylinder</b> <b>indirect</b> injection, light duty diesel engine coupled with the appropriate eddy current dynamometers and instrumented with fuel consumption measurement unit, pressure sensor, angle encoder, speed sensor, temperature indicators, data acquisition system etc, to measure the fuel consumption, power/torque etc. Two engine lubricants were selected for both types of engine {{in such a way that}} both lubricants were of same performance category but having different viscosity grade. For DI diesel engine SAE 20 W- 50 and SAE 10 W- 30 engine lubricant complying with API CG- 4 were chosen, whereas for IDI diesel engine SAE 15 W- 40 and SAE 5 W- 30 engine lubricants complying with API CF- 4 were selected. It is to be noted that recommended engine oil was taken as baseline lubricant for the friction and fuel consumption study. Test results in terms of friction mean effective pressure (FMEP), friction power, fuel consumption (g/kWh) were analyzed for DI heavy duty diesel engine for both engine lubricants. Whereas test results in terms of fuel consumption and Fuel Efficiency (...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} need for bio-diesel and analyse bio-diesel against its {{counterpart}} being petroleum diesel. Both, performance and emissions of an internal combustion engine (ICE) using bio-diesel and bio-diesel blends are experimentally measured for two types of bio-diesel, type A - 80 % tallow (beef, pork and sheep) and 20 % canola oil methyl ester and type B - 70 % chicken tallow and 30 % waste cooking oil methyl ester. The test was done according to the ISO 8178 standard for emissions analysis of off-road engines. Kubota V 3300 <b>indirect</b> injection, four <b>cylinders</b> naturally aspirated ICE {{was used to evaluate}} the performance and emissions of test fuels. Bio-diesel blends of B 5, B 10, B 20, B 50 and B 100 are analysed. Bio-diesel properties such as density, viscosity, calorific value, and cetane number, etc have significant impact on performances and emissions. This study found that the performance of both biodiesel fuels reduces with increasing blend ratio, with a torque decrease of 5 % for both biodiesels, and a fuel consumption increase of 7 - 10 % over the ISO 8178 test cycle. This {{can be attributed to the}} lower energy content of biodiesel when compared with petroleum diesel. The emissions results were varied for the biodiesels, as some emissions were found to be higher than petroleum diesel, while some were lower. NOx emissions decreased by 14 % for biodiesel A, but increased by 17 % for biodiesel B. CO emissions were significantly reduced for both biodiesel A and B, with reductions of 58 % and 27 % respectively. Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were found to increase with increasing blend ratio for both biodiesels, with an increase of 10 % for biodiesel A and 80 % for biodiesel B. Lastly, CO 2 emissions were found to increase, with an increase of 6 % for biodiesel A and 18 % for biodiesel B. The study clearly found that each of the biodiesels has different scale ofeffect on ICE performance and emissions and hence, it is essential to test biodiesels before it can be recommended for commercial use in ICE. However, the study indicates that although performance is reduced when using biodiesel fuels the two major pollutant gas emissions are generally reduced when using biodiesel, therefore biodiesel can be considered as more environmentally friendly, secure and renewable approach of obtaining energy in the long run...|$|R
