2500|$|A puzzling {{aspect of}} BTV is its {{survival}} between midge seasons in temperate regions. Adult Culicoides {{are killed by}} cold winter temperatures, and BTV infections typically do not last for more than 60 days, which is not long enough for BTV to last until the next spring. It is believed that the virus somehow survives in overwintering midges or animals. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed. [...] A few adult Culicoides midges infected with BTV may survive the mild winters of the temperate zone. [...] Some midges may even move indoors to avoid the cold temperature of the winter. [...] Additionally, BTV could cause a chronic or latent infection in some animals, providing another means for BTV to survive the winter. [...] BTV can also be transmitted from mother to fetus. [...] The outcome is abortion or stillbirth if <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> occurs early in gestation and survival if infection occurs late. [...] However infection at an intermediate stage, before the fetal immune system is fully developed, {{may result in a}} chronic infection that lingers until the first months after birth of the lamb. Midges will then spread the pathogen from the calves to other animals, starting a new season of infection.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{maternal}} infections with coxsackievirus {{during pregnancy}} are relatively common, <b>fetal</b> <b>infections</b> are quite rare. Coxsackievirus infection in utero {{has been associated}} with myocarditis, but has not been proven a teratogen. Case: A patient whose fetus had structural cardiac anomalies and hydrops was found to have an intrauterine infection with Coxsackie B- 1 virus, proven by virus isolation from the amniotic fluid. This infection led to increasing intrauterine hydrops and subsequent neonatal death.

40|$|Renal {{dysplasia}} {{is defined}} as a condition of disorganised development of renal parenchyma due to abnormal differentiation. The case of a 5 -month-old intact male Norwegian Forest Cat with a history of polyuria and polydipsia is reported. Ultrasonographic examination showed a slight enlargement of kidneys. Biochemical parameters, haematological examinations and clinical signs were compatible with chronic renal failure (CRF). Histological examination was correlated with a primary tubular disorganisation and modification of glomerular compartment. The clinical history together with the histological lesions is consistent with bilateral juvenile renal dysplasia in this cat.

50|$|When a {{pregnant}} woman is diagnosed with acute toxoplasmosis, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} determine whether the fetus has been infected or not. When {{a pregnant}} woman develops acute toxoplasmosis, the tachyzoites have approximately a 30% chance of entering the placental tissue, and from there entering and infecting the fetus. As gestational age at the time of infection increases, the chance of <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> also increases.|$|E
50|$|The rash {{and pain}} usually subside within {{three to five}} weeks, but about one in five people develop a painful {{condition}} called postherpetic neuralgia, which {{is often difficult to}} manage. In some people, shingles can reactivate presenting as zoster sine herpete: pain radiating along the path of a single spinal nerve (a dermatomal distribution), but without an accompanying rash. This condition may involve complications that affect several levels of the nervous system and cause many cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, or aseptic meningitis. Other serious effects that may occur in some cases include partial facial paralysis (usually temporary), ear damage, or encephalitis. During pregnancy, first infections with VZV, causing chickenpox, may lead to infection of the fetus and complications in the newborn, but chronic infection or reactivation in shingles are not associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Porcine {{parvovirus}} (PPV) causes reproductive {{failure of}} swine characterized by embryonic and <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> and death, {{usually in the}} absence of outward maternal clinical signs. The disease develops mainly when seronegative dams are exposed oronasally to the virus anytime during about the first half of gestation, and conceptuses are subsequently infected transplacentally before they become immunocompetent. There is no definitive evidence that infection of swine other than during gestation is of any clinical or economic significance. The virus is ubiquitous among swine throughout the world and is enzootic in most herds that have been tested. Diagnostic surveys have indicated that PPV is the major infectious cause of embryonic and fetal death. In addition to its direct causal role in reproductive failure, PPV can potentiate the effects of porcine circovirus type II (PCV2) infection in the clinical course of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).|$|E

40|$|Neurospecific enolase is an endoenzyme of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) present in neurons of the brain and {{peripheral}} neuraltissue.

A high level of neurospecific enolase in children with infectious and inflammatory diseases is not only the marker of damage to blood-brain barrier, but also reflects the nature of damage (hypoxia, intoxication, inflammation).

40|$|The incidences of {{congenital}} toxoplasmosis in Fischer rats infected between the 8 th and 12 th days of pregnancy {{with three different}} strains of Toxoplasma gondii (RH, 76 K, and Prugniaud) were 58. 2, 35. 2, and 62. 8 %, respectively. No infected fetuses were collected from rats previously infected with RH or Prugniaud strain parasites, even if the rats were reinfected during pregnancy. Since pups from chronically infected mothers are protected from {{congenital toxoplasmosis}}, rat infection could thus constitute a relevant model for immunological studies and vaccine design. Toxoplasmosis is a widespread infection caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii (8).

40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) impacts global swine production, is {{economically}} important, and {{is associated}} with multiple disease entities that include multisystemic disease, wasting, pneumonia, diarrhea and reproductive failure. Transmission of PCV 2 within or between swine populations is not well understood. We characterized semen shedding of PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b in Landrace boars and found that PCV 2 viremia precedes semen shedding, clinical signs are absent, and peak PCV 2 semen shedding occurs between 10 - 20 days post-infection. PCV 2 can be continuously shed in semen for at least 90 days. We determined that PCV 2 shed in semen is infectious when used in a swine bioassay model, but dam or <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> after artificial insemination with PCV 2 positive extended semen does not necessarily occur. However, when nayve dams were artificially inseminated with PCV 2 -spiked semen, dam viremia and <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> occurred. Nayve dams inseminated with spiked semen did not show clinical signs of infection after PCV 2 exposure, but increased numbers of mummified and stillborn fetuses were observed.

Using the PCV 2 -spiked semen model, we compared dam immunity associated with PCV 2 vaccination to immunity associated with a previous infection to induce protection against subsequent PCV 2 -challenge. PCV 2 antibodies induced by a homologous strain of PCV 2 protected against in utero infection; however, 63 % of the piglets from vaccinated dams were PCV 2 viremic at birth suggesting that commercial vaccines may not prevent <b>fetal</b> <b>infection.</b> We also verified that PCV 2 vaccination of dams is not protective against <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> following oro-nasal challenge during gestation, and affirmed that immunocompetent in utero fetuses are able to clear PCV 2 infection prior to parturition...|$|E
50|$|The initial hypoxia (decreased oxygen flow) or {{ischemia}} (decreased blood flow) {{can occur}} {{for a number}} of reasons. Fetal blood vessels are thin-walled structures, and {{it is likely that the}} vessels providing nutrients to the periventricular region cannot maintain a sufficient blood flow during episodes of decreased oxygenation during development. Additionally, hypotension resulting from fetal distress or cesarean section births can lead to decreased blood and oxygen flow to the developing brain. These hypoxic-ischemic incidents can cause damage to the blood brain barrier (BBB), a system of endothelial cells and glial cells that regulates the flow of nutrients to the brain. A damaged BBB can contribute to even greater levels of hypoxia. Alternatively, damage to the BBB can occur due to maternal <b>infection</b> during <b>fetal</b> development, <b>fetal</b> <b>infections,</b> or infection of the newly delivered infant.

We sought the three by PCR, and MCPyV also by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), from 535 fetal autopsy samples (heart, liver, placenta) from intrauterine fetal deaths (IUFDs) (N = 169), miscarriages (120) or induced abortions (246). We also measured the MCPyV IgG antibodies in the corresponding maternal sera (N = 462) mostly from the first trimester. Results No sample showed KIPyV or WUPyV DNA. Interestingly, one placenta was reproducibly PCR positive for MCPyV. Among the 462 corresponding pregnant women, 212 (45. 9 %) were MCPyV IgG seropositive.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is {{the most}} common cause of congenital virus infection. Congenital HCMV infection occurs in 0. 2 – 1 % of all births, and causes birth defects and developmental abnormalities, including sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay. Several key studies have established the guinea pig as a tractable model for the study of congenital HCMV infection and have shown that polyclonal antibodies can be protective [1 – 3]. In this study, we demonstrate that an anti-guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) glycoprotein H/glycoprotein L neutralizing monoclonal antibody protects against <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> and loss in the guinea pig. Furthermore, we have delineated the kinetics of GPCMV congenital infection, from maternal infection (salivary glands, seroconversion, placenta) to <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> (fetus and amniotic fluid).

40|$|The {{initial stages}} of {{infection}} of pregnant mice at gestation day 11 with either the T 48 strain of Ross River virus or avirulent Semliki Forest virus are similar. With both infections, a hematogenous spread of virus to the placenta occurs. The viruses subsequently replicate to high titer in all placentas {{and are able to}} persist in the presence of specific maternal antiviral antibodies. There is a delay of at least 1 to 2 days between the initial detection of virus in the placenta and the onset of <b>fetal</b> <b>infection.</b> With Semliki Forest virus, abortion occurred in all mothers and appeared to be preceded by infection of all fetuses. However, when Semliki Forest virus was given at other stages of pregnancy, abortion was less common, and in all non-aborted pregnancies at least one uninfected fetus was observed. This situation was similar to that with Ross River virus, in which abortion was not observed and <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> and death were only seen in a proportion of fetuses. Within each pregnancy, the outcome of the two in utero infections appeared to result from similar mechanisms, with the fate of an individual fetus depending upon the timing of the passive transfer of anti-viral immunoglobulin G from the mother relative to the timing of <b>fetal</b> <b>infection</b> by virus from the placenta.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes has a well-characterized {{ability to}} cross the placental barrier, {{resulting}} in spontaneous abortion and <b>fetal</b> <b>infections.</b> However, the mechanisms resulting in infection-associated abortion are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the dephosphorylation of MAPK family proteins caused by L. monocytogenes infection of trophoblast giant (TG) cells, which are placental immune cells, contributes to infectious abortion. Dephosphorylation of c-Jun, p 38, and ERK 1 / 2 was observed in infected TG cells, causing the downregulation of cytoprotective heme oxygenase (HO) - 1. Blocking the dephosphorylation of proteins, including MAPK family proteins, inhibited the decrease in HO- 1 expression. Treatment with MAPK inhibitors inhibited bacterial internalization into TG cells. Moreover, Toll-like receptor 2 involved in the expression of MAPK family proteins. Infection with a listeriolysin O-deleted mutant impaired dephosphorylation of MAPK family proteins in TG cells and did not induce infectious abortion in a mouse model. These results suggest that inactivation of the MAPK pathway by L. monocytogenes induces TG cell death and causes infectious abortion...|$|R
40|$|Inflammation and {{maternal}} or <b>fetal</b> <b>infections</b> {{have been suggested}} as risk factors for schizo-phrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). It is likely that such environmental effects are contin-gent on genetic background. Here, in a genome-wide approach, we test the hypothesis that such exposures increase the risk for SZ and BP and that the increase is dependent on genet-ic variants. We use genome-wide genotype data, plasma IgG antibody measurements against Toxoplasma gondii, Herpes simplex virus type 1, Cytomegalovirus, Human Herpes Virus 6 and the food antigen gliadin as well as measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), a peripheral marker of inflammation. The subjects are SZ cases, BP cases, parents of cases and screened controls. We look for higher levels of our immunity/infection variables and inter-actions between them and common genetic variation genome-wide. We find many of the anti-body measurements higher in both disorders. While individual tests do not withstand correction for multiple comparisons, the number of nominally significant tests and the compar-isons showing the expected direction are in significant excess (permutation p= 0. 019 and 0. 004 respectively).
