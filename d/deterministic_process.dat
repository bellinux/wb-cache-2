In this study, the microbial interactions and their succession in the anaerobic digestion process were investigated at three levels, represented by (1) present and (2) active microorganisms, and (3) gene expressions under a temperature gradient from 25 to 55 C. Network topological features indicated a global variation in microbial interactions at different temperatures. The variations of microbial interactions in terms of network modularity and <b>deterministic</b> <b>processes</b> based on topological features, corresponded well with the variations of methane productions, but not with temperatures. A common successional pattern of microbial interactions was observed at different temperatures, which showed that both <b>deterministic</b> <b>processes</b> and network modularity increased over time during the digestion process.

50|$|In {{probability}} theory, a {{stochastic process}} , or sometimes random process, is the counterpart to a <b>deterministic</b> <b>process</b> (or deterministic system).
