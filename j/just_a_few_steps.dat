2500|$|The Colonna family {{suffered}} a major disaster, when Pompeo's uncle, Prospero Colonna, was defeated and captured at Battle of Marignano on 14 September 1515. [...] Prospero {{had been the}} leading general of the Sforza of Milan, and had been leading a force of Milanese and Papal troops, along with the Swiss, against the Genoese, who were reinforced by the French, led by the young King Francis I and the Chevalier Bayard. [...] Prospero was defeated, captured, and deported to France. [...] Bishop Pompeo Colonna made the journey to France to effect his release. Travelling {{in the middle of}} the winter of 1515-1516, he was caught in an avalanche which engulfed an embassy from Sion <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> in front of him. Reaching France, he spent six months until the French king made a decision. King Francis, meditating on a plan to reclaim the Angevin kingdom of Naples, and realizing that he would need the friendly cooperation of the Pope and assistance in the Papal States, generously agreed to release Prospero Colonna, on the condition that Prospero agree in writing to serve under Francis' banner. [...] Having reached Italy, however, Prospero began to raise troops to put at the disposal of Charles V at the siege of Verona. Prospero sent his nephew Pompeo on an embassy to the Emperor Maximilian and King Charles, and charged him with winning over King Ferdinand, Max's grandson. In this he was successful. Ferdinand provided Pompeo with money, and he proceeded through Germany to Bruxelles, where he engaged in discussions with Prince Charles, who was then Duke of Burgundy and an Austrian Archduke. [...] He was then recalled to Rome by his uncle.|$|E
2500|$|The series utilises several {{techniques}} {{from the}} stage and theatre and converting them to the screen. [...] The series frequently breaks the fourth wall (purposely...and, usually, at least once per episode), as well as employing other stylised, cinematic devices such as cutaway scenes shot in a different style {{from the rest of}} the show. For example, in several episodes characters appear to [...] "stop time", interacting with other actors that remain frozen in place, while key members of the cast announce their intentions to us (the audience) or further develop their [...] "con" [...] between themselves and other characters by discussing plans with either each other—or even themselves; while certain members freeze in place, others of the cast are free to move around the set and drink other peoples drinks and pilfer other peoples pockets and the like. [...] This technique serves many purposes—chiefly of which is a stylistic approach to theater, but it can also be said that it is used here as a metaphor for how the main characters of this drama can manipulate their environment at will—as opposed to average individuals who, most of the time, remain oblivious to what is going on around them. Examples of this can be seen in the pilot episode ("The Con Is On"), the first episode of the second series ("Gold Mine") and the second episode of the fourth series ("Signing Up to Wealth"). Other fourth-wall-breaking moments are more subtle – a character might smile directly at the camera as the con begins to take shape, or an actor may make an editorial comment to the viewers, or they might even wink at us...as if we are in on it with them, or they are letting us in on a secret. Some episodes insert fantasy sequences – scenes shot like a Bollywood musical or a silent movie, for example, all well-known cinematic style choices used to elicit emotions or mood from the audience in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>steps</b> that might, otherwise, take up pages of dialogue in order to accomplish.|$|E

40|$|Proteases are {{implicated in}} various {{diseases}} and several {{have been identified}} as potential drug targets or biomarkers. As a result, protease activity assays that can be performed in high throughput are essential for the screening of inhibitors in drug discovery programs. Here we describe the development of a simple, general method for the characterization of protease activity and its use for inhibitor screening. GFP was genetically fused to a comparatively unstable Tus protein through an interdomain linker containing a specially designed protease site, which can be proteolyzed. When this Tus–GFP fusion protein substrate is proteolyzed it releases GFP, which remains in solution after a short heat denaturation and centrifugation step used to eliminate uncleaved Tus–GFP. Thus, the increase in GFP fluorescence is directly proportional to protease activity. We validated the protease activity assay with three different proteases, i. e., trypsin, caspase 3, and neutrophil elastase, and demonstrated that {{it can be used to}} determine protease activity and the effect of inhibitors with small sample volumes in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> simple <b>steps</b> using <b>a</b> fluorescence plate reader...|$|R

30|$|A typical Nyx {{simulation}} evolves a cosmology {{from high}} redshift (z > 100) {{to the present}} (z = 0) in many thousands of time steps. The size of each time step {{is limited by the}} standard CFL condition for the baryonic fluid, as well as by a quasi-CFL constraint imposed on the dark matter particles, and additionally by the evolution of the scale factor a in the Friedmann equation; details of these constraints are described in Almgren et al. (2013). Currently the largest Nyx simulations are run on a 4, 096 ^ 3 grid, and at this scale each plotfile at a single time step is ∼ 4 TiB, with checkpoint files being even larger; a complete data set for a single simulation therefore reaches well into the petascale regime. A single simulation can therefore fill up a typical user allocation of scratch disk space (O(10) TiB) in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> time <b>steps.</b> We see then that modern simulation data sets represent a daunting challenge for both analysis and storage using current supercomputing technologies.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the {{performance}} of binary classifiers based on Boosted Random Ferns can be significantly improved by appropri-ately bootstrapping the training step. This results in a classifier which is both highly discriminative and computationally efficient and is particu-larly suitable when only small sets of training images are available. During the learning process, a small set of labeled images is used to train the boosting binary classifier. The classifier is then evaluated over the training set and warped versions of the classified and misclassified patches are progressively added into {{the positive and negative}} sample sets for a new re-training step. In this paper we thoroughly study the conditions under which this bootstrapping scheme improves the detection rates. In particular we assess the quality of detection both {{as a function of the}} number of bootstrapping iterations and the size of the training set. We compare our algorithm against state-of-the-art approaches for several databases including faces, cars, motorbikes and horses, and show remarkable improvements in detection rates with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> bootstrapping <b>steps.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} has {{the potential}} to bring high performance computing capabilities to the average science researcher. However, in order {{to take full advantage of}} cloud capabilities, the science data used in the analysis must often be reorganized. This typically involves sharding the data across multiple nodes to enable relatively fine-grained parallelism. This can be either via cloud-based file systems or cloud-enabled databases such as Cassandra, Rasdaman or SciDB. Since storing an extra copy of data leads to increased cost and data management complexity, NASA is interested in determining the benefits and costs of various cloud analytics methods for real Earth Observation cases. Accordingly, NASA's Earth Science Technology Office and Earth Science Data and Information Systems project have teamed with cloud analytics practitioners to run a benchmark comparison on cloud analytics methods using the same input data and analysis algorithms. We have particularly looked at analysis algorithms that work over long time series, because these are particularly intractable for many Earth Observation datasets which typically store data with one or <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> time <b>steps</b> per file.

40|$|In this paper, the {{so-called}} 'continuous adjoint-direct approach' is used within the truncated Newton algorithm for the optimization of aerodynamic shapes, using the Euler equations. It {{is known that}} the direct differentiation (DD) of the flow equations {{with respect to the}} design variables, followed by the adjoint approach, {{is the best way to}} compute the exact matrix, for use along with the Newton optimization method. In contrast to this, in this paper, the adjoint approach followed by the DD of both the flow and adjoint equations (i. e. the other way round) is proved to be the most efficient way to compute the product of the Hessian matrix with any vector required by the truncated Newton algorithm, in which the Newton equations are solved iteratively by means of the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Using numerical experiments, it is demonstrated that <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> CG <b>steps</b> per Newton iteration are enough. Considering that the cost of solving either the adjoint or the DD equations is approximately equal to that of solving the flow equations, the cost per Newton iteration scales linearly with the (small) number of CG steps, rather than the (much higher, in large-scale problems) number of design variables. By doing so, the curse of dimensionality is alleviated, as shown in a number of applications related to the inverse design of ducts or cascade airfoils for inviscid flows. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse, after {{clinical}} experience with a series of patients with established diagnoses and review of the literature, all relevant anamnestic features in order to build a simple diagnostic algorithm for vertigo in childhood. This study is a retrospective chart review. A series of 37 children underwent complete clinical and instrumental vestibular examination. Only neurological disorders or genetic diseases represented exclusion criteria. All diagnoses were reviewed after applying the most recent diagnostic guidelines. In our experience, the most common aetiology for dizziness is vestibular migraine (38 %), followed by acute labyrinthitis/neuritis (16 %) and somatoform vertigo (16 %). Benign paroxysmal vertigo was diagnosed in 4 patients (11 %) and paroxysmal torticollis was diagnosed in a 1 -year-old child. In 8 % (3 patients) of cases, the dizziness had a post-traumatic origin: 1 canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal and 2 labyrinthine concussions, respectively. Menière's disease was diagnosed in 2 cases. A bilateral vestibular failure of unknown origin caused chronic dizziness in 1 patient. In conclusion, this algorithm could represent a good tool for guiding clinical suspicion to correct diagnostic assessment in dizzy children where no neurological findings are detectable.
