IPCC authors concluded that the global mean <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> for doubling [...] (to a concentration of 560 ppmv), or equilibrium climate sensitivity, very likely is greater than 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and likely to lie in the range 2 to 4.5 °C (4 to 8.1 °F), with a most likely value of about 3 °C (5 °F). For fundamental physical reasons, as well as data limitations, the IPCC states a climate sensitivity higher than 4.5 °C (8.1 °F) cannot be ruled out, but that agreement for these values with observations and [...] "proxy" [...] climate data is generally worse compared to values in the 2 to 4.5 °C (4 to 8.1 °F) range.|$|E

The likelihood of avoiding a given threshold for DAI depends in part on uncertainty in the climate system, notably, the range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity. We combine a set of probabilistic global average temperature metrics for DAI with probability distributions of future climate change produced from a combination of several published climate sensitivity distributions and a range of proposed concentration stabilization profiles differing in both stabilization level and approach trajectory, including overshoot profiles. These analyses present a “likelihood framework” to differentiate future emissions pathways with regard to their potential for preventing DAI. Our analysis of overshoot profiles in comparison with non-overshoot profiles demonstrates that overshoot of a given stabilization target can significantly increase the likelihood of exceeding “dangerous” climate impact thresholds, even though <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> in our model is identical for non-overshoot concentration stabilization profiles having the same target...|$|E
40|$|The future {{climate change}} {{projections}} are essentially based on coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulations, which give a distinct global warming pattern with arctic winter amplification, an <b>equilibrium</b> land-sea <b>warming</b> contrast and an inter-hemispheric warming gradient. While these simulations {{are the most}} important tool of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions, the conceptual understanding of these predicted structures of climate change and the causes of their uncertainties is very difficult to reach if only based on these highly complex CGCM simulations. In the study presented here we will introduce a very simple, globally resolved energy balance (GREB) model, which is capable of simulating the main characteristics of global warming. The model shall give a bridge between the strongly simplified energy balance models and the fully coupled 4 -dimensional complex CGCMs. It provides a fast tool for the conceptual understanding and development of hypotheses for climate change studies, which shall build a basis or starting point for more detailed studies of observations and CGCM simulations. It is based on the surface energy balance by very simple representations of solar and thermal radiation, the atmospheric hydrological cycle, sensible turbulent heat flux, transport by the mean atmospheric circulation and heat exchange with the deeper ocean. Despite some limitations in the representations of the basic processes, the models climate sensitivity and the spatial structure of the warming pattern are within the uncertainties of the IPCC models simulations. It is capable of simulating aspects of the arctic winter amplification, the <b>equilibrium</b> land-sea <b>warming</b> contrast and the inter-hemispheric warming gradient with good agreement to the IPCC models in amplitude and structure. The results give some insight into the understanding of the land-sea contrast and the polar amplification. The GREB model suggests that the regional inhomogeneous distribution of atmospheric water vapor and the non-linear sensitivity of the downward thermal radiation to changes in the atmospheric water vapor concentration partly cause the land-sea contrast and may also contribute to the polar amplification.

40|$|How can {{dangerous}} {{interference with}} the climate system be avoided? Science can help decision-makers answer this political question. Earlier publications {{have focused on the}} probability of keeping global mean temperature change below certain thresholds by stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at particular levels. We compare the results of such “stabilization profiles” with a set of “peaking profiles” that reduce emissions further after stabilization and thus result in a concentration peak. Given the inertia in the climate system, stabilization profiles lead to ongoing warming beyond 2100 until the temperature reaches <b>equilibrium.</b> This <b>warming</b> partly can be prevented for peaking profiles. In this way, these profiles can increase the likelihood of achieving temperature thresholds by 10 – 20 % compared with the likelihood for the associated stabilization profiles. Because the additional mitigation efforts and thus costs for peaking profiles lie mainly beyond 2100, peaking profiles achieving temperature thresholds with the same likelihood as the original stabilization profile, but at considerably lower cost (up to 40 %), can be identified. The magnitude of the cost reductions depends on the assumptions on discounting.

40|$|Poleward {{shifts of}} the extratropical {{atmospheric}} circulation {{are a common}} response to CO 2 forcing in global climate models (GCMs), but {{little is known about}} the time dependence of this response. Here it is shown that in coupled climate models, the long-term evolution of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) induces two distinct time scales of circulation response to step-like CO 2 forcing. In most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 GCMs as well as in the multi-model mean, all of the poleward shift of the midlatitude jets and Hadley cell edge occurs in a fast response within 5 to 10 years of the forcing, during which less than half of the expected <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> is realized. Compared with this fast response, the slow response over subsequent decades to centuries features stronger polar amplification (especially in the Antarctic), enhanced warming in the Southern Ocean, an El Nino-like pattern of tropical Pacific warming, and weaker land-sea contrast. Atmosphere-only GCM experiments demonstrate that the SST evolution drives the difference between the fast and slow circulation responses, although the direct radiative effect of CO 2 also contributes to the fast response. It is further shown that the fast and slow responses determine the long-term evolution of the circulation response to warming in the RCP 4. 5 scenario. The results imply that shifts in midlatitude circulation generally scale with the radiative forcing, rather than with global-mean temperature change. A corollary is that time slices taken from a transient simulation at a given level of warming will considerably overestimate the extratropical circulation response in a stabilized climate...|$|E

Here, data are combined from the 1985 – 96 Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) with surface temperature change information and estimates of radiative forcing to diagnose the climate sensitivity. Importantly, the estimate is completely independent of climate model results. A climate feedback parameter of 2. 3 � 1. 4 Wm � 2 K � 1 is found. This corresponds to a 1. 0 – 4. 1 -K range for the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> due to a doubling of carbon dioxide (assuming Gaussian errors in observable parameters, which is approximately equivalent to a uniform “prior ” in feedback parameter). The uncertainty range is due to a combination of the short time period for the analysis as well as uncertainties in the surface temperature time series and radiative forcing time series, mostly the former. Radiative forcings may not all be fully accounted for; however, an argument is presented that the estimate of climate sensitivity is still likely to be representative of longer-term climate change. The methodology can be used to 1) retrieve shortwave and longwave components of climate feedback and 2) suggest clear-sky and cloud feedback terms.

40|$|When {{a planet}} is in {{radiative}} equilibrium, the incoming solar flux balances the outgoing longwave flux. If something were to perturb the system slightly, say the incoming solar flux increased, the planet would respond by radiating {{at a higher}} surface temperature. Since any radiation that comes in must go out, if the incoming is increased, the outgoing must also increase, and this increase manifests itself as a <b>warmer</b> <b>equilibrium</b> temperature. The increase in solar flux would correspond {{to an increase in}} temperature, which would increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere due to increased evaporation. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, it would absorb more radiation in the atmosphere leading to a yet <b>warmer</b> <b>equilibrium</b> temperature. The planet would reach radiative equilibrium at this new temperature. There exists a point, however, past which this positive feedback leads to a "runaway" situation. In this case, the planet does not simply evaporate a little more water and eventually come to a slightly higher equilibrium temperature. Instead, the planet keeps evaporating more and more water until all of the planet's available liquid and solid water is in the atmosphere. The reason for this is generally understood. If the planet's temperature increases, evaporation of water increases, and the absorption of radiation increases. This increases the temperature and the feedback continues until all water is in the atmosphere. The resulting equilibrium temperature is very high, much higher than the equilibrium temperature of a point with slightly lower solar flux. One can picture that as solar flux increases, planetary temperature also increases until the runaway point where temperature suddenly "jumps" to a higher value, in response to all the available water now residing in the atmosphere.

Reducing diesel emissions could mitigate near-term climate change with significant co-benefits. This study quantifies the global and regional climate impacts of BC and co-emitted short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) from present-day on-road diesel vehicles, as well as future impacts following a current legislation emission scenario. Atmospheric concentrations are calculated by the chemical transport model OsloCTM 2. The following radiative forcing (RF) and equilibrium surface temperature responses are estimated. For year 2010 on-road diesel emissions we estimate a global-mean direct RF from BC of 44 mW/m 2 and an equilibrium surface temperature response of 59 mK, including the impact of BC deposition on snow. Accounting for cooling and warming impacts of co-emitted SLCFs results in a net global-mean RF and warming of 28 mW/m 2 and 48 mK, respectively. Using the concept of Regional Temperature change Potential (RTP), we find significant geographical differences in the responses to regional emissions. Accounting for the vertical sensitivities of the forcing/response relation amplifies these differences. In terms of individual source regions, emissions in Europe give the largest regional contribution to <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> caused by year 2010 on-road diesel BC, while Russia is most important for Arctic warming per unit emission. The largest contribution to warming caused by the year 2050 on-road diesel sector is from emissions in South Asia, followed by East Asia and the Middle East. Hence, in regions where current legislation is not sufficient to outweigh the expected growth in activity, accelerated policy implementation is important for further future mitigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{increase in}} the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) since the preindustrial era has most likely committed the world to a warming of 2. 4 °C (1. 4 °C to 4. 3 °C) above the preindustrial surface temperatures. The committed warming is inferred from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of the greenhouse forcing and climate sensitivity. The estimated warming of 2. 4 °C is the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> above preindustrial temperatures that the world will observe even if GHG concentrations are held fixed at their 2005 concentration levels but without any other anthropogenic forcing such as the cooling effect of aerosols. The range of 1. 4 °C to 4. 3 °C in the committed warming overlaps and surpasses the currently perceived threshold range of 1 °C to 3 °C for dangerous anthropogenic interference {{with many of the}} climate-tipping elements such as the summer arctic sea ice, Himalayan–Tibetan glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. IPCC models suggest that ≈ 25 % (0. 6 °C) of the committed warming has been realized as of now. About 90 % or more {{of the rest of the}} committed warming of 1. 6 °C will unfold during the 21 st century, determined by the rate of the unmasking of the aerosol cooling effect by air pollution abatement laws and by the rate of release of the GHGs-forcing stored in the oceans. The accompanying sea-level rise can continue for more than several centuries. Lastly, even the most aggressive CO 2 mitigation steps as envisioned now can only limit further additions to the committed warming, but not reduce the already committed GHGs warming of 2. 4 °C...|$|E
40|$|A new Earth {{system model}} of {{intermediate}} complexity, LOVECLIM, {{has been developed}} in order to study long-term future climate changes. In particular, LOVECLIM includes an interactive Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet model (AGISM) {{as well as an}} oceanic carbon cycle model (LOCH). Those climatic components can have a great impact on future climate. However, most studies investigating future climate changes do not take them into account. The few studies in recent literature assessing the impact of polar ice sheets on future climate draw very different conclusions, which shows the need for developing such a model. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the possible perturbations of climate induced by human activities over the next millennia. A particular attention is given to the evolution of the oceanic thermohaline circulation. A series of numerical simulations have been performed with LOVECLIM over the next millennia using various forcing scenarios. The global <b>equilibrium</b> <b>warming</b> computed by the model ranges from 0. 55 °C to 3. 75 °C with respect to preindustrial times. The model does not simulate a complete shut down of the oceanic thermohaline circulation but a transient weakening followed by a quasi-recovering at equilibrium. In most of the projections, the Greenland ice sheet undergoes a continuous reduction in volume, leading to an almost total disappearance in the most pessimistic scenarios. The impact of the Greenland deglaciation on climate has been assessed through sensitivity experiments. The removal of the Greenland ice sheet is responsible for a regional amplification of the global warming inducing a total melt of Arctic sea ice in summer. The freshwater flux from Greenland generates large salinity anomalies in the North Atlantic Ocean that reduce the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, slowing down the oceanic thermohaline circulation.

40|$|We {{consider}} the dynamical evolution of an interstellar cloud that is initially in thermal <b>equilibrium</b> in the <b>warm</b> phase and is then {{subjected to a}} sudden increase in the pressure of its surroundings. We find that if the initial plasma beta of the cloud is of order unity, {{then there is a}} considerable period during which the material in the cloud both has a small beta and is in the thermally unstable temperature range. These conditions are not only consistent with observations of star forming regions, but are also ideally suited to the production of density inhomogeneities by magnetohydrodynamic waves. The end result should be a cloud whose size and average density are typical of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) and which contains denser regions whose densities are in the range inferred for the translucent clumps in GMCs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to quantify the economic effects of introducing carbon-reduction policies in the European Union (EU). For this purpose, we use linked applied general equilibrium (AGE) models for 11 EU member countries. This method enables us to measure the change in competitiveness for domestic industries; the effect on growth, employment and inflation in member countries; and the costs and benefits of a coordinated versus an uncoordinated approach to adhere to an EU target of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Unemployment is high in the EU, and many economists believe that this problem as well as global warming can be solved by a CO 2 tax, where tax revenues are used to reduce employers' contributions to social insurance. Then, hopefully, a'double dividend will result for the environment as well as for the labor market. In one simulation, each country implements a CO 2 tax to limit CO 2 emissions by 10 %. As an alternative to this uncoordinated approach, we calculated an overall CO 2 tax for the EU to limit the CO 2 emissions of the EU by 10 %. We will measure the effects on the labor market, on economic performance and on trade flows under the uncoordinated CO 2 policy, and will compare the results with the coordinated CO 2 policy of an overall CO 2 reduction for the EU.

40|$|Simulation of {{both the}} climate of the 20 th century and of {{possible}} future climate change requires taking into account numerous forcings of different nature. Climate sensitivities of existing general circulation models, defined as the <b>equilibrium</b> surface <b>warming</b> due to increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, vary over a rather wide range. A large number of simulations with the MIT climate model of intermediate complexity with forcings of different nature {{have been carried out}} to study to what extent sensitivity to changes in CO 2 concentration represent sensitivities to other forcings. Sensitivity of the MIT model can be changed by changing the strength of the cloud feedback. Simulations with the versions of the model with different sensitivities show that the sensitivity to changes in CO 2 concentration provides a reasonably good measure of the model sensitivity to other forcings with similar vertical stratifications. However the range of models’ responses to the forcings leading to the cooling of the surface is narrower than the range of models’ responses to the forcings leading to warming. This is explained by the cloud feedback being less efficient in the case of increasing sea ice extent and snow cover. The range of models’ responses to the forcings with different vertical structure, such as increase in black carbon concentration, is also smaller than that for changes in CO 2 concentration.
