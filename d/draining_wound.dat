Breast abscess can occur as post-surgical complication, for example after cancer treatment or reduction mammaplasty. Furthermore, if a breast has already undergone irradiation (as in radiation therapy for treating breast cancer), there is a heightened risk of complications (e.g. reactive inflammation, occurrence of a chronic <b>draining</b> <b>wound,</b> etc.) for breast biopsies or other interventions to the breast, even those often considered [...] "minor" [...] surgeries. The combined effects of radiation and breast cancer surgery can in particular lead to complications such as breast fibrosis, secondary lymphedema (which may occur in the arm, the breast or the chest, in particular after axillary lymph node dissection), breast asymmetry, and chronic/recurrent breast cellulitis, each of these having long-term effects.|$|E

Search methods In November 2013, for this second update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid Medline; Ovid Medline - In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; Ovid Embase; and EBSCO CINAHL.

30|$|There was a {{statistically}} significant difference in time from surgery to dry incision favoring the OCA group. This effect was likely attributable to the sealant effect of OCA on the wound. Although there was not {{a statistically}} significant difference in vacuum-assisted dressing application to either the incision or drain holes, clinically the metallic staples group required more vacuum dressings on the incision and the OCA group required more vacuum-assisted dressings on the drain holes. Few other studies have examined wound drainage as an endpoint. We considered wound drainage to be very important, since a <b>draining</b> <b>wound</b> is always at risk for infection, and patients with a <b>draining</b> <b>wound</b> are not discharged from the hospital, thereby prolonging hospital stay. The application of negative pressure dressings to non-infected surgical wounds was highly effective in our series. All wounds treated with negative pressure dressings were dry after 48  h of vacuum therapy. This technique decreases dressing changes, potentially mitigating wound contamination and skin maceration from saturated gauze dressings. Livesey et al. [13] examined wound drainage at 3  days postoperatively and noted drainage in 39.5  % of the skin adhesive patients and 51.3  % of the staples patients in total hip arthroplasty; this difference was not statistically significant. However, Khan et al. [11] examined wound drainage accumulated on total hip arthroplasty dressings and noted {{a statistically significant}} increase in the drainage of wounds closed with metallic staples. The application of OCA to a surgical wound appears to clinically reduce the amount of drainage and may improve wound healing and decrease the number of dressing changes required.|$|E

Additional samples were studied from 11 {{of these patients}} who developed a postoperative surgical <b>draining</b> <b>wound.</b> Bacterial growth occurred in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. There were 144 aerobic isolates (1. 4 per specimen). The predominant isolates were: E. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); Group D streptococcus (12 specimens); and P. aeruginosa (9 specimens). There were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). The predominant isolates were: 157 Bacteroides spp. (including 92 B. fragilis group and 26 B. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 Peptococcus sp.; 29 Peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 Fusobactenium sp.; and 16 Clostridium sp. B. fragilis and Peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. Beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. These included all isolates of B. fragilis and six of the 23 Bacteroides sp. Forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds.

40|$|Objective: Seromas or lymphoceles {{are common}} {{postoperative}} complications. This series presents 3 patients with lower extremity seromas refractory to treatment that required lymphatic mapping and lymphatic ligation for closure, and in 1 case, diagno-sis. Methods: Lymphatic mapping procedure consisted of intraoperative injection of subcutaneous tissue with methylene blue distal to the seroma with observation of dye effluence from transected or injured lymphatics draining into area of seroma. Results: In 2 patients, methylene blue dye absorption into lymphatic vessels allowed for optimized visual identification of lymphatic leak and contrast against surrounding tissues. In the third patient, where no lymphocele leak was found, {{the study was}} diagnostic and helped to find an alternate etiology for the recurrent seroma. Conclusion: Lymphatic mapping with methylene blue dye is an effective tool in the evaluation and diagnosis of chronic seroma. Seromas are a mass or tumefaction caused by localized accumulation of serum within tissues or organs that occur secondary to surgery or blunt trauma where significant tracts of lymphatic tissue have been removed, injured, or occluded. This condition is characterized by palpable, fluctuant mass and confirmed by ultrasonography. Serous seepage or impaired lymphatic drainage may result in passive leak into adjacent compartments which may persist. Accumulated serous fluid may require multiple aspirations or drain placement and sometimes surgery to repair the area. Complications include infection, wound dehiscence, or in rare cases calcification of the seroma capsule. 1 Seromas resolve slowly and are often refractory to conventional treatment with prolonged drainage, multiple aspirations, and local pressure. 2 Large seromas may cause edema of the extremities, pain, unsatisfactory cosmetic outcomes, and can become a chronic <b>draining</b> <b>wound.</b> 3,...|$|E

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent chest wall resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material at the Mayo Clinic. Results: From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1992, 197 patients (109 male patients and 88 female patients) underwent chest wall resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material. Median age was 59 years (range, 11 - 86 years). The indication for resection was recurrent chest wall malignancy in 65 patients (33. 0 %), primary chest wall malignancy in 62 patients (31. 5 %), contiguous lung or breast carcinoma in 58 patients (29. 4 %), and other reasons in 12 patients (6. 1 %). Three patients (1. 5 %) each had an open <b>draining</b> <b>wound.</b> This review covers 2 time periods. Sixty-four patients (32. 5 %) underwent reconstruction with polypropylene mesh {{during the period from}} 1977 to 1986. One hundred thirty-three patients (67. 5 %) underwent reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene from 1984 to 1992. Soft tissue coverage was achieved with transposed muscle in 116 patients (58. 9 %), local tissue in 81 patients (41. 1 %), and omentum in 3 patients (1. 5 %). There were 8 deaths (operative mortality rate, 4. 1 %). Ninety-one patients (46. 2 %) experienced complications. Seromas occurred in 14 patients (7. 1 %). Wound infections occurred in 9 patients (4. 6 %; 5 patients with polypropylene mesh and 4 patients with polytetrafluoroethylene). The prosthesis was removed in all 5 patients with polypropylene mesh and in none of the patients with polytetrafluoroethylene. Follow-up was complete in 179 operative survivors (94. 7 %) and ranged from 1 to 204 months (median, 26 months). A well-healed asymptomatic wound was present in 127 patients (70. 9 %). Conclusions: Chest wall resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material will yield satisfactory results in most patients.

Moreover, any advanced wound-healing adjunctive therapies that require daily applications may not be suitable for use with patients using a non removable device, such as the TCC. In addition, TCC may cause or exacerbate deformed toenails, ischemia, fungal infection, dermatitis, and claustrophobia. In situations requiring prolonged casting, joint rigidity and muscular atrophy have been documented.

40|$|<b>Wound</b> <b>drains</b> {{are often}} used after plastic and {{reconstructive}} surgery of the breast, in order to reduce potential complications. It is unclear whether there is any evidence to support this practice and we therefore undertook a systematic review of the best evidence available. To compare the safety and efficacy of the use of <b>wound</b> <b>drains</b> following elective {{plastic and reconstructive surgery}} procedures of the breast. For the first update of this review we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 4 March 2015); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (2012 to March 3 2015); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations March 3 2015); Ovid EMBASE (2012 to March 3 2015); and EBSCO CINAHL (2012 to March 4 2015). There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication. Three review authors undertook independent screening of the search results. All randomised trials (RCTs) that compared the use of a <b>wound</b> <b>drain</b> with no <b>wound</b> <b>drain</b> following plastic and reconstructive surgery of the breast (breast augmentation, breast reduction and breast reconstruction) in women were eligible. Two review authors undertook independent data extraction of study characteristics, methodological quality and outcomes (e. g. infection, other wound complications, pain, and length of hospital stay). Risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95 % confidence intervals. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. Three randomised trials were identified and included in the review out of 190 studies that were initially screened; all evaluated wound drainage after breast reduction surgery. No new trials were identified for this first update. In total there were 306 women in the three trials, and 505 breasts were studied (254 drained, and 251 who were not drained). Apart from a significantly shorter duration of hospital stay for those participants who did not have drains (MD 0. 77; 95 % CI 0. 40 to 1. 14), there was no statistically significant impact of the use of drains on outcomes.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe use of {{vacuum suction}} drains after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and groin {{dissection}} for arterial reconstruction surgery remains controversial. A large multicentre prospective randomised trial {{would be needed}} to show any difference if clinical end points (infection and haematoma) are used. Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate the value of wound drainage using accurate duplex measurement of haematoma expecting a 25 % difference in volume between <b>drained</b> and non-drained <b>wounds.</b> Patients and methodsSeventy consecutive patients undergoing CEA and 73 patients who underwent 106 groins dissection were separately and blindly randomised into two groups: group (a) with <b>wound</b> <b>drain</b> and group (b) without <b>wound</b> <b>drain.</b> A duplex scan was carried out post-operatively to document the presence and volume of any wound haematoma. ResultsThe majority of wounds did not show any evidence of collections 1. In the CEA patients duplex scan revealed wound haematoma in 8 patients with a median volume of 25 ml (5 – 65) in group (a) in comparison to 7 wound haematomas 31 ml (3 – 72) in group (b). Median suction drain drainage was 42 ml (10 – 120) when used. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups. Three patients 4. 3 % (two from the drain group) underwent evacuation of haematoma post-operatively. 2. In the groin dissection patients most of the documented collections were trivial. Ultrasound scans showed 21 collections (20 %), of these 7 (34 %) were in group (a) and 14 (66 %) were in group (b). There was no significant difference in wound collections between the two groups (p= 0. 28). Only 5 collections (75 %) exceeded 10 ml, three of them were in the drain group. One patient (1 %), who did not have a <b>drain,</b> developed a <b>wound</b> collection, which needed re-exploration. When a drain was used the median drainage was 64. 5 ml (range 10 – 220).

30|$|In conclusion, no {{statistically}} significant difference was detected in our primary endpoint of wound infection when comparing superficial wound closure with metallic staples versus running subcuticular monocryl suture and sealed with OCA in acetabular fracture surgery. However, our results show that the running subcuticular monocryl suture and OCA closure led to a dry incision more quickly than metallic staples (p =  0.032), and thereby may assist in minimizing hospital stay. In addition, negative pressure dressings can be used to safely and effectively treat a non-infected <b>draining</b> surgical <b>wound.</b> Closure with OCA and subcuticular monocryl showed no clinical disadvantages and appears to have a clinical advantage when compared to standard metallic staple skin closure in acetabular fracture surgery.

The present study used flow cytometric immunofluorescence analyses to investigate changes in number and phenotype of lymphocytes in seven different lymphoid compartments at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 60 days after 50 % total body-surface area thermal injury in the rat. Relative to sham-injured control rats, at postburn day 2, significant lymphopenia was observed in the peripheral blood along with depletion of lymphocytes from the spleen and thymus. By day 6 after injury, lymphocytes in the bone marrow and cervical lymph nodes decreased significantly while numbers in the spleen and thymus remained depressed. Splenic and cervical node lymphocyte numbers normalized by day 12, the bone marrow and thymus numbers still were significantly lower than control, and a 6. 5 -fold increase in number of lymphocytes was observed in the nodes <b>draining</b> the burn <b>wound,</b> pooled axillary, brachial, inguinal, and lumbar lymph nodes. At day 24 after injury, the thymus and bone marrow virtually were depleted of lymphocytes, the mesenteric lymph nodes manifested a significant decrease, and lymphocytes in the nodes <b>draining</b> the burn <b>wound</b> continued to increase in number. This same pattern was maintained on day 48, but numbers of lymphocytes in the mesenteric nodes normalized. At day 60 after injury, lymphocyte numbers in all tissues were normalized, but the spleen and nodes <b>draining</b> the burn <b>wound</b> where increased numbers compared to control persisted. Cell-surface phenotyping was performed on all lymphoid tissues at all time intervals to determine the percentages of lymphocytes comprising the following subsets: Ia+ cells (B cells and activated T cells), T cells, T-Helper/Inducer cells (T-H/I), and T-Suppressor/Cytotoxic (T-S/C) cells. Although changes in lymphocyte subset percentages were complex, they could be divided grossly into two phases. First, all compartments showed significant phenotypic changes {{in the first six}} days after burn. With the exception of the nodes <b>draining</b> the burn <b>wound</b> and the blood, this was followed by a return towards normal on day 12. The second phase then ensued with significant phenotypic changes again occurring in most tissues from days 24 to 60 after injury. These studies demonstrate that burn injury results in dramatic alterations in lymphocyte numbers and subset percentages in different lymphoid compartments.

Pronutro {{is a high}} energy, high protein food that is easier to digest than animal sources of protein. 15 - 25 % of the calorie intake of dogs should be protein while 25 - 35 % of the calorie intake of cats should be protein. In dogs with liver disease the most important dietary consideration is protein. Dietary protein should not be restricted to avoid development of a negative nitrogen balance. High quality, highly digestible protein should be fed to reduce hepatic work and decrease the amount of undigested protein reaching the colon. Undigested protein is converted to ammonia in the colon. It is recommended that hospitalised dogs should be supplemented with 4 to 6 g of protein per 100 kcal and cats with 6 or more grams of protein per 100 kcal. Protein requirements of patients is estimated based on clinical examination {{and the fact that}} protein requirements are increased during certain disease conditions such as peritonitis and <b>draining</b> <b>wounds.</b> Providing protein to catabolic animals spares endogenous skeletal muscle proteins and provides essential amino acids for acute-phase proteins and immune response. A prolonged period of insufficient protein intake causes low albumin, poor immune response, poor healing and increases the risk of dehiscence and muscle wasting. Excessive protein feeding places extra stress on the kidneys and liver as it takes more energy to excrete the excess nitrogen. REFERENCES: 1.
