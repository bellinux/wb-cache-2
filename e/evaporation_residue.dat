The decrease in the measured yield of quasifission fragments in $^{ 48 }$Ca+$^{ 154 }$Sm at the large collision energies and the lack of quasifission fragments in the $^{ 48 }$Ca+$^{ 144 }$Sm reaction are explained by the overlap in mass-angle distributions of the quasifission and fusion-fission fragments.
