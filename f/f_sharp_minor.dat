500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems like just yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your arms around me tight/Everything it felt so right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just thought you were the one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t get to see the tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV noticed that the song [...] "soared on crunchy guitars, driving beats and anthemic, agitated choruses." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs Noye and her Gossips {{enter to}} an <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> {{distortion}} of the children's tune, which reflects their mocking attitude. In Noye's song calling for the ark to be built, a flood leitmotiv derived from {{the first line of}} the opening hymn recurs as a solemn refrain. The music which accompanies the construction work heavily involves the children's orchestra, and includes recorder trills, pizzicato open strings, and the tapping of oriental temple-blocks. After the brief [...] "quarrel" [...] duet between Noye and his wife in 6/8 time, timpani-led percussion heralds the Voice of God's order to fill the ark. Bugle fanfares [...] announce the arrival of the animals, who march into the ark to a [...] "jauntily innocent" [...] tune in which Roseberry detects the spirit of Mahler; the fanfares punctuate the entire march. The birds are the last group to enter the ark, to the accompaniment of a three-part canon sung by Noye's children and their wives. In the final scene before the storm, where Noye and his family try to persuade Mrs Noye to join them in the ark in G major, the music expresses Mrs Noye's obstinacy by having her reply accompanied by a D sharp pedal which prepares for the Gossips' drinking scherzo in E minor. The slap which Mrs Noye administers when finally persuaded is accompanied by an E major fortissimo.|$|E
2500|$|Rubinstein {{was most}} {{famous for his}} series of {{historical}} recitals—seven consecutive concerts covering the history of piano music. [...] Each of these programs was enormous. [...] The second, devoted to Beethoven sonatas, consisted of the Moonlight, Tempest, Waldstein, Appassionata, E minor, A major (Op. 101), E major (Op. 109) and C minor (Op. 111). [...] Again, this was all included in one recital. [...] The fourth concert, devoted to Schumann, contained the Fantasy in C, Kreisleriana, Symphonic Studies, Sonata in <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor,</b> a set of short pieces and Carnaval. [...] This did not include encores, which Rubinstein sprayed liberally at every concert.|$|E
5000|$|The movement, in [...] and {{switching}} between <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> major and <b>minor,</b> is marked [...] "assez lent et d'un rythme las" [...] ("rather slow {{and with a}} drowsy rhythm"). Goodwin describes it as [...] "beguiling and subtle in its expression of a thoroughly Spanish character and spirit".|$|R
40|$|This concerto {{in three}} {{movements}} focuses on advanced marimba techniques. Scored for a chamber orchestra of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, timpani, solo marimba, and single strings. Inspired {{by the recent}} efforts of the Classical Marimba League, this concerto strives to provide a classically driven, tonal addition to the marimba repertoire. The piece explores tonal interplays between <b>F</b> <b>minor,</b> C <b>sharp</b> <b>minor,</b> A minor The first movement, in F minor, opens delicately and is constantly growing to its dramatic conclusion. The second movement answers {{the first in the}} opposing key of C <b>sharp</b> <b>minor.</b> This movement is built in an arch form and returns to F minor at its climax, from this moment the movement will unfold back into C <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> just as it arrived. The final movement is a scherzo in A minor This key choice demonstrates neutrality from the previous opposing keys...|$|R

2500|$|Rubinstein's concert {{programs}} were often gargantuan. [...] Hanslick mentioned in his 1884 review that the pianist played more than 20 pieces in one concert in Vienna, including three sonatas (the Schumann <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor</b> plus Beethoven's D minor and Op. 101 in A). [...] Rubinstein {{was a man}} with an extremely robust constitution and apparently never tired; audiences apparently stimulated his adrenals {{to the point where he}} acted like a superman. [...] He had a colossal repertoire and an equally colossal memory until he turned 50, when he began to have memory lapses and had to play from the printed note.|$|E
2500|$|Dussek then toured Germany, {{where he}} became one of the first [...] "glamour" [...] pianists, {{preceding}} Franz Liszt. According to Louis Spohr, Dussek was the first to turn the piano sideways on the stage [...] "so that the ladies could admire his handsome profile." [...] Before long he took up a position with Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, who treated him more as a friend and colleague than as an employee. Together, they sometimes enjoyed what were called [...] "musical orgies." [...] When Prince Louis Ferdinand was killed in the Battle of Saalfeld, Dussek wrote the moving Sonata in <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>minor,</b> Elégie harmonique, Op. 61 (C 211).|$|E
