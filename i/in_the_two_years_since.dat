5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E

Ten days after its release, Beyoncé had sold 991,000 copies in the US, {{making it the}} best-selling album by a female artist in 2013. A third week at number-one with sales of 310,000 copies brought the album's US sales to 1.3million after 17 days of release, positioning it as the eighth best-selling album of the year, {{and the first to}} enter the year-end top 10 based on just three weeks of sales availability in the Nielsen SoundScan era. In its fourth week, sales reached 1.43million, surpassing the total sales of Beyoncé's previous album, 4, which was released in 2011 and had sold 1.39million in total <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> its release. Following Beyoncé performing at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, sales of the album in the US increased by 181%. The record sold 878,000 copies in the US in 2014 alone, becoming the sixth best-selling album of the year. As of November 2016, Beyoncé has sold 2.4million copies in the US and has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In July 2017, the album became the longest-charting album by a black female artist in Billboard 200 history, surpassing the record previously held by Whitney Houston’s self-titled album.|$|E

The rebels attacked cities and towns with virtual impunity; they had conquered al-Ubulla, Jubba and al-Ahwaz and received the voluntary submission of 'Abbadan. Rather than attempt to hold the cities that they captured, the Zanj generally opted to pillage and abandon them, after which they would move on to their next target.|$|E

Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are now embraced by the population as a whole, which has begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of blitzball.

500|$|In early 1971, Corbally {{was offered}} the {{presidency}} of the University of Illinois system, which he readily accepted. The suddenness of his resignation at Syracuse led to speculation that he had been pressured to leave due to the tense events of 1970 or that he wanted to jump ship from a school still facing financial difficulties. However, John Robert Greene, in a 1998 book on the history of Syracuse, argues that none of that is true: Corbally handled the student protesters and football boycott admirably, despite criticism at the time from some alumni of the school, and he, along with his vice chancellor Ronald Brady, had improved the financial status of the school much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Corbally took office. According to Greene, the chancellor took the new job [...] "simply because he received a better job offer". Corbally was succeeded by his provost Melvin Eggers.|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{issued the}} single on 17 March 1972 in Britain, as Apple R 5944, with a US release taking place three days later, as Apple 1849. It was Starr's first release since [...] "It Don't Come Easy", a year before. During this period, his {{priority}} {{had been to}} develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 Motels (1971) and Blindman. Further aligning himself with Britain's glam rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie (1972), a film starring Bolan that included Starr's footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on 18 March. With [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", NME critic Bob Woffinden noted Starr's success in establishing himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the Beatles' break-up, and wrote that the single [...] "confirmed that he and Harrison, dark horses both, {{were the ones who}} had managed their solo careers more purposefully and intelligently" [...] compared with McCartney and Lennon.|$|E
500|$|In the pilot, Monica is dumped almost {{immediately}} after sleeping with her new date Paul {{on the night of}} their first date. Monica is tricked into bed with him after Paul lies to her about his sex life, falsely alleging that he has not slept with anyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> his wife left him. At first, NBC executives worried that audiences would react to Monica's role unfavorably, thus they decided to survey the studio audience and ask them whether or not they thought that having Monica sleep with someone on their first date made her character too promiscuous. Don Ohlmeyer, then-president of NBC's west coast division, was particularly adamant about his stance against Monica's role in the pilot, which he considered [...] "casual sex", and created a [...] "stacked" [...] questionnaire asking audience members if they thought Monica was a whore. Kauffman recalled Ohlmeyer specifically expressing that Monica deserved to be dumped, a statement by which the writer was greatly offended, dismissing Ohlmeyer as a misogynist. Ultimately, the results returned in favor of Monica; audiences liked the character nonetheless, and the episode aired unchanged.|$|E

500|$|Lukather's sixth studio album, All's Well That Ends Well, was {{released}} on October 11, 2010, in Europe and Japan, and November 16 as a digital download worldwide. The material was written predominantly in collaboration with longtime associate C. J. Vanston, and the album features stalwart musicians from Lukather's touring band. Songwriter Randy Goodrum, who has collaborated with Lukather {{many times over the}} years including on the 1986 Toto single [...] "I'll Be over You", contributes to the track [...] "Brody's". All's Well That Ends Well draws from Lukather's personal experiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Ever Changing Times. Critic Arlene Weiss noted that the album features three distinct flavors of music: one that [...] "bares [...] soul and emotional heartache", one that pans elements of popular culture like TMZ.com, and one that expresses optimism and enthusiasm about the future. While Lukather focused on instrumental writing and production on previous albums but collaborated with lyricists, he wrote much of the lyrics for All's Well That Ends Well himself. Lukather describes the album as being a [...] "real" [...] and [...] "honest" [...] reflection of the period between 2008 and 2010, when he experienced difficulties within his private life.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the album's debut, the {{critical}} receptions of Whitney were mixed. Most of critics admitted the {{commercial value of}} the album, but were critical of its standard pattern followed the predecessor's winning formula and the materials failed to reveal Houston's individuality. Jon Pareles of The New York Times criticized something as formulaic on the album, stating that: [...] "Whitney plays everything safe. It uses three of the debut album's producers. [...] There are bouncy, tinkly songs aimed at teen-agers, [...] and slow tunes aimed at sentimental adults, as before. Even the album title fits in with an Arista Records custom of separating female singers—Dionne, Aretha, Carly—from their last names." [...] He was not positive of her vocals on it, commenting [...] "What's more unsettling is that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Whitney Houston was released, the singer hasn't gotten much more expressive. For too many songs, she takes the patched-together style of the debut album further [...] {{as if she were}} singing in a second language." [...] He added that [...] "For all the passionate avowals of the lyrics, Ms. Houston and her producers keep emotion at bay." ...|$|E
