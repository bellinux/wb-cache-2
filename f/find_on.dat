5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to <b>find,</b> <b>on</b> looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, a BART rider {{created a}} website, bartcrimes.com, to {{disseminate}} information he thought BART makes {{very difficult to}} <b>find</b> <b>on</b> their website, intentionally making it inconvenient to access crime logs, which are public information. BART officials say crime rates remain low. But according to data requested by the San Francisco Chronicle after the mob robbery in April, figures showed a 45 percent increase in robberies aboard BART trains in its stations {{during the first quarter}} of the year.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{helicopter}} operations commenced out of Brønnøysund Airport in 1981, when Helikopter Service was contracted for fly to exploration {{field on}} Trænabanken. A combined fixed-wing and helicopter hangar {{was completed in}} 1983. The contract changed to Lufttransport from 1984. Operations remained limited and in 1989 the airport only saw 34 helicopter flights. The exploration resulted in a positive <b>find</b> <b>on</b> the Norne field, which started production in 1997. Norsk Helikopter, later renamed Bristow Norway, established a helicopter base at Brønnøysund Airport n 2002 and took over flights to the Skarv Oil Field.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} work was exhaustive, involving {{the filming of}} numerous churches in Norfolk, both ancient and more modern. Many of the clergymen featured in the programme were discovered by accident or by word-of-mouth. For example, the production researcher managed to <b>find,</b> <b>on</b> request, a vicar who had an extensive model railway in his rectory, another whose ministry was based on water (the Chaplain of the Broads) and a vicar whose congregation at the time numbered zero.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they <b>find</b> <b>on</b> the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to <b>find</b> <b>on</b> the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E

25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to <b>find</b> <b>on</b> short-haired animals, but very difficult to <b>find</b> <b>on</b> long-haired animals like Persian cats. If {{you live in a}} tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, it is suggested that you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} species of plants that reside within the {{preserve}} besides the iconic Valley Oak(Quercus lobata). Some of the species that are located close to the water are Cottonwood (Populus fremontii), cattail (Typhaceae Typha), Broadleaf Arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia), and Pampas Grass (Cortaderia selloana). Other plants that you can <b>find</b> <b>on</b> the preserve include Wild California Grape (Vitis californica), California Rose (Rosa californica), and the Elderberry tree (Adoxaceae Sambucus). Two greatly invasive plant species that occur around the Cosumnes River Preserve are the Perennial Pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) and Common water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes).|$|E
25|$|Among {{evidence}} demonstrated toward Heirens's {{guilt is}} the fingerprint {{evidence on the}} Degnan ransom note and on the doorjamb of Frances Brown's bathroom door. However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that you would <b>find</b> <b>on</b> a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E

After a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail, Dick finds that he has conquered Joanna's lawful guardian, Lord Foxham, who promises to give Joanna to Dick in marriage after contemplated seaside rescue. There is irony in Foxham scolding Dick, who is nobly born, for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in Dick and Foxham's plans to rescue Joanna. Wounded in the failed seaside rescue, Foxham writes letters of recommendation for Dick to Richard Crookback, whom Dick must <b>find</b> <b>on</b> the outskirts of Shoreby.|$|E
25|$|Around April 19, 2000 Blizzard {{released}} new screenshots of Warcraft III, {{these were}} completely without interface. These screenshots showed heroes {{and a number}} of abilities. More screenshots came around May 2000. These screenshots showed the new interface of the game, which looked like the human interface in the eventual final release, however had small cannons above the minimap and the command button space. The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities that you can <b>find</b> <b>on</b> these screenshots never appeared in the retail version. Then from E3 2000 around May 12, 2000 to ECTS 2000 the game didn't change very much. The next major changes came between ECTS 2000 and E3 2001, when a different interface and the Night Elf race was revealed.|$|E
