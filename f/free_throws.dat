5|$|The radio postgame show {{reported}} the Warriors defeating the Knicks 169–150. However, the official scorer's report recorded {{the game as}} 169–147, a discrepancy {{that has never been}} explained. Chamberlain made 36 of 63 field-goals and 28 of 32 <b>free</b> <b>throws,</b> the latter a far better rate than his roughly 50% career average. In two earlier games at Hershey that season, Chamberlain had made a combined 27of38 <b>free</b> <b>throws,</b> 71percent. The basket rims at the arena were aged, flimsy, and forgiving. Balls would bounce off of typical firm rims, whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were apt to get a good roll and fall in. Playing all 48minutes of the game, Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted (63) and made (36), <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> made (28), most points in a quarter (31), and half (59). He averaged 73points in four games that week, exceeding 60 in all of them.|$|E
5|$|As a sophomore, Burke made 5 of 6 <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> in {{overtime}} {{to help his}} team defeat Dublin Scioto High School by a 54–53 margin in a 2009 OHSAA Division I regional final.

He also made the pass {{to set up the}} final game-winning points, although they were scored from the foul line by Sullinger. During the championship season, Burke averaged 10.7 points and 9.1 assists, and made only 1.7 turnovers per game.|$|E

A <b>free</b> <b>throw</b> violation also occurs if a <b>free</b> <b>throw</b> misses the backboard, rim, and basket. If a <b>free</b> <b>throw</b> violation is assessed on the last <b>free</b> <b>throw</b> awarded to a player in a given situation, possession automatically reverts to the opposing team.|$|R

5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both <b>free</b> <b>throws.</b> Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> and tied the score at 5252.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} {{accumulated}} through <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> or field goals. The National Basketball Association's (NBA) scoring title is {{awarded to the}} player with the highest points per game average in a given season. The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968–69 season, after which points per game {{was used to determine}} the leader instead. Players who earned scoring titles before the 1979–80 season did not record any two point field goals because the three-point line was first implemented in the NBA during that season. To qualify for the scoring title, the player must appear in at least 70games (out of 82) or have at least 1,400points. These have been the entry criteria since the 1974–75 season.|$|E

The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made <b>free</b> <b>throws</b> by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E
