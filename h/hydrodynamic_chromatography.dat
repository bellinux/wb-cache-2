40|$|For {{the first}} time, on-chip planar <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> is {{combined}} with UV absorption detection. This technique is suitable for size characterization of synthetic polymers, biopolymers, and particles. Possible advantages of an on-chip <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> system over conventional techniques, such as size exclusion chromatography, and field-flow fractionation are fast analysis, high efficiency, reduced solvent consumption, and easy temperature control. The hydrodynamic separations are performed in a planar configuration realized in fused silica using a mixture of fluorescent and nonfluorescent polystyrene particles with sizes ranging from 26 to 155 nm. The planar chip configuration consists of a 1 -μm-high, 0. 5 -mm-wide, and 69 -mm-long channel, an integrated 150 -pL injection structure, and a 30 -μm-deep and 30 -μm-wide detection cell, suitable for UV absorption detection.

The main advantages are fast analysis, high separation efficiency, negligible solvent consumption, and easy temperature control. The prototype chip contains a rectangular flat separation channel with dimensions of 1 μm deep and 1000 μm wide, integrated with a 300 -pL injector on a silicon substrate. The silicon microtechnology provides precisely defined geometry, high rigidity, and compatibility with organic solvents or high temperature. All flows are pressure driven, and a specific injection system is employed to avoid excessive sample loading times, demonstrating an alternative way of lab-on-a-chip design.

Upon incubation of the synaptic junctions with three cross-linking regents, dimethyl adipimidate (DMA), dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) and N-succinimidyl-(4 -azidophenyl) - 1, 3 '-dithiopropionate (SADP), AMPA receptor subunits in higher-molecular-mass aggregates were detected by immunoblotting. These aggregates migrated as proteins of approx. 200, 300 and 400 kDa. The number and identity of the subunits in a solubilized AMPA receptor were also investigated here. Two samples, W 1 and W 2, enriched in AMPA receptors were prepared from synaptic junctions {{by a combination of}} detergent-solubilization, anion-exchange chromatography and wheatgerm agglutinin affinity <b>chromatography.</b> <b>Hydrodynamic</b> behaviour analyses revealed {{that the majority of the}} AMPA receptors in either one of these samples were asymmetrical detergent-surrounded particles with a protein mass around 350 kDa. SDS/PAGE analysis revealed that the majority of AMPA receptors in the W 1 sample were comprised of dimers of 106 kDa subunits which were covalently linked by disulphide bonds. Cross-linking these receptors with SADP yielded a new band of approx. 400 kDa. The results obtained here, either from the studies of AMPA receptors embedding in synaptic junctions or from those of detergent-solubilized and partially purified receptors, suggest that AMPA receptors contain a basic core structure comprising of four 106 kDa subunits...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-high-pressure liquid {{chromatography}} (UHPLC) has {{great potential for}} the separations of both small molecules and polymers. However, the implementation of UHPLC {{for the analysis of}} macromolecules invokes several problems. First, to provide information on the molecular-weight distribution of a polymer, size-exclusion (SEC) columns with specific pore sizes are needed. Development of packing materials with large pore diameters and pore volumes which are mechanically stable at ultra-high-pressures is a technological challenge. Additionally, narrow-bore columns are typically used in UHPLC to minimize the problem of heat dissipation. Such columns pose stringent requirements on the extra-column dispersion, especially for large (slowly diffusing) molecules. Finally, UHPLC conditions generate high shear rates, which may affect polymer chains. The possibilities and limitations of UHPLC for size-based separations of polymers are addressed in the present study. We demonstrate the feasibility of conducting efficient and very fast size-based separations of polymers using conventional and wide-bore (4. 6 mm I. D.) UHPLC columns. The wider columns allow minimization of the extra-column contribution to the observed peak widths down to an insignificant level. Reliable SEC separations of polymers with molecular weights up to ca. 50 kDa are achieved within less than 1 min at pressures of about 66 MPa. Due to the small particles used in UHPLC it is possible to separate high-molecular-weight polymers (50 kDa ≤ Mr ≤ 1 - 3 MDa, upper limit depends on the flow rate) in the hydrodynamic-chromatography (HDC) mode. Very fast and efficient HDC separations are presented. For very large polymer molecules (typically larger than several MDa, depending on the flow rate) two chromatographic peaks are observed. This is attributed to the onset of molecular deformation at high shear rates and the simultaneous actions of <b>hydrodynamic</b> and slalom <b>chromatography...</b>|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} are {{proteins that}} {{reside in the}} cell membrane. Due to {{their position in the}} cell membrane, the barrier between the cell interior and exterior, they are vital to cell signaling. Moreover, the presence of membrane proteins in the cell's signaling pathways make membrane proteins important drug targets. In fact, {{one of the most important}} drug target classes are the membrane residing G protein coupled receptors. Despite this apparent importance there is currently no good technique for purifying membrane proteins that does not also have a high risk of causing denaturation of the protein. Taking into account that the cell membrane and its constituents can be described as a two-dimensional fluid, combined with the fact that many chromatography techniques are two-dimensional systems, it may seem peculiar that membrane chromatography is not yet solved in a satisfactory way. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to improved membrane protein <b>chromatography.</b> <b>Hydrodynamic</b> forces have recently been used to induce lateral movement of membrane associated molecules, a principle which has been utilized to improve the efficiency of the accumulation and separation of membrane associated molecules situated in supported lipid bilayers (SLB). This was done by forming SLBs in microfluidic channels, and by further introducing a gold barrier situated on the floor of the microfluidic channel. The barrier restricts the SLB to the center of the microfluidic channel where the spatial variation of the hydrodynamic force is small. Thanks to the so obtained homogeneous force, it was possible to show that separation of cholera toxin B subunit based on the number of attachment points to the SLB was complete, with no material in between the different populations. Also, a method for label-free diffusivity measurements on a substrate that is sensitive to changes in the effective refractive index in a small volume above the substrate is described. The technique is based on local application of hydrodynamic forces, in a so called hydrodynamic trap, to locally accumulate proteins at a surface coverage significantly higher than the equilibrium of the system. The trap is subsequently turned off, allowing the accumulated proteins to diffuse out of the trap, allowing the diffusivity of the accumulated proteins can be studied. The latter method was shown to provide a unique possibility to compare the diffusivity of labeled and non-labeled proteins in otherwise identical systems. It was shown that the inclusion of fluorescent labels decreases the diffusivity by approximately 12 %...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the role of colloids in accelerating contaminant transport as evidence of significant subsurface transport of contaminants continues to be presented. Colloid migration models typically include the processes of advection, dispersion, deposition and release. Present models are limited in their ability to predict the transport and fate of colloids due to limited understanding of the interaction between these processes. The objective of this research is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the physical/chemical factors which affect the transport of colloidal particles. ^ Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted in two phases to examine the effects of different chemical and physical factors on colloid transport. In the first phase, pulses of 1. 09 and 0. 28 μm fluorescent particles were injected into sand-packed columns under constant chemical conditions, and the response monitored over time. The second phase consisted of making a step change in solution chemistry (reduction in ionic strength or increase in pH) or flowrate to the system and monitoring the fluorescence response over time. The relative impact of various processes including advection, deposition/release, retardation and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> on colloidal transport was evaluated using experimental results. Various mathematical models were evaluated for their effectiveness in describing the observed colloid migration. ^ Results of finite pulse experiments conducted under constant chemical conditions confirm that solution chemistry is a key factor affecting particle deposition and release. Deposition results show evidence of the effects of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> and retardation. As expected, deposition increases with increasing ionic strength. Perturbations in solution chemistry caused the subsequent release of particles. However, the amount released was only a fraction of the total deposit.

Using two commercially available columns (Polymer Labs-PDSA type 1 and 2), a set of well characterised calibrants and a new external time marking method, we showed that flow rate and eluent composition have few influence on the size resolution and, therefore, can be adapted to the sample particularity. Monitoring the agglomeration of polystyrene nanoparticles over time succeeded without observable disagglomeration suggesting that even weak agglomerates can be measured using HDC. Simultaneous determination of gold colloid concentration and size using ICP-MS detection was validated for elemental concentrations in the ppb range.

Leveraging the potential of micro- and nanofluidic geometries {{is not only a}} matter of shrinking systems. Miniaturization can shift the relative importance of physical phenomena leading to separation. Theoretical and computational studies into the consequences of miniaturization are vital. Mesoscopic, multi-particle collision dynamics simulations are performed on polyelectrolytes and hard, colloidal solutes. Multiple variations of this simulation algorithm are implemented to achieve versatility for simulating non-equilibrium flows and dispersed solutes. The algorithm is extended to simulate the effects of finite Debye layers on the electro-hydrodynamics of electrophoresing macromolecules and used to study the electrophoresis of charged oligomers, polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes in both free-solution and confined geometries.

40|$|Tracer {{transport}} experiments involving colloids {{that showed}} little tendency to attach to rock surfaces and a nonsorbing solute (iodide) -were conducted {{in three different}} well-characterized natural fractures in tuff. The colloids always arrived earlier in the effluent than the iodide, which we believe is evidence of (1) <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> and/or (2) {{the fact that the}} colloids experience a smaller effective volume in the fracture because they diffuse too slowly to enter low-velocity regions (dead zones) along the rough fracture walls. The iodide also approached the inlet concentration in the effluent more slowly than the colloids, with the concentration at a given elution volume being greater at higher flow rates. By contrast, the rate of approach of the colloid concentration to the inlet concentration did not vary with flow rate. We attribute this behavior to matrix diffusion of the iodide, with the colloids being too large/nondiffusive to experience this phenomenon. Dispersion of all tracers was greatest in the fracture of widest average aperture and least in the fracture of narrowest aperture, which is consistent with Taylor dispersion theory. The tracer experiments were modeled/interpreted using a three-step approach that involved (1) estimating the aperture distribution in each fracture using surface profiling techniques, (2) predicting the flow field in the fractures using a localized parallel-plate approximation, and (3) predicting tracer transport in the fractures using particle-tracking techniques.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{simulation}} of porous media using a pore fractal dimension D was performed. Obtained {{results can be}} outlined as follows: 1). Starting from large pores with aspect ratio of micro-particle size to pore size > 0. 001, molecules (or test object) recognise the pore volume as a partially restricted space with reduced fractal dimension. 2). The restriction effect on a molecule depends on pore topology (in the present case {{on the type of}} packing). 3). Dramatic reduction of D is observed when overcomes 0. 01 and approaches ~ 0. 1 in a 2 -D approach, meaning that the test object recognises the pore as one dimensional rather than a 2 -D space; in turn, a 3 -D system will be recognised by the the test object as a 2 -D system. 4). Concerning the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> (HDC) the simulation explains why micro-objects become significantly retarded even at ~ 0. 01, that is, even when the ratio between the Stokes-Einstein diameter of the diffusing micro-object to the equivalent pore diameter is very small. The developed approach confirms that even for micro-object with a very simple geometry (a square test box) a molecule might be much more sensitive to pore topology than what could be expected by a steric effect. It is possible to expect a more pronounced effect for asymmetric micro-objects in tortuous channels. These results show that the problem of molecular sensitivity towards pore topology may be understood using fractal analysis. Further work will apply this fractal approach to diffusivity behaviour in gel-like and fibre-like or foam structures. 1...|$|E

This analytical approach is robust and suitable to study quantitatively the dynamics and kinetics of AgNPs in complex biological fluids, including processes such as agglomeration, dissolution and formation of protein coronas. The method was applied to study the transformations of AgNP standards and an AgNP-coated dressing in human plasma, supported by micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) and micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (μXANES) speciation analysis and imaging, and to investigate, for the first time, the possible presence of AgNPs in the blood of three burn patients treated with the same dressing.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} concern over the safety of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to humans and the environment {{and it is likely}} that the environmental risks of these particles will have to be tested under regulatory schemes such as REACH. Due to their unique properties and the fact that their detection and characterisation in complex matrices is challenging, existing analytical methods and test approaches for assessing environmental risk may not be appropriate for ENPs. In this article we discuss the challenges associated with the testing of ENPs to generate data on persistence, mobility, bioavailability and ecotoxicity in the environment. It is essential that careful consideration is given to the selection of the test material, the test system (including test vessels and study media) and the test exposure conditions. During a study it is critical that not only the concentration of the ENP is determined but also its characteristics (e. g. size, shape, degree of aggregation and dissolution). A range of analytical techniques is available including microscopy-based approaches (e. g transmission and scanning electron microscopy), dynamic light scattering, and size separation approaches (e. g. field flow fractionation and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography)</b> coupled to detection methods such as inductively coupled plasma MS. All of these have their disadvantages: some are unable to distinguish between ENPs and natural interferences; some techniques require sample preparation approaches that can introduce artefacts; and others are complex and time-consuming. A combination of techniques is therefore needed. Our knowledge in this area is still limited, and co-ordinated research is required to gain a better understanding of the factors and processes affecting ENP fate and effects in the environment as well as to develop more usable, robust and sensitive methods for characterisation and detection of ENPs in environmental systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new way}} to perform <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> (HDC) for the size separation of particles based on a unique recirculating flow pattern. Pressure-driven (PF) and electro-osmotic flows (EOF) are opposed in narrow glass microchannels that expand at both ends. The resulting bidirectional flow turns into recirculating flow because of nonuniform microchannel dimensions. This hydrodynamic effect, combined with the electrokinetic migration of the particles themselves, results in a trapping phenomenon, which we have termed flow. induced electrokinetic trapping (FIET). In this paper, we exploit recirculating flow and FIET to perform a size-based separation of samples of microparticles trapped in a short separation channel using a HDC approach. Because these particles have the same charge (same potential), they exhibit the same electrophoretic mobility, but they can lie separated according to size in the recirculating flow. While trapped, particles have a net drift velocity toward the low-pressure end of the channel. When, because of a change in the externally applied PF or electric field, the sign of the net drift velocity reverses, particles can escape the separation channel in the direction of EOF. Larger particles exhibit a larger net drift velocity opposing EOF, so that the smaller particles escape the separation channel first. In the example presented here, a sample plug containing 2. 33 and 2. 82 pm polymer particles was introduced from the inlet into a 3 -mm-long separation channel and trapped. Through tuning of the electric field with respect to the applied PF, the particles could be separated, with the advantage that larger particles remained trapped. The separation of particles with less than 500 nm differences in diameter was performed with an analytical resolution comparable to that of baseline separation in chromatography. When the sample was not trapped in the separation channel but located further downstream, separations could be carried out continuously rather than in batch. Smaller particles could successfully pass through the separation channel, and particles were separated by size. One of the main advantages of exploiting FIET for HDC is that this method can be applied in quite short (a few millimeters) channel geometries. This is in great contrast to examples published to date for the separation of nanoparticles in much longer micro- and nanochannels...|$|E

These results suggest that opening the yarn up may reduce flow impedances in a manner which reduces dispersion. ^ Most importantly, the solute dispersion was found to be independent of flow rate for interstitial velocities greater than 20 cm/min. This is consistent with earlier observations of a flat plate height curve for other types of rolled stationary phases, and gives an indication that mobile phase flow occurs in the spaces between the fibers as well as the yarns of the textile fabric. An analysis of the theory of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> in packed beds on non-porous spherical particles showed that this behavior is expected when convective flow dominates the solute transport process in the void volume between the nonporous particles. This concept was extended to the rolled stationary phases where fibers are the smallest structures in a macroporous assembly of yarns. Convective transport was shown to dominate over diffusive transport for probes whose molecular weight exceeded 3350. ^ The rapid separation of protein, bovine serum albumin (MW = 66, 000) from a small solute, NaCl, in 90 seconds or less indicated the potential usefulness of this type of stationary phase for rapid size exclusion chromatography. The utility of the approach was further illustrated by the rapid separation and partial removal of denaturants from a recombinant protein, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, which improved its processing into the renatured form. ...|$|E
40|$|This is the 29 th {{annual review}} of the {{application}} of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This Update refers to papers published approximately between September 2012 and July 2013 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in Environmental Analysis 1 that should be {{read in conjunction with}} other related ASUs in the series namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages; 2 advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques; 3 elemental speciation; 3 X-ray spectrometry 4 and advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials. 5 In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period include measuring the bioaccessible fraction of metals in particles and ongoing work in assessing the performance of optical and combustion techniques for the determination of the carbonaceous content of airborne particulate matter. Developments in instrumentation included new sampler designs for the collection of nanoparticles, the coupling of FFF and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> to ICP-MS for the sizing and compositional analysis of such particles and the ongoing development of aerosol mass spectrometry. In the field of water analysis, new procedures for the detection and quantification of emerging pollutants in water such as MRI contrast agents have been developed. Instrumental developments reported include the use of molecular absorption spectrometry, by exploiting the CS-AAS technique, for measuring halogen species in water. Numerous articles involving the application of atomic spectrometry to plants, soils and related materials appeared in this review period but, as usual, most were concerned with the environmental significance of the results, rather than the methodology used to obtain them. Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments. Both LIBS and PXRF spectrometry have been used more widely, variants such as LA-LIBS and microwave assisted LIBS have appeared, and PXRF spectrometry has been applied {{for the first time in}} the analysis of plants. Developments in geochemical analysis include the production and (re) certification of new geological RMs for bulk, isotopic and microspatial analysis. Optimisation of LA-ICP-MS techniques for the interrogation of geochemical samples continues to be reported and a number of useful instrumental review articles (AMS, ICP-MS and SIMS) have been published. Feedback on this review is most welcome and the review coordinator can be contacted using the email address provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of on-chip analytical separations using planar <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography</b> (HDC) in Pyrex-silicon and fused silica chips has been demonstrated. In order to sketch the analytical separations {{area in which}} the HDC chip has to operate, an introduction was given of important macro-scale separation techniques and their microfabricated counterparts. Furthermore, an impression of separation techniques that are enabled specifically by microtechnology was presented. One of these techniques is on-chip planar <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Other techniques are mainly aimed at DNA analysis using differences in transport of DNA through various constraining (microfabricated) geometries. Two types of HDC chips have been fabricated. The first type employs a Pyrex top wafer and a silicon bottom wafer, while the second type is fabricated using fused silica for both top and bottom wafers. Separation and injection channels were defined in the bottom wafer, whereas the top wafer provided through-holes for external connections. One particular part of the fabrication technology, fusion bonding of Pyrex to silicon and of fused silica to fused silica, was thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Bonding of Pyrex to silicon induces thermal stresses, which cause a slight deformation of the channel geometry. This deforms the sample zones thus decreasing the device performance. The thermal deformation was reduced by using fused silica. This has the additional advantage of a good transparency down to the deep-UV. Fabrication of the fused silica HDC chip required additional processing development, especially aimed at Reactive Ion Etching of deeper structures. The HDC chip designs were made using a combination of computational fluid dynamics and analytical expressions. Investigation of the chromatographic and technological constraints lead to a first Pyrex-silicon HDC chip design, incorporating a 1 μm deep and 0. 5 or 1 mm wide separation channel and a deeper (20 μm) integrated injection configuration. Apart from an enhanced injection structure, the fused silica HDC chip also incorporated an optical detection cell, located directly after the separation channel. This detection cell had roughly the same cross-sectional area as the separation channel, but was 30 μm deep, thereby giving a 30 -fold increase in the path length for external optical detection. All characterization steps were performed optically. For the Pyrex-silicon chip fluorescence imaging directly inside the 1 μm deep separation channel was used. The correct operation of the injection structure for the Pyrex-silicon and fused silica chips was demonstrated by visualization of the concentration distribution of a fluorescent dye. Subsequently, the separation capabilities in both chip types were demonstrated by separation of various polystyrene nanoparticles. In the fused silica chip detection of the particles was performed using UV absorption detection through the integrated optical detection cell. In the Pyrex-silicon chip separation of large biomolecules was shown as well. Additionally, it was shown that relatively small molecules could be separated, not by using the hydrodynamic separation effect, but by interaction with the relatively large channel wall surface area (adsorption chromatography). The retention data for the particle separations showed that the influence of electrostatic and hydrodynamic particle-wall interactions on the particle retention behavior is not yet well understood and needs further research. The particle separations, detected using UV absorption through the detection cell, enabled a quantitative estimate of the peak broadening. Plate numbers ranging from 10. 000 for small analytes to more than 100. 000 for large fluorescent and non-fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles were obtained. Qualitative comparison of (fluorescent) zone shapes showed that thermal deformation of the Pyrex-silicon separation channel, resulting in a higher dispersion, is less pronounced in narrower channels. Narrower channels however exhibit a relatively large influence of the side-walls on the total peak broadening, which leads to smaller plate numbers. Improvement of the separation resolution must therefore be aimed at reduction of the side-wall induced dispersion and of the thermal deformation. This could be realized by using wider channels, defined in fused silica. For integration with the Pyrex-silicon HDC chip a prototype stand-alone viscosity detector was developed using a technologically compatible fabrication process. The functionality of the differential detector was demonstrated by measuring the viscosity change caused by an ethanol plug in deionized water. A viscosity sensing resolution of Δηsp = 3 * 10 - 3 was estimated from those measurements. For the HDC chip a resolution of 10 - 4 is required. The difference {{can be explained by the}} extremely low volume flows and sample volumes required in on-chip HDC. Upscaling of the viscosity detector for higher volume flows theoretically improves the detection limits. Upscaling could thus create a functional viscosity detector with sample volumes that are much smaller than required for commercial viscodetectors. This could enable application of the detector for miniaturized (not necessarily micromachined) liquid chromatography systems for polymer analysis...|$|E
