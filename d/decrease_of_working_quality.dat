Generally, the decline in working memory and memory span tasks in old age is attributed to a decline in overall cognitive control.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{leadership}} structure and behavior on team or crew performance {{is well known}} and has been demonstrated in various studies (see e. g. Guzzo & Dickson, 1996; Zaccaro, Rittmann, & Marks, 2001). However, {{as far as we}} know, there is no empirical study available on leadership structures and crew performance in the applied setting of airport security control. This study compares the structure and impact of two different leadership models for security control. The first (older) model consists of one supervisor per sector. In the supervisor's sector, there are three to eight crews at work, each consisting of five security officers (SOs). Each crew independently manages and operates one line of the checkpoint. One of the five SOs in a crew is the crew leader (CL), who works together with the crew as a normal crew member but has a few additional tasks to fulfill. The second (newer) model, which focuses more on integrated crew resource management (CRM) criteria, consists of one supervisor, assisted by two CLs per sector. Together, they form a cohesive leading team. The CLs do not work in the crews anymore but manage two to three lines from behind. The crews still consist of five SOs. It is the new CLs' task to quickly isolate and manage problematic cases so that those do not block the line anymore. Like this, the workload of each team member is reduced. Another task is {{to keep an eye on}} the <b>working</b> <b>quality</b> and to communicate with the crews in such a way that <b>working</b> <b>quality</b> is enhanced. The impact of this reinforced leadership on indicators <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>quality</b> such as compliance with rules and regulations, as well as its impact on passenger flow (throughput) are analyzed using different statistical procedures such as T-tests, U-tests and Chi-square tests. Moreover, the job models of the new leadership structure are presented in detail and SOs' ratings of their acceptance and liking of both systems are presented. In sum, this study offers another, differe- nt approach to the human factors perspective in airport security focusing on leadership structures, crew resource management, and their effects...|$|R

This paper proposes that unpredictability in {{scheduling}} is associated with greater employee work-life conflict and perceived stress. This, in turn, has implications for health behaviour (alcohol consumption, sleep disturbance) and symptoms (digestive and cardiovascular problems). Increasing employee control through flexible working arrangements (FWA) is examined as a potential moderator. We also examine the possibility that alcohol consumption exacerbates {{the negative effects of}} unpredictability on well-being and health. A survey of 1207 police officers, for whom working unsocial hours is commonly accepted, showed direct effects of unpredictability over and above nonstandard hours on digestive health, and indirect effects through well-being on sleep, digestive and cardiovascular health. In some cases, these indirect effects were reduced or absent with greater employee control through FWA, although this was not uniform. Alcohol consumption intensified the effects of unpredictability on well-being and some health outcomes. As well as highlighting unpredictability as a key dimension <b>of</b> <b>working</b> time <b>quality,</b> the findings reflect a tension between employer-centred scheduling strategies for enhancing workforce flexibility and HRM practices, such as FWA, which purport to provide employees with greater control and work-life balance...|$|R

This common assumption presumes that employees are given compensatory time off on other days when they work on saturdays, sundays, or on public holidays. 6 The number <b>of</b> potential <b>working</b> days therefore results {{from the number of}} calendar days minus saturdays, sundays, and public holidays. Regional holidays that do not apply throughout Germany are weighted with the number of employees subject to social insurance contributions within the states (Bundesländer) level to calculate averages. The different numbers <b>of</b> annual <b>working</b> days have a nonnegligible irregular effect on annual hours worked. In addition to the resulting number of days, the effect <b>of</b> <b>working</b> days on the collectively agreed annual working time is presented in Table A. 1 (see Appendix A). The corresponding line in the lower part of Table A. 1 shows the percentage change <b>of</b> collectively agreed <b>working</b> time compared with the previous year due to an increase or <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> the potential <b>working</b> days.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} clients’ {{role in the}} mutuality of therapeutic encounter, this pilot study examined data from 49 participants who had undergone at least three sessions of therapy. The participants completed the Working Alliance Inventory and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills. As hypothesised, higher levels of mindfulness were associated with enhanced working alliance. All three dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> alliance (<b>quality</b> <b>of</b> therapeutic bond, agreement on tasks, and agreement on goals) {{were found to be}} associated with mindfulness. These results suggest that it would be worthwhile to develop future longitudinal research on the relationship between client variables and the development of therapeutic encounter...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue is {{a common}} sense caused by {{crushing}} labor, stressful social events and various illnesses. It is usually judged by their subjective symptoms, {{but it should be}} evaluated in an objective perspective. Here we show that the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> efficiency and sympathetic hyperactivity are associated with mental fatigue state caused by prolonged mental workload. Recently we made a new mental fatigue model of healthy volunteers caused by long-term computerized Kraepelin test (CKT) workload. CKT is our new software for automatically checking the calculation capability, with which it is easy to determine the reaction time (RT), coefficient of variance of reaction time (CV), and accuracy of the answers (AC) during tasks. We put 24 healthy volunteers into the fatigue state by subjecting them to 120 minutes’ CKT workload, and then studied the changes in fatigue sensation, RT, CV, and AC before and after the CKT workload. The fatigue sensation, RT, and CV were clearly increased by the fatigue-inducing task and recovered during the resting period. We also studied the changes in autonomic nerve activity by using heart rate variability analysis. The low/high frequency component ratio (LF/HF) was signifi-cantly increased by the fatigue-inducing task and decreased by resting, suggesting that mental stress causes a relatively sympathetic nerve activity-dominant state. Therefore, our new fatigue model involving a long-term CKT workload is a good mental fatigue model to provide much information about the fatigue state simultane-ously, and the increase of RT, CV, and proportion of sympathetic activity (LF/HF) are associated with mental fatigue state. These might be useful objective biomarkers or evaluating a mental fatigue state...|$|R
