40|$|In {{microcircuit}} fabrication, {{the diameter}} {{and length of}} a bond wire {{have been shown to}} both affect the current versus fusing time ratio of a bond wire as well as the gap length of the <b>fused</b> <b>wire.</b> This study investigated the impact of current level on the time-to-open and gap length of 1 mil by 60 mil gold bond wires. During the experiments, constant current was provided for a control set of bond wires for 250 ms, 410 ms and until the wire fused; non-destructively pull-tested wires for 250 ms; and notched wires. The key findings were that as the current increases, the gap length increases and 73 % of the bond wires will fuse at 1. 8 A, and 100 % of the wires fuse at 1. 9 A within 60 ms. Due to the limited scope of experiments and limited data analyzed, further investigation is encouraged to confirm these observations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a novel method for {{manufacturing}} microscopic Langmuir probes with spherical tips from platinum bond wires for plasma characterization in microplasma sources by fusing. Here, the resulting endpoints, formed by droplets of a <b>fused</b> <b>wire,</b> are intended {{to act as a}} spherical Langmuir probe. For studying the fusing behavior, bond wires were wedge-bonded over a 2 mm wide slit, to emulate the final application, and fused at different currents and voltages. For electrical isolation, a set of wires were coated with a 4 µm thick layer of Parylene before they were fused. After fusing, the gap size, as well as the shape and area of the ends of the remaining stubs were measured. The yield of the process was also investigated, and the fusing event was studied using a high-speed camera for analyzing the dynamics of fusing. Four characteristic tip shapes were observed: spherical, semi-spherical, serpentine shaped and folded. The stub length leveled out at ~ 420 µm. The fusing of the coated wires required a higher power for attaining a spherical shape. Finally, a Parylene coated bond wire was integrated into a stripline split-ring resonator (SSRR) microplasma source, and fused to form two Langmuir probes with spherical endpoints. These probes were used for measuring the I-V characteristics of a plasma generated by the SSRR. In a voltage range between - 60 V and 60 V, the fused stubs exhibited the expected behavior of spherical Langmuir probes and will be considered for future integration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The rewireable fuse or cutout {{is widely}} used in Bangladesh and elsewhere, {{in spite of the}} very real danger of {{improper}} replacement of <b>fuse</b> <b>wires.</b> To assess the problem, a preliminary survey of buildings, electrical shops, and electricians were conducted. The majority of buildings and retail establishments were found to use <b>fuse</b> <b>wires.</b> Electricians were found to use copper of arbitrary thicknesses as fuses, and were unaware of the existence of specialized <b>fuse</b> <b>wires.</b> Every year, there are numerous fires in the garments and other industries, causing hundreds of deaths. As the vast majority of these fires are of electrical origin, the evidence is strong that improper <b>fuse</b> <b>wiring</b> may have been the cause of the fires. The number of smaller fires which do not make it to the news is likely to be orders of magnitude greater than the publicized fires. Even when the origin is not electrical, insulation failures may cause secondary electrical fires, that may cause the fire to spread rapidly {{to the rest of the}} building, making it hard to extinguish...|$|R

40|$|Great {{effort is}} {{currently}} being put into the development and construction of the second generation, advanced gravitational wave detectors, Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO.

The low frequency dynamical behaviour of the suspension can be computed and optimized, provided that the wire bending shape under pendulum motion is known.

The last few decades have witnessed the introduction of electricity as a factor of everyday life in its use {{as a source of}} light, power and heat. The dangers of fire breaking out, or the damaging of machines or other apparatus by an unexpected rush of excessive current, have demanded the immediate use of protective means to interrupt the current before it becomes higher than the current capacity of the circuit. The earlier forms of the so called "cut outs" were <b>fuse</b> <b>wires,</b> whose current carrying capacity was, or at least was supposed to be, equal to that of the circuit, but which would fuse and consequently open the circuit at the smallest excess of current above the normal load. Various other forms, like the magnetic circuit breaker, have subsequently come into use, but they are restricted mainly to guard against short circuits, while the ordinary <b>fuse</b> <b>wire</b> is still and will be used to open the circuit when the current exceeds the carrying capacity of the line.

40|$|In this class, we {{will discuss}} the {{detectability}} lemma, which {{can be seen as}} a step towards constructing a gap amplification procedure for local Hamiltonians. Before this, we describe the tensor network formalism and its applications to solving some “easy ” cases of the gapped local Hamiltonian problem. The tensor network formalism will be useful in future discussions in the class. 8. 1 Tensor networks Tensor networks provide a graphical method for manipulating tensors. A tensor network for a rank k tensor u living in ⊗k i= 1 C di is represented by a dot with k wires attached to the dot. Assigning integral values ci (where 1 ≤ ci ≤ di) to the wires yields the entry uc 1,c 2, [...] .,ck. Tensor product of two tensors is represented simply by drawing the two tensors side-by-side: the interpretation being that the output in this case is the product of the two “dots ” corresponding to the two tensors. The more interesting operation is contraction, in which two wires belonging to different (or same) tensors are “fused ” together. The interpretation for this is that the new output for a fixed setting of the other wires is the sum of all outputs over all possible setting of equal values to the two <b>fused</b> <b>wires</b> (the two <b>fused</b> <b>wires</b> must therefore have the same dimension).
