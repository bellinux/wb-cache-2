50|$|When a {{government}} decides to <b>index</b> <b>wages</b> of government employees to inflation {{it is to}} transfer the risk of inflation away from government workers onto the government. Such a policy is to attempt to reduce inflationary expectation and in turn inflation when it is rising rapidly. Research by economists is ambivalent {{on the success of}} such policies. Some have deemed it a success including Friedman (1974), Gray (1976), and Fischer (1977). Others have considered it less successful as they observed that indexation breeds inflation inertia (a reduction in the government and the central bank’s effort in fighting inflation leading to inflation rate remaining higher than targeted). This perspective is supported by Bonomo and Garcia (1994).|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1970 s, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} research on the macroeconomic consequences of wage indexation. Nonetheless, until recently, this research had not explicitly explored the implications of contracts that <b>index</b> <b>wages</b> to lagged inflation, the usual type of wage indexation observed in practice. Drawing mainly on recent research by the author, this paper examines the consequences of wage indexation to lagged inflation on aggregate wage formation, the cost of disinflation under money- and exchange-rate-based stabilization, the variability of output under alternative shocks and policy regimes, the choice of exchange rate regime, and the level and variability of inflation. ...|$|E
40|$|Optimal wage {{indexation}} is analyzed {{in an economy}} subject to common and sector-specific supply shocks and aggregate demand shocks where one sector has wage contracts and the other has a Walrasian labor market.

Consequently, this study provides possible theoretical explanations for observation of both CPI indexation and profit-sharing contracts, and {{for the failure of}} purely aggregative indexation models to explain disaggregate-level behavior.

We show that workers <b>index</b> <b>wages</b> to past inflation when output fluctuations are primarily explained by technology and permanent inflation-target shocks, whereas they index to trend inflation when aggregate demand shocks dominate output fluctuations.

40|$|The Econotnics of New Goods is {{directly}} relevant to recent {{debates over the}} properties of the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI {{is one of the most}} import-ant numbers in economics. It is used to <b>index</b> <b>wages,</b> pensions and welfare pay-ments, and it is the focus of monetary policy. In the last few years, however, there has been a growing realization that the CPI, as currently measured, is an upward biased measure of changes in the cost of living. In particular, the CPI Commission (see Boskin et al., 1997) claims that for the United States: The [CPI] bias looking forward is 1. 1 percentage points per year [...] . [Olver the next decade, [if it continues] this bias would contribute about $ 148 billion to the deficit in 2006 and $ 691 billion to the national debt by then. The bias alone would be the fourth largest federal program, after social security, health care and defense. Most of the bias can be attributed to the failure of the CPI to account for the welfare gains derived from new goods and quality change. The Economics of New Goods is a major contribution to this literature. The eleven papers in this volum...|$|E

40|$|While a {{standard}} academic presumption {{has been that}} wage indexation reduces the cost of disinflation, policymakers generally contend that <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> makes disinflation more difficult. To shed light on these views, this paper reexamines the effects of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> on the output loss caused by money-based stabilization. It finds {{that the cost of}} disinflation with <b>indexed</b> <b>wage</b> contracts tends to be smaller than that with contracts that specify preset time-varying wages, but larger than that with contracts that specify fixed wages. Thus the academic and policymakers views can be both appropriate depending on the standard of reference. ...|$|R

40|$|The celebrated {{analysis}} by Barro and Gordon (1983) of the undesirably high {{average rate of}} inflation that results under discretion illustrates the suboptimal nature of time-consistent monetary policy. That is to say, a discretionary policymaker may choose the positive rate of inflation with no output gain. The resulting rate of inflation depends upon {{the slope of the}} short-run Phillips curve, which in turn depends on the structure of the economy. We explore a model in which <b>indexed</b> <b>wage</b> contracts coexist with non-indexed long-term wage contracts which are assumed to incorporate non-contingent wage increases that permit adjustment of wage rates to anticipated inflation. In our model the slope of the long-run Phillips curve is not exogenous but to some extent depends upon monetary policy. Unlike the model of Barro and Gordon, positive steady-state inflation raises the steadystate output gap in this model. This is because we allow for the possibility that the monetary authority takes advantage of the inertial behavior of price implied by partially <b>indexed</b> <b>wage</b> contracts. In order to analyze time consistent monetary policy in the model considered here, we define a discretionary policy regime as one in which the monetary authority chooses the optimum feedback rule given the public's expectations of feedback money supply rule...|$|R

This series gross up earlier years wages so that all years earnings up to age 60 are put on equal footing. Because it takes more than one year to fully collect such data, and because some people have January birthdays, the age 62 calculation done in 2006 must be based on the most recent data which is the 2004 national average wage. By law, all covered workers who attain age 62 in 2006 must be treated the same with respect to wage indexation so the 2004 figure for national average wage must be used for the entire 2006 year.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between wage indexation, discretionary wage adjustment and inflation in Italy, by specifying and estimating (on quarterly time series for 1963 - 85) a short-term model for the price-wage nexus in the industrial sector of a small open economy.

The main conclusion is that, at least since 1973, institutional interventions on the degree of indexation seem to be only partially determined by variations in the optimum degree of indexation. As a result, <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> has increased price variance without this being justified by the fact that wages are closer on average to their equilibrium level.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a unified {{framework for the}} analysis of wage indexation and monetary policy in the presence of supply shocks. We first present simple formulae for the optimal wage indexation rule and for the optimal money supply rule. In order to set the stage for an evaluation of departures from the optimal policy rules we first analyse two extreme cases [...] a rule that stabilizes employment and a rule that stabilizes the real wage. The analysis of these two extreme cases provides the ingredients for the evaluation of various rules for wage indexation and for monetary targeting. We examine the implications of <b>indexing</b> <b>wages</b> to (i) nominal GNP, (ii) the CPI and (iii) the value-added price index, as well as the implications of targeting the money supply to these alternative three indicators. It is shown that, the various indexation rules bear a dual relation to the various monetary targeting rules. The welfare ranking of the various rules depends on whether the elasticity of the demand for labor exceeds or falls short of the elasticity of labor supply. If the demand for labor is more elastic than the supply, then policy rules that stabilize employment produce a smaller welfare cost than policy rules that stabilize the real wage. In that case, <b>indexing</b> <b>wages</b> to nominal GNP results in a smaller welfare cost than indexing to value-added price index which, in turn, produces a smaller cost than indexation to the CPI. Because of the dual relation between monetary policy and wage indexation, it follows that under the same circumstances, monetary policy that targets nominal GNP produces a smaller welfare cost than policy that targets the value-added price index which, in turn, results in a smaller cost than the policy that targets the CPI. This ranking is reversed when the elasticity of the supply of labor exceeds the elasticity of demand. ...|$|R
