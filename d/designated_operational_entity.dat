40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a {{mechanism}} under the Kyoto Protocol, which allows industrialised {{countries that have}} binding emission targets to invest in emission reduction projects in non-industrialised countries. These CDM investments generate certified emission reductions (CERs), {{which can be used}} by the industrialised countries towards meeting their own targets. The dual objective of the CDM is: 1) to assist developing countries to achieve sustainable development and contribute to the UNFCCC’s ultimate objective of stabilising the global concentrations of GHG emissions, and 2) to help the developed countries achieve their emission reduction targets. Ensuring that the CDM projects actually reduce emissions is fundamental for the environmental integrity of the CDM, and the task of validating and verifying/certifying the CDM project activities emission reductions has been delegated by the CDM Executive Board (EB) to the <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entities</b> (DOEs).

50|$|The {{next step}} would be to hire an {{independent}} certifier to do the CCB audit and validate the project.

The CCB audit and validation should take about two months or sometimes more depending on the audit findings. Typically, the CCB auditor reviews all the project documents and once they find that the documentation is sufficient and appropriate to proceed with an audit they forward the documents to the CCBA for the mandatory public comment period. Once the auditor evaluates the responses they write up the final audit & validation report and forward this with their statement of conformance to CCB Standards to the CCBA for publication on the CCBA website. Then the project would be deemed “CCB validated”.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to public {{services}} innovation in the municipal solid waste sector. It analyses the implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in the Bandeirantes and São João landfills in the municipality of São Paulo, Brazil. The analysis {{is based on the}} concept of Public-Private Innovation Networks in services (ServPPINs). Using the ServPPIN concept it was possible to identify competence gaps affecting the stakeholders involved in these CDM projects. We focus in particular on those organisational and relational competence gaps that are likely to weaken innovation feasibility and reduce the quality of solid waste services supply. In fact, innovation is closely linked to the development of new competences among service providers and users. For the most part, these will arise out of changes in interactions between actors-given that the projects in question include the coordination of various actors (public, private, and citizen). Such innovations will also arise out of changes in the environmental aspect, since in addition to monitoring of the technical parameters required for the general operation of landfills which implement CDM projects, auditing is also carried out by the <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entities</b> (DOE), which are responsible for validation of these projects...|$|R
40|$|Verification of gas {{emissions}} faces particular problems of uncertainty, {{because of their}} intangibility, the variety of factors that influence them, and continuing disagreements on the monitoring methodologies. Verification under the UNFCCC aims to test compliance with the binding GHG emissions reduction targets identified in the Kyoto Protocol. The paper describes the verification system, which is managed by an international secretariat but based on national reporting. The Protocol has only recently come into force, making the effectiveness {{of some of the}} verification tools difficult to assess, although experience has been gained from gradual improvements made since the Treaty was first developed. The system has some innovative features (for example, Expert Review Teams, <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entities,</b> and a complex compliance methodology), and these may be of wider relevance in verification systems design. POLICY CONCLUSIONS i. Verification of highly technical matters such as greenhouse gas reductions is a challenging area which must accommodate competing pressures; decentralisation of reporting responds to a political expedient (national sovereignty) but rapidly comes up against major capacity constraints (the lack of qualified technical personnel, particularly for Parties in the South). Financial incentives and technical support may be required to address these constraints, and the UNFCCC offers an interesting approach in these areas, though the investments are considerable...|$|R
50|$|An {{industrialised country}} that wishes to get credits from a CDM project must obtain {{the consent of}} the {{developing}} country hosting the project and their agreement that the project will contribute to sustainable development. Then, using methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (EB), the applicant industrialised country must make the case that the carbon project would not have happened anyway (establishing additionality), and must establish a baseline estimating the future emissions in absence of the registered project. The case is then validated by a third party agency, called a <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entity</b> (DOE), to ensure the project results in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. The EB then decides whether or not to register (approve) the project. If a project is registered and implemented, the EB issues credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs, commonly known as carbon credits, where each unit is equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of CO2e, e.g. CO2 or its equivalent), to project participants based on the monitored difference between the baseline and the actual emissions, verified by the DOE.|$|E
40|$|While the {{transport}} sector is responsible for more than 23 % of global emissions and growing, the share of transport sector projects within the Kyoto Protocol Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) remains well below 1 %. This study shows that the CDM is not currently a viable or attractive financing mechanism for intervening in {{the transport}} sector; given its disproportional focus and stringent accuracy requirements for additionality, the low return on investments, and the generally bureaucratic nature of the CDM. It is suggested for the CDM to broaden its scope and to allow projects to reflect {{the complexity of the}} sector. It also recognises that the CDM system was never designed to incorporate transport, and illustrates the incompatibility of the system with enabling sustainable mobility. The reports first reviews relevant mobility theory and the measures available to address {{the transport sector}}, namely within the Avoid-Shift-Improve strategies. Secondly, following interviews with the main <b>designated</b> <b>operational</b> <b>entity</b> (DOE) operating within the transport sector and the CDM, and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) Risø Centre in charge of monitoring CDM projects, the report explains the shortcomings of the CDM within the transport sector. More specifically, the report suggests to include support for packages of measures such as land-use planning and regulatory instruments that promote access instead of mobility. It is recommended to develop new methodologies that consider modal shift and other environmental or social co-benefits of transport projects to be accounted for. The report also suggests to simplify the CDM process and to remove barriers by revising the requirements for calculations and monitoring. Finally, the report touches {{on the question of whether}} the CDM system should be modified to incorporate the transport sector. As an alternative, the report proposes that the system be included as an integral element in other programmes, such as the NAMA...|$|E
40|$|I. Executive summary 1. The Executive Board (hereinafter {{referred}} to as the Board) of the clean development mechanism (CDM) continues to direct the mechanism’s regulatory framework to ensure that it is sufficiently robust and flexible to respond to the needs of Parties while facilitating the implementation of the CDM in a manner that maximizes its contribution to the aims of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol. 2.

40|$|The {{supervisory}} {{system of the}} Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been heavily criticized {{for not being able}} to guarantee the additionality of projects. Since neither the sellers nor the buyers of emission reduction credits in the CDM have an interest in the emissions reductions per se, but simply the right to them, a credible {{supervisory system}} is necessary to uphold the mechanism’s integrity. In the CDM, the on-the-ground supervision of projects has been delegated to the <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entities</b> (DOEs), which are private companies accredited by the CDM Executive Board (EB) to perform this task. But, as the DOEs are selected and paid by the project developers themselves, they have an economic incentive to let projects through to gain a favourable reputation among clients. Taking its starting point in delegation theory, this article argues that the supervisory system of the CDM is fundamentally flawed, since its design is incompatible with basic theoretical insights from this literature. It concludes that a thorough reform of the CDM’s supervisory system is needed in order to increase its credibility. First, the EB should select and pay the DOEs. Second, the current rules for determining additionality should be replaced so as to reduce the arbitrariness of decisions...|$|R
40|$|The clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) {{is part of}} {{the global}} carbon market developing rapidly in response to global warming. It has the twin objective to achieve sustainable development (SD) in host countries and assist Annex- 1 countries in achieving their emission reduction targets in a cost-efficient manner. However, research has shown that trade-offs between the two objectives exist in favour of cost-efficient emission reductions and that left to the market forces, the CDM does not significantly contribute to sustainable development. The main argument of the paper is the need for an international standard for sustainability assessment [...] additional to national definitions [...] to counter weaknesses in the existing system of sustainability approval by designated national authorities in host countries. The article develops a new methodology, i. e. a taxonomy for sustainability assessment based on text analysis of the 744 project design documents (PDDs) submitted for validation by 3 May 2006. Through analysis of the SD benefits of all CDM projects at aggregated levels, the strengths and limitations of the taxonomy are explored. The main policy implication of the research is to propose the taxonomy as the basis of an international verification protocol for <b>designated</b> <b>operational</b> <b>entities</b> (DOEs) for reporting, monitoring and verifying that potential SD benefits described in the PDDs are actually realized. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] With the already huge and growing amount of {{greenhouse}} gas emissions {{and a great deal}} of low-cost abatement options available, China is widely expected as the world's number one host country of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. But, making this potential a reality represents a significant challenge for China, because there has been a general lack of awareness by both the Chinese government and business communities, institutional structure, and implementation strategy. This has raised great concern about China's ability to compete internationally for CDM projects and exploit fully its CDM potential. This paper aims to address how CDM projects will be effectively implemented in China by examining the major CDM capacity building projects in China with bilateral and multilateral donors, the treatment of low-cost, non-priority CDM projects, and how a system for application, approval and implementation of CDM projects is to be set up in China and what roles the main institutional actors are going to play in the system. We conclude that these capacity building assistances, the establishment of streamlined and transparent CDM procedures and sound governance, and the lessons learned and experience gained from the implementation of the CDM project in Inner Mongolia and the two Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) projects will make China well positioned to take advantage of CDM opportunities. Moreover, in order to further exploit its CDM potential, we recommend that China should well define its sustainable development objective of the CDM, disseminate CDM knowledge to local authorities and project developers as sectorally and geographically wide as possible, and get at least two domestic legal <b>entities</b> accredited as <b>designated</b> <b>operational</b> <b>entities.</b> By taking these ongoing capacity building projects and the recommended actions, and gaining experience from real practice, it is thus expected that a much greater percentage of carbon credits is likely to come from CDM projects in China over the next several years as the Kyoto Protocol enters into force...|$|R
40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{has evolved}} at a {{surprising}} speed since 2003 {{and is considered}} to have made positive contributions {{to the development of}} greenhouse-gas-reducing projects in developing countries. Taking into account its historical significance as the first effort of its kind and its current success, a thorough evaluation of its system and its effectiveness is of critical importance. Against this backdrop, this study closely investigates each stage of the CDM project cycle from development and registration of projects to issuance of certified emission reductions and identifies influential factors for the successful CDM implementation. For the analysis, we performed an extensive quantitative analysis augmented by a descriptive study, based on information of approximately 5000 CDM project. Our findings suggest that the development of CDM projects is stimulated by favorable economic, social and technical environments in host countries as well as supportive CDM administration. This explains why projects are currently concentrated in certain countries such as China and India. Once projects are developed and submitted for validation, the success of the CDM projects at the next stages of project cycle related to registration and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) issuance is influenced by their types and a choice of <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entities</b> and project consultants. In particular, significant difference in registration success exists across project types, which calls for special attention of both the CDM authority and project participants to projects with high risks like energy efficiency, fossil fuel switch and biomass projects. Lastly, we found that performance of projects is affected by very project-specific conditions. For many of the most poorly performing projects, failure is attributable to technical and operational problems at the initial stage of project implementation, which highlights the importance of well-prepared PDDs. Based on the findings, the thesis concludes with policy recommendations to enhance the capacities and improve the performance of the major players under the CDM. by Jaemin Song. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Installations {{covered by}} the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) can use credits from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to cover a share of their emissions. The CDM credits are {{generated}} by low-carbon projects in developing countries that require the CDM support to become financially viable. We review the objectives that are pursued by the EU and by CDM host countries with the CDM, and assess {{the performance of the}} mechanism in reaching these objectives: Additionality Additionality is a key premise of the CDM 2 ̆ 013 only projects {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise should be supported by the CDM. Studies have found, however, that between one-fifth 1 and twothirds 2 of registered projects are non-additional; reasons include insufficient demonstration criteria and the ineffectiveness of <b>Designated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Entities</b> (DOE) 3 in filtering non-additional projects. Assuming these estimates are valid, non-additionality could have contributed 30 to 106 million tons of CO 2 eq to global emissions increases through the use CDM credit in the EU ETS in 2008 - 2009. Efficient use of EU mitigation funds CDM may not be a cost-effective mechanism for mitigation. For example, yearly costs for abating all developing HFC- 23 would cost about 2 ̆ 0 ac 26 million, but through the CDM, Annex I buyers pay between 2 ̆ 0 ac 250 and 2 ̆ 0 ac 750 million in total. 4 Sustainable Development The definition of sustainable development is controversial and there is no agreement on how it should be measured. Within this context, it is difficult to determine whether CDM aids sustainable development or not. Some CDM experts go so far as to suggest 2 ̆ 013 using their sustainable development criteria - that the additionality requirements of CDM actually reduce the number of sustainable projects available for CDM investment. Low-carbon development 2 ̆ 013 In developing countries In developing countries, the authors find that the CDM has not facilitated technology transfer, does not support a shift to low-carbon technologies, can discourage the development of domestic lowcarbon policies such as Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), does not achieve sustainable development criteria, and, in fact, can support carbon-intensive activities.
