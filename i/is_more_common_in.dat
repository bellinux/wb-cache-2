5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} affects between 5% and 66% of people, {{with about}} 20% {{of individuals in}} most populations having the condition to some degree. This makes it the most common disease of the oral mucosa. Aphthous stomatitis occurs worldwide, but <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> developed countries.|$|E
5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, {{it is even more}} common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E

5|$|Severe disease <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{babies and}} young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause {{the full spectrum of}} disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|The IPA <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> bilingual dictionaries, {{but there}} are {{exceptions}} here too. Mass-market bilingual Czech dictionaries, for instance, tend to use the IPA only for sounds {{not found in the}} Czech language.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
30|$|With {{increasing}} age, {{there was}} {{no change in the}} mLDFA in children with MPS I and MPS II. A valgus distal femur (mLDFA ≤  85 °) <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> MPS I and a varus distal femur (mLDFA ≥  91 °) <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> MPS II.|$|R

30|$|It {{might be}} that genetic and {{geographic}} differences {{play a role in}} the differences between the groups, mainly in the histological type of the Lymphoma. T-cell Lymphomas, for instance, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Asia, while the B-cell Lymphomas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Western countries (Rüdiger et al. 2002).|$|R
5|$|Entoloma sinuatum {{is fairly}} common and {{widespread}} across North America {{as far south}} as Arizona. It also occurs throughout Europe and the British Isles including Ireland, though it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest. In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region, and Adıyaman Province in Turkey, Iran, and northern Yunnan in China.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious {{neurological}} disorders affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|In Europe it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{northern}} than south Europe, {{and it has}} {{not been}} reported from south and west Europe. In addition to being common in Scandinavian countries, it has been collected in Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, and Korea. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska, where it is usually found above the tree line.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{tree species}} include the Douglas fir, the state tree, {{as well as}} redwood, ponderosa pine (generally east of the Cascades), western red cedar, and hemlock.

5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, {{which usually}} {{originates}} in peripheral lung tissue. Although most cases of adenocarcinoma {{are associated with}} smoking, adenocarcinoma {{is also the most}} common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{prognosis}} {{is good in}} most patients, with one study showing recovery occurring in 94% and 89% of children and adults, respectively (some having needed treatment). In children under ten, the condition recurs in {{about a third of}} all cases and usually within the first four months after the initial attack. Recurrence <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> older children and adults.|$|E

5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus {{is common}} in {{northern}} temperate regions of Europe, and has also been collected in Australia, New Zealand, Anatolia, Japan, and China. In North America, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the east than the west; the mushroom's northern range extends to Alaska, {{and it has been}} collected as far south as Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep farming <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the northwestern provinces of the country, where such tracts of land exist. China does have a native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E
30|$|Alcohol {{drinking}} {{is a minor}} problem as it was detected in {{a small group of}} all cases yet its association with traumatic death was significantly higher than natural death and <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> males. Traumatic death <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> females. The study also revealed that traumatic causes of death decreased significantly with advancing age.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{brain tumors}} can occur at any age, from infancy to late in life. These tumors often afflict people during their prime years. Factors such as age, tumor location, and {{clinical}} presentation are helpful in differential diagnosis. Most types of primary brain tumors <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{men with the}} exception of meningiomas, which <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> women.|$|R

5|$|Tinnitus is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that can result {{from a number of}} {{underlying}} causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> those with depression.|$|E
5|$|Within nations, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> higher {{socioeconomic}} groups. Males {{and females}} are affected in an equal ratio, and the peak age of onset between 10 and 19 years. About 80% {{of people with}} aphthous stomatitis first developed the condition {{before the age of}} 30. There have been reports of ethnic variation. For example, in the United States, aphthous stomatitis may be three times more common in white-skinned people than black-skinned people.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period}} of time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E
