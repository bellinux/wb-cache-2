25|$|Thirty-two out of {{two hundred}} girls {{eventually}} made it from the local recall shows to Majorca, Spain to get trained in singing, dancing, and fitness. While the judges continued eliminating two or three girls each day {{with the help of}} choreographer Detlef Soost and British vocal coach Robert Bicknel, eleven finalists remained and were sent home to prepare. After a final elimination round, Nadja Benaissa, Lucy Diakovska, Sandy Mölling, Vanessa Petruo and Jessica Wahls were chosen, and signed a recording contract with Polydor. Managed by Joy Berhanu during their first year, the girls were named No Angels following a public televoting and moved in together near Munich. With the final members of the group in place, the program followed the group during its recording sessions, photo and music video shoots and other promotional commitments such as showcases and instores. The show concluded with the band's first public live performance at The Dome at the <b>Dortmunder</b> Westfalenhalle in February 2001.|$|E

It made its North American debut with a performance by the San Diego Symphony on July 21 at the Copley Symphony Hall, followed by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra on July 23 at the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall and the San Francisco Symphony on July 27 at the Davies Symphony Hall. Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was present for concert and audience Q sessions at both the California shows, the concert in San Francisco boasted a crowd of over 2,700 and made it the largest ever audience for a single performance produced by Merregnon Studios. The Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra in New Zealand performed two concerts, taking place on October 21 and 22. While the only planned 2017 performance of the full concert is in Hong Kong on November 22 and 23 at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre by the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, [...] parts of the programme have been presented by the Munich Radio Orchestra at the Prince Regent Theatre Munich on February 1, the London Symphony Orchestra at the Philharmonie de Paris on June 18 and the Württembergische Philharmonie Reutlingen at the Stadthalle Reutlingen on October 26 at the Symphonic Selections concerts. 2018 performances of Final Symphony include a March 2 concert at the Laeiszhalle in Hamburg, Germany, a March 4 concert at the Berliner Philharmonie in Berlin, a March 14 concert at the Philharmonie München in München, and a March 17 concert at the Konzerthaus in Vienna, all performed by the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg. Planned Symphonic Selections concerts including Final Symphony arrangements are one on February 4 at the Liederhalle in Stuttgart by the Württembergische Philharmonie Reutlingen again, and one on June 11 at the Theater Dortmund by the <b>Dortmunder</b> Philharmoniker.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of a}} Kriegsmarine competition, prototypes for a {{prefabricated}} [...] "heavy landing bridge" [...] or jetty (similar {{in function}} to later Allied Mulberry Harbours) were designed and built by Krupp Stahlbau and <b>Dortmunder</b> Union and successfully overwintered in the North Sea in 1941–42. Krupp's design won out, as it only required one day to install, as opposed to twenty-eight days for the <b>Dortmunder</b> Union bridge. The Krupp bridge consisted {{of a series of}} 32m-long connecting platforms, each supported on the seabed by four steel columns. The platforms could be raised or lowered by heavy-duty winches in order to accommodate the tide. The German Navy initially ordered eight complete Krupp units composed of six platforms each. This was reduced to six units by the autumn of 1941, and eventually cancelled altogether when it became apparent that Sea Lion would never take place.|$|E
50|$|Very {{little is}} known of <b>Dortmunder's</b> childhood. It is {{mentioned}} {{in more than one}} book that he was abandoned at birth and raised in an orphanage in the fictional town of Dead Indian, Illinois, run by the Bleeding Heart Sisters of Eternal Misery.|$|R

She has since moved in with Andy and has accepted his unusual lifestyle.|$|R
5000|$|Judson [...] "The Kid" [...] Blint: Introduced in Watch Your Back. Determined to {{meet the}} mysterious and elusive J. C. Taylor (see below), Judson arrived unannounced at her offices looking for a job. J. C. {{immediately}} saw through him and his fake résumé, but sensed his potential and hired him as her assistant {{to take over the}} day-to-day running of her mail-order scams. He originally joined <b>Dortmunder's</b> gang as something of a mascot/protégé, but by the time of Get Real has been accepted as one of them (even if he hasn't yet settled on what he drinks at the OJ).|$|R
2500|$|In mid-1942, {{both the}} Krupp and <b>Dortmunder</b> prototypes were {{shipped to the}} Channel Islands and {{installed}} together off Alderney, where they were used for unloading materials needed to fortify the island. Referred to as the [...] "German jetty" [...] by local inhabitants, they remained standing for the next thirty-six years until demolition crews finally removed them in 1978–79, a testament to their durability.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 Hansa lager was launched, brewed under licence from <b>Dortmunder</b> Actien Brauerei. Camerons spent £2 {{million to}} upgrade their brewing {{facilities}} in order to brew bottom fermented lager, in what CAMRA described as [...] "the most ambitious [...] for a regional brewer yet". The company had sales of £51 million in 1981, and one per cent of the British beer market. Market share in the Tees Valley area was 25 per cent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dortmunder</b> Export or <b>Dortmunder</b> is a pale lager {{originally}} brewed by <b>Dortmunder</b> Union in Dortmund, Germany, in 1873. A soft-textured beer {{influenced by}} the Pilsner lager brewed in Pilsen, it became popular with industrial workers and was responsible for <b>Dortmunder</b> Union becoming Germany's largest brewery and Dortmund having the highest concentration of breweries in Germany. With the decline of heavy industry in the area, the sales of <b>Dortmunder</b> also declined until, by 1994, the Dortmund Union brewery had shut down, and merged with several other Dortmund breweries to form Brinkhoff's Brewery.|$|E

5000|$|Fred Eckhardt in A Treatise on Lager Beers, {{published}} in 1969, {{set out the}} view that <b>Dortmunder</b> is a distinctive enough pale lager to be classed as a separate beer style. Michael Jackson and Roger Protz continued the trend, although with a certain faint heart, uneasy at pinning down exactly the distinctive nature of the beer. Beers described as <b>Dortmunder</b> or <b>Dortmunder</b> Export are also brewed in Denmark, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, Sweden and the US, such as <b>Dortmunder</b> Gold by Great Lakes Brewing Company in Cleveland, Ohio. [...] and [...] "Grandpa Tractor" [...] by Barley Forge Brew Co. in Costa Mesa, CA. Brewers outside of Germany who brew beers they term <b>Dortmunder</b> will tend to brew a pale lager with a soft, rounded character.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dortmunder</b> Hansa {{refers to}} a number of beers from Dortmund, Germany, brewed by <b>Dortmunder</b> Hansa Brewery, a {{division}} of <b>Dortmunder</b> Actien Brauerei. Its popularity is due in some part to its low price. Hansa brews a variety of beers, including Pilsener, Altbier, Malzbier, Kölsch and wheat beer. Because of its low price, Hansa Pils is often used in Radler. The low price also led to its popularity in the punk subculture in Germany.|$|E

5000|$|The Westlake novel The Hot Rock (1970) was {{originally}} intended to feature Parker, but the plot, which involves a precious gem that is stolen, lost, stolen again, lost again, and so on seemed too comic a situation for the hard-boiled Parker, so Westlake rewrote the novel with a more bumbling and likable cast of characters, including John <b>Dortmunder,</b> who is Parker seen through a comic mirror. The third <b>Dortmunder</b> novel, Jimmy the Kid (1974), features a plot in which <b>Dortmunder</b> and his associates base a kidnapping on a plan from a (fictitious) Parker novel called Child Heist. Good Behavior (1985) {{was originally}} intended as the seventeenth Parker novel following Butcher's Moon (1974), but, like The Hot Rock, was rewritten for <b>Dortmunder.</b> Good Behavior bore the dedication [...] "To P., 1962-1974"—the dates the original Parker novels were published.|$|E

5000|$|Why Me? (1990) stars Christopher Lambert as <b>Dortmunder,</b> renamed [...] "Gus Cardinale".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dortmunder</b> is {{tall with}} stooped {{shoulders}} and [...] "lifeless thinning hair-colored hair" [...] {{and has a}} disreputable [...] "hangdog" [...] face which rarely smiles. He shares an apartment with longtime girlfriend May Bellamy, a supermarket cashier, in Manhattan on East 19th Street. Unlike Parker, however, <b>Dortmunder</b> is a nonviolent character who devises schemes that are usually outlandish and over-the-top.|$|E
5000|$|Andy Kelp: All-purpose crook Andy Kelp is Dortmunder's best friend, though <b>Dortmunder</b> {{would be}} the first to deny this. Cheerful and optimistic where <b>Dortmunder</b> is dour and relentlessly pessimistic, Kelp is boundlessly {{enthusiastic}} and full of (sometimes questionable) ideas. In appearance, he is shorter than <b>Dortmunder,</b> has a pointy nose, has birdlike mannerisms, and looks [...] "like a cockney pickpocket" [...] (Nobody's Perfect). An experienced thief, Kelp has a notable penchant for stealing cars with M.D. plates, his reasoning being that doctors have both the money and the ego to provide themselves with the very best. Kelp also loves to adopt the newest electronic gadgets, generally to Dortmunder's disgust. Because Kelp has brought <b>Dortmunder</b> many eventually unsuccessful jobs (or jobs that promised great payment but which dismally disappoint all members of the [...] "string"), <b>Dortmunder</b> has been known to call Kelp a jinx. However, <b>Dortmunder</b> is generally loyal to Kelp throughout the series, even if he sometimes finds him exasperating (especially as Kelp has developed the habit of picking the lock on John's apartment door and entering without knocking or ringing the doorbell first). Kelp has an older sister, whose adult son Victor (a former FBI agent who wanted the FBI to have a secret handshake) plays a role in some of the gang's misadventures (Bank Shot and Nobody's Perfect). Although unmarried over the course of the series, Kelp is known to have had at least two prior marriages, presumably dissolved.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} {{something}} almost always goes wrong with Dortmunder's jobs, {{in spite of}} careful planning, has given him {{the reputation of being}} jinxed — and despite claiming not to be superstitious, <b>Dortmunder</b> has believed so, too. In fact, <b>Dortmunder</b> gets worried when things go smoothly and seems relieved when something does go wrong. In most novels, Dortmunder's team earn only small amounts of money; the resultant heists, therefore, are only Pyrrhic victories, and the moral for the reader is that Crime Does Not Pay ... at least not very well. However, <b>Dortmunder</b> is not always unlucky, and in some novels and stories he and his crew make out quite well.|$|E
