40|$|Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a valuable tool to apply the ecosystem approach while {{the amount of information}} needed to manage systems in a sustainable way is often perceived as insufficient. Our study provides information on how scientific data can be used and {{on how to deal with}} the complexity of the system. The strategy focuses on small-scale, short-term studies on a limited set of organisms. Organisms investigated are chosen because of their supposed horizontal and vertical links with other (groups of) organisms and because of their (direct or indirect) economic value. This strategy was applied for the Belgian part of the North Sea using the bioengineering polychaete Lanice conchilega. The ecological importance of this species relates to its modulation mechanisms (such as the elevation, the consolidation of the sediment, the spatial extent and the patchiness). Increased habitat complexity provides favourable conditions for other infaunal species. These species attract on their turn other predatory infauna. The analyses of the associated species indicate that biodiversity and productivity increase in areas where L. conchilega occurs (species richness increases with factor three, while the macrobenthic density is seven times higher). Analyses for the Belgian part of the North Sea show that L. conchilega shapes the community composition by expanding the realized niche of species that otherwise occur in low densities. Besides the horizontal and vertical interaction within the benthic ecosystem, interactions with other ecosystem components may occur. Therefore, the interaction with juvenile flatfish (often species of high commercial value) and the resilience of the particular L. conchilega system to beam trawl flatfish fisheries is being investigated in a set of laboratory experiments. Results show that L. conchilega is relatively resistant to <b>intermediate</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure. However, species that are strongly associated with the L. conchilega aggregations are greatly impacted after fisheries disturbance. Intertidal field experiments showed that the most dominant associated species Eumida sanguinea was impacted very severely and that also the conchilega is an example of ready-to-use information for the marine management of the soft-bottom area of concern...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} natural {{selection}} to drive local adaptation has been appreciated ever since Darwin. Whether human impacts can impede the adaptive process has received less attention. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying natural selection and harvest selection acting on a freshwater fish (pike) over four decades.

Moreover, non-linear natural selection tended to favour <b>intermediate</b> sized <b>fish</b> whereas the fishery targeted <b>intermediate</b> sized <b>fish</b> because the smallest and largest individuals were often not captured. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that natural selection and fishery selection often acted in opposite directions within this natural system.

We investigated the relation between erythrocyte (RBC) DHA and AA contents and neurological development, by assessment of General Movements (GMs), in populations with substantial differences in fish intakes. Methods: We included 3 -month-old breastfed infants of three Tanzanian tribes: Maasai (low fish, n = 5), Pare (<b>intermediate</b> <b>fish,</b> n = 32), and Sengerema (high fish, n = 60); and a Dutch population (low-intermediate, fish, n = 15).

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 3000 fishermen households surrounding 54 wetlands (Beels) of Assam. The fish diversity of the wetlands has been decreasing {{during the last few}} years due to some extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The total number of fish species recorded so far during the present study is 67 belonging to 21 families. Cyprinidae is the most dominant family represented by major group species (8), intermediate group species (3) and minor group species (12) of high commercial value. Among these three groups, the diversity of fish species is higher in the minor group fish. The present paper deals with the economic condition of the fishermen who mainly fish in the wetlands. The economic condition of the fishermen community is found very poor. The income of fishermen varies from Rs. 4. 478 to Rs. 7, 484 per annum. A regression analysis shows that the income of fishermen is not dependent alone on the fish production but it is exclusively dependent on the value of the fish catch.

40|$|Plerocercoids of the {{tapeworm}} Ligula intestinalis (Cestoda: Bothriocephalidea) {{have been}} reported to inhibit gametogenesis of their <b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> hosts. However, mechanistic studies are rare and the proximate cues leading to impaired reproduction still remain unknown. In the present study we investigated the effects of infection by L. intestinalis on reproductive parameters of roach (Rutilus rutilus, Cyprinidae), a common fish host of this parasite. Field studies on roach demonstrated that in both genders infection prevented gonad development. As revealed by quantitative PCR, infection was accompanied by essentially lower pituitary expression of follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (FSHbeta) and luteinizing hormone beta-subunit (LHbeta) mRNA compared with uninfected roach, providing clear evidence for gonadotropin-insufficiency as the cause of arrested gametogenesis. Under controlled laboratory conditions infected roach showed lower mRNA levels of FSHbeta but not of LHbeta, despite histology revealing similar gonad stages as in uninfected conspecifics. These findings indicate the involvement of FSH rather than LH in mediating effects of infection early during gonad development in roach. Moreover, the impact of L. intestinalis on reproductive parameters of roach appeared to be independent of the parasite burden. Together, these data provide valuable information on the role of FSH and LH as mediators of parasite-induced sterilization in a vertebrate and implicate the selective inhibition of host reproduction by L. intestinalis as a natural source of endocrine disruption in fish. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to see if {{differences}} in the transfer and behaviour of Cs in fishes can be found in large fishery areas. Based on watercourses the country can be divided into eight large areas. The study is focused mainly to four of these areas, most important for freshwater fishing in Finland and based on long-term ana lysing programmes of freshwater fishes carried out after the Chernobyl deposition in each area. Deposition from Chernobyl was distributed most unevenly in Finland. Average depositions of 1 3 7 C s to the areas studied varied from 4 kBq/m 2 to 34 kBq/m 2. The transfer of 3 7 Cs into fishes differed somewhat in various areas. Regional averages of 1 3 7 Cs in fishes per unit deposition varied between 0. 04 to 0. 2 m 2 /kg. Average concetration ratios of 1 3 7 Cs in preda tory, non-predatory and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> and water were 7000, 2400 and 6200, respectively, in 1998. After peak values 1 3 7 Cs in fishes decreases with a half-life of 2. 2 - 7. 5 years in the four large fishery areas. The type of the catchment plays an important role in the long-term behaviour of 1 3 7 Cs both in surface water and in fishes. 1...|$|R
40|$|Hosts can utilize {{different}} types of defense against the effects of parasitism, including avoidance, resistance, and tolerance. Typically, there is tremendous heterogeneity among hosts in these defense mechanisms that may be rooted in {{the costs associated with}} defense and lead to trade-offs with other life-history traits. Trade-offs may also exist between the defense mechanisms, but the relationships between avoidance, resistance, and tolerance have rarely been studied. Here, we assessed these three defense traits under common garden conditions in a natural host–parasite system, the trematode eye-fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum and its second <b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> host. We looked at host individuals originating from four genetically distinct populations of two closely related salmonid species (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar and sea trout, Salmo trutta trutta) to estimate the magnitude of variation in these defense traits and the relationships among them. We show species-specific variation in resistance and tolerance and population-specific variation in resistance. Further, we demonstrate evidence for a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. Our results suggest that the variation in host defense can at least partly result from a compromise between different interacting defense traits, the relative importance of which is likely to be shaped by environmental components. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering different components of the host defense system when making predictions on the outcome of host–parasite interactions...|$|R

Twelve ponds of 2. 5 -m depth were used in four treatments: (A) weekly fertilization with water addition; (B) weekly fertilization without water addition; (C) one early fertilization without water addition; and (D) fertilization frequency dependent on nutrient concentrations, without water addition. Sex-reversed Nile tilapia were stocked at 2 fish/m 2 with an initial weight of 15 g, and harvested after 234 d.

The GH response to DA was blocked by the D 1 antagonist (+) SCH 23390, confirming the involvement of D 1 receptors in DA-stimulated GH release. In studies using static incubation of pituitary cells, somatostatin, a known physiological GH-release inhibitor in the goldfish, abolished the GH response to DA. Intraperitoneal injection of apomorphine, a non-selective DA agonist, also increased the plasma GH levels and enhanced the linear body growth of goldfish.

40|$|Abstract Background Success of trophically {{transmitted}} parasites depends to a {{great extent}} on their ability to manipulate their intermediate hosts {{in a way that makes}} them easier prey for target hosts. Parasite-induced behavioural changes are the most spectacular and diverse examples of manipulation. Most of the studies have been focused on individual behaviour of hosts including fish. We suggest that agonistic interactions and territoriality in fish hosts may affect their vulnerability to predators and thus the transmission efficiency of trophically transmitted parasites. The parasite Diplostomum spathaceum (Trematoda) and juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were used to study whether infection can alter aggression rates and territorial behaviour of <b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> hosts. Results The changes in behaviour of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, infected with an eye fluke Diplostomum spathaceum (Trematoda), was monitored over the course of an experimental infection for 1. 5 months. At the beginning of their development, not yet infective D. spathaceum metacercariae decreased the aggressiveness of rainbow trout. By the time that metacercariae were fully infective to their definitive hosts, the aggressiveness increased and exceeded that of control fish. Despite the increased aggressiveness, the experimentally infected fish lost contests for a territory (dark parts of the bottom) against the control fish. Conclusions The results obtained indicate that the parasitized fish pay the cost of aggressiveness without the benefit of acquiring a territory that would provide them with better protection against predators. This behaviour should increase transmission of the parasite as expected by the parasite manipulation hypothesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of fish-borne trematodes (FBT), including Clonorchis sinensis, is still high in riverside {{areas of the}} Republic of Korea. The author reviewed the detection and identification methods, differential keys, <b>fish</b> <b>intermediate</b> hosts, and morphological characteristics of FBT metacercariae. FBT metacercariae found in freshwater fish are classified mainly into 4 families, i. e., Opisthorchiidae, Heterophyidae, Echinostomatidae, and Clinostomidae. The metacercariae of C. sinensis, found in 40 species of freshwater fish, are elliptical and 0. 15 - 0. 17 × 0. 13 - 0. 15 mm in size, have nearly equal sized oral and ventral suckers, brownish pigment granules, and an O-shaped excretory bladder. Their general morphologies {{are similar to those}} of Metorchis orientalis (except in the thickness of the cyst wall). Metagonimus spp. (M. yokogawai, M. takahashii, and M. miyatai) metacercariae are subglobular or disc-shaped, and 0. 14 - 0. 16 mm in diameter. They have yellow-brownish pigment granules, a ventral sucker deflectively located from median, and a V-shaped excretory bladder.

40|$|Mangroves and {{seagrass}} beds can harbour high {{densities of}} mostly juvenile fishes. It has therefore long been assumed that these habitats function as nursery areas. In the present thesis the nursery function of mangroves, seagrass beds and other shallow-water biotopes, located in sheltered inland bays, was studied on the Caribbean islands of Curaçao and Bonaire. The {{study shows that}} mangroves and seagrass beds are important nurseries for the juveniles of 17 fish species which live as adults on the coral reef. Inland bays lacking mangroves and seagrass beds show highly reduced densities or absence of the juveniles of these 17 fish species. Furthermore, Caribbean islands lacking inland bays with mangroves and seagrass beds show highly reduced densities of the adults of these 17 reef fish species on the coral reef. This {{may be explained by}} absence of suitable nursery areas for the juveniles. Presence of these fish species on the coral reef is thus associated with presence of mangroves and seagrass beds. These fish species show ontogenetic shifts in habitat utilisation; juveniles are found in shallow-water biotopes of the bays, <b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> are often found in the deeper channels of the bays, whereas adults are found on the reef.

40|$|Higher {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (LCP) in infant compared with maternal lipids at delivery is named biomagnification. The decline of infant and maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status during lactation in Western countries suggests maternal depletion. We investigated whether biomagnification persists at lifelong high fish intakes {{and whether the}} latter prevents a postpartum decline of infant and/or maternal DHA status. We studied 3 Tanzanian tribes with low (Maasai: 0 /week), intermediate (Pare: 2 - 3 /week), and high (Sengerema: 4 - 5 /week) fish intakes. DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) were determined in maternal (m) and infant (i) erythrocytes (RBC) during pregnancy (1 st trimester n = 14, 2 nd = 103, 3 rd = 88), and in mother-infant pairs at delivery (n = 63) and at 3 months postpartum (n = 104). At delivery, infants of all tribes had similar iRBC-AA which was higher than, and unrelated to, mRBC-AA. Transplacental DHA biomagnification occurred up to 5. 6 g% mRBC-DHA; higher mRBC-DHA was associated with "bioattenuation" (i. e., iRBC-DHA <mRBC-DHA). Compared to delivery, mRBC-AA after 3 months was higher, while iRBC-AA was lower. mRBC-DHA after 3 months was lower, while iRBC-DHA was lower (low <b>fish</b> intake), equal (<b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> intake), and higher (high fish intake) compared to delivery. We estimated that postpartum iRBC-DHA equilibrium is reached at 5. 9 g%, which corresponds to a mRBC-DHA of 6. 1 g% throughout pregnancy. Uniform high iRBC-AA at delivery might indicate the importance of intrauterine infant AA status. Biomagnification reflects low maternal DHA status, and bioattenuation may prevent intrauterine competition of DHA with AA.

Samples derived from non-pregnant adults (MA, HA, SE), pregnant women (MA, SA, SE), mother-infant couples at delivery (UK), infants at delivery and their lactating mothers at 3 days (MA, SA, SE), and lactating mothers at 3 months postpartum (SA, SE). Erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid (RBC-DHA) was determined as a proxy for fish intake. The mean +/- A SD 25 (OH) D of non-pregnant adults and cord serum were 106. 8 +/- A 28. 4 and 79. 9 +/- A 26. 4 nmol/L, respectively. Pregnancy, delivery, ethnicity (which we used as a proxy for sunlight exposure), RBC-DHA, and age were the determinants of 25 (OH) D. 25 (OH) D increased slightly with age. RBC-DHA was positively related to 25 (OH) D, notably 25 (OH) D- 2. Pregnant MA (147. 7 vs. 118. 3) and SE (141. 9 vs. 89. 0) had higher 25 (OH) D than non-pregnant counterparts (MA, SE). Infant 25 (OH) D at delivery in Ukerewe was about 65 % of maternal 25 (OH) D. Our ancient 25 (OH) D amounted to about 115 nmol/L and sunlight exposure, rather than fish intake, was the principal determinant.

40|$|Abstract: Fish {{maturation}} schedules {{vary greatly}} among systems and over time, reflecting both plastic and adaptive re-sponses to ecosystem structure, physical habitats, and mortality (natural and fishing). We examined maturation schedules of commercially exploited lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in the Laurentian Great Lakes (Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior) by estimating ages and lengths at 50 % maturity, age-specific maturity ogives (age-specific probabil-ity of being mature), and probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs; a metric {{that accounts for}} effects of growth and mortality). Collectively, these estimates indicated variation in maturation schedules between sexes (i. e., males tend to mature at younger ages and shorter lengths than females) and among systems (midpoint estimates of PMRNs were smallest for Lake Michigan <b>fish,</b> <b>intermediate</b> for <b>fish</b> in the main basin of Lake Huron, and largest for fish in Lake Huron’s Geor-gian Bay and Lake Superior). Temporally, recent increases in age at 50 % maturity in Lakes Huron and Michigan may pri-marily reflect plastic responses to decreased growth rates associated with ecosystem changes (e. g., declines of the native amphipod, Diporeia spp.). As plastic and adaptive changes in maturation schedules of fish stocks may occur simultane-ously and require different management considerations, we recommend the concomitant analysis of multiple maturation in-dices.

Pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments with 7 replications per treatment. There were 5 replications with 7 pigs per pen and 2 replications with 6 pigs per pen. Pigs and feeders were weighed on d 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G. A 2 -phase diet series was used, with treatment diets fed from d 0 to 14 and a common diet fed from d 14 to 28. All diets were in meal form. For the 6 dietary treatments, the fish meal was included at: 4. 50, 3. 60, 2. 70, 1. 80, 0. 90, and 0. 00 % respectively. Crystalline lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, and valine all increased as fish meal decreased to maintain minimum amino acid ratios. Also, increasing amounts of glutamine and glycine were used in diets containing 3. 60 % to 0. 00 % fish meal to maintain a lysine-to-CP ratio. From d 0 to 14, {{there was no difference}} (P > 0. 29) in ADG, ADFI, or F/G as the level of fish meal decreased and crystalline amino acids increased.

For F/G, a quadratic effect (P < 0. 04) was detected, which was the result of small improvements in F/G at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fish</b> meal levels (2. 70 and 1. 80). In conclusion, these data suggest that crystalline amino acids, when balanced for minimum amino acid ratios, can be used to replace fish meal in diets for 15 - to 25 -lb pigs...|$|R
40|$|Reservoirs are the {{predominant}} standing {{water in the}} prairie regions of North America and provide major sport fishing opportunities. Reservoirs are young aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates trophic dynamics of reservoirs from three different perspectives: littoral productivity by morphometry and hydrological regimes in reservoirs; zooplankton development and production in a new reservoir; and the impact on growth and recruitment of a top predatory fish lacking appropriate food resources. Water level fluctuations significantly reduce littoral productivity and shift trophic energy flows towards pelagic resources. Pelagic production is positively influenced by appropriate nutrients and increased water residence time. A lack of <b>intermediate</b> zooplanktivorous <b>fish</b> species weakens the link between pelagic primary production and higher trophic levels. The resulting simplified food webs reduce growth and recruitment of top predatory fish. Thus, management must consider introducing species capable of linking the various resources within a reservoir to optimize the fishery potential...|$|R
2500|$|Although most anglers {{keep their}} catch for consumption, catch and release fishing is {{increasingly}} practised, especially by fly anglers. The general principle is that releasing fish {{allows them to}} survive, thus avoiding unintended depletion of the population. For species such as marlin, muskellunge, and bass, there is a cultural taboo among anglers against taking them for food. In {{many parts of the}} world, size limits apply to certain species, meaning fish below a certain size must, by law, be released. It is generally believed that larger fish have a greater breeding potential. Some fisheries have a slot limit that allows the taking of smaller and larger fish, but requiring that <b>intermediate</b> sized <b>fish</b> be released. It is generally accepted that this management approach will help the fishery create a number of large, trophy-sized fish. [...] In smaller fisheries that are heavily fished, catch and release {{is the only way to}} ensure that catchable fish will be available from year to year.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} how condition (weight at length) of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss varied {{in relation to}} availability of drifting invertebrates and temperature at two locations over four seasons in the Green River, Utah. Food availability (daytime drift density) varied more than 17 -fold across sites and seasons, and rainbow trout experienced an 11 °C range in mean monthly temperature. Both rainbow trout gut fullness and condition increased as joint, nonlinear functions of increasing food availability and increasing temperature. Variation in condition decreased with fish size, although condition of <b>intermediate</b> sized <b>fish</b> was most strongly related to variation in food and temperature. Observed relationships between rainbow trout condition, drift abundance, and temperature were qualitatively consistent with bioenergetic models that predict fish growth should vary as a joint function of food and temperature. However, the inferred temperature optima for rainbow trout seemed to be significantly higher than predicted. Our results support {{a growing body of}} evidence that stream trout may be frequently food-limited in nature...|$|R
