5|$|The Main Stand {{houses the}} VIP area, {{directors}} box and various suites. The Tranmere suite {{was added to}} the Main Stand in 1988, with the Dixie Dean suite, Bunny Bell bar and Dave Russell restaurant added soon after.

5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as too <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would {{have pushed the}} budget to $50million.

5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, {{the use of the}} drug {{increased}} dramatically {{in other parts of the}} world in that decade. In areas where use of the drug has become common, meth mouth is often widespread. The condition is <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by the Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, the British {{upper class}} was in decline as the reduced {{workforce}} meant servants were less in supply and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became more <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> service and consequently many {{were converted to}} foreign embassies. The 2nd Duke of Westminster decided to demolish Grosvenor House and build Bourdon House in its place. Mayfair attracted commercial development after much of the City of London was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area. Several historically important houses were demolished, including Aldford House, Londonderry House and Chesterfield House.|$|E

5|$|Henry Cameron's platinotype {{reproductions of}} {{the first version of}} Hope had {{circulated}} since the painting's exhibition, but were slow to produce and <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> buy. From the early 1890s photographer Frederick Hollyer produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1818, Calhoun {{approved}} {{an expedition}} to build a military outpost near the present site of Bismarck, North Dakota on the Yellowstone River; Johnson awarded the contract to his brother James.

5|$|In 1992, the {{transport}} authorities of Oslo decided to close Nordberg and Frøen stations, {{on the grounds}} that these stations were too <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> maintain.

5|$|In {{addition}} to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for eighty years, housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles {{a few years after}} its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> maintain.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> buy and maintain and more <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
