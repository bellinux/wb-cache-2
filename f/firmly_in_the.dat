5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which would place the courtyard <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds {{to cover the costs}} incurred trying to redeem the courtyard. His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.|$|E
5|$|The uranography of Andromeda has {{its roots}} most <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's {{location}} had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy. The stars that make up Pisces and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess, sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady of the Heavens.|$|E

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E
5|$|She {{is placed}} <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary {{conceptions of the}} late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to {{the diameter of the}} tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are <b>firmly</b> rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While {{it can be argued that}} White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were <b>firmly</b> rooted <b>in</b> their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained <b>firmly</b> rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century.|$|R

5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|When Giuliano della Rovere {{was elected}} Pope Julius II in 1503, {{he issued a}} bull annulling any papal {{election}} brought about by simony, and defrocking and excommunicating any cardinal who sold his vote. Although the twenty-six day reign of Pope Pius III intervened between Alexander VI and Julius II, the alleged unscrupulousness of the Borgia pope was still <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> institutional memory of the Roman Curia. While Cardinal {{during the reign of}} Alexander VI, Julius II had been assailed politically and often militarily outside the sturdy wall of his Castle of Ostia.|$|E

Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état. Chad {{is one of the}} poorest and most corrupt countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers. Since 2003 crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry.|$|E

5|$|By seven-thirty, {{the town}} was <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Major-General Hunter's force. Almost the {{entirety}} of the Mahdist garrison, excepting the cavalry, had been slain in desperate combats throughout the settlement. However, a few isolated pockets of Mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses, violently refusing to give up the fight. Six men sent to capture a Mahdist sniper's position in a small house near the river were each killed, forcing Hunter to invoke his artillery. The building was shelled to ruins, but the sniper survived, evidenced by the shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body. Finally, a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of the structure and the rubble fell silent, though the sniper's body was never found. The local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during the battle, but played little role in its outcome.|$|E
5|$|By 1440 he was <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> king's favour, {{being made}} in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E
25|$|The Immigration Control Ordinance dealt {{exclusively}} with all non-Gibraltarians seeking {{a permit to}} enter and reside in Gibraltar.

Louis Comfort Tiffany signed one of his Favrile glass windows inside.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used in the seat belt {{pre-tensioner}} system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines which rotate to take up the slack in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers <b>firmly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seat before a collision.|$|E
