40|$|Purpose: We {{hypothesize that}} the USP {{induction}} port may <b>de-agglomerate</b> carrier-free powder emitting from dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Methods: Aerosols emitting {{from a range}} of DPIs (Spinhaler ®, Turbuhaler ® and Osmohaler TM) and induction ports (USP throat, straight tube, Alberta idealized mouth-throat geometry (AG)) were sized by laser diffraction. Total drug recovery was obtained by HPLC and fine particle fraction computed. Air flow patterns were simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Results: The straight tube did not <b>de-agglomerate</b> emitted powder. However, the USP throat and AG further de-agglomerated powders from the Spinhaler, but not the Turbuhaler and Osmohaler. While budesonide powder deposited similarly in all induction ports, deposition was significantly higher in the AG for both DSCG and mannitol. CFD revealed agglomerates impacting on the USP throat with higher localized velocity compared with the straight tube. CFD further showed a more complex flow pattern with high-velocity air jets in the AG, which explains the higher FPF for DSCG and the lower FPF for mannitol using the AG. Conclusion: The USP throat further de-agglomerated the emitted powder from the DPI when it did not sufficiently disperse the powder. Other tools such as laser diffraction may be used for cross-examining to avoid artifacts in the results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

A wrought magnesium alloy AM 30 was selected for processing with intensive melt shearing and subsequent twin-roll casting. AM 30 with additions of CaO and SiC were also processed by this route and the hardness and microstructure were investigated. Sheets were rolled and their tensile strength was determined.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} impaction on the aerosolperformance of pharmaceutical powders comprising smooth and rough-surfaced spherical particles was investigated. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{was chosen as}} a model drug and powders prepared using spray drying. Surface roughness and adhesion force properties of BSA were measured by atomic force microscopy. The aerosolperformance of the powders was assessed by impaction using a customised throat model built with specific mitre joints (0, 15, 45 and 90 °), coupled with a liquid impinger through a laser diffractometer. Results showed enhanced aerosolperformance of BSA by mechanical impaction, with the effect increasing with the impaction angle and being more pronounced with corrugated BSA. This is attributed to the lower cohesion force between the corrugated particles, enabling them to <b>de-agglomerate</b> more readily on impaction. In conclusion, impaction causes significantly better deagglomeration in corrugated particles than smooth particles. A combination of mechanical impaction and rough surface will help maximise the aerosolperformance of powders for inhalation drug delivery...|$|E

In this work, coating was done by wet method using ethanol. Ultrasonication was applied to NPCC to <b>de-agglomerate</b> micron size NPCC into smaller size. Effects of amplitude, temperature and energy input of ultrasonication was investigated. The amplitude was varied from 60 to 100 whereas temperature was varied from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C. The energy input was stressed up from 3. 6 kJ to 180 kJ. Mean diameter of NPCC were observed by using Particle Size Analyzer and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It was found that mean diameter of NPCC do not vary significantly with temperature. Mean diameter of NPCC, however, decreases exponentially with the energy input. Comparisons were done on NPCC coated with others methods such as dry ball milling and aqueous coating TEM images show that coating NPCC with ultrasonication is more uniform than other methods.

40|$|This thesis investigates how the {{properties}} of foams can be modulated {{by the addition of}} particles to the foam solution. As a model system hydrophobic and hydrophilic silica particles were used. The de-agglomeration of hydrophilic silica particles in water and surfactant solutions was studied. Two methods are investigated: ultrasound cavitation (UC) and mechanical agitation (MA). The efficiency of these two methods was compared with respect to their ability to produce foams and to <b>de-agglomerate</b> both hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica particles. The same particles were used as additions to protein and surfactant foaming solutions. In the experiments, the amount and types of particles, proteins and surfactants were varied in the foaming dispersions. Then UC and MA were used to foam the dispersions and the drainage, breakage and microstructure of the resulting foams were examined. In the protein foaming solutions, both casein and whey protein foams were considered. In the surfactant foaming solution, C 12 LAS and CTAB were used. Partially hydrophobic silica particles were used in pure water to generate foam. Foamability and foam stability both increased with increasing concentration of particles. Moderately hydrophobic particles gave optimum foamability whilst no foam could be produced with fully hydrophilic particles. In the foam rheology test, a transition from solid-like to liquid-like behaviour was found while the foam with addition of SCMC exhibited no such transition. ...|$|E

In this study we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} acoustic parameters of an inhalation are related to the PIFR and hence reflect drug delivery. Methods A sensitivity analysis of the relationship of the acoustics of inhalation to simultaneously recorded airflow, in a cohort of volunteers (n = 92) was performed. The Next Generation Impactor (NGI) was used to assess in vitro drug delivery from salmeterol/fluticasone and salbutamol Diskus (TM) DPIs. Fine particle fraction, FPF, (< 5 mu m) was measured at 30 - 90 l/min for 2 - 6 s and correlated with acoustically determined flow rate (IFRc). In pharmacokinetic studies using a salbutamol (200 mu g) Diskus (TM), volunteers inhaled either at maximal or minimal effort on separate days. Results PIFRc was correlated with spirometrically determined values (R- 2 = 0. 88). In in vitro studies, FPF increased as both flow rate and inhalation duration increased for the salmeterol/fluticasone Diskus (TM) (Adjusted R- 2 = 0. 95) and was proportional to flow rate only for the salbutamol Diskus T (Adjusted R- 2 = 0. 71).

40|$|Incorporation {{of carbon}} {{nanotubes}} (CNT) into polymers is attractive {{due to the}} generally good processability of polymers and unprecedented properties of nanotubes. In this work, preparation and matrix known earlier but not employed so-far for nanocomposites are studied towards enhanced mechanical and electrical performances. For another CNT composite, the photorefractive behaviour is studied. Commercial single-wall (SWNT) and multi-wall nanotubes (MWNT) grown by arc discharge and Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) of diameter 1. 4 nm (average value) and 10 - 30 nm, respectively, were used. They were purified and functionalised by acid reflux, and characterised by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). From the C 1 s spectrum, the peak corresponding to carboxylic group increased from 7 % (for as–received) to 16 %, and similarly from 0 % to 9 %, for oxidised MWNT and SWNT, respectively. The presence of carboxylic moieties {{plays a role in}} the composite preparation and properties. Films containing 0 - 1. 5 wt% CNT were synthesized by hot pressing from melamine-formaldehyde (MF) with -cellulose, using a film stacking route with layered cellulose, and using milled cellulose. Sonication, mechanical mixing and surfactant assistance were used in the low viscosity (~ 30 mPa·s) aqueous MF solution to <b>de-agglomerate</b> and disperse the nanotubes. Electron and optical microscopy was performed to observe the morphology. Also, composites containing 0. 2 - 0. 3 wt% untreated SWNT in aromatic polyimide (API) were prepared by coating. Obtained results for both, SWNT and MWNT MF composites demonstrate that improvements in stiffness and strength, practically without embrittlement (MWNT), can be achieved; for example improvements by around 40 - 50 % at 0. 1 wt% CNT. Continuum mechanics calculations of the modulus gave underestimated values. Superior stiffening of the structure is explained in terms of constituents linking (immobilisation). Conductive behaviour was found for SWNT/MF at filler content > 1 wt% and > 1. 5 wt% (MWNT), and statically dissipative behaviour for CNT/cellulose/MF at filler content > 0. 05 wt%. From the percolation theory, a threshold of 0. 13 wt% (SWNT) and 0. 2 wt% (MWNT) were calculated. For SWNT/API, improvement in the photorefractive performance was observed at 1062 nm wavelength with 0. 25 wt% CNT. The gain coefficient of 90 cm- 1 and net gain coefficient of 65 cm- 1 at 80 V/μm were obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of {{a small amount of}} liquid to a granular system can dramatically change the flow dynamics including the flowability, tensile strength, and segregation. Such liquid-coated particles coated are common in nature (e. g. avalanches, pollen capture) and in industry (e. g. granulation, particle filtration). Despite their ubiquity, predicting macro-scale (bulk) flows of liquid-coated particles is still elusive. A microscale (particle-level) investigation of the interactions of few wetted particles will lead to the identification of the dominant physical mechanisms which feeds into the understanding and modeling of bulk flows of wetted systems. Previous micro-scale studies of wetted particles have included experimental and theoretical efforts to study particle-wall collisions (both oblique and head-on) and particle-particle collisions (head-on only). Before using such micro-scale models to describe macro-scale flows, more general cases need to be first considered such as collisions between more than two particles and the rotational motion of agglomerates. The goal of this work is to address these two issues through a combination of experiments using a pendulum apparatus and theory. To investigate collisions between more than two particles, this work focuses on the normal (head-on) collision of three spheres. The foundation for such work is provided by first investigating analogous dry (non-wetted) systems. Experimental results are compared to soft-sphere models, which simultaneously account for all collisions, and a hard-sphere model, which treats the three-body collision as a series of two-body collisions. While the soft-sphere models generally predicts the post-collisional velocities better, the hard-sphere model exhibits a good comparison overall. In the wetted three-particle collisions, the pendulum apparatus is coined Stokes’s cradle for the Stokes flow in the liquid gap between the particles. In two-body collisions, only two outcomes exist, namely stick and bounce. But in three-particle collisions, four possible geometrical outcomes exist and using the model as a guide, all four outcomes are experimentally observed. Furthermore, this combination of experiments and theory led to the identification of the dominant physical mechanisms. First, due to the large pressures in the liquid gap, the fluid may undergo a glass transition at which point the particles reverse direction. Additionally, previous theories neglect the viscous resistance of the fluid as the particles move away from one another, since cavitation was assumed to occur. However, three-body experiments show definitively that the outbound resistance cannot be neglected. To investigate how rotational motion influences agglomeration, oblique collisions between two particles are performed. Whereas in normal collisions particles rebound only due to solid deformation, so-called centrifugal forces in oblique collisions produce a new outcome in which the particles initially form a rotating agglomerate, and then <b>de-agglomerate</b> at a later time. Furthermore, capillary forces play an essential role in oblique collisions even when the capillary number (viscous over capillary forces) is high. This recognition leads to the introduction of a dimensionless number, the centrifugal number (centrifugal over capillary forces), which together with the previously established Stokes number characterizes the regime map of outcomes for two-particle collisions...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{development}} in inhalation drug delivery {{over the past}} decade has led to the invention {{of a wide range of}} innovative dry powder inhaler systems. One such commercially available device is the Aerolizer, which utilises a spinning capsule for powder dispersion. Upon inhalation, the air flow entering the inhaler through the tangential air inlets acts to rotate the capsule at high speed, ejecting the drug powder into the surrounding flowfield. The <b>de-agglomerating</b> forces required to disperse the drug agglomerates are provided by the air flowfield generated within the device. However there is a distinct lack of knowledge in the literature examining how the flowfield generated in dry powder inhalers interacts with the drug agglomerates to generate respirable aerosol clouds.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the improvement on flowability of a model cohesive powder using two different types of fumed silica mixed by the dry coating method “mechanofusion” and to explore the relationship between flowability and surface free energy and/or wettability. The first aim was to find the optimum conditions for improving the flowability of a model cohesive powder, glass microspheres (DMV ~ 3. 5 µm), by mechanofusion with fumed silica. Conventional blending using tumbling was done as a comparison. Mechanofusion was conducted at three different speeds 1500, 3000 and 4500 rpm and at three concentrations of hydrophobic Aerosil®R 972 (1 %, 3 % and 5 % w/w) for 10 minutes, while conventional blending was performed at 72 rpm for 30 minutes. It was revealed that the optimum concentration to improve flowability was 1 % w/w Aerosil®R 972 for all processes utilized. Increasing the concentration of the fumed silica decreased the flowability at all speeds. This indicates the enhancement of flowability of this model cohesive powder depends on the concentration of guest particles. The influence of different speeds to the flowability was observed upon the increasing concentration of Aerosil®R 972 at 3 % and 5 % w/w. Mechanofusion was found to be a more effective mixing method compared to tumbling mixing presumably due to the higher energy applied that can <b>de-agglomerate</b> the cohesive microspheres. The second aim of this thesis was to determine the mechanism of action of the fumed silica in improving cohesive powder flow and to investigate the relationship between flowability and surface free energy and/or wettability. Hydrophilic fumed silica Cab-o-sil®M- 5, which has the same particles size as Aerosil®R 972, was used as a comparison. 1 % w/w Cab-o-sil®M- 5 failed to improve the flow of particles, whereas the same concentration of Aerosil®R 972 did. Powder wettability and surface free energy were derived from contact angle measurements of uncoated and coated particles. The capillary rise technique was used to measure powder contact angles. The water contact angle increased when the glass microspheres were coated with hydrophobic Aerosil®R 972, whereas it decreased when coated with hydrophilic Cab-o-sil®M- 5. However, the 1 -bromonaphthalene contact angle increased after coating with both types of fumed silica. The contact angle data was used to calculate the surface free energy of uncoated and coated particles. A decrease in dispersive and polar components of surface free energy was found in particles coated with hydrophobic fumed silica, while the surface free energy of particles coated with hydrophilic fumed silica reached the highest value. Particles with higher surface free energies had poorer flow than particles with lower surface free energies. Similarly, particles with a water contact angle less than 90 ° had lower flowability than particles with a water contact angle higher than 90 °. Therefore, this study found that the improvement of flowability of micronized cohesive particles can be achieved by mechanofusion provided the chosen guest particle has relatively low surface free energy and/or is hydrophobic. The outcomes of this thesis present an enhanced better understanding of improving the flowability of a cohesive powder using fumed silica. These findings may have future value for the development of improved solid formulation of pharmaceutical preparations with the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in micron size...|$|E

The adsorption of amphiphiles on the particle surface was indirectly determined by measuring the concentration of amphiphiles left in the bulk liquid media after 2 h mixing of the powder with the amphiphile. The bulk concentration was determined by removing the particles in a two-step centrifugation process (Z 513 K, Hermle Labortechnik GmbH, 4, 500 rpm, 1 h; 5417 R, Eppendorf AG, 15, 000 rpm, 20 min) and subsequently measuring the amphiphilic concentration in the supernatant solutions by potentiometric titratio...|$|R
40|$|As {{significant}} number of products manufactured for personal care/health care, either in the final stage or at some stage of their production, dispersion of particulate materials dispersed into liquid or solid vehicles, often at high volume fraction. The vast array of cosmetics/personal care and pharmaceutical products reveal the importance of adequate dispersion. With active pharmaceutical ingredients possessing poor aqueous solubility, optimal dispersion is necessary for maximizing the bioavailability and uniformity of dose. Fine particulate dry powders always contain agglomerates that require de-agglomeration and stabilization to obtain optimal dispersion. All particulate dispersion systems are inherently thermodynamically unstable. Unless properly stabilized, through the random motion of the particles over time, they will get aggregate due to the natural and dominant tendency to decrease the large specific surface area and excess surface energy. Adequate concentrations of wetting agents, <b>de-agglomerating</b> agents and stabilizers are required to produce stable particulate dispersions. The dispersion process is accomplished via three distinct steps: wetting the particulate material, de-agglomeration of the particles and stabilization of the same, and these steps should be performed in the correct {{order to get a}} stable product.

40|$|The {{deposition}} {{characteristics in}} lungs following inhalation, the potential toxic effects induced and the toxicokinetic fate including a possible translocation to other {{sites of the}} body are predominantly determined by the agglomeration status of nanoscaled primary particles. Systemic particle effects, i. e. effects on remote organs besides the respiratory tract {{are considered to be}} of relevant impact only for <b>de-agglomerated</b> particles with a nanoscaled aspect. Rats were exposed to various types of nanoscaled particles, i. e. titanium dioxide, carbon black and constantan. These were dispersed in physiologically compatible media, e. g. phosphate buffer, sometimes including auxiliaries. Rats were treated with aqueous nanoparticle dispersions by intratracheal instillation or were exposed to well-characterized nanoparticle aerosols. Subsequently, alterations in the particle size distribution were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) technique. Based on the results in various approaches, a tendency of nanoscaled particles to form larger size agglomerates following deposition and interaction with cells or the respiratory tract is predominant. The contrary trend, i. e. the increase of particle number due to a disintegration of agglomerates seems not to be of high relevance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{sonication}} {{process is}} commonly used for <b>de-agglomerating</b> and dispersing nanomaterials in aqueous based media, necessary to improve homogeneity and stability of the suspension. In this study, a systematic step-wise approach is carried out to identify optimal sonication conditions {{in order to achieve}} a stable dispersion. This approach has been adopted and shown to be suitable for several nanomaterials (cerium oxide, zinc oxide, and carbon nanotubes) dispersed in deionized (DI) water. However, with any change in either the nanomaterial type or dispersing medium, there needs to be optimization of the basic protocol by adjusting various factors such as sonication time, power, and sonicator type as well as temperature rise during the process. The approach records the dispersion process in detail. This is necessary to identify the time points as well as other above-mentioned conditions during the sonication process in which there may be undesirable changes, such as damage to the particle surface thus affecting surface properties. Our goal is to offer a harmonized approach that can control the quality of the final, produced dispersion. Such a guideline is instrumental in ensuring dispersion quality repeatability in the nanoscience community, particularly in the field of nanotoxicology...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{utilizing}} nanoparticles {{is that they are}} highly agglomerated and if used directly in a bulk composite, they often lose their high-surface area due to grain growth or unavailability of the high surface area where it matters. This NIRT project focuses on mixing of two (or more) nano-constituents at nano-scale in an environmentally benign manner. In well-mixed nano-particles at nano-scale, the loss of high surface area is prevented, and unique and special properties can be achieved due to the interactions of different phases at their interfaces in a nano-composite. Thus the ability to achieve nano-mixing can open up innovative ways to improve performance of drugs, biomaterials, catalysts and other high-value-added materials. The main objective of this project which involves an interdisciplinary team of researchers at four Universities is to address the overall problem of nano-particle de-agglomeration, mixing and characterization. The research tasks include; measurements of the degree of de-agglomeration as a result of applying <b>de-agglomerating</b> forces, investigation of several different environmentally benign nano-particle mixing methods, as well as nano-mixing characterization techniques, and to develop a fundamental understanding of the de-agglomeration and mixing of two or more species of nano- particles through complimentary continuum and molecular dynamics modeling...|$|R
40|$|Functionalised polymer {{composites}} and blends {{were prepared}} {{with the aim}} of enhancing the mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer matrix, while maintaining the characteristic property (functionality) of the introduced functional group. This involved the use of nanoparticles with novel architecture (core cross-linked star polymers, POSS-functionalised dendrimers, telechelic POSS) to provide attributes for improving mechanical and thermal stability, in addition to physical aging stability and phase selectivity. Furthermore, nanoparticles were functionalised to provide attributes such as colour (dye-functionalised POSS) and magnetism (magnetite-functionalised carbon nanotubes). These nanoparticles were investigated in amorphous polymer matrices, with structure-property relationships explored. Core cross-linked star (CCS) increased the glass transition temperature (Tg) and decreased shrinkage of linear polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate). This was attributed to reduced volume within the blends and CCS polymer ‘arms’ imparting restrictions on segmental motions of polymer chains. These restrictions also enhanced thermomechanical properties and retarded structural relaxation. Volume relaxation was successfully observed in real time, creating a novel application for modulated temperature – thermomechanometry. POSS-functionalised dendrimers and telechelic POSS enhanced the thermal and mechanical properties of their respective elastomer matrices. Phase preference was successfully achieved via compatibilising ‘R’ groups on the POSS. Colour intensity was able to be controlled by altering the dye-functionalised POSS concentration. Material properties were influenced by filler concentration, phase preference and POSS architecture. Films became more magnetic with increasing carbon nanotube/magnetite concentration and films displayed superior mechanical and thermal properties. Melt-mixing was more effective at <b>de-agglomerating</b> and distributing functionalised CNTs than solvent dispersion. As a result, melt-mixed composites exhibited more dramatic changes in material properties and displayed superior magnetic, mechanical and thermal properties than their solvent dispersed counterparts...|$|R

A commercially available powder was added to propan- 2 -ol and dispersed using a magnetic stirrer, a high frequency 850 kHz ultrasonic cell, a standard 40 kHz bath and a 20 kHz ultrasonic probe. The particle size of the powder was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Z-Average diameters (mean cluster size based on the intensity of scattered light) and intensity, volume and number size distributions were monitored {{as a function of}} time and energy input. Low frequency ultrasound was found to be more effective than high frequency ultrasound at <b>de-agglomerating</b> the powder and dispersion with a 20 kHz ultrasonic probe was found to be very effective at breaking apart large agglomerates containing weakly bound clusters of nanoparticles. In general, the breakage of nanoclusters was found to be a factor of ultrasonic intensity, the higher the intensity the greater the de-agglomeration and typically micron sized clusters were reduced to sub 100 nm particles in less than 30 min using optimum conditions. However, there came a point at which the forces generated by ultrasonic cavitation were either insufficient to overcome the cohesive bonds between smaller aggregates or at very high intensities decoupling between the tip and solution occurred. Absorption spectroscopy indicated a copper core structure with a thin oxide shell and the catalytic performance of this dispersion was demonstrated by drop coating onto substrates and subsequent electroless copper metallization. This relatively inexpensive catalytic suspension has the potential to replace precious metal based colloids used in electronics manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesise}} nanopowders by laser pyrolysis in order to elaborate Si 3 N 4 -SiC nanocomposites exhibiting a high ductility at high temperature. The synthesis of SiCN and SiCNYAlO nanopowders with a good thermal stability has been developed from a liquid mixture based on hexamethyldisilazane with a gaseous precursor (silane, SiH 4) and ammonia. Si 3 N 4 -SiC nanocomposites exhibiting almost theoretical density have been elaborated by hot pressing under 35 MPa at 1600 °C either from SiCNYAlO nanopowders or from SiCN nanopowders mixed with commercial sintering aids nanopowders (6 wt% yttria and 3 wt% alumina) in ethanol and <b>de-agglomerated</b> by milling with Si 3 N 4 balls. The densification behaviour is better for nanopowders containing in-situ additives. In addition, using prealloyed powders enables to simplify the elaboration process since the mixing step of the nanopowders is eliminated. The nanocomposites elaborated from the mixture (SiCN + commercial sintering aids) exhibit a different microstructure, depending on the drying process (under vacuum or in an oven) of the nanopowders after the mixing step: When drying was performed in a confined atmosphere, a noticeable amount of Si 2 N 2 O was detected in addition to â-Si 3 N 4 and the average grain size was 60 nm, whereas the crystalline phases were á- and â-Si 3 N 4, when the slurry was dried under vacuum and the average grain size was 200 nm. The creep behaviour of the two grades was assessed under compressive loading in air and the deformation appears strongly influenced by this change of the microstructure: A strong ductility was observed for the smallest grain size: a deformation as high as 45 % was measured under a compressive load of 180 MPa at 1350 °C under air...|$|R
