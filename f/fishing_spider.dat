25|$|A {{bolas spider}} is any of {{several species of}} orb-weaver spider that, instead of {{spinning}} the typical web, hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk {{on the end of}} a line, known as a 'bolas'. By swinging the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook. Because of this, they are also called angling or fishing spiders (although the remotely related genus Dolomedes is also called a <b>fishing</b> <b>spider).</b> The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone-analogues.|$|E
25|$|Four species {{occur in}} New Zealand. Two are widespread: the large Dolomedes aquaticus of open riverbanks, and the similar size Dolomedes dondalei or New Zealand forest <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> (once {{referred}} to as Dolomedes III), which specialises in forested riverbanks. The largest of the New Zealand species Dolomedes schauinslandi or Rangatira spider occurs in the Chatham Islands, where it occurs on rodent-free islands where running water is rare. The fourth species, D. minor, is also not restricted to rivers. Known as the nursery web spider, it makes white nursery webs on shrubs, but is still capable of fishing behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{species of}} Dolomedes exist in North America. [...] The six-spotted <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> (D. triton) lives {{primarily}} in small lakes and ponds. This spider consumes mostly water striders (pond skaters), {{but like all}} Dolomedes, it is an opportunistic ambush hunter that will eat anything that it can capture. [...] Other species include the bog-dwelling D. striatus, and four species living by streams: D. scriptus, D. vittatus, D. gertschi and D. holti. Two North American species, D. tenebrosus and D. okefinokensis, exhibit female giganticism and/or male dwarfism, with their males being {{less than half the}} size of the females. The ninth species is the arboreal D. albineus.|$|E
50|$|A phylogenetically diverse {{range of}} other native {{arthropods}} including <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders,</b> water beetles, water scorpions and dragonfly nymphs have also been observed to prey on cane toads metamorphs. In particular, dragonfly nymphs and <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> selectively attack toads over native frog species.|$|R

50|$|The six-spotted <b>fishing</b> <b>spider,</b> Dolomedes triton, is an {{arachnid}} {{from the}} {{nursery web spider}} family Pisauridae. This species is from the genus Dolomedes, the fishing spiders. This species of <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> is named after the mythological Greek god Triton who is the messenger of the big sea {{and the son of}} Poseidon. These spiders can be seen scampering along the water’s surface when a person walks by in which they are often referred to as dock spiders because they are often witnessed as they quickly vanish through the cracks of a boat dock.|$|E
50|$|Dolomedes aquaticus is a <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> {{that lives}} and hunts along the gravel banks of unforested New Zealand rivers. It prefers open riverbanks where it lives under rocks, usually less than 5 metres from the river. Its {{colouring}} {{allows it to}} blend in with river stones. Normally nocturnal, it sits and waits for its prey after dark, and can survive for short periods under the water.|$|E
50|$|With {{a typical}} body length of 1.5 to 4 cm, Ancylometes {{are among the}} largest araneomorph spiders (tarantulas and allies are mygalomorphs) and they are {{sometimes}} called giant <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> to separate them from the smaller Dolomedes <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders.</b> The largest Ancylometes is A. rufus where females have a body length of up to 5 cm and a leg span up to 12 cm, while males grow up to 3 cm in body length, but with longer legs than the female. Both sexes are brown with dark spots on the abdomen, with two thin lines along the carapace of the male.|$|R
5000|$|Dolomedes [...] is a genus {{of large}} spiders {{of the family}} Pisauridae. They are also known as <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders,</b> raft spiders, dock spiders or wharf spiders. Almost all Dolomedes species are semi-aquatic, with the {{exception}} of the tree-dwelling D. albineus of the southwestern United States. Many species have a striking pale stripe down each side of the body.|$|R
50|$|Their diet {{includes}} <b>fish,</b> <b>spider</b> monkeys, peccary, birds, wild pig, fruit, manioc and corn. A {{leading cause}} of illness and death within the tribe is by malaria. They have some knowledge of agriculture, making clearings for harvests of crops.|$|R
50|$|Thalassius albocinctus, {{commonly}} called the <b>fishing</b> <b>spider,</b> is {{a species of}} spider found in tropical Asia from India to the Philippines. It is named after its habit of catching small fish. The spider is striking in appearance and can be easily recognised {{by the presence of}} a black, glossy, broad median band bordered by a white lateral band on the cephalothorax and abdomen. The legs are long and yellowish brown. It is usually found near water.|$|E
50|$|Neustons, broadly defined, {{are made}} up of some species of fish (see flying fish), beetles (see whirligig beetle), protozoans, {{bacteria}} and spiders (see <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> and diving bell spider). Collembola in the genera Podura and Sminthurides are almost exclusively neustonic, while Hypogastrura species often aggregate on pond surfaces. A water strider, Gerris, is a common example of an insect that supports its weight on water's surface tension. By extension, the term may also refer to non-organismal floating aggregations (see, e.g., Great Pacific Garbage Patch).|$|E

5000|$|Dolomedes sulfureus is {{a species}} of venomous spiders {{commonly}} known as <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> belonging to a family of Dolomedes. They produce a venom that contains a group of neurotoxic peptides. [...] The species is found in Russia, China, Korea, and Japan.|$|R
50|$|Three of the <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> are {{widespread}} on the {{two main}} islands of New Zealand. Dolomedes aquaticus grows up to 7 cm across and specialises in open, unforested riverbanks, and lives under rocks within 5 m of the river. Another species of similar size, Dolomedes dondalei, specialises in forested riverbanks and is also widespread on the mainland. The third and most common species, Dolomedes minor, is not restricted to rivers. Known as the nursery web spider, it makes white nursery webs on shrubs, but is still capable of fishing behaviour. The largest of the New Zealand <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> is Dolomedes schauinslandi and occurs on South East and Mangere islands in the Chatham Islands.|$|R

2500|$|Rather than {{hunting on}} land or by waiting in a web, these spiders hunt {{on the water}} surface itself, preying on mayflies, other aquatic insects, and even small <b>fish.</b> For <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders,</b> the water surface serves the same {{function}} as a web does for other spiders. They extend their legs onto the surface, feeling for vibrations given off by prey.|$|R
50|$|There is good {{evidence}} for stereopsis throughout the animals kingdom. It occurs in many mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, <b>fish,</b> crustaceans, <b>spiders,</b> and insects.|$|R
5000|$|Nursery web spiders are spiders of {{the family}} Pisauridae. They {{resemble}} wolf spiders (family Lycosidae), but they carry their egg sacs by means of their jaws and pedipalps (instead of attaching them to their spinnerets). When the eggs are about to hatch, a mother spider builds a nursery [...] "tent", puts her egg sac inside, and mounts guard outside. The name [...] "nursery web spider" [...] is especially given to the European species Pisaura mirabilis, but the family also includes <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> and raft spiders.|$|R
50|$|Ancylometes is a <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> genus from Central and South America, {{where they}} live near ponds, lakes, rivers and other {{freshwater}} habitats. These spiders can walk over water rather quickly, in a fashion similar to water striders. This is because of fine air-trapping hairs on the tips of their legs. They can dive underwater, and will consume anything from insects to small lizards and fish. They can stay underwater for over an hour, using air trapped in hairs surrounding their book lungs as a physical gill. Ancylometes {{is one of only}} two known genera of spiders that can spin webs in water (the other being Argyroneta) and they do sometimes catch fish. However, they mostly catch fish by diving down or lying in wait until prey passes within striking distance. They do however consume them on the ground or above the water.|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{arthropod}} defensive chemistry {{continue to}} bring to light novel structures and unanticipated biosynthetic capabilities. Insect alkaloids, such as the heptacyclic acetogenin chilocorine and the azamacrolides, exemplify both of these aspects of arthropod chemistry. Spider venoms are proving to be rich sources of neuroactive components of potential medical interest. The venom of a <b>fishing</b> <b>spider,</b> Dolomedes okefinokensis, has yielded a polyamine which reversibly blocks L- and R-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Most recently, we have characterized, from the funnel-web spider Hololena curta, a sulfated nucleoside glycoside {{which serves as a}} reversible blocker of glutamate-sensitive calcium channels. The ability to synthesize or acquire an extremely diverse array of compounds for defense, offense, and communication appears to have contributed significantly to the dominant position that insects and other arthropods have attained...|$|E
40|$|Pre-copulatory sexual {{cannibalism}} (pre-SC), or predation of {{a potential}} mate before sperm transfer, provides an ideal model system for behavioral ecology’s current focus on inter-sexual conflict. Studying the North American <b>fishing</b> <b>spider</b> (Dolomedes triton), I tested three female-benefit hypotheses for pre-SC: indirect benefits, direct benefits, and aggressive spillover. First, pre-SC may reflect a mating bias providing females with ‘good-genes ’ benefits. By manipulating each female’s options {{with regard to the}} most cited phenotypic advantage in male spiders, body size, I show that while females exhibit no bias in their attack tendency on males of different body sizes, large males mate significantly more often than small males. Second, pre-SC may be explained by direct benefits if females use it as an adaptive foraging/mating trade-off. My work provides mixed support for this idea: (i) females vary attacks according to the availability of mates, (ii) females do not vary attacks according to the availability of food, and (iii) females derive discrete fecundity benefits from consuming a male. Finally, I tested the aggressive-spillover hypothesis, which posits that pre-SC is a by-product of selection for high levels of aggression towards prey in traditional foraging contexts. Path analysis indicated intra-individual, positive correlations between aggression in foraging contexts and the mating context...|$|E
50|$|C. quadimaculata {{have several}} {{different}} predators that include <b>fish,</b> <b>spiders,</b> frogs other bigger insects and birds. There was no sufficient evidence found of parasites and diseases affecting the New Zealand blowfly however {{they are known}} to be vectors for disease for conditions such as dysentery and can transfer bacterial infections from animals to humans. Additionally myiasis is the parasitic condition where maggots from blowflies are living in the tissue of animals and although C. quadrimaculata is not the primary cause of myiasis (other blowfies are) it can be a secondary source.|$|R
25|$|The main predators of <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> are {{birds and}} snakes. Dragonflies {{have also been}} {{observed}} catching young spiders. Species parasitic on the spiders include a wasp of the Pompilidae family that stings the spider to paralyse it before carrying it off and laying an egg in its abdomen. The larvae of the wasp hatch and proceed to eat the spider from the inside out. One escape technique the spiders use is to disappear beneath the surface tension of the water. However, some wasps counter the disappearing trick by going into the water to sting the spider and drag {{it out of the}} water.|$|R
500|$|The {{primitive}} Liphistiidae, the [...] "trapdoor spiders" [...] of {{the family}} Ctenizidae and many tarantulas are ambush predators that lurk in burrows, often closed by trapdoors and often surrounded by networks of silk threads that alert these spiders {{to the presence of}} prey. Other ambush predators do without such aids, including many crab spiders, and a few species that prey on bees, which see ultraviolet, can adjust their ultraviolet reflectance to match the flowers in which they are lurking. Wolf <b>spiders,</b> jumping <b>spiders,</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>spiders</b> and some crab spiders capture prey by chasing it, and rely mainly on vision to locate prey.|$|R
