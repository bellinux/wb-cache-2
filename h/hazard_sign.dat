He played drums with City Lights from 1965 to 1971, and formed his own band, The Rubber Band, in 1973, which stayed together until 1977. By 1979, Foulkes had returned to his childhood interest in one-man bands and began playing solo with [...] "The Machine," [...] which he created.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK Car accident analysis indicates that many accidents happen when taking a bend. For example, in a detailed analysis of 115 road departure situations where only one car was implicated, 82 of these occurred when taking a bend (2). These accidents are often the result of excessive speed or steering wheel errors (72 %). These errors may be due to a bad estimation of the nature of the oncoming bend. Anticipation plays an important part in driving. Effectively, driving behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Background : Exploration {{of oil and}} gas in mining {{industry}} is a industry with high risk to accident. Accident happens because of lack of knowledge and training, lack of control, no safety permit, damage safety sign and unappropriated SOP implementation. So that, with analysis of hazard and accident risk, can be designed one act of control which purpose to prevent accident happens. This objective of this research is to analyze the administration control of hazard and accident risk in Betara Gas Plant PetroChina International Jabung Ltd. Method : This research is descriptive studied by qualitative approximation. Method of research is by depth interview, observation and using the company document as a compare.

40|$|For {{the past}} five years, air {{contaminants}} at Spectro Alloys {{have been a major}} source of employee concern. In these same five years, Spectro Alloys has seen high turnover and low employee morale. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess and describe ways in which organizational trust-building can be enhanced by identifying effective methods of gathering and sharing information related to occupational exposure to air contaminants at Spectro Alloys Corporation. Based on employee feedback and past air sampling data, the two major air contaminants at Spectro Alloys are hydrogen chloride and aluminum dust. For this study, the health hazards associated with aluminum and hydrogen chloride were researched. Additionally, the value of trust in organizations, and methods of health hazard communication were described. Air sampling performed at processes associated with high levels of air contaminants showed results to be acceptable compared to OSHA’s PermissibleExposure Limits. The information was shared with employees, supervisors and management for the purpose of pre-testing material, soliciting feedback and gaining participation in the process from all levels of Spectro employees.

40|$|A NIOSH {{standard}} for worker exposure to carbon-tetrachloride (56235) is reviewed. Control of air {{concentrations in the}} workplace so they do not exceed 2 parts per million (ppm) in 45 liters is discussed. Medical requirements of the standard, including preplacement and annual physicals, counseling regarding use of alcohol and barbiturates, {{and the maintenance of}} medical records also are discussed together with labelling requirements for shipping and storage containers, and for areas of occupational exposure. Clothing and equipment are described for protection of eyes and respiratory system, together with gloves, aprons, and footwear. The need for employee education regarding the <b>hazards,</b> <b>signs,</b> and symptoms of overexposure, emergency procedures, and proper conditions and precautions for safe use of carbon tetrachloride is considered. Work practices, including the control of airborne contamination, contact with skin and eyes, emergency procedures, cleaning of spills, housekeeping procedures, personal hygiene, access to regulated areas, and control of soiled clothing are described. Sanitation requirements are presented for washing facilities, clothing and locker facilities, and smoking restrictions. Record keeping and exposure monitoring procedures are reviewed.

40|$|SummaryEveryday {{behavior}} frequently involves {{encounters with}} multiple objects that compete for selection. For example, {{driving a car}} requires constant shifts of attention between oncoming traffic, rearview mirrors, and traffic signs and signals, among other objects. Behavioral goals often drive this selection process [1, 2]; however, {{they are not the}} sole determinant of selection. Physically salient objects, such as flashing, brightly colored <b>hazard</b> <b>signs,</b> or objects that are salient by virtue of learned associations with reward, such as pictures of food on a billboard, often capture attention regardless of the individual’s goals [3 – 6]. It is typically thought that strongly salient distractor objects capture more attention and are more disruptive than weakly salient distractors [7, 8]. Counterintuitively, though, we found that this is true for perception, but not for goal-directed action. In a visually guided reaching task [9 – 11], we required participants to reach to a shape-defined target while trying to ignore salient distractors. We observed that strongly salient distractors produced less disruption in goal-directed action than weakly salient distractors. Thus, a strongly salient distractor triggers suppression during goal-directed action, resulting in enhanced efficiency and accuracy of target selection relative to when weakly salient distractors are present. In contrast, in a task requiring no goal-directed action, we found greater attentional interference from strongly salient distractors. Thus, while highly salient stimuli interfere strongly with perceptual processing, increased physical salience or associated value attenuates action-related interference...|$|R
