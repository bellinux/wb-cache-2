In this paper we will show that there are convex <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular tetrahedron having the following shapes: an equilateral triangle, an isosceles triangle, a right-angled triangle, scalene triangles, rectangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, quadrilaterals which are not trapezoids, pentagons and hexagons, and furthermore these cases exhaust all the possibilities <b>of</b> convex <b>developments</b> with sides n⩽ 6. And we will show {{that there are no}} convex n-gons which are <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular tetrahedron when n⩾ 7. Here, we mean by <b>a</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> polyhedron a connected plane figure, from which one can construct the polyhedron by folding it without getting overlap or gap.

5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upper level anticyclone.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate.

Based on drawings, {{it was suggested that}} Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E

For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua.

5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes.

In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications.

5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
