5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
25|$|Truckers {{also use}} their 4 ways {{flashing}} {{up a steep}} hill, mountain roads and on ramps on express ways to let others <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> traveling at a slow speed and to be cautious approaching them.|$|E

25|$|These were in many, but not lasted to our time. There are {{multiple}} of them, up to 162 count of signals. We know that {{right wing of}} the army marked with red banners and left wing with yellow. We also <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> tactical importance to hide the exact number of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Let {{the nation}} know {{the meaning of}} our numbers. We are not a {{pressure}} group. We are not an organization. We are not a mob. We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not free while we are not.|$|E
25|$|If {{the patient}} can {{be led to}} accept one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to feel more comfortable, because they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E

6000|$|... "Cannibals!" [...] {{interrupted}} Mrs. Eversley, [...] "I never <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> cannibals. Indeed, I {{know little}} about the Pongo, whom I scarcely ever see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I tell? No;--I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not. I fear <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not. I cannot {{say that}} money was given, but I fear it." ...|$|R
25|$|Both {{indirect}} reciprocity {{and costly}} signaling {{depend on the}} value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects. Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.|$|E
25|$|STD may refer only to {{infections that}} are causing diseases, {{or it may}} be used more loosely as a synonym for STI. Most of the time, people do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{infected}} with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term sexually transmissible disease is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than sexual contact. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HPV it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{development}} {{was motivated by}} the phrase 'Check on It' which Beyoncé and her management jokingly used before they decided {{to turn it into}} a song. [...] "Check on It" [...] is an R and hip hop song, which is instrumentally complete with a heavy bassline, strings, and wind instrument. Lyrically, it takes place in a club, where Beyoncé is letting the male patrons <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. The song consists of two verse-raps by Slim Thug. [...] "Check on It" [...] was well received by contemporary music critics, who universally complimented Beyoncé's vocals, and the assertiveness with which she sings her lines.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{welcoming}} her. Their hands, their smiles, their shouts, their affectionate eyes overcame her. She stammered, [...] "Thank you, oh, thank you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Then the eies of {{them both}} <b>were</b> opened, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> naked, and <b>they</b> sewed figge tree leaves together, and made {{themselves}} breeches.|$|R
6000|$|Ver. 7. [...] "And {{the eyes}} of them both <b>were</b> opened, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> naked; and <b>they</b> sewed fig-leaves together, and made {{themselves}} aprons." ...|$|R
500|$|If this module {{is played}} as a {{continuation}} of the first two modules, the players <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> searching for the force behind the giants' alliance; otherwise, they have been hired by nobles to destroy the fire giants. This module is twice as long as the previous two: sixteen pages instead of eight. Unlike the two previous modules where the giant's complex consists of two levels, the fire giant hall contains three levels. [...] The giants live in a hot, smoky barren area made of rock; as in the previous module, the party is able to find a safe location for forays against the giants. [...] The leader of the fire giants is King Snurre Iron Belly, and his hall is made of obsidian and natural caverns.|$|E
500|$|The fourth devil, Toby (Wally Dalton), is {{convinced}} that Black really does <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> demons. Toby also recounts his story, in which he begins to feel ennui at his failure to damn humans for some time. He meets and courts an aging stripper, Sally, {{who falls in love}} with him. [...] Their relationship blossomed, despite her having seen his true demonic form. One day Toby leads her to believe he is about to propose to her, before instead curtly insulting and breaking up with her. He later visited her home to find police investigating her suicide—a successful damnation. However, he also encounters Black, who sees his true nature. Instead of recoiling or reacting, Black simply tells Toby that he sees how lonely he must be. Toby's story affects all the gathered demons, who realize how lonely they really are. As they get up to leave, Abum praises the shop's coffee and briefly reveals his true form to the waiter.|$|E
500|$|Wałęsa is {{well known}} for his anti-gay position. In 2013 he said on Polish {{television}} that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics, [...] "They have to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a minority and must adjust to smaller things". He also said homosexual MPs should sit [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments. At a political rally in 2000, he described gay people as [...] "sick" [...] and said, [...] "I believe those people need medical treatment". During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995, President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions. In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his [...] "anti-gay remarks". A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa's anti-gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker.|$|E

5000|$|... 11 Group's {{most famous}} period {{was during the}} Battle of Britain when, due to its position, 11 Group bore {{the brunt of the}} German aerial assault.

500|$|... "Check on It" [...] is an midtempo R and hip hop song, {{which makes}} use of a heavy bassline, strings, wind instrument, and {{frequent}} [...] "swinging pelvic taunts". According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of G major, and is set in common time at 83 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range spans from the low note A3 to the high note B5. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, Beyoncé adopts smooth and alluring vocals throughout [...] "Check on It". Lyrically, the song {{takes place in a}} dance club, where the female protagonist is letting the male patrons <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. [...] "Check on It" [...] starts with a verse-rap from Slim Thug: [...] "Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas / Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it...". The rapper sounds like a 1975 Mercury Cougar turning over as he growls in his burly purr, as written by Bret McCabe of Baltimore City Paper.|$|E

2500|$|If {{a county}} has no player in its squad who is {{eligible}} for a benefit but has not yet had one, it may organise a [...] "county benefit" [...] or a [...] "youth cricket benefit" [...] {{to raise funds for}} special projects, but these often do not raise much money as many people are more interested in taking part in a benefit if they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> helping an individual.|$|E

2500|$|Heartened {{by their}} success, the outlaws attempt to march on Nottingham itself. However, the Earl of Wessex traps {{them in a}} pincer {{movement}} between Nottingham and Newark and defeats them all. When his ally the Archbishop wonders aloud why the rebels die so willingly on the swords of his soldiers the Earl replies grimly: [...] "because they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to win - but not in my time".|$|E
2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to get the appropriate health care that they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but {{it turns out to be}} illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners." ...|$|E
