500|$|Johnston, {{historian}} Nikolaus Pevsner {{and landscape}} historian Richard Muir {{all agree that}} an original <b>gravel</b> <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> was once present {{on top of the}} stone of the Wheeldale structure. Whereas Johnston and Pevsner believe that the gravel was washed away through weathering, Muir states that human agents were primarily responsible for its removal. Both agree that the stonework remaining does not represent the original road surface. Statements by the eighteenth-century antiquary Francis Drake and nineteenth-century topographer Samuel Lewis that the writers found it to be [...] "paved with a flint pebble" [...] may support this theory, although Hayes and Rutter cast doubt on the accuracy of Drake's reports. Codrington states that in 1817 the causeway consisted of a [...] "strong pavement of stones... above these another stratum of gravel...", Hayes and Rutter state that [...] "traces of a surface layer of gravel and small stones" [...] remained visible in the 1960s, and professor of structural engineering John Knapton states that there remained some evidence of smaller surface-dressing pebbles as late as 1996.|$|E
500|$|The use of dressed stone {{rather than}} gravel as a surface {{dressing}} was also occasionally {{held to be}} a sign against the causeway being of Roman construction: the majority of Roman roads that were finished with a material other than simple packed earth were dressed in either packed gravel or pebbles. There are other examples of Roman roads paved with stone blocks, including the [...] section of the Via Appia—the oldest major Roman route in Italy—near Albano. Historians Richard A Gabriel and Michael Grant state that of the [...] of known Roman roads, over [...] may have been stone-paved. The Roman writer Ulpian specifically differentiates between via munita, which always had a paved stone surface, and via glareata, which were earthed roads with either gravelled surfaces, or a gravelled subsurface and paving on top. The causeway may well have had a <b>gravel</b> <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> originally, which has been removed since through robbing and natural weathering. Another difference in construction detail between Wade's Causeway and a typical Roman road is its lack of a foundation of large stones. Codrington and archaeologist John Ward stress that the structure of Roman roads varied greatly depending upon their situation and the materials available, especially within Britain.|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between <b>surface</b> winds and <b>gravel</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{that can be}} characterized by aerodynamic roughness length {{have important implications for}} sediment mobilization, transport, sedimentation and the development of desert pavements (‘gobi’ deserts). Wind tunnel results of systematic tests carried out to determine the aerodynamic roughness length of <b>gravel</b> <b>surfaces</b> of different size and coverage at a range of free-stream wind velocities are reported. The aerodynamic roughness of <b>gravel</b> <b>surfaces</b> is a function of gravel size, gravel coverage and free-stream wind velocity. The 1 / 30 law proposed by Bagnold, based on Nikuradse’s results of water pipe flow, or taking the aerodynamic roughness length as a fixed percentage of roughness element height is not supported for <b>gravel</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The aerodynamic roughness of <b>gravel</b> <b>surfaces</b> decreases with free-stream wind velocity. The variation of aerodynamic roughness with gravel coverage can be described by quadratic curves. Maximum aerodynamic roughness length occurs at gravel coverage range above 40 – 75 %, increasing with gravel size. Multivariate models based on free-stream wind velocity and gravel coverage have been developed for predicting the aerodynamic roughness of different gravel-sized surfaces. The maturity of the roughness effects of <b>gravel</b> <b>surfaces</b> increases with <b>gravel</b> coverage. I...|$|R
