40|$|A {{conceptual}} model is proposed as a decision tool {{for control of}} European <b>grape</b> <b>moth</b> Lobesia botrana Denis & Scchiffermuller (Lepidoptera; Tortricidae) in the "vinhos verdes" region in the northwest of Portugal.

A dochotomous decision tree was used to structure the alternative choices by each farmer. For the tree L. botrana generations, generation by generation, the most user friendly and adapted estimates were selected. The model can be formatted in an Excell algorithm and can be easily copied for use in the entire region.

40|$|Grape berries {{attacked}} by Lobesia botrana larvae {{are more easily}} infected by Aspergillus section Nigri (black aspergilli) ochratoxigenic species. Two-year field trials were carried out in Apulia (Italy) to evaluate a bioinsecticide control strategy against L. botrana and the indirect effect on reducing ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination in vineyards. A commercial Bacillus thuringiensis formulate and an experimental Beauveria bassiana (ITEM- 1559) formulate were tested in two vineyards cultivated with the same grape variety, Negroamaro, but with two different training systems (espalier and little-arbor techniques). In both years and training systems the treatments by B. bassiana ITEM- 1559 significantly controlled L. botrana larvae attacks with effectiveness similar to B. thuringensis (more than 20 %). A significant reduction of OTA concentrations (up to 80 % compared to untreated controls) was observed only {{in the first year}} in both training systems, when the metereological parameters prior to harvest were more favorable to the insect attack.

Bioassays were carried out on one EGM strain reared in the laboratory and on two EGM field strains from vineyards of the northeast of It-aly.

The EGM females resulted less susceptible than the males; this does not invalidate the method since {{it is based on the}} use of male specimens only. Concerning the age it was noticed a limited decrease of the lethal concentrations related to the age growing, which indicates the negative effect of the age on the EGM survival. Differences in the susceptibility between field and laboratory strain, whether using adults or whether larvae in the tests were detected.

40|$|International audienceThe {{main source}} of {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) in the wine food chain is the infection of grape by “black aspergilli” occurring in the field. OTA producing black aspergilli include mainly Aspergillus carbonarius, followed by A. niger and A. tubingensis. They are opportunistic fungi developing massively on damaged berries at ripening, although they may occur and form OTA on grapes from veraison to harvest. Climatic conditions (high humidity and temperature) and geographical location are important factors favouring OTA accumulation in grape berries. The severity of aspergillus rot is influenced by excessive irrigation and rainfall prior to harvest causing berry splitting. Berry wounds caused by insect attacks provide preferential entries for black aspergilli. High OTA levels occur in grapes severely damaged by the <b>grape</b> <b>moth</b> Lobesia botrana, particularly in the Mediterranean areas. Some grape varieties displays greater susceptibility to aspergillus rots due to intrinsic genetic characteristics and bunch conformation (compact > sparse). Actions to control toxigenic mycoflora in the vineyards must be taken considering these critical control points. Proper fungicidal and insecticidal treatments can reduce OTA contamination. Knowledge {{about the fate of}} OTA and its distribution in wine and winery by-products is important to manage OTA risk in contaminated stocks. During wine making only 4 % of the OTA present in grapes remains in the wine whereas the most is retained in pressed grape pomaces. OTA concentration remains unchanged in wine after one year aging as well as in all liquid fractions collected during vinification (must, free run wine, and wine after first and second decantation). Activated carbons reduce OTA levels in wine but negatively affect wine quality...|$|E

40|$|Several {{factors have}} {{prompted}} the reevaluation of control recommendations for key pests of grapes in recent years. First, {{the costs of}} insecticides and their application have risen substantially. Growers who improve the efficiency of their use of pesticides can realize significant savings in production costs.

Finally, increased governmental restrictions regarding what pesticides {{can be used in}} vineyards and how they may be used may increase the overall difficulty that growers encounter when using pesticides. The result of these factors is that while producers and processors continue to require control of economically-damaging pests, this now must be achieved with the least amount of pesticide possible.

As an alternative, we compared the capture of female and male <b>grape</b> berry <b>moth</b> in panel traps baited with synthetic host volatiles with captures of males in pheromone-baited wing traps over two growing seasons in two blocks of grapes in a commercial vineyard in central New York. Lures formulated in hexane to release either 7 -component or 13 -component host volatile blends captured significantly more male and female <b>grape</b> berry <b>moth</b> on panel traps compared with the numbers captured on panel traps with hexane-only lures. For both sexes over both years, the same or more moths were captured in panel traps along the forest edge compared with the vineyard edge {{early in the season}} but this pattern was reversed by mid-season. Male moths captured in pheromone-baited wing traps also displayed this temporal shift in location. There was a significant positive {{correlation between}} captured males and females on panel traps although not between females captured on panel traps and males captured in pheromone-baited traps for both years suggesting pheromone traps do not accurately reflect either female or male activity. Male moths captured in pheromone traps indicated a large peak early in each season corresponding to first flight followed by lower and variable numbers that did not clearly indicate second and third flights. Panel trap data, combining males and females, indicated three distinct flights, with some overlap between the second and third flights. Peak numbers of moths captured on panel traps matched well with predictions of a temperature-based phenology model, especially in 2008. Although effective, panel traps baited with synthetic host lures were time consuming to deploy and maintain and captured relatively few moths making them impractical, in the current design, for commercial purpose...|$|R

However, the converse is not true and environments with the same mean temperature can exhibit very different diurnal temperate ranges. Here we apply a degree-day model for development of the <b>grape</b> berry <b>moth</b> (Paralobesia viteana, a significant vineyard pest in the northeastern USA) to investigate how different diurnal temperature range conditions can influence degree-day accumulation and, hence, insect life history. We first consider changes in diurnal temperature range independent of changes in mean temperatures. We then investigate <b>grape</b> berry <b>moth</b> life history under potential climate change conditions, increasing mean temperature via variable patterns of change to diurnal temperature range. We predict that diurnal temperature range change can substantially alter insect life history. Altering diurnal temperature range independent of the mean temperature can affect development rate and voltinism, with the magnitude of the effects dependent on whether changes occur to the daily minimum temperature (Tmin), daily maximum temperature (Tmax), or both. Allowing for an increase in mean temperature produces more marked effects on life history but, again, the patterns and magnitude depend {{on the nature of the}} change to diurnal temperature range together with the starting conditions in the local environment.
