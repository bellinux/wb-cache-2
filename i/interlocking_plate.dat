40|$|Background. Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation using an <b>interlocking</b> <b>plate</b> system has gained popularity {{for the treatment}} of dorsally displaced distal radius fractures. Purpose. To evaluate the functional and radiological results of treating unstable distal radius fractures with the volar locking plate. Patients and methods. A retrospective review was conducted of patients from one institution using the volar locking plate to treat intra-articular and extra-articular distal radius fractures. Unstable distal radius fractures in 15 patients, comprising 3 men and 12 women {{with a mean age of}} 64. 4 years (34 – 76 years), were treated with a volar locking compression plate (Acu-Loc distal radius plate system; Acumed, Oregon, USA) and followed up for a minimum of 1 year. Fractures were classified using the AO classification. Radiographic parameters of preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up radiographs were compared. The time to initiation of active range of motion was determined. Final follow-up range of motion and complications were reported. Results. At final functional assessment, the scores of 5 patients were excellent, 7 patients good, and 3 patients fair according to Cooney’s Clinical Scoring Chart. No non-union or infection occurred. Rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon occurred in 1 patient. Conclusion. Treatment of unstable distal radius fractures with a volar locking plate leads to satisfactory results, provided the operative technique is carefully performed to prevent complications.

40|$|A biomechanical {{comparison}} {{was conducted}} on two internal spinal fixation techniques: pins and Polymethylmethacrylate, and the String of Pearls <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Plate</b> System. Both techniques were applied to a surgically simulated level L 7 -S 1 complete spinal injury, {{with the objective of}} the study being to compare the stability of the two techniques. Cadaver specimens from 18 skeletally mature large breed dogs were used. These specimens were randomly divided into two equal groups and fixated using one of the two internal spinal fixation techniques. The lumbosacral spine specimens (L 5 -S 3) were subjected to a mechanically applied bending moment, which was applied to the caudal and cranial ends of the specimen. Biomechanical parameters including range of motion (RoM), neutral zone (NZ), and elastic zone stiffness (EZS) were used to compare the stability of the two fixation techniques. No significant difference between the means of the NZ in flexion (p-value= 0. 3458), extension (pvalue= 0. 1255), and the total value (p-value = 0. 3458) of the injured lumbosacral (L 7 -S 1) joint fixated with the two fixation techniques was found. Similarly, {{no significant difference between the}} means of the RoM in flexion (p-value = 0. 2386) and extension (p-value = 0. 1255), or between the means of the EZS in extension (p-value = 0. 4094) was noted. Therefore, it can be concluded that the stability of the injured joint between the two fixation techniques is similar.

40|$|Plate {{tectonics}} is the kinematic {{theory that}} describes the large-scale motions and events of the outermost shell of the solid Earth {{in terms of the}} relative motions and interactions of large, rigid, interlocking fragments of lithosphere called tectonic plates. Plates form and disappear incrementally over time as a result of tectonic processes. There are currently about a dozen major plates {{on the surface of the}} Earth, and many minor ones. The present-day configuration of tectonic plates is illustrated in Figure 7. 1. As the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plates</b> move relative to each other, they interact at plate boundaries, where adjacent plates collide, diverge, or slide past each other. The interactions of plates result in a variety of observable surface phenomena, including the occurrence of earthquakes and the formation of large-scale surface features such as mountains, sedimentary basins, volcanoes, island arcs, and deep ocean trenches. In tum, the appearance of these phenomena and surface features indicates the location of plate boundaries.

Other applications are expected to follow, and they will need passive devices with functionality already found in more familiar microwave and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, but presently missing in the terahertz region. Two fundamental devices in particular are variable polarisation compensators, and tunable frequency-selective filters. This work represents the first demonstration of a variable polarisation compensator using subwavelength patterned features (artificial dielectrics). Following on from the original proposal, this work contains a complete and thorough investigation including the development of a bulk silicon micromachining fabrication process, full characterisation of the device performance in the W-band (70 – 110 GHz) and comprehensive simulations of the device, including detailed simulation of three distinct new designs with improved performance (continuously-variable retardance with maximum in excess of quarter- and half wave). The third of the three designs is capable of extremely low insertion loss (< 0. 6 dB) and overcomes a difficulty of the original design that prevented zero retardance in a practical device. Secondly, a new tunable photonic crystal filter is proposed and demonstrated. Easily accessible external control surfaces integrated into the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plates</b> of a layer-by-layer photonic crystal allow unprecedented contol over the number and type of defects within the structure, all of which may be tuned "on-the-fly".

5000|$|Finer yarns {{and lighter}} woven fabrics {{have been a}} key factor in {{improved}} ballistic results. The cost of ballistic fiber goes up dramatically as yarn size goes down, so it is unclear how long this trend can continue.

Three-dimensional weaving with fibers connecting flat wovens together into a 3D system are being considered for both hard and soft ballistics. Team Engineering Inc is designing and weaving these multi layer materials. Dyneema DSM has developed higher performance laminates using a new, higher strength fiber designated SB61, and HB51.

500|$|Aetosaurs {{were very}} heavily armored (most {{certainly}} {{as a defense}} against predators), with large , <b>interlocking</b> bony <b>plates,</b> or osteoderms, protecting the back and sides, belly, and tail. [...] Most osteoderms are heavily pitted on their upper surfaces and smooth on their undersides. Their centers are made of cancellous or spongy bone (also called diploë) and their outer portions {{are made up of}} compact bone. In life, these plates were probably covered in horn. Dorsal osteoderms, which are found on the backs of aetosaurs, are often ornamented with radial grooves. Dorsal paramedians, those found along the midline of the animal, are often wide and quadrangular with a small boss called a dorsal eminence on the dorsal surface of each plate. In aetosaurs, paramedian plates often have raised or depressed anterior edges where the plates articulate with the ones in front of them. If the anterior edge is raised, the area is called an anterior bar, while if it is depressed, the area is called an anterior lamina. In lateral plates, which are positioned {{on either side of the}} paramedian plates, the dorsal eminence is often enlarged into a prominent spike. This spike is especially noticeable in desmatosuchines such as Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus. Osteoderms are useful in diagnosing aetosaur taxa, and aetosaur species can often be identified from individual scutes based on their ornamentation pattern.|$|R
40|$|Automatic joinery {{has become}} a common {{technique}} for the jointing of beams in timber framing and roofing. It has revived traditional, inte-grated joints such as mortise and tenon connections. Similarly, but only recently, the automatic fabrication of traditional cabinetmaking joints has been introduced for the assembly of timber panel shell structures. First prototypes have used such integrated joints for the alignment and assem-bly of components, while additional adhesive bonding {{was used for the}} load-bearing connection. However, glued joints cannot be assembled on site, which results in several design constraints. In this paper, we propose the use of dovetail joints without adhesive bonding, on the case study of a timber folded plate structure. Through their single-degree-of-freedom (1 DOF) geometry, these joints block the relative movement of two parts in all but one direction. This presents the opportunity for an <b>interlocking</b> connection of <b>plates,</b> as well as a challenge for the assembly of folded plate shells, where multiple non-parallel edges per plate must be jointed simultaneously. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of intragranular nucleation of austenite in a duplex stainless steel (Fe- 23. 1 Cr- 6. 1 Ni- 3. 1 Mo-O. 165 N- 0. 017 C, wt. %) weld metal and heat-affected zone (HAZ) has been examined. In the weld metal the acicular austenite {{is found to}} nucleate intragranularly on inclusions and subsequent plates form sympathetically resulting in a fine <b>interlocked</b> microstructure. Austenite <b>plates</b> adopt the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship with the ferrite matrix and grow with diffusion-controlled mechanism as evident from partitioning of substitutional alloying elements. At least one set of fine intrinsic dislocations on the austenite/ferrite interphase interfaces is observed suggesting that the boundaries are semi-coherent. The high cooling rates involved in the HAZ result in a supersaturated ferrite matrix where precipitation of intragranular austenite {{occurs as a result}} of reheating associated with subsequent passes. Austenite particles in the HAZ nucleate preferentially away from gain boundary austenite allotriomorphs indicating that intragranular precipitation is favoured by the supersaturated matrix...|$|R
40|$|Two new genera, Gedoelstascaris and Ortleppascaris, are {{proposed}} for species of ascaridoid nematodes occurring in crocodilians and previously included in Dujardinascaris. Species included in Gedoelstascaris are vandenbrandeni Baylis, 1929 as type species and australiensis Baylis, 1931 (= salomonis Kreis, 1940). These species occur in Crocodylus spp. in Africa and Australia respectively and are characterised by lips with a rostral <b>plate,</b> without <b>interlocking</b> processes or dentigerous ridges, with well-developed interlabia, lobulated ventriculus, and excretory pore {{in front of}} the nerve ring. Species included in Ortleppascaris are: nigra Gedoelst, 1916 (= tasmani Ortlepp, 1932) as type species; alata Baylis, 1947; antipini Mozgovoy, 1950. These species occur in Crocodylus, Caiman and Alligator and are characterized by flat lips with alate margins, without anterior rostral <b>plate,</b> <b>interlocking</b> processes or dentigerous ridges, with weakly developed interlabia, by an irregular-shaped ventriculus, excretory pore behind or between the subventral lips, and by the presence of lateral alae or cuticular thickenings in the oesophageal region. The significance of this proposal is discussed in relation to the radiation and dispersal of ascaridoids of crocodilians...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. A light duty, desktop size, 3 axis CNC {{milling machine}} is {{designed}} with a frame featuring a novel welded steel design composed entirely of precision cut <b>plate</b> steel featuring <b>interlocking</b> and self aligning geometry. The wide availability of high accuracy cutting of {{sheet and plate}} materials by laser and abrasive waterjet cutting has made possible {{the idea of a}} structure composed entirely of precision cut <b>plate.</b> <b>Interlocking</b> features are used at the joints between each piece which when considered in a three dimensional structure causes the assembly to be inherently self aligning and requires no assembly fixturing. The design concept is intended to reduce or eliminate machining of the finished steel structure. Three dimensional parametric modeling and finite element analysis simulations will be used to design the assembly and make worst case deflection predictions. A prototype machine structure is fabricated and evaluated to determine if the design is a viable alternative to more traditional machine designs. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
