40|$|AbstractIn Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, {{the lower}} <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> made of SS 316 LN in control plug has cut opening in three {{locations}} {{for the purpose}} of easiness of assembling the sampling tubes through the lower <b>stay</b> <b>plate.</b> These openings are then covered with appropriate cover plates bolted with the <b>stay</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> along with cover plate will be seeing thermal transients during reactor scrams. The thermal transient will cause the membrane stress due to global temperature increase in cover plate and bending stress due to temperature gradient across the thickness. This paper aims the creep and fatigue damages estimation of the <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and covers plate. The material of <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and cover plate is SS 316 LN. The <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and cover plate is analysed using CAST 3 M FE software developed by CAE France. A small square segment including a bolt and portion of junction between <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and cover plate is modeled with 8 noded, CUB 8 elements. The fatigue damage for 851 number of thermal transient has been calculated. The creep damage due to the thermal stress has been evaluated. The interaction of creep-fatigue damage has also been evaluated as per RCC-MR code rule and is found within the limit...|$|R
40|$|Roxtec is {{well-known}} {{as a company}} which designs and supplies cable and pipe sealing systems. The purpose of this thesis was to develop new solutions to verify the installed systems. We use some chemistry knowledge and modern technology, such as pressure sensors, etc. {{to meet the needs}} mentioned above. We have added some new function into the original <b>stay</b> <b>plate,</b> too. And it enables the <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> to tell the tightness of the sealing system by measuring the lateral displacement of the modules. We also assumed that we can compress the system by a torque wrench with certain Nm instead of checking the sealed system by wedge clip. 072772415...|$|R
