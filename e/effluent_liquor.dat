40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} effects of acidified acidogenically {{fermented}} piggery effluent containing Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) on shiga-toxigenic and resident strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) as part of the development of a waste treatment process. Methods and Results: Four shiga-toxigenic E. coli strains (O 157 :H 7, 091. H-, 0111. H-, and 0123. H-) and four non-toxic resident enzootic strains were all killed by 3 h treatment with fermented piggery <b>effluent</b> <b>liquor</b> (153 mmol l(- 1) total VFA) at pH 4. 3. The shiga-toxigenic strains showed greater sensitivity after 1 h of treatment. The fermented liquor at pH 6. 8 was not inhibitory. Conclusions: The shiga-toxigenic strains were no more resistant to the toxic effects of VFA than the non-toxic strains tested. Significance and Impact of the Study: Shiga-toxigenic strains and resident enzootic non-toxigenic strains are equally susceptible to inactivation by this waste treatment process and by acidified VFA in general...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} uses pulping chemicals for the treatment of bagasse, straw and wood chips. Spent liquor or <b>effluent</b> <b>liquor,</b> with high carbon content is produced and sent to chemical recovery to recover pulping chemicals. In addition, energy from the spent liquor is recovered and utilised to generate steam for electricity supply, thereby reducing fossil fuel power consumption. Spent liquor is destroyed using conventional incineration technology, in a recovery furnace or recovery boiler, which is the heart of chemical recovery. These units have {{over the past few decades}} been prone to numerous problems and are a major concern to the {{pulp and paper}} industry. They pose a threat to the environment, are expensive to maintain and constitute a safety hazard. Thus the {{pulp and paper industry}} is now looking at a replacement technology; an alternative that will effectively regenerate pulping chemicals and recover energy for generating electricity, ultimately to make the plant energy self-sufficient. Gasification technology may be the chosen technology but is yet to be applied to the pulp and paper sector. However, this technology is not new. It has been integrated and used successfully in the petroleum industry for decades, with applications in coal mining and the mineral industry. The overall objective of tills study is to develop a better understanding of gasification using a pilot-scale fluidised bed reactor which was designed and developed at the University of Natal. The reactor, "the Gasifier", is operated at temperatures below the smelt limits of inorganic salts (< 750 Â°C) in the spent liquor. In this investigation, spent liquor is injected directly into an inert bed of alwninium oxide grit, which is fluidised by superheated steam. The atomized liquor immediately dries when it contacts the grit in the bed, pyrolyses and the organic carbon is gasified by steam. Pyrolysis and steam gasification reactions are endothennic and require heat. Oxidised sulphur species are partially reduced by reaction with gasifier products, which principally consist of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The reduced sulphur is said to be unstable in the gasifier environment, and reacts with steam and carbon dioxide to form solid sodium carbonate and gaseous hydrogen sulphide. (Rockvam, 2001). The focus of this study will be to determine the Gasifier's ability to gasify spent liquor, from soda and sulphite pulping of bagasse, at different operating conditions. In addition, the fate of process and non-process elements will be investigated. The product gas generated in the gasification of spent soda and sulphite liquors consisted of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. In the gasification of spent sulphjte liquor, hydrogen sulphide was also produced. The water-gas shift reaction, which was the main reaction, was found to be temperature dependent. In adilition, organic carbon conversion increased with temperature. Furthermore, most of the sulphur in the bed predominated in the form of hydrogen sulphide with very little sulphur in the form of sulphate. This indicated that gasification would reduce sulphate levels, which are responsible for dead load in a chemical recovery cycle. Finally, an important result was that the aluminium oxide grit was successfully coated. It was previously speculated that this would not be possible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Leather tanning {{industry}} uses large quantity {{of water for}} processing which results in copious quantity of liquid effluent. Disposal of tannery effluent {{has become a major}} environmental concern. A new technique has been developed to augment the water evaporation rate from the tannery <b>effluent</b> (soak <b>liquor)</b> and to recover fresh water. In this work, water in the tannery <b>effluent</b> (soak <b>liquor)</b> is evaporated using a spray tower and fresh water is recovered using a vapour compression refrigeration system (VCR). In the spray tower simultaneous heat and mass transfer takes place between the soak liquor and air which results in the evaporation of water from the soak liquor and humidification of air. Condensation of water vapour from the humidified air using VCR system yields fresh water. Experimental analysis has been carried out to find the effect of operational parameters like heat supplied to the soak liquor, heat removed from the humidified air, relative humidity of inlet air and the soak liquor flow rate on the evaporation rate and the amount of fresh water collected...|$|R

40|$|New separation/detection {{procedures}} by reversed-phase HPLC {{coupled with}} UV and fluorescence detection {{have been developed}} for the determination of organic admixtures of the sulphonated melamines-formaldehyde condensates (SMFC) and lignosulphonates (LS) type in environmental samples (drinking and ground waters), as well as in concrete leachates. The developed method permitted to reach detection limits in the 0. 05 - 0. 3 mug range (as injected amount). An extraction/enrichment method from the titled environmental samples based on solid-phase-extraction (SPE) has been developed for SMFC by using polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB, Envichrom-P) resin as sorbent. SMFC were extracted (recovery: ca. 70 %) from aqueous samples at starting concentrations down to 10 mug/L. A structural confirmation of SMFC in aqueous samples was established by HPLC/Mass Spectrometry with electrospray interface (HPLC-ESI-MS) by using collision-induced ion fragmentation (in source-CID mode). The developed analytical procedures were applied to the determination of SMFC and LS in commercial blends, in drinking and ground waters, as well as in industrial <b>effluents</b> and <b>liquors</b> from leaching test experiments. Only shorter SMFC and LS components were identified as result of the leaching from concrete specimen...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Laccase, a copper-containing enzyme, oxidizes {{variety of}} {{aromatic}} compounds. Since laccase {{is essential for}} lignin degradation, {{it can be used}} for lignin removal in the pulp and paper industry (biopulping). Laccase is also employed as a dechlorinating agent (biobleaching), along with the removal of phenolic and other aromatic pollutants. In the present investigation it was aimed to employ the laccase produced by the bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes along with the bacterium itself in biopulping of sugarcane bagasse and biobleaching of kraft <b>liquor</b> <b>effluent.</b> Methodology and results: A laccase was isolated from the bacterium K. aerogenes, purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme was purified by conventional techniques following salt precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography on Con A sepharose. The purified laccase was found to be monomeric glycoprotein with a Mr of 64 kDa when measured by Sephadex G- 200 gel chromatography and SDS-PAGE. The Vmax and Km of laccase towards the substrate guaiacol was determined. The optimum pH of the laccase was found to be 5. 0. biopulping and biobleaching activities were determined by TAPPI standard methods. Treatment of sugarcane baggase by K. aerogenes also significantly reduced lignin content of the bagasse. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The bacterium K. aerogenes and a laccase produced by it were used separately for biopulping of sugarcane bagasse and biobleaching of kraft <b>liquor</b> <b>effluent.</b> Treatment with both brought significant reduction in lignin content and kappa number of the pulp. The handsheets prepared from the treated pulp showed improved brightness without affecting the strength properties of paper. The bacterium and the laccase efficiently decolorized the kraft liquor proving to have biobleaching potential. ...|$|R

This industrial wastewater is highly loaded in organic and nitrogen compounds (CODâ 12, 000 mg L(- 1) and NH(4) (+) -Nâ 4, 000 mg L(- 1)). The possibility of its treatment in an urban WWTP is studied measuring ammonia oxidation rate with non-acclimated sludge to the industrial <b>effluent.</b> Compost <b>liquor</b> appears as an inhibitor substrate. The ammonia oxidation rate can be modelled by the Haldane model: U(MAX) = 0. 180 d(- 1), K(S) = 12. 0 mgN. L(- 1) and K(I) = 26. 0 mgN. L(- 1). The ammonia oxidation rate also follows for a synthetic substrate which has the same pollutant load as the real substrate. In this case, the ammonia oxidation rate can be modelled by the Monod model: U(MAX) = 0. 073 d(- 1) and K(S) = 4. 3 mgN. L(- 1). This result confirms that the ammonia oxidising bacteria are inhibited by the real wastewater. The following-up of nitrate production shows also the inhibition of nitrite oxidising bacteria. The compost liquor treatment seems not possible in an urban WWTP (< 50, 000 p. e.). That's why a specific WWTP is recommended and an acclimation step of activated sludge is essential...|$|R
40|$|The {{pre-oxidation}} of high COD value (varying from 40000 mg/l to 90000 mg/l) containing Aqueous Mother <b>Liquor</b> <b>Effluent</b> (AMLE) {{by using}} the Fentonâs reagent (FeSO 4 and H 2 O 2 in acidic medium) with effective air mixing in reactors were studied. The theoretically calculated H 2 O 2 doses are higher and are neither cost effective nor shows good reduction in COD value when it used alone. The theoretically calculated H 2 O 2 dose consumption reduced more than 90 % when it used along with ferrous sulphate by providing favorable oxidation condition for AMLE. The parameters which showed their great influence on pre-oxidation of Aqueous Mother <b>Liquor</b> <b>Effluent</b> (AMLE) were pH, concentration of ferrous ion, Hydrogen peroxide and reaction time. These parameters were optimized for COD reduction more than 80 %. Fentonâs reagent dose were applied to AMLE (e. g. FeSO 4 (anhydrous physical form of commercial grade) : H 2 O 2 (on assay basis) = 1 : 10) on pH 3 - 3. 5. The Fentonâs oxidation enhances the biodegradability of AMLE which further treated by coagulation and Activated Sludge Treatment Process (ASP). The biodegradable organic matter present in waste water removes in ASP by biosorption, biooxidation including nitrification and bioflocculation but due to the high organic load, biorecalcitrant compound, surfactants or biotoxicity in AMLE the Activated Sludge Treatment Process (ASP) did not perform effective treatment as a result we obtained biologically treated effluent with high COD, TSS and TDS value, loss of biomass in treated effluent, biomass rupturing in aeration tank and poor settling of biomass in secondary clarifier. Therefore to deactivate the biocidal property and to prevent shock loading and to improve the biodegradability for ASP the Advanced Oxidation played very important role...|$|R
40|$|Electro-oxidation {{reactions}} using {{a nickel}} anode {{were carried out}} on the calcium-spent <b>liquor</b> <b>effluent</b> obtained from Sappi Saiccor (formerly South African Industrial Cellulose Corporation) dissolving pulp mill {{as well as on}} lignin- and lignan-type compounds previously identified in the effluent. Voltammograms were obtained for each solution in order to identify the oxidation potentials of the compounds to be electro-oxidised. Value-added products such as vanillin and syringaldehyde were identified in the electro-oxidised reaction mixtures using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Profiles of the changes in concentration of these compounds were determined as a function of time with maximum concentrations reached within the first half hour. These findings are significant in that few electro-oxidation reactions have been carried out on the effluent of a pulp mill which uses the acid bisulphite pulping process and no results have previously been reported on the electro-oxidation of syringaldehyde. This study contributes to a further understanding of the electro-oxidation of lignin and is of value to the paper and pulp industry at large.

40|$|The {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} examine the advanced oxidation of the black <b>liquor</b> <b>effluent</b> obtained from the {{pulp and paper industry}} using the dark Fenton reaction in a lab-scale experiment based on Central Composite Design. The three factors along with their range values in that experiment were temperature (298; 333, K), H 2 O 2 concentration (29. 4; 58. 8, mM), and Fe(II) concentration (0. 36; 8. 95, mM). The range of the factors were examine at fixed phase pH= 3. Three response variables studied in the experiment, namely, COD removal after 90 min(%), UV 254 removal after 90 min(aromatic content,%), and UV 280 removal after 90 min (lignin content, %). The most widespread application of the RSM is in the situation where input variables potentially influence some quality characteristics of a process. Due {{to the fact that the}} experiment has several response variables, we employed a desirability function approach to optimize the responses simultaneously at one best setting of available factors. The resulted simultaneous optimization of an experiment is, in fact, the real situation where the experimenter should deal with since in an experiment, there is certainly a single input setting. After analyzing the data, both separated for each response variable and simultaneous for all response variables provided the same terms (factors) which are significantly contribute to the quadratic model (H 2 O 2 and Fe(II) concentration). Nevertheles, they produced different factor settings. Through desirability function approach, we found that the best settings are 46. 84 mM and 6. 771 mM of H 2 O 2 and Fe(II) concentration, respectively. Those setting can be obtained at desirability functionâs value of 0. 782. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent times}} terrorists have {{targeted}} US citizens {{at home or}} abroad. These attacks have primarily concentrated on infrastructure. The destruction of infrastructure is frequently considered {{an attack on the}} U. S. Government and the U. S. economy. Among the most critical infrastructure areas needing protection are the potable water treatment and distribution system and wastewater collection and treatment system. In this time of elevated security and concern over possible terrorist attacks, it has become necessary to prepare emergency response plans for public utilities (including wastewater collection and treatment systems). A framework was developed to numerically rank chemical, biological, and radiological agents with respect to four end points for wastewater collection and treatment. The end points were worker/public health, process upset, physical damage/destruction, and pass through. The four end points were each evaluated with eight criteria. The eight criteria were availability, potency, persistence, introduction/dispersion, process removal, storability, outcomes, and public perception. A literature review was performed for every contaminant evaluated, to determine a numerical value between 1 and 5 to assign to each of the criteria. At the completion of this research a basic foundation for the prioritization framework had been developed and used to evaluated 14 contaminants. In addition to developing the prioritization framework, this researched evaluated current technology for detecting volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) using the man portable Hapsite GC/MS. Six water samples were used to evaluate the detection capabilities of the Hapsite GC/MS in varying qualities of water. The samples included distilled water, drinking water, and river water, and from a wastewater treatment facility, primary effluent, secondary <b>effluent,</b> and mixed <b>liquor</b> from the aeration basin. The six water samples were spiked with nine VOCs, at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 ppb, and analyzed with the Hapsite GC/MS. The observed results indicate that there was a false, low concentration measured in the primary effluent. A false low was also observed in the mixed liquor for select VOCs, depending on their octanol-water partition coefficient. The temperature of an analyzed water sample could affect the instrument's detection capabilities...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, much {{research}} has focused on Algal High Rate Oxidation Ponds as both an economic means for wastewater treatment and as a system for the mass production of algae. With the advent of these systems for the treatment of saline organic effluents, the extreme halophile, Dunaliella salina was considered. In this study, the growth and productivity of a number of Dunaliella species (and strains thereof) was evaluated in hide soak <b>liquor</b> tannery <b>effluent.</b> Hide soak <b>liquor,</b> diluted to 20 % with water, proved to be highly suitable as a growth medium {{for the majority of the}} Dunaliella species under study and in some instances, resulted in enhanced growth rates and higher biomass yields compared to those obtained in defined inorganic medium. A few Dunaliella species failed to grow in this effluent. A correlation was observed between the lack of growth displayed by these species in this organio-rich medium and their failure to utilise organic compounds. Glycine, a major component of this effluent, possibly stimulates the growth of Dunaliella. Studies on the mechanism of growth stimulation by glycine revealed that an algal-bacterial relationship existed whereby the bacteria mineralised the amino acid, releasing ammonia which was then utilised by the alga. Results of this work revealed significant variations in the intracellular glycerol content amongst the Dunaliella species under study. Large differences were also observed between the glycerol contents of effluent-grown and control Dunaliella cells, where the effluent-grown cells were characterised by greatly reduced intracellular glycerol content. These reduced glycerol levels are assumed to have arisen from the glycine-induced stimulation of glycerol release which was observed in this study, where the high glycine content of the hide soak liquor is proposed to have induced glycerol release. This enhanced glycerol release in tatmery effluent could play a central role in the fimction of Dunaliella-based High Rate Oxidation Ponding systems, by stimulating bacterial activity. Observed glycerol productivities were therefore proposed to be a fimction of the type and concentration of the organic constituents of the medium. A similar medium-induced phenomenon was observed in the starch content of Dunaliella cells. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of sulfur compounds (e. g. protein, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, etc.) in the feed stream generates highly corrosive and odorous hydrogen sulfide during anaerobic digestion. The high sulfide {{level in the}} biogas stream is not only poisonous to many novel metal catalysts employed in thermo-catalytic processes but also reduces the quality of methane to produce renewable energy. This study used an innovative, low-maintenance, low-cost biological sulfide removal technology to remove sulfides simultaneously from both gas and liquid phase. ORP (Oxidation-Reduction-Potential) {{was used as the}} controlling parameter to precisely regulate air injection to the sulfide oxidizing unit (SOU). The microaeration technique provided just enough oxygen to partially oxidize sulfides to elemental sulfur without inhibiting methanogenesis. The SOU was equipped with a diffuser at the bottom for the dispersion of sulfide-laden biogas and injected air throughout the column. The SOU can be operated as a standalone unit or coupled with an anaerobic digester to simultaneously remove sulfide from the biogas and effluent. The integrated system was capable of reducing hydrogen sulfide in biogas from 2, 450 to less than 2 ppmV with minimal sulfate production at the highest available sulfide loading rate of 0. 24 kg/m 3 -day. More than 98 % of sulfide removed was recovered as elemental sulfur. However, the standalone SOU was able to operate at high hydrogen sulfide loading of 1. 46 kg/m 3 -day at inlet sulfide concentration of 3000 ppmV and reduce the off-gas hydrogen sulfide concentrations to less than 10 ppmV. The experiment also revealed that the ORP controlled aeration was sensitive enough to prevent oxygen overdosing (dampening effect) during unexpected surges of aeration. Using generalized linear regression, a model predicting output H 2 S concentration based on input H 2 S concentrations, SOU medium heights, and biogas flow rates, was derived. With 95 % confidence, output H 2 S concentration was affected by changes in liquid heights the most, followed by changes in flow rates. Feasibility studies for H 2 S removal from biogas by micro-aeration were conducted at the Ames Water Pollution Control Facility (AWPCF) by using different types of liquid media available at the plant, i. e. plant <b>effluent,</b> mixed <b>liquor,</b> and digester supernatant. From the experiment at AWPCF, it was found that operating pHs were affected by the amount of alkalinity in the liquid media and that the removal efficiencies were affected by the operating pH. Among all the liquid media tested, digester supernatant showed the greatest potential with more than 99 % H 2 S removal at an operating pH of 7. 0 and volumetric biogas flow rate of 21. 6 m 3 /m 3 -hr. By increasing trace metal contents and temperature of the medium, the hydrogen sulfide removal rate was greatly improved. The operating cost of the full-scale system was estimated to be approximately $ 2 /kg-S-removed. In addition, it was also revealed that abiotic sulfide oxidation accounted for 95 % of overall sulfide oxidation. This technology is expected to widen the use of biogas as a renewable fuel since the maintenance requirements of biogas handling equipment, the methane purification costs, and the emissions of SOx will dramatically be reduced. Importantly, the technology does not require inoculation of special bacteria, addition of nutrients and trace elements, or chemicals for pH control...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{stability}} (in terms of half-life time) and decolourisation efficiency of free and immobilised laccase was determined in four industrial dyeing <b>effluents.</b> The dyeing <b>liquors</b> composition and the chemical {{structure of the}} dyes influence significantly the stability and the decolourisation ability of the enzyme. The dyeing in enzymatically decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent provided consistency of the colour with both bright and dark dyes. Additionally the number of washing cycles necessary to remove the hydrolyzed dyestuff from dyed textiles was reduced using an enzymatic pre-treatment. In decolourisation experiments with immobilised laccase, two phenomenons were observed - initial decolourisation due to adsorption on the support and dye degradation due to the enzyme action. This research focuses on the stability and decolourisation ability of free and immobilised laccase in industrial dyeing effluents and their reuse for dyeing. In our experiments {{the stability of the}} immobilised laccase in dyeing liquors was unexpectedly lower than the stability of the free enzyme. The stability of the laccase in dyeing effluents {{is a result of the}} additive effect of all components presented. The decrease of enzymatic activity could be associated with the potential protein â dyeing effluent components interactions. Azoaromatic sulfonate dye anions could provide enzyme stabilisation. However, the structure of the immobilised laccase possibly became less accessible than the free enzyme for interaction with the anionic dyes, and thereby the stabilisation was not efficient. Non-ionic surfactants present in the dyeing liquors are able to stabilise the enzyme in solution by formation of a surrounding shell. The surfactant stabilisation was effective only on free enzyme. The salts in the dyebaths also displayed enzyme stabilising properties. The presence of CrVI and CrIII in the mordant dyeing effluent could cause significant loss of activity. The colour removal with immobilized laccase is due to the additive effects of dye-support adsorption, dye-protein adsorption and enzymatic dye degradation. In the decolourisation experiments carried out in pure dyes, the higher the hydrophilicity of the dye, the lower was the decolourisation. The Reactive Blue 158 adsorbed on the alumina support could act as mediator in laccase-assisted reactions, explaining the higher decolourisation of Reactive Black 5 with immobilized enzyme. The decolourisation efficiency in dyeing effluents was affected by the stabilization/destabilisation interactions in the dyeing formulation. Acceptable colour difference was achieved in dyeing with dyebaths prepared with laccase decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent. Enzymatic treatment of dyed textiles provided water savings, reducing the number of the after-dyeing washing cycles. E...|$|R
