5000|$|The Albany rotary <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> {{was created}} in 1901 in the Old Kent Road area of South London in a small {{workshop}} controlled by R. White & Co. Mineral Water Manufacturers.

50|$|Rubbing {{of metal}} engine parts inevitably {{produces}} some microscopic metallic particles from {{the wearing of}} the surfaces. Such particles could circulate in the oil and grind against moving parts, causing wear. Because particles accumulate in the oil, it is typically circulated through an oil filter to remove harmful particles. An oil pump, a vane or <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> powered by the engine, pumps the oil throughout the engine, including the oil filter. Oil filters can be a full flow or bypass type.|$|E

50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. <b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. Vane pumps and gerotor pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with <b>gear</b> or vane <b>pumps.</b> Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or {{with one or more}} <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> or vane <b>pumps</b> (the <b>gear</b> or vane <b>pumps</b> often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units). Axial plunger pumps of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other pumps.|$|R

50|$|The rear pump was an {{unregulated}} <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> {{driven from}} the transmission output shaft, which meant it {{was capable of}} pressurizing the transmission if the vehicle was in motion. This feature {{made it possible to}} push-start a vehicle with a dead battery if the vehicle could be accelerated to at least 15 - 20 mph. At higher speeds, the rear pump provided all the oil volume that was needed to operate the transmission and the front pump's slide was nearly centered, causing that pump to produce little output.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} to geometric displacement optimization of external helical <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> is presented. In addition, relations of pump flow property {{and its influence}} factors are also inves-tigated. During that, only the pumps with transverse contact ratios of not less than one are discussed. First, using the involute property, an analytic representation for flowrates is deduced, by which displacements and fluctuation coefficients of helical <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Then, by incorporating several design considerations, optimization problems formaximum geometric displacement are formulated and solved integrally by an opti-mization code, Multifunctional Optimization System Tool, with which various types of design variables including real, integer, and discrete can be simultaneously dealt with. Finally, the desired pumps with optimal displacement can be obtained. The proposed approach facilitates the design optimization of helical <b>gear</b> <b>pumps.</b> Moreover, influences of design parameters on the displacement and flow characteristics of the optimal pumps by assigning individual param-eters are investigated. The result also concludes that the pump with a larger module, larger face width, or smaller tooth number has bigger displacement but may cause more severe flowrate fluctuation...|$|R
