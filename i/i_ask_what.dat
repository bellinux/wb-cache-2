500|$|Blood {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} as the first two OSI albums. Matheos and Moore worked together on the album long-distance, mainly by emailing each other files. Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> I can do, and I mess around, complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>what</b> am I to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the outpouring}} of support she {{received}} from the black community. Douglas writes, [...] "In my opinion, those who call the Southern Negroes ungrateful are only those who never do anything to call forth that emotion....May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> gratitude they owe {{to those who would}} degrade them? [...] What gratitude does that child owe to his own father, who would coldly sell [...] him as [...] a slave?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The diary {{states at}} 02:00 (6-12-41) Turner fears a sudden Japanese attack on Manila. At 14:00 the diary states [...] "Everyone present on O.N.I. I speak to Director Admiral Wilkinson, Captain MacCollum, Lt. Cdr. Kramer... They show me – on my request – {{the place of}} the 2 {{carriers}} (see 2–12–41) West of Honolulu. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> the idea is of these carriers on that place. The answer was: 'perhaps in connection with Japanese rapports [...] on eventual American actions'. There is not one of ours who speaks about a possible air attack on Honolulu. I myself did not think of it because I believed everyone on Honolulu to be 100% on the alert, as everyone here on O.N.I. There prevails a tense state of mind at O.N.I."
