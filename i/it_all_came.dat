25|$|Suddenly, in 1988, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> {{crashing}} down for Switzer. His team {{was placed on}} probation by the NCAA for violating several rules. In a six-month time frame, there was a shooting and a rape in the athletic dorm on Oklahoma's campus. Switzer's house was robbed {{with the help of}} one of his athletes, and an athlete was caught attempting to sell drugs to an undercover agent. The three-year probation included a two-year ban on TV and bowl appearances and a reduction in scholarships from 25 to 18. Nonetheless, the 1988 team established the NCAA Division I single-game record of 768yards rushing against Kansas State on October 15, 1988, a record that stands to this day. After the season, Switzer resigned as head coach.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{civilization and}} culture, {{apart from the}} ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found {{exclusively}} among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All {{this is due to}} the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> their high civilization.|$|E

25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, and I {{needed to get}} a new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1916 morale in {{the factory}} went slowly downhill, but nothing was done to {{alleviate}} the problem, although consultations were going on between Whitehall and Birtley {{on how best to}} deal with any unrest that night occur {{in the factory}}. Another problem was that in practice the Colony was policed by Belgian gendarmes but in theory they were working under British rule of law, very different from their own. As just one example, back home the gendarmes were allowed to carry pistols at all times: here they were not allowed to be armed except under special circumstances and only then with the approval of the British police. Finally, on 20 December 1916, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> to a head. One of the workers went to see Captain Algrain, Military Head of Security, in order to obtain four days leave, to which he was entitled to. Suddenly the captain noticed that the man, though wearing his regulation uniform, was sporting a civilian cap. Enraged at this ‘breach of discipline’, he had the man sent directly to the cells for four days, to join two others who had attempted to leave the camp in civvies. The rest of the workforce quickly got to hear about this unjust act.|$|E
25|$|The season <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> {{together}} for the Runnin’ Rebels was 1989–90. Future NBA star Larry Johnson transferred from Odessa College, joining Greg Anthony, Stacey Augmon, David Butler and Anderson Hunt. The Rebels began the season ranked No. 1 in almost every poll and rolled through the competition. UNLV suffered a surprising loss at New Mexico State and finished the season as co–champions of the Big West Conference. However, Johnson and Co. flexed their muscles in the Big West Tournament, running away with the title and the No. 1 seed in the West Region. In NCAA Tournament play, the Rebels toughest game came {{in the third round}} at Oakland, Calif., when Ball State hung tough before falling 69–67. UNLV also ended Loyola Marymount’s Cinderella season with a 131–101 thrashing in the regional final. The win set up a semifinal match with Georgia Tech at McNichols Arena in Denver. Trailing by seven at the half, UNLV rallied for an 89–80 triumph and a date in the championship. The 1990 NCAA Championship was all UNLV as an 18–0 run midway through the second half sent Duke reeling as the Rebels ran up the most lopsided victory in championship history, 103–73. Hunt was named Most Outstanding Player at the Final Four for his performance as the Rebels finished the season 35–5. The squad was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E

500|$|The {{underside}} of the BT49 is shaped to create downforce through ground effect: air is accelerated under the car, reducing the air pressure beneath it and pushing the tyres down harder onto the track. This provides more grip and thus higher cornering speeds, but compared to conventional wings creates less of the drag that slows the car in a straight line. In its original form, the reduced pressure area under the car was sealed off with sliding skirts which rose and fell with {{the movement of the}} car to ensure no air could leak under it. According to Murray, the aerodynamics were the car's great strength: [...] "It had more [...] than any other car and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> from the ground effect. We ran the car with no front wing at all and scarcely any at the back." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Our Song" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. [...] While listening to [...] "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideals for a music video with Swift. [...] "She had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It just shows what a truly great director she is", Swift informed CMT News. The video was conceptualized to be very fantasy-like and surreal. The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as she paints them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair, is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront her bedroom mirror, which she writes the word [...] "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in [...] a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs [...] "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying {{on a bed of}} flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed by a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes with Swift giggling while sitting on the front porch.|$|E
500|$|However, in the 1968–69 season, Russell {{seemed to}} reach a {{breaking}} point. Shocked by the murder of Robert F. Kennedy, disillusioned by the Vietnam War, and weary from his increasingly stale (and later divorced) marriage to his wife Rose, {{he was convinced that}} the U.S. was a corrupt nation and that he was wasting his time playing something as superficial as basketball. He was 15 pounds overweight, skipped mandatory NBA coach meetings and was generally lacking energy: after a New York Knicks game, he complained of intense pain and was diagnosed with acute exhaustion. Russell pulled himself together and put up 9.9 points and 19.3 rebounds per game, but the aging Celtics stumbled through the regular season. Their 48–34 record was the team's worst since 1955–56, and they entered the playoffs as only the fourth-seeded team in the East. In the playoffs, however, Russell and his Celtics achieved upsets over the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks to earn a meeting with the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. L.A. now featured new recruit Wilt Chamberlain next to perennial stars Baylor and West, and were heavily favored. In the first two games, Russell ordered not to double-team West, who used the freedom to score 53 and 41 points in the Game 1 and 2 Laker wins. Russell then ordered to double-team West, and Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, the Celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and the Lakers having the ball, but then Baylor stepped out of bounds, and in the last play, Sam Jones used a triple screen by Bailey Howell, Larry Siegfried and Havlicek and hit a buzzer beater which equalized the series. The teams split the next two games, so <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> down to Game 7 in L.A., where Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke angered and motivated the Celtics by putting [...] "proceedings of Lakers victory ceremony" [...] on the game leaflets. Russell used a copy as extra motivation and told his team to play a running game, because in that case, not the better, but the more determined team was going to win.|$|E
