25|$|Beveridge saw full {{employment}} (defined as unemployment {{of no more}} than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. Full Employment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Society,</b> written in 1944 expressed how this goal might be gained. Alternative measures for achieving it included Keynesian-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's thinking was social justice, and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour {{government}} elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. Beveridge published widely on unemployment and social security, his most notable works being: Unemployment: A Problem of Industry (1909), Planning Under Socialism (1936), Full Employment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Society</b> (1944), Pillars of Security (1943), Power and Influence (1953), and A Defence of Free Learning (1959).|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between alternative views of economic freedom have been {{expressed in terms}} of Isaiah Berlin's distinction between positive freedom and negative freedom. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast Amartya Sen argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals. One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life. In his book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

500|$|As the Wisconsin primary loomed {{in early}} April, Nixon's only {{obstacle}} {{seemed to be}} preventing his supporters from voting in the Democratic primary for Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota as a protest against President Johnson. However, Johnson [...] before the primary, meanwhile Governor Reagan's name was {{on the ballot in}} Wisconsin, but he did not campaign in the state and was still not a declared candidate. Nixon won the primary with 80% followed by Reagan with 11% and Stassen with 6%. With Johnson removed from the race, Nixon fell behind Democratic candidates Eugene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy in head-to-head match-ups. At the end of April, Nixon called for a moratorium on criticism of the Johnson policy in Vietnam as negotiations were underway: [...] "The one man who can do anything about peace is Lyndon Johnson, and I'm {{not going to do anything}} to undercut him." [...] However, the Democratic candidates for president remained fair game for criticism. He argued that [...] "A divided Democratic Party cannot unite a divided country; a united Republican Party can." [...] He also began to discuss economics more frequently, announcing plans to cut spending while criticizing the Democrats' policy of raising taxes. During a question and answer session with the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Nixon spoke out of turn, receiving numerous interruptions of applause. The largest came when he addressed the issue of crime, proclaiming that [...] "there cannot be order <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> <b>society</b> without progress, and there cannot be progress without order." ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis examines current U. S. policy vis-a-vis Cuba, {{and its impact}} on the development of democracy in Cuba. It argues that U. S. policy is counter-productive <b>in</b> promoting <b>a</b> sustainable, inclusive democracy in Cuba, because it demands that the Castro regime hold 'free and fair' elections prior to any normalization in the relations between the two countries. This demand ignores the fact that Cuban Civil society is woefully underdeveloped, and is not prepared to effectively participate in the creation and maintenance of a truly representational government. Without a vibrant civil society, Cuba is likely to fail under the control of an authoritarian, populist regime whose relationship to the United States may prove no more cordial than Castro's. The thesis recommends practical steps through which the United States can reward Cuban liberalization without requiring immediate political democratization. The goal of these steps is to encourage the opening of political space within which Cuban associational groups with <b>a</b> clear stake <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>freer</b> <b>society</b> can flourish.
