It depicted {{construction workers}} who {{were satisfied with the}} working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E

[...] Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post said that even though Gaga turns somewhat serious while disapprovingly singing [...] "Paparazzi", the song comes across as flat and faceless as well as vapid. Erika Howard of the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called it the most telling track from the album.|$|E

[...] Although Aguilera is heartbroken by the decision to split up with her ex-boyfriend, she is not a broken person.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would lift my voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks I told him that I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated."

They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> now? Empty? Not yet. But we need to get help. When you play 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E

Later that year, the Spice Girls were invited to sing on the official England World Cup song [...] "How <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Feel</b> (To Be on Top of the World)", the last song recorded with Halliwell until 2007.

Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100 million from video rentals and became one of MGM's top 20 all-time bestsellers. Verhoeven accepted the film's unexpected cult status, saying [...] "Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn't what I intended, but it's like a resurrection after the crucifixion." [...] Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: [...] "What Paul [...] and I had in mind was something darkly funny.

2500|$|Ejector Seat Reservation did {{get some}} press in {{mainland}} Europe (specifically France and Germany) and received significant support from licensee Sony Music in Australia, including {{an invitation for}} the group to tour {{the country at the}} end of the year, but that did not prevent it from becoming Swervedriver's poorest selling album. Despite its lack of commercial success, critics have considered Ejector Seat Reservation to be the band's highest achievement. Andy Kellman of AllMusic crowned it their [...] "most cohesive and concise record, best experienced in whole," [...] which [...] "Swervedriver effortlessly committed ... as if they had it in them all along." [...] Magnet magazine's Gil Gershman complimented it as the [...] "work of artists enjoying a towering creative high" [...] that [...] "should have topped every chart and won legions over to the Swervedriver cause."
