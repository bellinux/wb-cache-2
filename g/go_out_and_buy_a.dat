5000|$|... {{might just}} might be the most hypocritical thing I’ve seen in the past year.....How bad is it? Let me count the ways.# Politicians who rail against {{wasteful}} government spending are taking action to prevent the government from reining in … wasteful spending.# Politicians who warn that the burden of entitlements is killing the federal budget are stepping in to block … the single most painless route to reducing the growth of entitlements.# They’re doing it in the name of avoiding “rationing of health care” … but they’re specifically addressing taxpayer-funded care. If you want to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> medically useless treatment, Medicare won’t stop you.# These same politicians are, of course, opposed to efforts to expand coverage. In other words, it’s evil for government to “ration care” by only paying for things that work; it is, however, perfectly OK, indeed virtuous, to ration care by refusing to pay for any care at all.|$|E

Double spread would be $15; single would be seven, sometimes ten," [...] Flessel recalled in 2001. He broke into comics after answering an ad in The New York Times by Major Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, whose National Allied Publications would eventually become DC Comics, and began freelancing there. His first known work for the publisher appeared in More Fun Comics #10 (cover-dated May 1936), penciling and inking the two-page sword-and-sorcery feature [...] "Don Drake" [...] and the two-page humor strip [...] "Fishy Frolics". Flessel recalled, I don’t think they were looking for any pedigree or “Would you do this?” More like, “You’re a live body. What do you want to do? Take this and do it, then.” I realized they were desperate so I had to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> drawing table. They had just one table that they were doing all of the mechanical work on. So I got a table and managed to find a chair and sat down and they said, “Here.

5000|$|The single {{received}} general positive {{reviews from}} fans and critics. Popjustice.com stated, [...] "it's {{a bit like}} on Derren Brown when he spends days, weeks or months programming someone so that one day, when he comes along and prods them on the shoulder, it all comes flooding back {{and they can do}} something amazing like fly a kite or do the ironing with their eyes shut etc. It is as if the last eight or however many years of The X Factor, with the Inspirational Blub Tunes blasting out every time someone does something happy or sad or notable, has programmed us so that a prod from this Westlife tune makes us feel like we're through the boot camp. It feels good being Through To Boot Camp. It feels very good indeed. While 4music.com emphasized on a part of the lyrics saying, [...] "It includes such gems as 'Pulling at me like the stars do / You're like gravity.' Who'd have thought that physics could have such an influence in pop music." [...] Music All Stars said [...] "Safe" [...] is good, it has Westlife's typical moving/heart-warming lyrics but I just think the Irish lads have made way better first singles in the past." [...] Entertainment Focus said: [...] "Westlife are hardly considered to be cool are they in the industry? We aren’t going to do that. Whilst we wouldn’t choose to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Westlife single we can understand why people would. There's something so familiar about a Westlife track that the minute it starts you feel like you’re sat with an old friend you hold very dear. Safe sticks to the usual formula, and therefore guarantees that the band will be once again battling for the top spot in the charts the week of release. Soaring melodies, harmony-filled vocals and dramatic instrumentation all combine for another classic slice of Westlife. You can say many things about Westlife but one thing you can’t say is that the lads can’t sing. Each of the boys can hold their own and whilst Safe doesn’t exactly set our world on fire it’ll be held dearly to the hearts of every Westlife fan in the world. After 11 years you’ve got to admire the fact that the band are sticking with the ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ formula don’t you?" [...] Tina Hart of MSN UK quoted, Admittedly, I was kind of over Westlife when I got over Boyzone the first time around - sorry guys, I was a fickle teenager. The Irish quartet is still churning out the tunes though as the lead single Safe from forthcoming (eleventh!) album Gravity, is a suitably nice, sentimental ballad that will undoubtedly please hardcore fans and I’m sure I’ll now end up singing ‘I will keeep you sa-a-aafe’ all day after a few plays. With an accompanying dramatic multi-storyline video featuring a fiery car crash and domestic violence, it's not definitely not your less-interesting visual Flying Without Wings but Safe doesn’t quite reach the audio-epicness of FOW either. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said: [...] "Let's just get this out the way: Westlife's new single is called 'Safe' and it's a ballad. While the jokes write themselves, anyone who remembers their dodgy Rat Pack covers record from 2004 knows that we, and they, are in a much better place now. Back then we were certain the lads were about to call time, but a further five albums down the line, it's obvious they're doing something right. Of course, their eleven years in the game has given them a knack for spotting a good ballad, but truth be told, it's difficult to drum up much excitement for this kind of thing tenth album around. Nonetheless, the pounding piano riff, fist-clenching lyrics and that key change are, as ever, all present and correct. The real test? Whether it's used during those teary moments on next year's X Factor." [...] Daily Star added: [...] "YES, it's a ballad. But, hang on? This is not slushier than a smashed-up punnet of out-of-season Sainsbury's strawberries. In fact - gasp! - it's kind of cool in a key change-tastic boyband ballady way. Fans {{are going to have a}} right job deciding between buying this and the JLS and Take That offerings. In fact, the ‘Loife might just mop up the Take That fans who aren’t so keen on the lads’ new Muse-esque direction.IndieLondon informed, [...] "How you going to live your life like the dream you have is real?… I will keep you safe…" [...] So sing Westlife during the chorus to their epic new power ballad, Safe. And that title tells you just about everything you need to know about the track… it's safe, conventional and passionately heartfelt in the way that you’d expect a power pop ballad to be from one of the boy bands of the moment. That is to say, a moody piano score, belated swirling string arrangements and a layered chorus that delivers each question - [...] "How you gonna love? How you gonna feel?" [...] - with passion and meaning. It's destined to sweep the hopeless romantics off their feet, and to provide the backing for several movie and/or TV scenes… but it is formulaic no matter how well done for this kind of thing (and therefore kind of average)." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{was talking}} with some friends recently, friends who don't own a computer. They were {{thinking}} of getting one so they could use Amazon. com to buy books and CDs. Not to use “the Internet,''not to use “the Web,''but to use Amazon. com. Now, that's the classic definition of a “killer application'': one that makes someone <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> computer. What's interesting is that the killer application {{is no longer a}} desktop productivity application or even a back-office enterprise software system, but an individual web site. And once you start thinking of web sites as applications, you soon come to realize that they represent an entirely new breed, something you might call an “information application,''or perhaps even “infoware. ''Information applications are used to computerize tasks that just couldn't be handled in the old computing model. A few years ago, if you wanted to search a database of a million books, you talked to a librarian, who knew the arcane search syntax of the available computerized search tools and might be able to find what you wanted. If you wanted to buy a book, you went to a bookstore, and looked through its relatively small selection. Now, {{tens of thousands of people}} with no specialized training find and buy books online from that million-record database every day. The secret is that computers have come one step closer to the way that people communicate with each other. Web-based applications use plain English to build their interface [...] words and pictures, not specialized little controls that acquire meaning only as you learn the software. Traditional software embeds small amounts of information in a lot of software, infoware embeds small amounts of software in a lot of information.
