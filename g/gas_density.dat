She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a <b>gas</b> <b>density</b> switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the <b>gas</b> <b>density</b> switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

40|$|We present UBVJHKHalpha and HI {{data of the}} {{irregular}} galaxy NGC 2366. It is a normal boxy-shaped disk seen at high inclination angle. We do not see any unambiguous observational signature of a bar. There is an asymmetrical extension of stars along {{one end of the}} major axis of the galaxy, and this is where the furthest star-forming regions are found, at 1. 3 R_Holmberg. The HI is normal in many respects but shows some anomalies: 1) The integrated HI shows two ridges running parallel to the major axis that deproject to a large ring. 2) The velocity field exhibits several large-scale anomalies superposed on a rotating disk. 3) The inclination and position angles derived from the kinematics differ from those dervied from the optical and HI mor- phology. 4) There are regions in the HI of unusually high velocity dispersion that correlate with deficits of HI emission in a manner suggestive of long-range, turbulent pressure equilibrium. Star-forming regions are found where the <b>gas</b> <b>densities</b> locally exceed 6 Msolar/pc^ 2. NGC 2366, like other irregulars, has low <b>gas</b> <b>densities</b> relative to the critical <b>gas</b> <b>densities</b> of gravitational instability models. Because of the lack of shear in the optical galaxy, there is little competition to the slow gravitational contraction that follows energy dissipation. However, the peak <b>gas</b> <b>densities</b> in the star-forming regions are equal to the local tidal densities for gravitational self-binding of a rotating cloud. Evidently the large scale gas concentrations are marginally bound against background galactic tidal forces. This condition for self-binding may be more fundamental than the instability condition because it is local, three-dimensional, and does not involve spiral arm generation as an intermediate step toward star formation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the galactic tidal field is usually {{considered}} disruptive in the literature. However, in some cases its effect can become compressive.

40|$|Abstract. The {{method for}} the {{extinction}} correction {{based on the}} <b>gas</b> column <b>density</b> is tested. A positive correlation is found between the total <b>gas</b> column <b>density</b> and the extinction estimated using a model based on energy conservation (‘frequencyconverter model’). Assuming a Solar Neighbourhood opticaldepth–to–gas ratio, extinction is predicted from the <b>gas</b> column <b>density</b> using a radiative transfer model which adopts a ‘Sandwich’ configuration for the stellar and dust distributions, and which takes also into account the effect of scattering. This prediction agrees well with the extinction estimated from the energy conservation consideration. This indicates that (1) the method for the extinction correction based on the <b>gas</b> column <b>density</b> is a robust one; (2) in the inner part of galaxy disks {{where most of the}} extinction occurs, the dust-to-gas ratio is on average about the same as the Solar Neighbourhood value. Our results also suggest that dust grains associated with both gas phases (HI and H 2) participate in the extinction, with a relative importance depending on the abundance of the gas phase in the inner disk. For most of the galaxies in our sample the extinction is mainly due to the dust associated with the molecular gas because they have high molecular to atomic <b>gas</b> column <b>density</b> ratios. On the other hand, for galaxies whose <b>gas</b> column <b>density</b> is dominated by the atomic gas, the extinction seems to be mainly caused by the dust associated with atomic gas...|$|R

The inorganic and anion constituent concentrations were compared to active unconventional <b>gas</b> well <b>density</b> relative to each household. Cross-sectional, temporal, and spatial analytical techniques were employed to explore potential relationships between analyte concentrations or change in analyte concentrations and <b>gas</b> well <b>density</b> or change in <b>gas</b> well <b>density.</b> Overall, the groundwater in Washington County is of good quality {{and there was no}} evidence for systematic deterioration of water quality due to <b>gas</b> well <b>density.</b> Manganese and pH exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs) in ~ 12 % of samples each, but these exceedances were expected due to the long history of acid mine drainage throughout the County. Eight analytes (Cr, Co, Li, Hg, Ni, K, Sn, and temperature) exhibited statistical significance when their initial and subsequent sample event medians were compared.

2500|$|Ultraviolet (UV), X-ray {{and shorter}} {{wavelengths}} of solar radiation are ionizing, since photons at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge an electron from a neutral gas atom or molecule upon absorption.

The reverse process to ionization is recombination, in which a free electron is [...] "captured" [...] by a positive ion. Recombination occurs spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination.

2500|$|It is also {{important}} to take losses due to fuel production, transportation, and storage into account. Fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22% if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas, and 17% if it is stored as liquid hydrogen. Fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery, except as hydrogen, but in some applications, such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power, they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system. Most hydrogen, however, is produced by steam methane reforming, and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide. The overall efficiency (electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity) of such plants (known as round-trip efficiency), using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be [...] "from 35 up to 50 percent", depending on <b>gas</b> <b>density</b> and other conditions. While a much cheaper lead–acid battery might return about 90%, the electrolyzer/fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen, and is therefore better suited for long-term storage.|$|E
2500|$|Bernoulli's {{equation}} is sometimes valid for {{the flow of}} gases: provided {{that there is no}} transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. [...] If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. [...] In this case, Bernoulli's equation – in its incompressible flow form – cannot be assumed to be valid. [...] However, if the gas process is entirely isobaric, or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas, (so the simple energy balance is not upset). [...] According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. [...] Also the <b>gas</b> <b>density</b> will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature, however this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. [...] The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle, or in an individual isentropic (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density. [...] Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. [...] In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. [...] Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.|$|E
40|$|Many {{aspects of}} planet {{formation}} {{are controlled by}} the amount of gas remaining in the natal protoplanetary disk (PPDs). Infrared observations show that PPDs undergo a transition stage at several Myr, during which <b>gas</b> <b>densities</b> are reduced. Our Solar System would have experienced such a stage. However, there is currently no data that provides insight into this crucial time in our PPD's evolution. We show that the Isheyevo meteorite contains the first definitive evidence for a transition disk stage in our Solar System. Isheyevo belongs to a class of metal-rich meteorites whose components have been dated at almost 5 Myr after the first solids in the Solar System, and exhibits unique sedimentary layers that imply formation through gentle sedimentation. We show that such layering can occur via gentle sweep-up of material found in the impact plume resulting from the collision of two planetesimals. Such sweep-up requires <b>gas</b> <b>densities</b> consistent with observed transition disks. As such, Isheyevo presents the first evidence of our own transition disk and provides new constraints on the evolution of our solar nebula.
