40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines China's {{attempts to}} incorporate new, seemingly democratic f̀ire alarm' oversight institutions into their authoritarian political system. China's market economic reforms created new principal- agent problems that their traditional top-down oversight institutions cannot rectify, and {{these problems are}} forcing Chinese leaders to look for new solutions. Democratic leaders solve principal-agent problems by transferring monitoring authority to the citizenry, and Chinese leaders are borrowing that strategy by giving their own citizens new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions for holding local-level officials accountable to national-level laws and policies. However, Chinese leaders do not deploy these institutions uniformly across all policy sectors. Instead, they vary their <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions on a sector-by- sector basis, and this dissertation attempts to explain that variation. I argue that Chinese leaders divide their <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions into two broad categories : governmental and non-governmental. Governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> operate through state agencies; non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> operate through non-state communication and organization networks. Governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> are relatively safe, {{but they do not}} work well in China's politically controlled administrative environment. Non- governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> are relatively effective despite China's political controls, but they also pose additional risks. I argue that the risks associated with non- governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> vary across policy sectors. I hypothesize that Chinese leaders distinguish between high- and low-risk policy sectors and enable the more dangerous (and also more useful) non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> in the low-risk sectors only. This strategy maximizes the benefits from <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> oversight while also minimizing the potential political risks from non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms.</b> Unfortunately, this strategy also limits <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> effectiveness - especially in the high-risk sectors with the most restrictive non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> policies - so China's <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> institutions will not be as effective as their (relatively unlimited) democratic counterparts. I test my hypothesis by comparing Chinese <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> oversight strategies across three policy sectors: rural land expropriation (high risk), environmental protection (medium risk) and food and drug safety (low risk). The case studies from these three sectors support my argument that Chinese leaders differentiate between governmental and non-governmental institutions and only employ non-governmental <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> when the sector-specific political risks are relatively lo...|$|R

50|$|The later {{history of}} S. H.

A quick overview of this industry is available through several sources including the National Fire Protection Association's Guide to <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> and Signaling System Installation. Section I of the Pocket Guide notes the very first public <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> reporting system in the world, the Boston <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Telegraph, went into service in April 1852. The Guide also highlights key transitions that affected the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> industry such as smoke detectors beginning in 1960, visible signaling in the 1980s, and adoption of microprocessor and software technology.

50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system. The type of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> pull station, which signals the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|R

40|$|Some {{building}} occupants cannot {{hear the}} activated <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> nor can they recognize the <b>alarm,</b> although the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> {{system has been}} installed to the acceptable standard. Measurements of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> sound pressure levels (SPLs) in five elder care centres showed that the sound output of a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> can be depreciated after installation. The alarm level of a new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> installation could alert most of the building occupants but could not awaken a sleeping person. Subjective ratings on the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> audibility in terms of minimum <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> SPL were studied with 230 awaken subjects divided by two age groups (22 - 48 and 66 - 88) in the five elder care centres. A higher perceived SPL is preferred for the elder age group to obtain the same subjective rating, {{when compared with the}} younger age group. Correlations between the subjective ratings and the measured SPL show that the alarm SPL of 65 dBA can alert most of the occupants in daytime, but expressed a preference that the alarm SPL be increased. The results show that the minimum required <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> SPL is 74. 5 dBA, which agrees with the recommended alarm SPL at bed head of 75 dBA in the design guidelines.
