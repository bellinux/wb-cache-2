5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale <b>Frail</b> at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. <b>Frail</b> began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations <b>Frail</b> contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E

5000|$|Clawhammer and <b>frailing</b> are {{primarily}} banjo techniques that are sometimes {{applied to the}} guitar. [...] Jody Stecher and Alec Stone Sweet are exponents of guitar clawhammer. Fingerstyle guitarist Steve Baughman distinguishes between <b>frailing</b> and clawhammer as follows. In <b>frailing,</b> the index fingertip is used for up-picking melody, and the middle fingernail is used for rhythmic downward brushing. In clawhammer, only downstrokes are used, and they are typically played with one fingernail as is the usual technique on the banjo.|$|R

5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale <b>Frail</b> calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light.

5|$|In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale <b>Frail</b> {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12.

These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.|$|E

5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed the burst and determined {{that it was not}} strongly beamed. Further analysis by <b>Frail</b> and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E

5|$|On May13, {{five days}} after the first {{detection}} of GRB 970508, <b>Frail</b> resumed his observations with the Very Large Array. He made observations of the burst's position at a wavelength of 3.5cm and immediately detected a strong signal. After 24hours, the 3.5cm signal became significantly stronger, and he also detected signals at the 6 and 21cm wavelengths. This was the first confirmed observation of a radio afterglow of a GRB.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} month, <b>Frail</b> {{observed}} that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang is {{traditionally}} considered a women’s instrument by many groups: the Maguindanao, Maranao, Tausūg/Suluk, Samal, Badjao/Sama, Iranun, Kadazan, Murut, Bidayuh and Iban.

5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether.

Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, <b>Frail</b> calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E
