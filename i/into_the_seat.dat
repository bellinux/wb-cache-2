From {{the point}} of view of the {{interior}} of the car, an accelerating reference frame, there is a fictitious force pushing the passenger backwards, with magnitude equal to the mass of the passenger times the acceleration of the car. This force pushes the passenger back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> until the seat compresses and provides an equal and opposite force. Thereafter, the passenger is stationary in this frame, because the fictitious force and the real force of the seat are balanced.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the {{historic}} Gateway Theatre in the Jefferson Park community area of Chicago {{was purchased by}} the Copernicus Foundation {{with the intention of}} converting it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the Polish Cultural and Civic Center. Because of the building's historical significance, its interior was kept intact while the exterior was remodelled and a Neo-Baroque clock tower was added to give it the resemblance of the Royal Castle in Warsaw. It is a visual tribute to Chicago's large Polish populace, the largest such presence outside of the Republic of Poland.|$|E
25|$|The WN update from July 2013 added a VF Calais V {{interior}} and alloy wheels to the externally unchanged Caprice. The rear LCD screens for the Caprice V's DVD entertainment system now folded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> backs {{when not in}} use. The WN Caprice adds trailer stability control, rear cross traffic alert, backup camera, blind spot monitor, lane departure warning system, collision avoidance system, automotive head-up display, electric park brake, automatic parking. For the 2015 model year, the WN dropped the base model Caprice, leaving the Caprice V {{with a choice of}} L77 V8 or LPG-fuelled V6 engine options.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} quarter of the 13th century, Tomar was {{transferred}} into the control of the Templars, becoming its seat. The castle became {{an integral part of the}} defence system created by the Templars to secure the border of the young Christian Kingdom against the Moors, which at the time occupied the area to approximately the Tagus River. But, following the dissolution of the Templar Order, on 14 March 1319, and following the request of King Denis of Portugal, Pope John XXII instituted the Order of Christ. The seat of the former Knights Templar was converted in 1357 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of this new order.|$|E
25|$|Cabey {{ended up}} slumped {{in the short}} seat {{in the corner of}} the car next to the conductor's cab. Whether Cabey was struck by the fourth shot or by the fifth was {{critical}} to Goetz's claim of self-defense; this issue was fiercely contested at trial. Medical testimony said that such an injury would render the lower half of Cabey's body instantly useless. According to the prosecution, the fourth shot missed; then Goetz shot a seated Cabey at point-blank range with the fifth. The defense theory of how Cabey ended up in the seat was that he was standing when hit by the fourth shot, then collapsed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> due to the lurching and swaying of the train; with the fifth shot being the shot that missed.|$|E
25|$|The {{firearms}} officers {{boarded the}} train and it was initially claimed they challenged the suspect, though later reports indicate he was not challenged. According to Hotel 3, Menezes then stood up and advanced towards the officers and Hotel 3, at which point Hotel 3 grabbed him, pinned his arms against his torso, and pushed him back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> Although Menezes was being restrained, his body was straight {{and not in a}} natural sitting position. Hotel 3 heard a shot close to his ear, and was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage. He shouted 'Police!' and with hands raised was dragged out of the carriage by one of the armed officers who had boarded the train. Hotel 3 then heard several gunshots while being dragged out.|$|E

25|$|The Economy SkyCouch is {{available}} on the 787-9, 777-200ER and 777-300ER. It is a set of three Economy class seats on the window rows of the cabin that have armrests that retract <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back, and full leg rests that individually and manually can be raised to horizontal to form a flat surface extending {{to the back of the}} seats in front. It is largely designed for families for use as a flat play surface, and for couples, who on purchasing the middle seat for 25% more each, can use it as a flat sleeping surface. Each SkyCouch seat is equipped with the same basic facilities as a standard Pacific Economy seat. The Skycouch is only available on routes longer than 6 hours duration; where the aircraft are used on shorter routes, the leg rests are locked out and the Skycouch seats act as regular economy seats.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide {{up in front of the}} pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule was locked up.|$|E
2500|$|The seat [...] tube {{contains}} the seatpost of the bike, which {{connects to the}} saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the seatpost is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> tube. On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick release lever. The seatpost must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} impulses of making Strasbourg <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of {{numerous}} European institutions came from British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin, one of whose closest advisors had a daughter who had studied in the city. While Bevin publicly acknowledged that the multi-cultural, multi-confessionnal aspect {{of the city as}} well as its geographic situation in the heart of (western) Europe were the criteria on which it was chosen, he privately gave a completely different reason: [...] "Strasbourg? Perfect, no one will go there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Templar Order, on 14 March 1319 (following the request of King Denis of Portugal), Pope John XXII instituted the Order of Christ. The Templar order had been suppressed during most of Europe from [...] 1312–1314, but in Portugal its members, assets, and partly its membership were transferred to the Order of Christ. The seat of the former Knights Templar was converted in 1357 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of this new order. As a result, at about {{the first half of the}} 15th century, work was completed to adapt the Templar oratory, introducing an open choir to the western niche, about half-way up the wall. What remains of this adaptation was the colonnade frame with interior arch. At the same time the main palace was constructed.|$|E
