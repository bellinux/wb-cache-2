40|$|In {{this thesis}} the <b>Democratic</b> <b>People</b> <b>s</b> Republic of Korea (DPRK) {{is used as}} a case to explain the role {{credible}} deterrence plays in the 21 st century. The goal is to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} complex dynamics relating to nuclear weapons between the DPRK, the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK). It also sheds light on factors that may increase or decrease North Korean deterrence credibility. The main objective is to understand DPRK s nuclear weapons program and explain North Korean deterrence credibility. This thesis does this by drawing upon literature and information provided by respondents through conducted elite interviews. The study uses the information provided to discuss to what extent DPRK s nuclear weapons deter the United States and the ROK. The analysis goes deeper into the relationship between the three states and their nuclear weapons. The aim is to describe the role of deterrence and explain its impact on the relationship between the DPRK, the United States and the ROK. It identifies North Korean nuclear abilities and its will to use nuclear weapons against another state, and it discusses to which degree the United States and the ROK feel threatened by North Korean nuclear weapons. The findings indicate that the United States and the ROK is partially disposed to DPRK s nuclear deterrence because the DPRK do not at this moment have a reliable capability to hit the continental United States with nuclear weapons, but the DPRK has the capability to hit targets in the ROK, and American vital interests outside of the United States. Even though the DPRK can hurt the United States and the ROK with nuclear weapons, it seems unlikely that the DPRK would use nuclear weapons against another state because it appears that the leadership is a rational actor and regime survival is of greatest importance. The thesis argues that the DPRK is unlike any other country, and this makes predicting what the DPRK will do in a given situation almost impossible...|$|R
40|$|China {{is joining}} {{the group of}} {{countries}} that have reasonably comprehensive systems of social protection in place. In 2010, the National <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Congress adopted the first national Social Insurance Law, representing {{the culmination of a}} process of radical social reform. The question this paper asks is: what kind of welfare regime is being built in the <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of China? China has been politically unique. It is one of only five remaining communist states, the others being Cuba, Laos, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of Korea and Vietnam, and the only one (with some qualification for Vietnam) that has been economically successful. The characteristics of a communist state include centralized {{power in the hands of}} a party 9 lite and that this 9 lite is presumably motivated, to varying degrees, by some kind of socialist ideology of statism and social justice. While maintaining its political uniqueness, China has shed its economic uniqueness. With the reform and opening up that started in 1978, it turned its back on planned economy isolationism and has adopted an open socialist market economy. In considering what kind of welfare state is emerging in China, the paper looks at two hypotheses: is China producing a welfare state of its own kind, possibly a "socialist" welfare state? Or, if it is reproducing a conventional welfare state, what kind of previous experience elsewhere is it replicating...|$|R

The project culminate by concluding that the theories have different answers for examples the turn of events in the Six Party Talks. The Realist argues that the <b>Democratic</b> <b>People’s</b> Republic of Korea are acting selfish, whereas the Liberals argues that the talks show that there can be reached agreements through diplomacy in internal relations, while the English School advocates that there is a conflict of norms and values between <b>Democratic</b> <b>People’s</b> Republic of Korea and the international community.
