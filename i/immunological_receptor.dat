40|$|In this publication, a micromachined open {{tubular reactor}} is presented, {{which has been}} {{developed}} for the rapid and reliable performance of heterogeneous immunoassays in a miniatunzed chemical analysis system. In contrary to previous designs, this device was realized in conventional silicon with a novel two-side structuring process. Special care {{was given to the}} silicon oxide layer deposited at the inner reactor walls, which has to exhibit a high efficiency and stability for the coupling of <b>immunological</b> <b>receptor</b> layers. The performance of the reactor was tested with a miniaturized ISFET-FIA-ELISA-system using T- 2 toxin as a model analyte. In this system the micromachined reactors showed a high signal reproducibility and the <b>immunological</b> <b>receptor</b> layer could be regenerated repeatedly. Moreover, a major benefit is drawn from the easy handling of the micromachined reactor, which can be integrated into the system by a simple snap-in mount...|$|E
40|$|The elucidation of the {{molecular}} {{construction of the}} antigen receptors of T cells is a fundamental prerequisite for {{our understanding of the}} function of the immune system. Short of sufficient material for the analysis of structure, most of the present information on T cell receptors stems from serological, genetic, and functional studies (1 - 3). Such studies from a number of laboratories have suggested that the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region participates in antigen recognition by T cells, but other structural elements, although clearly inferred in some experiments, have not been unequivocally identified (3 - 6). One critical property that characterizes an <b>immunological</b> <b>receptor</b> system is the degree of diversity of its combining sites. For antibodies, a variety of different approaches to measure diversity has provided fairly clear estimates (7 - 9). For T cell receptors [...] because of the absence of well-characterized, soluble antigen-binding molecules [...] the only feasible approach is the precursor frequency analysis of T cells reactive to a given antigen in limiting dilution (10 - 12). The analysis of the combining-site diversity ofT cells is complicated by the existenc...|$|E
40|$|Chemokines {{have been}} shown to be {{effective}} bactericidal molecules against a variety of bacteria and fungi in vitro. These direct antimicrobial effects are independent of their chemotactic activities involving immunological receptors. However, the direct biological role that these proteins may play in host defense, particularly against intestinal pathogens, is poorly understood. Here, we show that CXCL 9, an ELR- chemokine, exhibits direct antimicrobial activity against Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching/effacing pathogen that infects the gut mucosa. Inhibition of this antimicrobial activity in vivo using anti-CXCL 9 antibodies increases host susceptibility to C. rodentium infection with pronounced bacterial penetration into crypts, increased bacterial load, and worsened tissue pathology. Using Rag 1 (-/-) mice and CXCR 3 (-/-) mice, we demonstrate that the role for CXCL 9 in protecting the gut mucosa is independent of an adaptive response or its <b>immunological</b> <b>receptor,</b> CXCR 3. Finally, we provide evidence that phagocytes function in tandem with NK cells for robust CXCL 9 responses to C. rodentium. These findings identify a novel role for the immune cell-derived CXCL 9 chemokine in directing a protective antimicrobial response in the intestinal mucosa...|$|E

40|$|A micromachined open {{tubular reactor}} is presented, which was {{developed}} with special {{focus on the}} application in heterogeneous immunoassays such as the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In contrary to previous designs, this device was realized in silicon as a single channel and with one-side fluid connections. For the micromechanical fabrication a two side process employing SiC as an etch mask was developed. As a result, microreactors were produced with an internal volume of 27 mu l, which exhibit a meander-shaped channel at the chip frontside and two fluid ports on the backside. The meander is sealed with a pyrex cover by anodic bonding. During fabrication a silicon oxide layer with a high density of silanol groups is deposited at the inner reactor walls, resulting in a ready-to-use device for the covalent immobilization of immunoreceptors without the need of additional surface treatment. Due to the fact, that both fluid ports are located on the chip backside, the integr ation into a flow-through system is feasible with a simple snap-in mount. Tests of the reactor performance were done with a miniaturized toxin analyzer using T- 2 toxin as a model analyte. In this system the microreactors showed a high signal reproducibility, a short analysis time and could be regenerated repeatedly. First experiments have shown an excellent stability of the <b>immunological</b> <b>receptor</b> layer, which is fully active and re-usable even after more than 20 regeneration cycles...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of allergic diseases is increasing worldwide for unclear reasons. This sudden widespread increase, particularly in children, suggests causes {{that are not}} due to genetic makeup of individuals, but rather a change in environment and lifestyle factors. Growing epidemiological and immunological evidence supports the hygiene hypothesis, which states that decreased exposure to immune stimulatinginfections in early childhood {{is the cause of}} the rise in allergic diseases. Studies have shown that even bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can have a protective effect. The receptor for LPS is Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), an innate <b>immunological</b> <b>receptor,</b> which may play an essential role in regulation of allergic disease. We investigated the expression of TLR 4 in the nasal mucosa of allergic and non-allergic children and adults, the effects of LPS on allergic inflammation and the regulation of TLR 4 expression. We hypothesized that LPS, through TLR 4, could regulate allergic inflammation and that long-term allergic inflammation would limit these responses. Children and adults undergoing nasal surgery were recruited from the local hospitals. Nasal biopsies from the patients were explanted and cultured ex vivo with allergen and LPS. LPS could prevent allergen-induced Th 2 cytokine production and inflammatory cell increases in explants from atopic children; this was through induction of Th 1 cytokines and IL- 10. TLR 4 was also detected on CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells. LPS did not provide the same protection in adults. Adults, especially atopic subjects, had less TLR 4 immunopositive cells; hence, their reduced responsiveness to LPS. This suggests that factors could downregulate TLR 4 in allergic adults. The U- 937 monocytic cell line was used as an in vitro model to study the regulation of TLR 4 by interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), a T-helper type 2 (Th 2) cytokine involved in allergic inflammation. U- 937 cells cultured with IL- 4 had decreased LPS responsiveness, TLR 4 protein surface expression, TLR 4 mRNA expression and transcriptional activity of the upstream region of TLR 4. This effect was tyrosine kinase and STAT 6 dependent. A STAT 6 binding site was determined in an area of the TLR 4 gene necessary to mediate IL- 4 's inhibitory effects on TLR 4 transcription. IL- 4 was also determined to reduce TLR 4 expression in PBMCs, especially in CD 4 + T cells purified from the blood of children. As predicted in epidemiological studies and animal studies, LPS was shown to provide anti-inflammatory effects against allergen in human nasal tissue. LPS may directly stimulate regulatory T cells (CD 25 +CD 4 +) to produce anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The effects of LPS exposure may be lost due to reduced expression of TLR 4 by inflammatory cells, and this may be caused by the allergic inflammation itself. Therefore, development of allergic inflammation can down-regulate anti-inflammatory mechanisms and promote long term chronic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{familial}} type of monocyte dysfunction not recognized previously. This disorder {{was observed in}} a young adult man with a long clinical history of recurrent, self-limited episodes of cryptogenic fever accompanied by digestive and respiratory symptoms and repeated oral and skin infections. Lectin-induced lymphocyte transformation was reduced and skin tests revealed anergy to tuberculin and candidin. Monocytes from this patient exhibited markedly diminished expression of cytoskeletal vimentin intermediate filaments, HLA-DR antigens and <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> for IgG Fc and C 3 b.

40|$|Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases (RTK), {{like the}} PDGF-receptor, translate {{information from the}} extracellular environment into cytoplasmic signals that regulate a spectrum of cellular functions. RTK molecules consist of ligand binding extracellular domains, cytoplasmic kinase domains and tyrosine phosphorylation sites [Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990 (Cell 61, 203 - 212); Heldin, 1992 (EMBO J. 11, 4251 - 4259) ]. Upon ligand-induced RTK oligomerization, the kinase domains will become activated and induce auto(trans) phosphorylation {{of a number of}} cytoplasmic tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues are incorporated in distinct sequence motifs and act as specific docking sites for SH 2 domain-containing proteins [Songyang et al., 1993 (Cell 72, 767 - 778) ]. In contrast to single- or oligo-chain RTK, <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> such as antigen receptors, FcR and cytokine receptors are multi-chain complexes in which distinct receptor functions appear to be compartmentalized in distinct polypeptides.

40|$|Suppressor T {{cells have}} been shown to be much more {{radiosensitive}} than other lymphoïd cells, and we have tried to reduce tumor growth by low-dose irradiation. Syngeneic DBA/ 2 mice received whole-body irradiation (150 rads; 1 rad = 0. 01 J/kg) 6 days after P 815 tumor inoculation. Tumor growth is significantly reduced in mildly irradiated mice. We also attempted to reduce syngeneic tumor growth by raising immunity against suppressor T cells in two different systems. DBA/ 2 mice were immunized against splenic T cells collected after disappearance of cytotoxicity and then injected with P 815 tumor cells. These mice develop a very high primary cytotoxicity against P 815 cells. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were immunized against blastic suppressor T cells, before injection of T 2 tumor cells. Some of these mice reject the tumor and other develop smaller tumors than control mice. These results could be explained by the induction of antiidiotypic activity directed against the <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> of suppressor T lymphocytes, because immunization with blastic suppressor T cells from mice bearing the T 2 tumor does not modify the growth of another tumor, T 10...|$|R

40|$|Morphology, {{lysosomal}} enzyme activities, and phagocytosis via <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> {{were tested}} in peritoneal macrophages from germfree and conventional mice. Nonstimulated macrophages from germfree mice showed less spreading and were more easily detached when seeded on glass than conventional macrophages. The activities of the lysosomal acid phosphatase and cathepsin D were similar in the two cell groups, whereas β-glucuronidase showed higher activity in macrophages from germfree mice. Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis of opsonized sheep erythrocytes was equally effective in germfree and conventional macrophages, and both cell types attached but did not internalize erythrocytes via the C 3 b receptor. Intraperitoneal injections of mineral oil caused a significantly higher influx of macrophages in conventional mice than in germfree mice, whereas the influx of polymorphonuclear cells was enhanced in both animals. Stimulation in vivo with oil or Escherichia coli endotoxin increased cell size, spreading ability, membrane ruffling, and lysosomal enzyme activities in macrophages from both conventional and germfree mice. The Fc-mediated phagocytosis was not influenced by stimulation, whereas the capacity to internalize via C 3 b receptor was triggered in macrophages from conventional mice, but not in corresponding cells from germfree mice. Similar results were obtained after stimulation with endotoxin in vitro. Culture in fetal calf serum for 72 h caused intracellular rises in all three enzyme activities tested in macrophages from conventional mice, whereas only the activity of acid phosphatase was increased in macrophages from germfree mice. Stimulation with zymosan in vitro caused selective release of lysosomal enzyme activity in macrophages from both animal groups. We conclude that peritoneal macrophages from germfree mice share several properties with cells from conventional mice, however, unstimulated β-glucuronidase activity was increased, whereas spreading on glass, chemotactic response, in vitro induction of lysosomal enzymes, {{and the capacity to}} internalize via the C 3 b receptor after stimulation were reduced or absent...|$|R
40|$|The current {{problems}} in controlling severe viral infections of blood cells {{such as in}} AIDS {{as well as the}} lack of effective and safe pharmacotherapeutic measures for such diseases have renewed interest in the options of targeting of drugs and genes to various blood cell types. The design and development of potential carriers for cell-specific delivery of therapeutics should be based on the knowledge of recognition sites on the surface of blood cells as well as on insight into the internalization and further cellular disposition of such macromolecules. In this review the presence of various lectins on T-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages as well as <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> and adhesion molecules is described. These recognition sites could in principle serve in binding and/or endocytosis of glycoconjugate carriers for the delivery of drugs and genetic material. Glycoproteins with a suitable density of sugar groups or a proper geometric organization of oligosaccharide side-chains may provide potential carriers that escape receptor-mediated endocytic processes in other tissues such as liver, spleen and bone marrow. Other modalities are recombinant T-cell receptors (sCD 4) that bind to HIV-infected cells, monoclonal antibodies raised against viral envelope proteins, and certain cytokines. Bacterial toxins, antisense DNA and genes that code for synthesis of antivirally active proteins as well as coupling products of nucleoside analogs such as AZT have been delivered to blood cells using this technology. Some of these drug carriers may provide an intrinsic antiviral action that may add to the effect of the coupled drug (dual targeting). Such multi-active drug targeting preparations may offer the advantages of synergistic effects and counteraction of drug resistance apart from the improved body distribution aimed at. More detailed in vivo studies should be performed in patients to test the promising concepts that have been developed in in-vitro studies. It is obvious that such preparations should have major advantages compared with the untargeted material to compensate for the intrinsic drawback of parenteral administration...|$|R

40|$|During pregnancy, the {{maternal}} immune system protects the allogeneic foetus from rejection. At {{the same time}} the mother maintains immunity defences against potential pathogens. This study aimed to identify whether <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> associated with antigen presentation and strong inflammatory responses play a role in fetal-maternal tolerance. One such receptor is CD 74; a membrane-bound protein involved in HLA class II- mediated antigen presentation and a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) receptor. CD 44 is the signalling component of the MIF-CD 74 receptor complex. The expression of CD 74, MIF and CD 44 was studied in the human trophoblast-derived cell lines JEG- 3 and ACH- 3 P by RT-PCR, flow cytometry, Western blot, immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy. Results obtained showed that untreated JEG- 3 and ACH- 3 P cells did not express CD 74 mRNA. By contrast, CD 74 mRNA was upregulated in response to IFN-γ or LPS in these cell lineages. Slight upregulation of CD 74 was observed following exposure of cells to 500 IU/ml IFN-γ for 12 hr. However, after 5 µg/ml LPS treatment for 4 hr, CD 74 was highly upregulated. Results from flow cytometry showed no detectable surface expression of CD 74 in the JEG- 3 and ACH- 3 P cell lines even after IFN-γ or LPS treatment. However, IFN-γ and LPS exposure resulted in intracellular expression of CD 74 in both cell lines. Western blotting showed the absence of a protein band for CD 74 in both cell lines after IFN-γ treatment. However, the 35 kDa isoform of CD 74 was detected in JEG- 3 and ACH- 3 P cells treated with LPS. The results {{of this study indicate that}} LPS regulates the expression of MIF and CD 44 and trophoblast cell proliferation. It was also demonstrated that CD 74 positivity significantly increased after incubation with IFN-γ or LPS, and that MIF and CD 44 are up-regulated by LPS. No evidence was found for colocalization between CD 74 with either CD 44 or MIF in JEG- 3 and ACH- 3 P cells using confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation. This indicated that MIF plays an essential role in cell proliferation, whereas both MIF and CD 44 play an important role in human pregnancy maintenance. Together, the results suggest that the absence of cell surface expression specific isoforms of CD 74 may provide a protective role by minimising inflammatory processes, and thus maximising a healthy pregnancy. In turn, it is reasonable to assume that the overexpression of CD 74 in early pregnancy may be related to gestational complications...|$|R

Within the <b>immunological</b> synapses, mGlu <b>receptors</b> expressed by T cells might contribute to the vast array of signals generated by the antigen-presenting cells. mGlu receptors are also found in embryonic and neural stem cells.

40|$|In {{the failing}} human heart, due to {{idiopathic}} dilated cardiomyopathy, {{it has been}} suggested that the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR) is a potential pathogenic autoantigen. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether immunization of rats with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the β 1 AR (β 1 AR ECII) was able to induce the early stage of cardiomyopathy and also to investigate <b>immunological</b> and <b>receptor</b> functional parameters at a transcriptional level to permit insights into the autoimmune mechanism in cardiomyopathy. Eleven Whistar Fur rats were immunized with a β 1 AR ECII peptide (H 26 R) once a month during 12 months and seven control rats were injected with vehicle according to the same procedure used for the immunized group. Cardiac function, β 1 AR autoantibodies and their functional effects on cardiomyocytes were analysed. β 1 AR <b>receptor</b> signalling, <b>immunological</b> and cardiomyocyte stretch markers were determined on transcriptional level. In H 26 R immunized rats, β 1 AR autoantibodies were shown to be present and functionally active, cardiac functions in terms of fractional shortening were decreased and β 1 -adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK 2) mRNA were increased compared with the control group. These data have shown that immunization of rats with a putative antigenic peptide was able to induce an early stage phenotype of cardiomyopathy in the form of cardiac dysfunction and up-regulation of GRK 2 as the first step in the desensitization process of the β 1 AR, implying the pathological importance of the β 1 AR autoantibody...|$|R
40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{are responsible for}} 6. 5 % of all hospital admissions. They also affect 10 to 20 % of hospitalized patients. Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions constitute an important major subtype of type B adverse drug reactions. Low molecular weight (i. e. penicillins, sulfamethoxazole and abacavir) and high molecular weight (biologics) drugs are both associated with the inadvertent activation of the adaptive immune system, which manifests as hypersensitivity in certain individuals. Pharmacogenomic research revealed that several forms of immunological drug {{reactions are}} strongly associated with specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles. The underlying mechanisms of HLA associated immunological drug reactions are still under exploration, however abacavir hypersensitivity represent a prototype model that exclusively occurs in individuals carrying the risk allele HLA- B* 57 : 01. One hundred and ten CD 8 + T-cell clones out of 1304 clones generated from 3 HLA-B* 57 : 01 healthy volunteers displayed proliferative responses and/or secreted interferon gamma {{in the presence of}} abacavir which have been used for further mechanistic studies to evaluate mechanisms of drug antigen presentation. Approximately half of the clones were activated with abacavir in the absence of antigen presenting cells. Of the remaining clones, interestingly about half were activated with abacavir pulsed APC. The APC pulse negative clones are likely activated via a PI mechanism involving the direct binding of abacavir to surface HLA-B* 57 : 01. In contrast, the pulse positive clones seem to be activated via the altered peptide repertoire mechanism involving abacavir binding to endogenous HLA-B* 57 : 01. Some clones were also activated with APC from certain allogeneic donors expressing different HLA-B alleles. APC-dependent abacavir-specific clones were activated by the drug in the presence of APC from at least 3 allogenic different donors. Sixteen 6 -amino substituted abacavir analogues were synthesized. Computational docking studies were completed to predict capacity for analogue binding within HLA-B* 57 : 01. Abacavir-specific CD 8 + clones were generated to study the association between HLA-B* 57 : 01 analogue binding and T-cell activation. Antiviral activity and the direct inhibitory effect of analogues on proliferation were assessed. MHC class I-restricted CD 8 + clones proliferated and secreted interferon gamma following abacavir binding to surface and endogenous HLA-B* 57 : 01. Several analogues retained antiviral activity and showed no overt inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation, but displayed highly divergent antigen-specific T-cell responses. Abacavir and N-propyl abacavir were equally potent at activating clones, while the closely-related analogues N-isopropyl and N-methyl isopropyl abacavir were devoid of T-cell activity. Docking abacavir analogues to HLA-B* 57 : 01 revealed a quantitative relationship between drug-protein binding and the T-cell response. These studies demonstrate that the unwanted T-cell activity of abacavir can be eliminated whilst maintaining the favourable antiviral profile. A relatively large panel of abacavir-dependent HLA-B* 57 : 01 binding self peptides were utilised to understand the mechanism of T-cell activation. Our data provides experimental evidence that a 9 mer peptide (Peptide 15; NTVELRVKI) is responsible for the polyclonal CD 8 + T-cell activation seen in abacavir hypersensitive patients. Furthermore, the discovery that most discovered unique altered self peptides are unable to induce CD 8 + T-cell activation indicated that the immune response is highly peptide specific. Collectively the data generated enhances our understanding of how a single drug abacavir interacts with <b>immunological</b> <b>receptors</b> to initiate an unwanted and often pathogenic immune response. Even for this most highly HLA-restricted immunological drug reaction the nature of the drug receptor interaction is much more complex than initially anticipated. Thus, further studies are needed to determine how the results presented herein relate to other forms of immunological drug reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{strategy}} of translationally fusing the subunits of heterodimeric proteins into single chain molecules {{is often used}} to overcome the mutagenesis-induced defects in subunit interactions. The approach of fusing the α and _β subunits of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) to produce a single chain hormone (phCGαβ) was used to investigate roles of critical residues of the α subunit in hormone receptor interaction and biological activity. The α subunit was mutated using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, fused to the wild type _β subunit and the fusion protein was expressed using Pichia pastoris expression system. Following partial purification, the mutant proteins were extensively characterized using <b>immunological</b> probes, <b>receptor</b> assays, and in vitro bioassays. The mutation hCGα P 38 A, which disrupts subunit interaction in the heterodimeric molecule, produced a fusion molecule exhibiting altered subunit interactions as judged by the immunological criteria, but could bind to the receptor with lower affinity and elicit biological response. Mutation of hCG α T 54 A disrupting the glycosylation at Asparagine 52, believed to be important for bioactivity, also yielded a biologically active molecule suggesting that the glycosylation at this site is not as critical for bioactivity {{as it is in the}} case of the heterodimer. The fusion protein approach was also used to generate a superagonist of hormone action. Introduction of four lysine residues in the Loop 1 of the α subunit led to the generation of a mutant having higher affinity for the receptor and enhanced bioactivity. Immunological characterization of single chain molecules revealed that the interactions between the subunits were not identical to those seen in the heterodimeric hormone, and the subunits appeared to retain their isolated conformations, and also retained the ability to bind to the receptors and elicit response. These data suggest the plasticity of the hormonereceptor interactions...|$|R

Previously, we have reported that angiotensin II caused an accumulation of cAMP and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in cultured glomerular epithelial cells. Current studies were conducted to verify the presence of angiotensin II <b>receptors</b> by <b>immunological</b> and non-peptide <b>receptor</b> ligand binding techniques and to ascertain the activation of intracellular signal transduction in glomerular epithelial cells in response to angiotensin II. Confluent monolayer cultures of glomerular epithelial cells were incubated with angiotensin II, with or without losartan and/or PD- 123, 319 in the medium. Membrane vesicle preparations were obtained by homogenization of washed cells followed by centrifugation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of membrane proteins followed by multiscreen immunoblotting {{was used to determine}} the presence of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT 1) or type 2 (AT 2). Angiotensin II-mediated signal transduction in glomerular epithelial cells was studied by measuring the levels of cAMP, using radioimmunoassay. Results obtained in these experiments showed the presence of both AT 1 and AT 2 receptor types in glomerular epithelial cells. Angiotensin II was found to cause an accumulation of cAMP in glomerular epithelial cells, which could be prevented only by simultaneous use of losartan and PD- 123, 319, antagonists for AT 1 and AT 2, respectively. The presence of both AT 1 and AT 2 receptors and an increase in cAMP indicate that glomerular epithelial cells respond to angiotensin II in a manner distinct from that of mesangial cells or proximal tubular epithelial cells. Our results suggest that glomerular epithelial cells participate in angiotensin II-mediated control of the glomerular filtration barrier...|$|R

Accuracy,dependability, reproducibility, specificity and stability of the techniques used are all important. The first three parameters are largely operator dependent, however, specificity and stability {{of the components of}} the tests also play a part. The specificity of analysis may be determined chemically or biologically by using enzymes, <b>immunological</b> reagents or <b>receptors</b> of some sort. However, biological molecules are often unstable in purified, isolated forms and must be stabilised in some way to retain activity. The work reported here attempts to increase the knowledge of enzyme stabilisation, using the enzyme alcohol oxidase as a test enzyme. This enzyme was used in : (i) A manual assay for ethanol determination. (ii) An automated assay using both soluble and immobilised enzyme in segmented flow and flow injection analysis. (iii) A dry phase stabilised enzyme based test for ethanol in saliva. During the course of the work a method for stabilising the enzyme was discovered. This has been applied to a number of other enzyme systems, successfully stabilising them in most cases. This work forms the basis of a patent application for enzyme stabilisation. A novel detection system allowing semi-quantitative results to be obtained, using stabilised dry phase technology has also been discovered. A second patent application has been filed and the system has been applied to analytes measured by oxidase enzymes. The final area of investigation was to develop an enzymic assay for diacetyl. This substance is a contaminant in beer and as such requires accurate detection at low levels.

40|$|Chemokines are a {{large family}} of low-molecular weight cytokines, which {{regulate}} the chemotaxis of leucocytes and {{play an important role}} in <b>immunological</b> processes. Chemokine <b>receptors</b> utilize G Proteins for signaling. One remarkable feature in the chemokine field is the redundancy and promiscuity of both chemokines and chemokine receptors. Forty-five chemokines and eighteen chemokine receptors have been indentified to date. Most of the chemokine receptors can recognize multiple chemokines, and many chemokines are shared by several chemokine receptors. Chemokine receptors are typically coupled to Gi proteins, however, it remains unclear whether the chemokine receptors can interact with other G proteins. The extent by which different chemokines regulate G protein functions through a single chemokine receptor is also unclear. Hence, the interactions of six chemokine receptors CCR 1, CCR 2 a, CCR 2 b, CCR 3, CCR 5 and CCR 7 with G 14 and G 16 were studied in cotransfection systems. Results revealed that three of them, CCR 1, CCR 2 b and CCR 3 were coupled to both G 14 and G 16, while others could not. The potencies for five ligands of CCR 1 (LKN- 1, MIP- 1 α, RANTES, MCP- 3 and MIP- 1 δ) to induce G 14 and G 16 -mediated responses were then examined. Results showed that chemokines can differentially induce stimulation of phospholipase C via G 14 and G 16. Moreover, different chemokines differentially induced phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK responses appeared to be regulated by both G 14 and Gi proteins. Lastly, the possibility of CCR 1 to signal through Gα 14 and Gα 16 was investigated in THP- 1 and U- 937 cells, which possess endogenous CCR 1, Gα 14 and Gα 16. In these cells, CCR 1 did not appear to mediate intracellular calcium release interact via Gα 14 and Gα 16. In summary, multiple chemokines may differentially regulate receptor-mediated signaling pathways and their receptors possess the ability to propagate the signals via G proteins other than those of the Gi family, although chemokine receptors might prefer to utilize Gi proteins in certain physiological systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} is {{comprised}} of tissue, cells, and chemicals that have been evolutionarily developed to protect ourselves from simple pathogenic components such as viruses and allergens, and more complex invading organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and parasites. This network of tissue, cells, and chemicals can even identify and remove compromised host cells, such as cancer cells. The components {{of the immune system}} can be organized into two categories: the innate immune system and adaptive immune system. Components of the innate immune system can be further organized into two categories: physical barriers and leukocytes. Physical barriers, such as skin, hair, epithelial cells, stomach acid, gut flora, and mucus membranes are the body’s first line of defense against invading pathogens. If the physical barriers of the innate immune system are breached, leukocytes are freely patrolling the body, ready to coordinate an immune response to any newfound pathogens. This is often achieved by phagocytic cells capable of antigen presentation, which in short, is how the innate immune system engages the adaptive immune system to generate <b>immunological</b> memory. Toll-like <b>receptors</b> (TLRs) exist at this interface between the innate and adaptive immune system. These receptors exist on either the cell surface or within endosomal compartments of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, B cells, and T cells. Activation of TLRs triggers a signaling cascade that results in the activation of several transcription factors. Depending on the transcription factor, either proinflammatory cytokines or type- 1 interferons (IFNs) are produced. Proinflammatory cytokines are important in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, further amplifying the immune response. IFNs can go on to bind IFN receptors, activating the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. One key outcome of this activation is the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the subsequent production of nitric oxide, a key molecule involved in the recruitment of immune cells with additional microbicidal properties. Within this thesis is described the design and synthesis of small molecules capable of 1) inhibiting the JAK/STAT 1 signaling pathway and 2) synergistic agonism of TLR 8 signaling in the presence of single-stranded ribonucleic acids (ssRNA) ...|$|R
5000|$|HIV-1 most {{commonly}} uses the chemokine receptors CCR5 and/or CXCR4 as co-receptors to enter target <b>immunological</b> cells. These <b>receptors</b> {{are located on}} the surface of host immune cells whereby they provide a method of entry for the HIV-1 virus to infect the cell. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein structure is essential in enabling the viral entry of HIV-1 into a target host cell. The envelope glycoprotein structure consists of two protein subunits cleaved from a Gp160 protein precursor encoded for by the HIV-1 env gene: the Gp120 external subunit, and the Gp41 transmembrane subunit. This envelope glycoprotein structure is arranged into a spike-like structure located {{on the surface of}} the virion and consists of a trimer of three Gp120-Gp41 hetero-dimers. The Gp120 envelope protein is a chemokine mimic. It lacks the unique structure of a chemokine, however it is still capable of binding to the CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors. During HIV-1 infection, the Gp120 envelope glycoprotein subunit binds to a CD4 glycoprotein and a HIV-1 co-receptor expressed on a target cell- forming a heterotrimeric complex. The formation of this complex stimulates the release of a fusogenic peptide inducing the fusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of the target host cell. Because binding to CD4 alone can sometimes result in gp120 shedding, gp120 must next bind to co-receptor CCR5 in order for fusion to proceed. The tyrosine sulfated amino terminus of this co-receptor is the [...] "essential determinant" [...] of binding to the gp120 glycoprotein. [...] Co-receptor recognition also include the V1-V2 region of gp120, and the bridging sheet (an antiparallel, 4-stranded β sheet that connects the inner and outer domains of gp120). The V1-V2 stem can influence [...] "co-receptor usage through its peptide composition as well as by the degree of N-linked glycosylation." [...] Unlike V1-V2 however, the V3 loop is highly variable and thus is the most important determinant of co-receptor specificity. The normal ligands for this receptor, RANTES, MIP-1β, and MIP-1α, are able to suppress HIV-1 infection in vitro. In individuals infected with HIV, CCR5-using viruses are the predominant species isolated during the early stages of viral infection, suggesting that these viruses may have a selective advantage during transmission or the acute phase of disease. Moreover, at least half of all infected individuals harbor only CCR5-using viruses throughout the course of infection.|$|R
40|$|The murine {{cytomegalovirus}} (MCMV) is {{a highly}} adapted pathogen and has developed numerous strategies to escape the host immune response. Using different escape mechanisms the virus is able to establish a lifelong persistent infection in immunocompetent hosts. Amongst others, myeloid cells are latently infected. Part of the latently infected cells are circulating monocytes, which {{play an important role}} in virus dissemination. The main functions of monocytes and macrophages are the early recognition of pathogens with respective surface receptors, the secretion of soluble mediators and other antimicrobial activities. The early phase of the immune response against MCMV is characterized by the production of chemokines which subsequently recruit and activate effector cells. One of the main sources of chemokines are myeloid cells and natural killer cells. In the current work it was shown for the first time at the single cell level that MCMV infects macrophages and thereby impairs the production of chemokines, cytokines and other essential immunological functions. MCMV blocked the activation of resting macrophages by microbial substances and the subsequent production of chemokines (MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β, RANTES and MCP- 1), cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 12, IL- 15, IL- 18 and TNF-α) and nitric oxid. The blockade by MCMV was achieved by downregulating of the surface receptors TLR 2 (toll like receptor 2) and TLR 4 leading to a stop of chemokine gene transcription. Hence MCMV infected macrophages were not able to produce chemokines and cytokines necessary for an effective TH 1 -immune response. In activated macrophages MCMV downregulated the ongoing production of the above mentioned soluble mediators. Additionally, MCMV interfered with other essential macrophage functions: the phagocytosis of dextran and the expression of <b>immunological</b> important surface <b>receptors</b> (CD 29, CD 80, CD 86 and CD 115). MCMV infected macrophages are therefore paralysed with respect to the recognition and elimination of microbial pathogens. Thus the MCMV induced paralysis of macrophages affects three main functions of phagocytes: the intercellular communication (and costimulation), the detection of pathogens and antimicrobial activities. Using these strategies MCMV is able to evade the primary immune response despite a short-time and local immune activation and uses the mobility of monocytes and macrophages to disseminate and reach immunological privileged sites in the host. As a result, an acute infection could lead to a local and transient immune suppression that might be an important strategy of viral dissemination. The results of this work describe a possible mechanism which may explain the transient immune suppression observed in acute MCMV infected mice...|$|R
