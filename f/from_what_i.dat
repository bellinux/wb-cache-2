On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E

His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation.

The sketch was written with a detailed knowledge of the soap opera's past: [...] "That stuck up Ida Barlow, who's no better than she should be... it'll not be too long before she falls under a bus!

500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno.

[...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated."

500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album.

The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, [...] "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, [...] "We did it for a laugh the first time.

[...] The Guardian said this cover showed {{a new and more}} [...] "dark" [...] side of the band, commenting [...] "slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet [...] "This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time" [...] sounded". PopWreckoning.com called it [...] "perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame". Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, [...] "It was so weird.

[...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was used to that I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop.

500|$|The Beatles reconvened at EMI Studios on 21 October {{to conduct}} three {{additional}} takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangements, {{with the second}} take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon's acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped [...] "Norwegian Wood", {{it was far from}} the album version. Harrison's sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called [...] "Norwegian Wood", and the group changed the key from D major, to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be [...] "quite spontaneous <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> remember", adding, [...] "We miked it up and put it on and it just seemed to hit the spot".|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} {{discusses}} racial classification and {{the root of}} White fear of African Americans, particularly racist concerns by some Whites over the effect of miscegenation. In the song, Chuck D argues {{that they should not}} worry as the original man was black and [...] "white comes from black / No need to be confused". The song features a vocal sample of comedian and activist Dick Gregory: [...] "Black man, black woman, black baby / white man, black woman, black baby?". [...] "Pollywanacraka" [...] also concerns interracial relations, including Blacks who leave their communities to marry wealthy Whites, and societal views of the matter: [...] "This system had no wisdom / The devil split us in pairs / and taught us white is good, black is bad / and black and white is still too bad". [...] "Meet the G That Killed Me" [...] features homophobic etiology and condemns homosexuality: [...] "Man to man / I don't know if they can / <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know / The parts don't fit". Written by hypeman Flavor Flav and Bomb Squad-producers Keith Shocklee and Eric [...] "Vietnam" [...] Sadler, [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] features Flav as the main vocalist and criticizes the inadequacy of 9-1-1, the emergency telephone number used in the United States, and the lack of police response to emergency calls in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.|$|E
500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of my interest in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E
