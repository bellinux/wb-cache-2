2500|$|Three <b>immunotoxin</b> {{drugs have}} been studied in {{patients}} at the NIHNational Cancer Institute in the U.S.: [...] BL22, HA22 and LMB-2. [...] All of these protein-based drugs combine part of an anti-B cell antibody with a bacterial toxin to kill the cells on internalization. [...] BL22 and HA22 attack a common protein called CD22, which is present on hairy cells and healthy B cells. [...] LMB-2 attacks a protein called CD25, which is not present in HCL-variant, so LMB-2 is only useful for patients with HCL-classic or the Japanese variant. [...] HA-22, now renamed moxetumab pasudotox, is being studied in patients with relapsed hairy cell leukemia at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Other sites for the study are expected to start accepting patients in late 2014, including The Royal Marsden Hospital in London, England.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, an {{increased}} amount of clinically-oriented research involving <b>immunotoxins</b> has been published. <b>Immunotoxins</b> are {{a group of}} artificially-made cytotoxic molecules targeting cancer cells. These molecules composed of a targeting moiety, such as a ligand or an antibody, linked to toxin moiety, which is a toxin with either truncated or deleted cell-binding domain that prevents it from binding to normal cells. <b>Immunotoxins</b> {{can be divided into}} two categories: chemically conjugated <b>immunotoxins</b> and recombinant ones. The <b>immunotoxins</b> of the first category have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Within the last few years, single-chain <b>immunotoxins</b> provide enhanced therapeutic efficacy over conjugated forms and result in improved antitumor activity. In this review, we briefly illustrate the design of the <b>immunotoxins</b> and their applications in clinical trials. Cellular & Molecular Immunology. 2005; 2 (2) : 106 - 112...|$|R

40|$|<b>Immunotoxins</b> are {{powerful}} tools to specifically eliminate deviated cells. Due {{to the side}} effects of the original <b>immunotoxins,</b> they were only considered for the treatment of cancer as in these cases, the potential favourable effect outweighed the unwanted toxic side effects. Over time, many improvements in the construction of <b>immunotoxins</b> have been implemented that circumvent, or at least strongly diminish, the side effects. In consequence this opens the way to employ these <b>immunotoxins</b> for the treatment of non-life threatening diseases. One such category of disease could be the many chronic inflammatory disorders in which an uncontrolled interaction between inflammatory cells leads to chronicity. In several of these chronic conditions, activated macrophages, which are characterised by an increased expression of CD 64, are known to play a key role. In this review we discus the data presently available on elimination of activated macrophages through CD 64 <b>immunotoxins</b> in several animal models for chronic disease. A chemically linked complete antibody with the plant toxin Ricin-A, proved very effective and provided proof of concept. Subsequently, the development towards genetically engineered, fully human, multivalent single chain based <b>immunotoxins</b> that have diminished immunogenicity, is discussed. The data show that the specific elimination of activated macrophages through CD 64 is indeed beneficial for the course of disease. As opposed to other methods used to inactivate or eliminate macrophages, with the CD 64 based <b>immunotoxins</b> only the activated population is killed. This may open the way to apply these <b>immunotoxins</b> as therapeutics in chronic inflammatory disease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Immunotoxins</b> are {{chimeric}} proteins {{obtained by}} linking a toxin to either an intact antibody or an antibody fragment. Conjugation {{can be obtained}} by chemical or genetic engineering, where the latter yields recombinant conjugates. An essential requirement is that the target molecule recognized by the antibody is confined to the cell population to be deleted, or at least that it is not present on stem cells or other cell types essential for the organism’s survival. Hundreds of different studies have demonstrated the potential for applying <b>immunotoxins</b> to many models in pre-clinical studies and in clinical trials. <b>Immunotoxins</b> can be theoretically used to eliminate any unwanted cell responsible for a pathological condition. The best results have been obtained in cancer therapy, especially in hematological malignancies. Among plant toxins, the most frequently employed to generate <b>immunotoxins</b> are ribosome-inactivating proteins, the most common being ricin.

50|$|Resimmune is a {{bivalent}} anti-T cell <b>immunotoxin,</b> A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1). The diphtheria toxin moiety {{has been}} modified {{to include an}} NH2 terminal alanine (A) and two double mutations (dm) {{have been made to}} prevent glycosylation in the eukaryotic expression system, Pichia pastoris (Liu et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 2001; Woo et al., 2002). The bivalent <b>immunotoxin,</b> A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) contains the first 390 amino acid residues of diphtheria toxin (DT) and two tandem sFv molecules derived from UCHT1 parental antibody (an anti-CD3 antibody). The first 390 amino acid residues of DT (DT390) contain the catalytic domain or A chain of DT that inhibits protein synthesis by ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) and the translocation domain that translocates the catalytic domain to the cytosol by interaction with cytosolic Hsp90 and thioredoxin reductase (Ratts et al., 2003). This single chain recombinant <b>immunotoxin</b> selectively kills human malignant T cells and transiently depletes normal T cells.

40|$|Many {{epithelial}} cancers rely on enhanced {{expression of}} the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to drive proliferation and survival pathways. Development of therapeutics to target EGFR signaling has been of high importance, and multiple examples have been approved for human use. However, many of the current small molecule or antibody-based therapeutics are of limited effectiveness due to the inevitable development of resistance and toxicity to normal tissues. Recombinant <b>immunotoxins</b> are therapeutic molecules consisting of an antibody or receptor ligand joined to a protein cytotoxin, combining the specific targeting of a cancer-expressed receptor with the potent cell killing of cytotoxic enzymes. Over the decades, many bacterial- or plant-based <b>immunotoxins</b> have been developed {{with the goal of}} targeting the broad range of cancers reliant upon EGFR overexpression. Many examples demonstrate excellent anti-cancer properties in preclinical development, and several EGFR-targeted <b>immunotoxins</b> have progressed to human trials.

40|$|The genes {{encoding}} the heavy- and light-chain Fv {{regions of}} the monoclonal murine antibody B 3, which recognizes a carbohydrate antigen {{on the surface of}} many human carcinomas, were cloned by PCR techniques and used to generate single-chain <b>immunotoxins</b> containing Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). The light and heavy chains were connected by a flexible linker to form a single-chain antigen-binding protein, B 3 (Fv), which was in turn fused to truncated forms of PE lacking the cell-binding domain. The single-chain Fv and two different B 3 (Fv) <b>immunotoxins,</b> B 3 (Fv) -PE 40 and B 3 (Fv) -PE 38 KDEL, were expressed in Escherichia coli and the single-chain <b>immunotoxins</b> were purified to near homogeneity. Both recombinant <b>immunotoxins</b> were shown to be cytotoxic specifically to carcinoma cell lines that express the B 3 antigen on their surface; B 3 (Fv) -PE 38 KDEL was significantly more active. Furthermore, intravenous administration of B 3 (Fv) -PE 38 KDEL caused complete regression of human epidermoid carcinomas growing subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant <b>immunotoxins</b> (RITs) are fusions of an Fv-based {{targeting}} moiety and a toxin. Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) {{has been used}} to make several <b>immunotoxins</b> that have been evaluated in clinical trials. Immunogenicity of the bacterial toxin and off-target toxicity have limited the efficacy of these <b>immunotoxins.</b> To address these issues, we have previously made RITs in which the Fv is connected to domain III (PE 24) by a furin cleavage site (FCS), thereby removing unneeded sequences of domain II. However, the PE 24 containing RITs do not contain the naturally occurring disulfide bond around the furin cleavage sequence, because it was removed when domain II was deleted. This could potentially allow PE 24 containing <b>immunotoxins</b> to be cleaved and inactivated before internalization by cell surface furin or other proteases in the blood stream or tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe five new RITs in which a disulfide bond is engineered to protect the FCS. The most active of these, SS 1 -Fab-DS 3 -PE 24, shows a longer serum half-life than an RIT without the disulfide bond and has the same anti-tumor activity, despite being less cytotoxic in vitro. These results have significance for the production of de-immunized, low toxicity, PE 24 -based <b>immunotoxins</b> with a longer serum half-life...|$|R

40|$|Ricin {{is a type}} II {{ribosome}} inactivating protein (RIP) {{isolated from}} castor beans. Its high toxicity classifies it as a possible biological weapon. On the other hand, ricin linked to specific monoclonal antibodies or used in other conjugates has powerful medical applications. Ricin consists of an A-chain (RTA) that damages ribosomes and inhibits protein synthesis, and a B-chain that {{plays a role in}} binding and cellular uptake. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that ricin-induced inhibition of protein synthesis is not the only mechanism responsible for cell death. It turns out that ricin is able to induce apoptosis in different cell lines and multiple organs in animals. However, the molecular link between protein synthesis inhibition and ricin-dependent triggering of apoptotic cell death is unclear.
