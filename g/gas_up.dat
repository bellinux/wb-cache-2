2500|$|In 1863, the British Parliament {{passed the}} first of several Alkali Acts, the first modern air {{pollution}} legislation. [...] This act allowed that no more than 5% of the hydrochloric acid produced by alkali plants could be vented to the atmosphere. [...] To comply with the legislation, soda works passed the escaping hydrogen chloride <b>gas</b> <b>up</b> through a tower packed with charcoal, where it was absorbed by water flowing in the other direction. [...] The chemical works usually dumped the resulting hydrochloric acid solution into nearby bodies of water, killing fish and other aquatic life.|$|E

Air Products uses ILs instead of pressurized cylinders as a transport medium for reactive gases such as trifluoroborane, phosphine and arsine. The gases are dissolved in the liquids at or below atmospheric pressure and are easily withdrawn from the containers by applying a vacuum.

2500|$|The {{solution}} to achieving a lethal concentration without releasing from cylinders was the [...] "gas projector", essentially a large-bore mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H. Livens in 1917) {{was a simple}} device; an [...] diameter tube sunk into the ground at an angle, a propellant was ignited by an electrical signal, firing the cylinder containing 30 or 40lb (14 or 18kg) of <b>gas</b> <b>up</b> to 1,900 meters. By arranging a battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at Arras on 4 April 1917. On 31 March 1918 the British conducted their largest ever [...] "gas shoot", firing 3,728 cylinders at Lens.|$|E
2500|$|With inside vapor deposition, the preform {{starts as}} a hollow glass tube {{approximately}} [...] long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a lathe. Gases such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) or germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) are injected with {{oxygen in the}} end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the <b>gas</b> <b>up</b> to 1,900K (1,600°C, 3,000°F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce silica or germania (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD).|$|E
2500|$|The {{combustion}} flue gases {{inside the}} chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes {{the bottom of}} the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure {{at the bottom of a}} corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue <b>gas</b> <b>up</b> and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called [...] "natural draught/draft", [...] "natural ventilation", [...] "chimney effect", or [...] "stack effect". The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney. [...] This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause creosote to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.|$|E
