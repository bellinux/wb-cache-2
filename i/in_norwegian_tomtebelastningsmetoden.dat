50|$|In Danish, Brussels is {{referred}} to as Bruxelles, as in French, or sometimes Bryssel as in Swedish, while <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> it is known as Brussel, as in Dutch (but Bruxelles was permitted until 1961). <b>In</b> <b>Norwegian,</b> however, Lisbon is known as Lisboa, as in Portuguese, whereas in Danish it is known as Lissabon, as in German.

50|$|Other {{differences}} {{include the}} use <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> of the native names of countries. In Danish, Greece {{is referred to as}} Grækenland but <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian,</b> it is mostly referred to as Hellas (the Greek form of the name), even though the Danish-like Grekenland is sometimes used. Similarly, the name for Cyprus <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> is the Greek-derived Kypros, rather than the Cypern (influenced by the German Zypern) used in Danish.|$|R

50|$|The terms Nynorsk, Modern Norwegian and Contemporary Norwegian are {{somewhat}} confusing, because <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> the same term Nynorsk {{is used for}} the first two, while Contemporary Norwegian could easily be called moderne norsk (literally Modern <b>Norwegian)</b> <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In Danish, 20 and 30 {{are called}} tyve and tredive. These forms (with tredive {{shortened}} to tredve) were replaced <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> <b>in</b> 1951 by the native tjue [...] and tretti.

5000|$|The word [...] "lagom" [...] also exists <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian,</b> <b>in</b> both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The connotations <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian,</b> however, are {{somewhat}} different from Swedish. <b>In</b> <b>Norwegian</b> {{the word has}} synonyms as [...] "fitting, suitable, comfortable, nice, decent, well built/proportioned". While some synonyms {{are somewhat}} similar in meaning (e.g. [...] "suitable" [...] and [...] "reasonable", [...] "fitting" [...] and [...] "in balance"), many present in Swedish do not exist <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> and vice versa. The Norwegian words [...] "passelig" [...] and the more common [...] "passe" [...] are very similar, translating roughly as [...] "fitting, adequate, suitable" [...] in English. [...] "Passe" [...] {{can be used in}} every context where the Swedish [...] "lagom" [...] is used, e.g. [...] "passe varm" [...] (right temperature/adequately warm), [...] "passe stor" [...] (right size), etc.|$|R
50|$|These {{names were}} used <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> as well, but have {{in modern times}} (during {{the second half of}} the 20th century) to a large extent been {{replaced}} by the Latin endings; this means that the usual ending is -a <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> and -en or -et in Danish (the -en and -et endings are also the definite articles). In the case of Switzerland, which is known in written Danish and Swedish by its German name Schweiz, this is transliterated <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> as Sveits.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} why the prenominal definiteness marker found in {{modified}} structures is acquired much later than the suffixal definite article <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian.</b> The coexistence of the two definiteness markers {{is the result of the}} double definiteness phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian,</b> which occurs <b>in</b> definite structures involving an attributive adjective.
