5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

The songs were retroactively made Mucky Pup songs when included on the 2012 re-release of Five Guys <b>In</b> <b>A</b> <b>Really</b> Hot Garage and referred to as the Straight Outta' Jersey EP.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the radical}} {{concept of the}} medieval pintle-and-gudgeon rudder did not come as a single {{invention}} into being. It presented rather a combination of ideas which each had been long around before: rudders mounted on the stern, iron hinges and the straight sternpost of northern European ships. While earlier rudders were mounted on the stern by the way of rudderposts or tackles, the iron hinges allowed {{for the first time}} to attach the rudder to the entire length of the sternpost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> permanent fashion. However, its full potential could only to be realized after the introduction of the vertical sternpost and the full-rigged ship in the 14th century. From the age of discovery onwards, European ships with pintle-and-gudgeon rudders sailed successfully on all seven seas.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was {{directed}} in February 1997 by Gregg Masuak, and filmed in a theatre {{located in the}} north of London. It features the Spice Girls singing and dancing solo in front of various colourful backgrounds whilst filmed with a steadycam. Other scenes show the group performing on a stage in front of an energetic crowd. In addition, there are many background performers doing unusual tricks. Chisholm wrote about the shoot: [...] "We shot the video for 'Who Do You Think You Are' <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> mad club—a real dive. The toilets were horrible and we had to have our make-up done in a Winnebago. The vibe was excellent, though—I think it was my favourite video because it was such good fun.

I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E

Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> bad place at the moment".|$|E
