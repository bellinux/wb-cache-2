40|$|Stunning {{quality in}} the {{slaughter}} house varies. A growing concern for the animals well-being {{and the safety of}} slaughter house personal call for improved slaughtering techniques. The main aim of this thesis is to establish whether or not the external parameters of a bolt stun can be altered to improve the stunning quality of animals before a <b>debleeding.</b> To meet this aim three sub studies, using finite element models and the solver LS-DYNA, were carried out. First, experiments in which a bolt entered gel bodies were reproduced to suggest modeling strategy and contact settings. An ALE method for the modeling was determined to be the most appropriate. Second, a finite element model of a rat brain was adopted and evaluated. Past experiments, carried out on rats, in which pressures were recorded in the brain during simulated stunning, served as evaluation data. Some problem areas in fitting the FE model to this purpose were identified, mainly areas where pressure transfer was hindered. Finally, a parameter study was carried out to study the effect of external bolt parameters in intra cranial pressure distribution. The simulation results from the parameter study indicate that a change of speed, position and angle could greatly affect how the pressure propagates through the brain tissue, and thereby increase the quality of the animal stunning...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} recent studies on {{adhesion}} performance of copper alloy substrate with bare surface, black oxide coating and black oxide with <b>debleeding</b> treatment. The interfacial adhesion of substrate with polyimide tape and glob top resin were measured after autoclave test (or pressure cooker test, PCT), temperature ageing and thermal cycles {{based on the}} button shear and tape peel tests. The failure mechanisms were studied from the fracture surface analysis. Moisture absorption and desorption studies at different aging time were carried out to understand the property changes due to moisture. The {{results show that the}} black oxide coating improved significantly the interfacial bond strength in the dry condition. The mechanical interlocking mechanism provided by the fibrillar copper oxide was mainly responsible for it. The interfacial bond strengths for all substrates remained almost unchanged after thermal ageing at 150 degreesC for 8 h. Thermal cycles between - 50 degreesC and 150 degreesC for 500 and 1000 thermal cycles exhibited generally a negligible influence or decreased slightly the interfacial adhesion. The hygrothermal ageing at 121 degreesC/ 100 % RH in an autoclave (i. e. PCT) resulted in large reductions in interfacial bond strength after the initial 48 h ageing and tended to level off with further ageing. Fracture analysis of tape peeled bare copper substrates after 500 cycles of thermal loading revealed a transition of failure mechanism from adhesive to cohesive failure. In contrast, the failure mechanism remained unchanged for oxide-coated substrates. The implications arising from the button shear and tape peel tests are different because of the different fracture modes involved. According to the available data discussed above, the PCT is regarded as the most severe test affecting the adhesion performance. Presence of oxide coating minimized the moisture absorption rate when compared to the bare copper surface...|$|E
40|$|Black oxide is a {{conversion}} coating applied onto copper surface {{to improve the}} interface adhesion with polymeric adhesives and moulding compounds. State-of-the-art analytical instruments, including SEM, TEM, XPS, AFM, XRD, Goniometry, TEM, Dynamic SIMS and RBS were employed to characterize the coated surface and interphase with glob top resins. It {{was found that the}} copper oxide layer consists of cupric and cuprous oxides with a continuous change of oxide composition from the top surface to the inside without a distinct boundary in between. Crystallinity of the oxides was barely detected directly from the black oxide coated copper. The cupric oxide exist {{in the form of a}} long, fibril structure on nanoscopic scale. The interface bond strength between the copper oxide and glob-top resin increased rapidly in the low range of oxide thickness and became almost constant with further increase in oxide thickness. A functionally similar dependence of oxide thickness and interface adhesion on treatment time was also revealed. Fracture occurred mainly within the oxide layer for black oxide coated substrate (i. e. cohesive failure of black oxide), while fracture tended to occur along the coating-resin interface (i. e. adhesive failure) once the coated surface is <b>debleeded</b> by sandblasting...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of the position of calves on the truck (back or front compartment) and other aspects of short distance transport on the welfare of cattle and meat quality parameters. A total of 158 Dutch Fresian calves, aged 28 weeks, were followed during 17 transports from 12 different farms to the slaughterhouse. Heart rate was monitored throughout the transport time and the night before. Blood samples were taken the day before transport in the home pen and at <b>debleeding</b> in the slaughterhouse. The samples were analysed for cortisol, lactate, glucose, creatine kinase and non-esterified fatty acids. Carcass pH and temperature and meat colour were measured in the musculus longissimus thoracis. The heart rate of the animals increased 80 % during loading and 72 % during unloading and remained high during transport (38 %) (P< 0. 001). The heart rate increased 3 % more for the animals travelling in the back compartment and remained higher during transport (P< 0. 05). The plasma concentration of cortisol, lactate and creatine kinase increased (P< 0. 001) after transport. The plasma cortisol increased more for the animals travelling in the front compartment (P< 0. 05). The pH, was lower for the animals travelling in the front compartment (P< 0. 001) and the pH difference (pH(u) minus pH(1)) was larger for animals travelling in the back compartment (P< 0. 001). The meat colour of the calves travelling in the front compartment was lighter (P< 0. 01). A longer fasting period resulted in a darker meat colour (P< 0. 01). A longer lairage time resulted in a higher increase of creatine kinase (P< 0. 05). (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Delaminations {{at various}} {{interfaces}} {{are one of}} the most critical reliability issues in plastic packages. Delamination is formed as a result of the imperfect interface adhesion between the integrated circuit (IC) package components. Adhesion has been identified as one of the key factors to improve delamination related problems. A thorough understanding of substrate, surface coatings, polymeric materials, interface adhesion properties and hygrothermal effects on reliability performance of the packages are necessary in order to minimize the problem of delamination and the associated package cracking issue. Previous research works have focused on dimples to improve the interfacial bond strength without full consideration of the surface coatings and hygrothermal effects on interfacial adhesion. In the present investigation of interfacial adhesion improvement between lead frame and epoxy molding compound (EMC), special emphasis has been placed on: i) the effects of dimple and metallic coating and; ii) the effects of temperature and hygrothermal ageing excursions simulating the practical package assembly processes. Moreover, the extension of copper oxide coating technology from printed circuit board (PCB) to IC packages, especially for copper lead frame and the heat sink/substrate for tape ball grid array (TBGA) packages, have necessitated a more detailed study of characterization and optimization of black oxide coating material, effect of debled treatment and hygrothermal effect on interfacial adhesion. A study is made of the effects of dimple and metallic coatings by evaluating the surface characteristics, such as wettability, surface roughness and elemental compositions, which in turn are correlated with the maximum pull force measured from the lead pull tests. It is found that the dimples enhanced the maximum pull force through improved mechanical interlocking of molding compound, depending on the type of coating. The wettability of metal surface represented by the surface energy played a predominant role in controlling the interfacial adhesion. Hygrothermal ageing at 85 â„ƒ/ 85 % RH followed by solder reflow process reduced the maximum pull force significantly especially for the hydrophilic and polar metal surfaces. The reduction in maximum pull force for hydrophilic surfaces is higher than hydrophobic surfaces. There was approximately a linear correlation between the reduction in interfacial bond strength and the differential work of adhesion between the dry and wet environments. The mechanical interlocking provided by dimples retained the interfacial adhesion in humid environment and stopped the propagation of delamination. In addition to the aforementioned metal plating and dimples, black copper oxide is another very useful chemical conversion coating for improved adhesion of copper with various polymers, and has been widely employed since the early days of printed circuit technology. The surface was characterized and it's thickness was optimized based on several state-of-the-art analytical instruments and interfacial adhesion study. The maximum shear force between the black oxide coated substrate and glob-top resin increased rapidly at a low range of oxide thickness, and became saturated at thicknesses greater than about 800 nm. There were functionally similar dependence of interfacial bond strength on oxide thickness, surface energy and surface roughness. A treatment for 150 sec is sufficient to produce a coating thickness with maximum adhesion with glob top resins. Mechanical hardening involved in the <b>debleeding</b> process consolidated the fibrillar cupric oxide into a flat surface, which reduced in turn both CuO/Cu 2 O ratio and the interfacial bond strength. Analysis of fracture surfaces indicated that cohesive failure occurred within the oxide layer for the black oxide coated substrate (cohesive failure), while fracture tended to occur along the coating-resin interface (adhesive failure) once the coated surface was processed with <b>debleeding</b> treatment. The presence of black oxide coating discouraged the moisture absorption, and encouraged the desorption of moisture within the coating. Autoclave test (or pressure cooker test, PCT), is regarded as the most severe test affecting the adhesion performance. The major contributions of this thesis are: i) to incorporate dimple and metallic coatings under hygrothermal conditions and to study its interfacial adhesion strength; ii) to report that the improvement in the interfacial adhesion due to dimples was higher for the coatings with inherently weak interfacial adhesion than those with inherently strong adhesion characteristic; iii) to study the correlation between interfacial adhesion and differential work of adhesion at dry and wet condition of metallic coatings; iv) to report the correlation between the work of adhesion difference and polar surface energy of metallic coatings; v) to report that dimples retains the interfacial adhesion under humid environment; and; vi) to compare the surface characteristics and interfacial adhesion of as-received black oxide and debled black oxide under different oxidation treatment time and hygrothermal conditions...|$|E
