5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the fourteen-day time limit {{is to ensure that}} {{creditors}} have sufficient opportunity to peruse the statement of affairs and {{to decide whether or not}} to oppose the application. The legislature’s objective in imposing the thirty-day limit was to ensure that debtors would not be able to give long notice, months beforehand, and in that way to keep creditors from levying execution and in the meantime dissipate all their assets. Failure to adhere strictly to the third-day time period has mostly been taken to be fatal to the application. In Ex parte Harmse, the court held that the failure is a formal defect or irregularity, as envisaged by section 157(1), and therefore does not invalidate the application unless <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> a substantial injustice which cannot be remedied by a court order.|$|E
