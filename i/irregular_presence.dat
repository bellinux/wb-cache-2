40|$|In {{the heated}} debate around {{irregular}} migration, the so-called regularization measures represent {{one of the}} main bones of contention – presented by some as the only possible solution to <b>irregular</b> <b>presences</b> and contested by others as rewards for illicit behaviour. Despite their many differences, such measures have a common core – discretion. They are, in fact, gracious concessions of the State to those who, by entering and staying within its borders in breach of its laws, have challenged its sovereignty. The present paper will use an operational definition of discretion to analyse two European regularization mechanisms that, because of their manifest similarities as well as their different empirical outcomes, lend themselves particularly well to comparison: the Swiss “cas de rigueur” procedure and the Spanish “arraigo”. The juxtaposition between the two schemes will be used to investigate how the powers of the State decline, through discretion, different answers to the challenge posed to national immigration models by irregular entries and stays...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the ultrasonographic {{features}} of benign nodules, follicular lesions and malignant nodules in the thyroids of patients who underwent fineneedle aspiration biopsy. We retrospectively analyzed the ultrasonographic features of 231 nodules, which were diagnosed as benign, follicular lesion or malignant nodules with respect to solitariness, echogenicity, echostructure, border characteristics, presence or absence of calcifications, internal vascularity and the presence of a halo. The ultrasono-graphic features of benign nodules, follicular lesions and malignant nodules were compared using the Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test.

Ultrasound features including hypoechogenicity, solid echostructure, <b>irregular</b> margin, <b>presence</b> of microcalcification and absence of a halo might be effective in the differentiation of malignant nodules and follicular lesions from benign nodules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Emilia Romagna, a {{northern}} Italian region, {{has a population}} of 4. 27 million, of which 9. 7 % are immigrants. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) during the period 1996 - 2006 in not Italy-born compared to Italy-born cases. Methods Data was obtained from the Regional TB surveillance system, from where personal data, clinical features and risk factors of all notified TB cases were extracted. Results 5377 TB cases were reported. The proportion of immigrants with TB, over the total number of TB cases had progressively increased over the years, from 19. 1 % to 53. 3 %. In the not Italy-born population, TB incidence was higher than in Italians (in 2006 : 100. 7 cases per 100 000 registered not Italy-born subjects and 83. 9 / 100 000 adding 20 % of estimated <b>irregular</b> <b>presences</b> to the denominators. TB incidence among Italians was 6. 5 / 100 000 Italians). A progressive rise in the not Italy-born incident cases was observed but associated with a decline in TB incidence. Not Italy-born cases were younger compared to the Italy-born cases, and more frequently classified as "new cases" (OR 2. 0 95 %CI 1. 61 - 2. 49 for age group 20 - 39); 60. 7 % had pulmonary TB, 31. 6 % extra pulmonary and 7. 6 % disseminated TB. Risk factors for TB in this population group were connected to lower income status (homeless: OR 149. 9 95 %CI 20. 7 - 1083. 3 for age group 40 - 59). Conclusions In low-incidence regions, prevention and control of TB among sub-groups at risk such as the foreign-born population is a matter of public health concern. In addition, increasing immigration rates may affect TB epidemiology. TB among immigrants is characterized by particular clinical features and risk factors, which should be analyzed in order to plan effective action. </p...|$|R
50|$|The peripatetic {{lifestyle}} of the 18th and 19th century middle classes also drove {{the development of}} more residential clubs, which had bedrooms and other facilities. Military and naval officers, lawyers, judges, members of Parliament and government officials tended to have an <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> in the major cities of the Empire, particularly London, spending perhaps a few months there before moving on for a prolonged period and then returning. Especially when this presence did not coincide with the Season, a permanent establishment in the city (i.e., a house owned or rented, with the requisite staff), or the opening of a townhouse (generally shuttered outside the season) was inconvenient or uneconomic, while hotels were rare and socially déclassé. Clubbing with a number of like-minded friends to secure a large shared house with a manager was therefore a convenient solution.|$|E

40|$|Copper is an {{important}} micronutrient required as a redox co-factor in the catalytic centers of enzymes. However, free copper is a potential hazard because of its high chemical reactivity. Consequently, organisms exert a tight control on Cu+ transport (entry-exit) and traffic through different compartments, ensuring the homeostasis required for cuproprotein synthesis and prevention of toxic effects. Recent studies based on biochemical, bioinformatics, and metalloproteomics approaches, reveal a highly regulated system of transcriptional regulators, soluble chaperones, membrane transporters and target cuproproteins distributed in the various bacterial compartments. As a result, new questions have emerged regarding the diversity and apparent redundancies of these components, their <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> in different organisms, functional interactions, and resulting system architectures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{literature}} suggests that abnormal sonographic findings of the common extensor origin (hypoechogenicity, neovascularity, calcifications, <b>irregular</b> margin, <b>presence</b> of adjacent fluid, irregular fibrillar pattern, thickness, tear) and of the lateral epicondyle (cortical irregularities) {{can be used to}} confirm the presence of Lateral Epicondylalgia (LE) in elbows which have been initially diagnosed using the clinical diagnosis for LE. The association of these abnormal sonographic findings and the initial clinical diagnosis for LE were studied. Methodology: The participants were recruited in Metro Manila (Philippines) through advertisements and referral by doctors and physiotherapists. LE was determined if participants reported lateral elbow pain on one elbow which was replicated by any of the Cozen’s, Mill’s, or Maudsley’s tests. Acuity of elbow symptoms was determined using six weeks since symptom onset as the time differentiating acute from chronic LE. A prospective blinded sonographic assessment of both elbows of participants was performed using a valid and reliable scanning protocol. Results: Fifty-one participants provided 55 symptomatic and 46 asymptomatic elbows (one elbow ineligible due to congenital shortening). Duration of elbow pain ranged from a day (acute) to 36 months (chronic). The hypoechogenicity of the common extensor origin was moderately associated with acute LE (sensitivity= 67...|$|R

However, it sometimes mimics a benign nodule or follicular tumor on ultrasound. In this study, we investigated the biological behaviors of 542 PTC that were not diagnosed as PTC on ultrasound. All but 6 underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy and 494 were cytologically diagnosed as or suspected of PTC. Of the 542 PTC, 198 were follicular variant (FVPC, n = 79), macrofollicular variant (n = 22), encapsulated PTC (n = 85), and cribriform morular variant (CMV, n = 12); these were classified into Group A. The remaining 344 were PTC with papillary growth pattern without encapsulation at histological examination, and were classified into Group B. Group A was less likely to show pathological node metastasis and extrathyroid extension than Group B, but prognosis did not differ between the groups (5 -year disease-free survival rate, 99 %). Since pathological node metastasis was rather frequent (21 % in Group A and 36 % in Group B), thyroidectomy with at least central node dissection was necessary for these patients; prognosis, however, was excellent in both groups...|$|R

METHODS: Two radiologists independently evaluated CT and MR imaging of 31 patients who had undergone lymphadenectomy (9 metastatic and 22 non-metastatic paraaortic nodes). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using a five point scale to compare CT with MRI. To re-define the morphologic features of metastatic nodes, we evaluated CT scans from 70 patients with 23 metastatic paraaortic nodes and 47 non-metastatic ones.

While Norway's agreements with Iraq and Ethiopia have been explicitly highlighted as effective by Norwegian authorities, this article argues that readmission agreements may be expected to limit, but not to eliminate, return problems.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that not all {{pigmented}} skin lesions (PSL) can be diagnosed solely by their clinical appearance, additional criteria are required to optimize the clinical diagnosis of atypical nevus and melanoma. Epiluminescence microscopy is a non-invasive in vivo examination that often helps to improved the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of such lesions. Years of experience have indicated some differential epiluminescent patterns for benign and malignant PSI, but there is some controversy about certain borderline lesions for which histological examination is always necessary. In our study we performed a statistical analysis of data concerning 183 PSI, to determine characteristics significantly associated with these lesions allowing identification of epiluminescent criteria suggestive of atypical nevus and malignant melanoma. Using he chi-quadro test and stepwise regression logistic model, we identified the following epiluminescent pattern as a risk factor for atypical nevus and malignant melanoma: <b>irregular</b> pigment network, <b>presence</b> of capillaries, <b>irregular</b> and abrupt ending of overall pigmentation, irregular brown globules and irregular shape and size of black dots...|$|R

40|$|Ephemeral wetland {{vegetation}} (EWV) in the Mediterranean Basin {{appears in}} temporary wetlands where favourable hydrological conditions exist {{only for a}} short time and year-to-year variability is high. Here, we report results of the seed germination, dormancy and desiccation tolerance of eight annual species living in this vulnerable habitat. Experiments were performed in laboratory conditions under constant and alternating temperatures and using a 12 -h daily photoperiod or continuous darkness. Whilst germination and dormancy differed between the species, seeds demonstrated an absolute light requirement and prefer cool temperatures to germinate (mean a parts per thousand currency sign 15 A degrees C). Logistic regression analysis showed significant effects of alternating temperature in all the species except in Tillaea vaillantii whose germination was stimulated by constant temperature. Mean temperature was a significant term in the logistic models for the dormant species Cicendia filiformis, Linum radiola and T. vaillantii for which after-ripening was an effective dormancy-breaking treatment. From these results we infer three strategies of regeneration by seeds: (1) species germinating during the whole vegetative season (2) species germinating in a narrow temperature niche and (3) species requiring flooding (T. vaillantii). Seeds possessed orthodox storage behaviour (tolerating drying to 15 % relative humidity) and may be amenable to seed banking as a means of ex-situ conservation. We conclude that EWV species are adapted to the <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> of water with characteristics that are typical of neither truly aquatic nor wetland plants.

This study aimed to investigate the ontogenesis, histochemistry and ultrastructure of glandular trichomes focusing on stalk cells and their possible transfer function.

40|$|Ceresiosaurus is a {{secondarily}} marine reptile {{that lived}} during the Middle Triassic (Ladinian–Anisian) in a subtropical lagoonal environment with varying open marine influences. The genus comprises two species, Ceresiosaurus calcagnii and C. lanzi, and {{represents one of}} the largest vertebrate of up to 3 -m snout-tail length from the UNESCO World Heritage site Monte San Giorgio, which is settled along the Swiss–Italian border. Earlier morphological studies identified this genus as basal sauropterygian still possessing many similarities with the plesiomorphic ancestral terrestrial condition. Interspecific morphological variation was interpreted as indicator for different habit(at) preferences by ascribing two locomotion types for each of the species. In this study, detailed data on the microstructure of the long bones are given and findings were put into a palaeoecological and phylogenetic context in comparison to other sauropterygians from Monte San Giorgio. Results showed that both Ceresiosaurus species retain a calcified cartilaginous core in the medullary region in at least young individuals. They both exhibit cyclical bone growth of lamellar to parallel-fibred bone matrices with undulating incremental growth marks and low to moderate vascularisation (lamellar-zonal bone tissue type). Interspecific variation comprises differences in the distribution of differently organised bone matrices and the size, orientation and number of vascularisation. The vascularisation pattern (abundance and orientation of the canals) of the pachyosteosclerotic long bones of C. calcagnii mostly resembles the histotype of the stratigraphically youngest pachypleurosaurid from Monte San Giorgio, Neusticosaurus edwardsii (except for the presence of primary osteons in the cortex of the former). The bone sample of C. lanzi is only osteosclerotic and most similar to young Nothosaurus (except for the <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> of fibrolamellar bone in the latter). The slightly different growth pattern already at young ontogenetic stages might be linked to a different mode of life within the restricted lagoonal basin for Ceresiosaurus, which supports previous studies on the morphological data that ascribed two different locomotion types...|$|E
40|$|The area of Ukrainian Carpathians {{is still}} poorly {{investigated}} {{in the context}} of vegetation history and human activity during the Holocene. The present study was carried out on deposits collected from the former oxbow lake. The study aimed to examine (1) whether various tendencies for occupation of valley terraces by different Neolithic and Early Bronze cultures led to a discrepant records of human impact in palaeo-proxies and (2) whether forest vegetation in the Dniester River valley (Carpathian foreland, Western Ukraine) reacted to global climatic events during the period 7500 to 3500 calibrated years BP (cal BP). We reconstructed vegetation changes with special attention being paid to human and climate impact, applying palaeobotanical and faecal bacteria ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses combined with radiocarbon dating. The results revealed that aDNA and palaeobotanical proxies recorded human impacts of differing intensities in the deposits analyzed. The Linear Pottery culture (Early Neolithic) occupied lower terraces close to the lake and so high concentrations of aDNA were detected, although with the <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> of the pollen of cultivated plants. Subsequently, the Malicka culture (Lengyel-Polgar cycle) still inhabited lower terraces of the valley, although its representatives probably exploited higher terraces (fluctuations of aDNA, still with an irregular record of cultivated plants). Humans of the Funnel Beaker culture preferred the highest terrace levels and watersheds (more scattered aDNA distribution) and they extensively used fire for deforestation (an increase in the accumulation of microcharcoal); however, their activity only had a slight effect on the woodlands on the lowest terraces of the valley. During occupation by Late Neolithic and Early Bronze cultures, the pasturelands on the lowest terraces were probably (at least partly) transformed into mown meadows (spread of Plantago lanceolata). The advance of Picea abies in the Dniester valley approximately 6110 - 5240 cal BP and an increase in the water table dated at approximately 3975 - 3900 cal BP in the mire occurred during the global cold period at 6500 - 5900 cal BP and ‘ 4. 2 ka’ cooling event...|$|E
40|$|The bulk rock {{geochemistry}} and inoceramid isotopic composition from Cenomanian to Santonian, finely laminated, organic-rich black shales, recovered during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 207 on Demerara Rise (western tropical North Atlantic), suggest persistent anoxic (free H 2 S) conditions within the sediments and short-term variations within {{a narrow range}} of anoxic to episodically dysoxic bottom waters over a ~ 15 Ma time interval. In addition to being organic-rich, the 50 - 90 m thick sections examined exhibit substantial bulk rock enrichments of Si, P, Ba, Cu, Mo, Ni, and Zn relative to World Average Shale. These observations point to high organic burial fluxes, likely driven by high primary production rates, {{which led to the}} establishment of intensely sulfidic pore waters and possibly bottom waters, {{as well as to the}} enrichments of Cr, Mo, U, and V in the sediments. At the same time, the <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> of benthic inoceramids and foraminifera in this facies demonstrates that the benthic environment could not have been continuously anoxic. The d 13 C and d 15 N values of the inoceramid shell organics provide no evidence of chemosymbiosis and are consistent with pelagic rain as being a significant food source. Demerara Rise inoceramids also exhibit well-defined, regularly spaced growth lines that are tracked by d 13 C and d 18 O variations in shell carbonate that cannot be simply explained by diagenesis. Instead, productivity variations in surface waters may have paced the growth of the shells during brief oxygenation events suitable for benthic inoceramid settlement. These inferences imply tight benthopelagic coupling and more dynamic benthic conditions than generally portrayed during black shale deposition. By invoking different temporal scales for geochemical and paleontological data, this study resolves recent contradictory conclusions (e. g., sulfidic sedimentary conditions versus dysoxic to suboxic benthic waters) drawn from studies of either sediment geochemistry or fossil distributions alone on Demerara Rise. This variability may be relevant for discussions of black shales in general...|$|E

Thus, a new set of experiments have been carried out at the DIGA wave basin; physical model tests have been combined with numerical simulations performed with the software MIKE 21.

40|$|This {{case report}} reports the visual {{rehabilitation}} obtained with the fitting {{of a new}} design of full scleral contact lens (ICD 16. 5 contact lens, Paragon Vision Sciences, distributed by Lenticon, Madrid, Spain) in a cornea with advanced keratoconus and previous implantation of intracorneal ring segment with a very limited effect. This eye had a refraction of – 3. 00 × 55 ° cylinder, providing a visual acuity of 0. 5 LogMAR. The topographic pattern was very <b>irregular</b> with the <b>presence</b> of a significant central protrusion and a significant central corneal thinning. Some previous unsuccessful fittings have been performed with corneal and corneal-scleral lenses. A comfortable wearing was achieved with a fully scleral contact lens of 4600 μm of sagittal height, optical power of – 11. 25 D, and providing an apical clearance of 196 μm. A visual acuity of 0. 0 LogMAR combined with a relevant aberrometric improvement was achieved with this contact lens. The patient was completely satisfied with the fitting. The result was maintained during 1 year after the fitting. Full scleral lenses are then able to provide comfortable wear and {{a significant increase in}} visual acuity combined with a significant improvement in the visual quality in eyes with advanced keratoconus...|$|R
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} {{irregular}} migration {{as a complex}} socio-economic process where states, actors and intermediaries interact with migration policies. Migration {{is not just about}} actually the policies of migration or the individual migrants but rather it is about both those who move and those how are sedentary as well as a whole series of actors and institutions that form the ‘industry’ of migration. This book concentrates on migrants themselves as main actors who based on specific structural conditions (their own economic, social and political resources) and in interaction with important intermediaries including employers, smugglers, NGOs, international organisations as well as national authorities and policies, make up their minds and engage into action. The research presented here examines how migrants learn about (changing) migration policies, how they take their decisions in each different stage of the migration route, how they execute their plans and in the end how they adopt specific strategies with a view {{to find a way to}} reach a desired destination. In other words, the book looks into how the migrants themselves make sense of their needs, wishes, and their migration experience, whether legal or irregular. The empirical research presented in this volume takes Greece as its case study, investigating five migrant populations who have a large <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> in the country notably Albanians, Georgians, Ukrainians, Afghans and Pakistanis. The reason for selecting people from these five countries is that they represent different migration systems and different migration pathways to Greece. The first chapter of the book engages into a critical literature review on the governance of irregular migration at times of globalisation, introducing then the case of Greece as a case of particular interest in terms of its migration and asylum experience. The five chapters that follow focus each on one group of migrants following closely their journey from the decision making to leave, to actually putting the plan into action, transiting other countries and then arriving in Greece and finding accommodation and employment. We investigate how they interact with policies and other actors/intermediaries and how they eventually organise their action. The seventh chapters offers a comparative analysis of the five cases...|$|E
40|$|Prompt care seeking and {{appropriate}} use of anti-malarial drugs are critical components of malaria prevention and control. This study assessed malaria related perceptions, care seeking behavior and anti-malarial drug use in malaria endemic settings of Ethiopia. Data were generated from a community based cross-sectional study conducted among 798 households during January 2014 {{as part of a}} larger household behavioral study in three malaria endemic districts of Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed using SPSS 17. 0 and STATA 12. 0. In this study, only 76. 1 % of the respondents associated malaria to mosquito bite, and incorrect beliefs and perceptions were noted. Despite moderate level of knowledge (estimated mean = 62. 2, Std Err = 0. 7, 95 % CI: 60. 6 - 63. 8 %), quite high favorable attitude (overall estimated mean = 91. 5, Std Err = 0. 6, 95 % CI: 90. 1 - 92. 9 %) were recorded towards malaria preventive measures. The mean attitude score for prompt care seeking, {{appropriate use of}} anti-malarial drugs, LLIN use and Indoor Residual Spray acceptance was 98. 5 (Std Err = 0. 4, 95 % CI: 97. 5 - 99. 4), 92. 7 (Std Err = 0. 6 95 % CI: 91. 5 - 93. 9), 88. 8 (Std Err = 0. 5, 95 % CI: 85. 5 - 92. 1) and 86. 5 (Std Err = 1. 2, 95 % CI: 83. 9 - 89. 1), respectively. The prevalence of fever was 2. 9 % (116 / 4107) and of the study participants with fever, 71. 9 % (95 % CI: 65. 5 - 78. 3 %) sought care and all of them consulted formal health care system. However, only 17 (19. 8 %) sought care within 24 hours after onset of fever. The frequency of care seeking was higher (77. 8 %, n = 21 / 27) and more prompt (28. 6 %, 6 / 21) for children under five as compared to old age groups despite it was not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). However, higher median time of seeking first care was observed among Muslims and people who did not attend school (p < 0. 05). Of those who used anti-malarial drugs, 9. 1 % indicated that they used it inappropriately through saving and/or sharing. Irregular availability of anti-malarial drugs; <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> of frontline health workers and misconceptions were mentioned to contribute to delayed care seeking and irrational use of anti-malarial drugs. Although care seeking behavior for febrile illness was quite high in this community, the habit of prompt care seeking was very limited. Thus, malaria prevention and control programs need to take into account local misconceptions and wrong perceptions, and health system factors to achieve optimal health seeking behavior in such malaria endemic settings...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} for the present work is to identify and investigate the influence of digenetic trematodes on the estuarine isopod Cyathura carinata, plus to describe temporal patterns of prevalence and intensity of these parasites in the populations of their intermediate macroinvertebrate hosts. It is also intended to assess the population dynamics of C. carinata {{through a period of}} almost 10 years, in a eutrophic estuary, the Mondego Estuary, located in the mid-Atlantic coast of Portugal, where an environmental rehabilitation programme was implemented. This work will be presented in several chapters, corresponding to different manuscripts being prepared, submitted or already published in scientific journals. Initially, there is a brief introduction to the need of developing management strategies, with the purpose of achieving a sustainable utilisation of coastal resources. In this section, {{some of the most important}} types of environmental pressures in coastal zones are mentioned, namely eutrophication processes. In this scenario, some of the problems that affect the Mondego Estuary are addressed. C. carinata is presented as one of the intertidal macrobenthic key-species and there is a first approach to the possible role of digenetic trematodes. The first chapter is dedicated to the identification of digenetic trematodes infecting C. carinata (second intermediate host of these parasites) and to the description of trematode patterns from two key sites in the estuary: a Zostera noltii bed and an inner eutrophic sand flat. Two trematode species were dominant: Maritrema subdolum and a hitherto unknown Levinseniella species, the latter being the most frequent one. Generally, the prevalence of both species peaked during winter months, when migratory water birds occurred in the estuary. Isopods from the Z. noltii bed harboured more infections per specimen than those from the sand flat. A much higher density of Hydrobia ulvae mud snails ≥ 2 mm (first intermediate host) and a low abundance of C. carinata were indicated as the most probably motives for this pattern. The second chapter refers a short-term microcosm experiment, conducted with the microphallid trematode M. subdolum and both of its intermediate hosts: H. ulvae and C. carinata. Results indicated that small-scale factors, such as differences in substratum and associated features, may have considerable impact on infections of host populations. C. carinata from a fine sand substratum, with a higher proportion of particles 5. 9 mm were non-infected. The parasitised H. ulvae had generally thin shells, very easy to crush, with large and round whorls, fouled by epibionts. The fifth chapter regards the infection characteristics and transmission strategies of the two most common trematodes found in C. carinata: M. subdolum and Levinseniella sp [...] Two short-term experiments were performed to compare their transmission success from H. ulvae to C. carinata. Both microphallids penetrated the isopod through the pleopods and encystment took place in the middle-region of the host’s body. The two parasites showed different strategies with respect to cercarial production and dispersal ability (cercarial behaviour). M. subdolum produced a high quantity of swimming cercariae, whereas Levinseniella sp. created few crawling free larval stages. These results can be interpreted as adaptations to different crustacean hosts. The strategy exhibited by Levinseniella sp. is more efficient to infect C. carinata, a relatively quiet bottom-dwelling isopod. The sixth chapter focus on the population dynamics of C. carinata at the Mondego Estuary, from 1993 to 2002, to assess the development of a restoration programme for the seagrass beds of Z. noltii endangered by eutrophication. The mitigation measures implemented since 1998 have contributed to a more stable C. carinata population density at an inner unvegetated sand flat area, where these isopods were abundant. This species was resilient to the occurrence of macroalgal blooms and floods, although both events have caused dispersion of isopod individuals to other areas of the estuary. Despite the increasing environmental quality in the estuary, C. carinata could not establish itself successfully in rooted-macrophyte beds, in contrast to other common estuarine species (e. g. H. ulvae or Scrobicularia plana) that prospered at all sites (bare sand or vegetated mud flats). Finally, there is a general discussion of the role of microphallid trematodes in explaining the <b>irregular</b> <b>presence</b> of C. carinata at the Z. noltii bed, where the mud snail H. ulvae is a dominant species and all the elements needed to complete these parasites’ life cycles are present. The infection characteristics and parasite effects in their macroinvertebrate hosts are also summarised. The possible full restoration of the intertidal areas to the original Z. noltii coverage is discussed, as well as the possible consequences for the C. carinata population. Relatively to the results obtained in this work, it is suggested that unexpected animal responses to habitat modification, such as parasite-hosts interactions, should also be thoroughly considered in environmental management.

40|$|The Equivalent-Frame Method (EFM), a {{simplified}} procedure for structural modelling of masonry constructions, {{is having a}} great success for the good balance that it allows between {{the accuracy of the}} geometrical description and the simplicity of the mechanical calibration. Despite the widespread use of EFM in scientific and professional field, some uncertainties affect its application to the specific problem of the existing unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings. For these structures, in fact, <b>irregular</b> geometries, the <b>presence</b> of deformable diaphragms and the interaction with other structures in aggregate configurations represent hard-to-model features that limit the accuracy of EFM. The paper presents a comparative study in the linear field between EFM and the more accurate Finite Element Method (FEM), assumed as reference. The comparative analysis involves a wide set of geometrical schemes, characterized by both regular and irregular configurations, and it is aimed at providing a measure of the EFM modelling accuracy {{as a function of the}} geometry of the wall. Non-dimensional parameters allow exploring the limits of applicability of EFM for both regular and irregular walls. Based on the parametric analyses, some recommendations are given for improving the effectiveness of the method and preserving the simplicity of application that makes EFM models so popular and widely used.

40|$|In {{oil and gas}} and {{geothermal}} installations, open channels {{followed by}} sieves for removal of drill cuttings, are used to monitor {{the quality and quantity}} of the drilling fluids. Drilling fluid flow rate is difficult to measure due to the varying flow conditions (e. g., wavy, turbulent and <b>irregular)</b> and the <b>presence</b> of drilling cuttings and gas bubbles. Inclusion of a Venturi section in the open channel and an array of ultrasonic level sensors above it at locations in the vicinity of and above the Venturi constriction gives the varying levels of the drilling fluid in the channel. The time series of the levels from this array of ultrasonic level sensors are used to estimate the drilling fluid flow rate, which is compared with Coriolis meter measurements. Fuzzy logic, neural networks and support vector regression algorithms applied to the data from temporal and spatial ultrasonic level measurements of the drilling fluid in the open channel give estimates of its flow rate with sufficient reliability, repeatability and uncertainty, providing a novel soft sensing of an important process variable. Simulations, cross-validations and experimental results show that feedforward neural networks with the Bayesian regularization learning algorithm provide the best flow rate estimates. Finally, the benefits of using this soft sensing technique combined with Venturi constriction in open channels are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The ultrastructural {{organization}} of the nucleus during late oogenesis in Rana temporaria was examined in normal and in hormone-stimulated maturing oocytes in vitro. At this stage numerous nucleoli are assembled around a knot of highly contracted chromosomes (the karyosphere) making up a karyosphere capsule. The nucleoli are fibrillar. They bear no pro-ribosomal granules and do not synthesize RNA. This period is characterized by segregation of nucleolar material into core and cortex. The nucleoli are of <b>irregular</b> shape. The <b>presence</b> of micronucleoli and nuclear bodies indicates an intensive fragmentation of nucleolar material. In the central fibrous zone of the capsule separating the chromosomes from the nucleoli, abundant accumulations of annuli lacking any membranous component occur. The annuli are connected by fibrous material and are regularly packed, forming peculiar pseudomembranes which are connected directly to the chromatin. Pseudomembranes, though less abundant and Jess regularly packed, are {{also found in the}} middle zone of the capsule. Along with annuli, membranous areas of various sizes and shapes are found in the pseudomembranes. Pseudo-membranes are linked to micronuclei by granular filaments 20 - 30 nm thick. A variety of membranous structures in the form of intranuclear annulate lamellae or mem-tranous tubular formations was detected in the peripheral zone of the capsule and outside it. The conclusion is drawn that the fibrous component of the karyosphere capsule consists of different membranous and pseudomembranous structures. It is suggested that chromatin participates directly in the formation of pseudomembranes and intranuclear membranous structures...|$|R
