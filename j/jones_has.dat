5|$|M-40 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US12 in rural Cass County. Running north through farm fields, the highway rounds Bar Lake {{and into the}} community of Jones. The area around <b>Jones</b> <b>has</b> a few more lakes in a wooded setting. As the trunkline continues north, it passes back into farm lands. The road curves around to the northwest as it passes between Bogart Lake and Streeters Mill Pond near Dutch Settlement Road. M-40 follows Centre Street into Marcellus. When the highway meets {{the western end of}} M-216 in town, M-40 turns west along Main Street and runs out of town. The roadway returns to a northerly course, and later it curves northwesterly again near Cedar Lake near the Van Buren County line.|$|E
500|$|While police {{questioned}} potential {{suspects and}} witnesses, other investigators focused on processing the crime scene. Repeated {{attempts were made}} to find the bullet that <b>had</b> passed through <b>Jones's</b> body and the murder weapon, including the sifting of dirt at the crime scene for bullets and the deployment of a troop of Boy Scouts to search for a gun. A [...]22 caliber rifle slug was eventually found buried in the ground where <b>Jones's</b> body <b>had</b> been found, providing evidence {{that at least some of}} her wounds had been sustained at the place her body was found. Though investigators went so far as to drag the bottom of nearby bodies of water, the gun that had shot Jones—assumed to be a [...]22 caliber pistol—could not be found. Buildings near where <b>Jones's</b> body <b>had</b> been located were also searched for blood and gunshot evidence, in accordance with police's theory that Jones had been attacked elsewhere and then transported outdoors. A [...] "white, powdery substance" [...] found in Jones's hair was initially believed to a trace evidence of some other crime scene area—an idea which fueled the search of nearby buildings—but was later determined to be fly eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the cavalry}} of the Army of Northern Virginia had {{accompanied}} Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart on his ride around the Union Army of the Potomac through Maryland and south-central Pennsylvania. Lee had retained several brigades {{to guard the}} mountain passes as he advanced through the Shenandoah and Cumberland Valleys and to scout Federal positions. Among the latter brigades was that of Brig. Gen. William E. [...] "Grumble" [...] Jones - the celebrated [...] "Laurel Brigade" [...] {{that had once been}} commanded by Turner Ashby. Jones had detached one of his best commands, the 35th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, to accompany the infantry of Jubal Early, but retained the bulk of his command. <b>Jones's</b> Brigade <b>had</b> been raiding the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in West Virginia and Maryland before being recalled by Lee. They hastened to Pennsylvania, crossing the Potomac River on July 1 (where Jones detached the 12th Virginia Cavalry to guard the ford) and camping at Chambersburg the following night. <b>Jones's</b> force <b>had</b> been reduced to the 6th, 7th, and 11th Virginia Cavalry and Preston Chew's Battery of horse artillery. Jones reached Fairfield on July 3 in response to Lee's orders to secure the vital Hagerstown Road.|$|R

5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. <b>Jones</b> <b>has</b> stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E
5|$|Samantha convinces Theodore {{to go on}} a {{blind date}} with a woman (Olivia Wilde), with whom a friend, Lewman (Luka <b>Jones),</b> <b>has</b> been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore {{mentions}} this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.|$|E
5|$|After {{six games}} without a goal and some {{criticism}} from supporters, manager Pulis revealed that <b>Jones</b> <b>has</b> had personal problems which have affected his performances. He ended this {{run with a}} goal against Everton on New Year's Day. However, he again went on a goal drought this time for three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had {{at the start of}} the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then had an opportunity to become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3–1 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City, he had Stoke's best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones' effort. Jones ended the 2010–11 as joint top goalscorer with Jonathan Walters, both scored 12 goals. Jones said that he had a 'topsy-turvy' first season at Stoke.|$|E
25|$|Marion Jones, {{winner of}} three gold and two bronze medals for the United States, relinquished them in October 2007 after confessing {{that she had}} taken {{tetrahydrogestrinone}} (THG) from September 2000 through July 2001. The IOC formally stripped Jones and her relay teammates of their 5 medals, although her teammates were to be offered opportunity to present a case for retaining their medals.

5000|$|In 1843, Jones {{returned}} a young deserter, Herman Melville, to the United States from the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were then known. Later, Melville modeled [...] "Commodore J—" [...] in Moby-Dick, and the commodore in White-Jacket after Jones. In 1827 Peacock under <b>Jones's</b> command <b>had</b> been severely damaged {{in an attack}} by a whale, which Melville took {{to have been a}} sperm whale. Moby-Dick may have partially inspired the story told of Jones in Chapter 45 [...] "The Affidavit".|$|R
50|$|Bugliosi {{criticized the}} U.S. Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Clinton v. Jones.
