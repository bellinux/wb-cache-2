Since there is not work for all, discouragement for some is unavoidable. How, then, does this process of discouragement operate? ...|$|R

30|$|By {{looking at}} labour force participation, {{we wanted to}} {{identify}} factors that affected workersâ€™ withdrawal from the labour market. We broadened the standard definition of the <b>discouraged</b> worker effect. We wanted to determine to what extent old-age benefits <b>discouraged</b> workers from active job search. We treated these benefits as an alternative source of income. They could be already paid out or shortly available to eligible workers. We focused on the outflow from unemployment to inactivity and approximated the <b>discouraged</b> worker effect by this outflow. Thus, we did not analyse pure <b>discouraged</b> worker effect. By <b>discouraged</b> workers, in turn, we meant those who had stopped seeking a job during the 1 -year interval.|$|R
50|$|The United States Department of Labor {{first began}} {{tracking}} <b>discouraged</b> workers in 1967 and found 500,000 at the time. Today, In the United States, {{according to the}} U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of April 2009, there are 740,000 <b>discouraged</b> workers. There is an ongoing debate as to whether <b>discouraged</b> workers {{should be included in}} the official unemployment rate. Over time, it has been shown that a disproportionate number of young people, blacks, Hispanics, and men make up <b>discouraged</b> workers. Nonetheless, it is generally believed that the <b>discouraged</b> worker is underestimated because it does not include homeless people or those who have not looked for or held a job during the past twelve months and is often poorly tracked.|$|R

5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began <b>discouraging</b> people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E

40|$|The Discouragement Scale for Adults (DSA) was {{developed}} to assess for the Adlerian construct of discouragement in adults age 18 years and over. Data were collected from three samples: norm (n= 586), presumed <b>discouraged</b> (n= 47), and {{parents of children with}} craniofacial anomaly (n= 105). Five subscales corresponding to life tasks identified in Adlerian literature as work, love, society, self-significance, and spirituality underlie the 60 item DSA. Item selection was based on ratings by five notable Adlerians and item correlations with scale scores. Gender, age, and ethnicity norms were established for the norm, presumed <b>discouraged,</b> and craniofacial samples. Across three samples, no significant ethnic differences were found. Normative findings indicated females are less <b>discouraged</b> than males on the Total DSA, the society and spirituality subscales. Age findings indicated the 18 - 34 year old sample is more <b>discouraged</b> than other ages on the Total DSA, the work, society, and spirituality subscales. Presumed <b>discouraged</b> findings indicated females are less <b>discouraged</b> than males on the society subscale. Craniofacial findings indicated females are less <b>discouraged</b> on the society subscale, but more <b>discouraged</b> on the self-significance subscale than males. Age findings indicated the 18 - 34 year old sample is more <b>discouraged</b> than other ages on the self subscale. Research on CPA parents' relationship status, CPA child's birth order, parental role of adult to CFA child, length of time the parent has cared for CFA child, the CFA child's age, CFA parent's education level, and CFA child's craniofacial anomaly diagnosis was conducted. Findings indicated birthmothers are less <b>discouraged</b> than birthfathers on the society subscale, but more <b>discouraged</b> on the self-significance subscale. Internal consistency ratings of the DSA were. 9392,. 9496, and. 9365 for three samples. Correlations to measures of social interest were negative and significant, reflecting an inverse relationship between discouragement and social interest. Factor analysis and interscale correlations are presented. Future research could include continued instrument validation and establishment of score ranges to indicate adult discouragement...|$|R

5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, <b>discouraging</b> many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, <b>discouraging</b> the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
