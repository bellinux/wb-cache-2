500|$|Paul Maurice Kelly [...] (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian {{rock music}} singer-songwriter, guitarist, and {{harmonica}} player. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He {{has worked with}} other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture {{the vastness of the}} culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise." [...] Kelly has said, [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet".|$|E
500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs with our own myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E

During the bridge section, the key sequence changes to A#m7–C7–F minor. It opens with a percussion section that includes a drum machine and cymbals; it then carries on with Palm Products GmbH synthesizers and keyboards, as described by a member at Selective Hearing.

500|$|The [...] "Director's Cut" [...] {{restored}} roughly {{four minutes}} of deleted footage while cutting {{about five minutes}} of other material, leaving it about a minute shorter than the theatrical cut. Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the Nostromo. Fox released the Director's Cut in theaters on October 31, 2003. The Alien Quadrilogy box set was released December 2, 2003, with both versions of the film included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's actors, writers, and production staff, {{as well as other}} special features and a documentary entitled The Beast Within: The Making of Alien. Each film was also released separately as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of Alien, saying that [...] "For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of Alien was perfect. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> that way", and that the original 1979 theatrical version [...] "remains my version of choice".

500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} his lyrical content relatively {{similar to the}} group's prior releases: [...] "The topics are universal.

I still have the same emotions I had 20 years ago – I get frustrated or I get excited. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E
500|$|Disagreements between female rapper Remy Ma and Minaj {{originated}} in 2007, when Remy {{took note of}} Minaj's freestyle record, nicknamed [...] "Dirty Money", from her mixtape Playtime Is Over (2007).

When the two encountered each other at an industry party, Remy asked Minaj who she was dissing in the song. Nicki Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Remy, however Remy Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, [...] "To this day <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like [...] is a stab at me; I'm gonna [...] back for that one". Since 2011, Remy Ma has stated that she supports Nicki Minaj and her success, [...] but added that she would be [...] "a problem" [...] to Minaj once she is released from prison. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Remy Ma affirmed that her option in releasing a blatant Minaj diss track titled [...] "Shether" [...] was considered after allegations were brought forward to Ma's camp about Minaj [...] "trying to keep [...] off of red carpets, trying to make sure awards don't go to [...] " [...] and [...] "trying to make people make bad reports about Plata O Plomo album sales." [...] Ma's opinion of Minaj not being a [...] "nice person" [...] and past incidents with Mariah Carey, Taylor Swift, and Lil' Kim were also factors in [...] "Shether"'s release.|$|E

2500|$|The play's {{main feature}} is its very eloquent, long, and {{authoritative}} dialogues, whereas {{the film is}} almost silent. Aravindan explains: [...] "There are some specific reasons for deciding to have sparse dialogues in Kanchana Sita. One, this episode taken from Ramayana is familiar to all. Two, Ramayana is not a supernatural reality for us, as it is ingrained in us. It is therefore not necessary to educate people about the film through lengthy dialogues. C. N. [...] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana. I {{did not think that}} Sita should come in the film {{in the form of a}} woman. That is why Sita appeared in the film as prakriti and Prakriti is a character in the film. When the emotions of Sita like pain, sadness, joy, and equanimity are manifested through the moods of Prakriti, dialogue becomes redundant. I felt I could make the film without dialogue. Rama committing suicide – (<b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> it was – self immolation) had haunted me very badly. With all these, my Kanchana Sita became very different. Words were required only for very essentials. The dialogues, which I used, were from C. N. 's play. The doubt I had then was whether my Rama and Lakshmana (as they were ordinary people) could use such an eloquent Sanskritised language." [...] In another interview, he said, [...] "Dialogues are there to carry on the storyline and make it move. But when it comes to well-known stories, dialogues ceases to be an essential ingredient." [...] Dialogue was, however, included in Kanchana Sita at the end of the movie to discuss the responsibilities of the king.|$|E
