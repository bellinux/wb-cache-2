40|$|The 8090 type Al-Li alloys {{are prone}} to {{intergranular}} and <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> in the peak aged temper.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{suffer from}} {{localised}} attack termed <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> which is intergranular in nature where the attack proceeds around the elongated grains {{present in the}} microstructure. The formation of a more voluminous corrosion product than the original material results in the lifting of grains giving the characteristic of <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> - lamellar attack. This results in surface degredation {{in the form of}} pitting, flaking or blistering. The precipitates present within the microstructure and the grain shape can alter how susceptible the material is to <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The distribution of precipitates present can be altered by heat treatment which affects the <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> susceptibility. A study on the effects of heat treatment and grain shape on <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> has been completed for two AlCuMg alloys (2014 and 2024) and two aluminium - lithium alloys (8090 and 2091). A MASTMAASIS salt - spray cabinet was used to determine the <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> susceptibility of all the alloys. A four - point bend test was developed to determine the depth of penetration and compared to depths measured metallographically. The results for the 2 XXX series alloys suggest that as the grain aspect ratio increases the exfoliation susceptibility increases. Although the aspect ratio did not differ greatly between each alloy, the different phases present in the two alloys seem to contribute more markedly to the susceptibility. Heat treatment in the 2024 alloy suggested that the peak - aged condition gave a higher susceptibility to corrosion than the under - aged and over - aged conditions. Results indicated that the heat treatment has a greater effect on <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> than the grain aspect ratio, showing that the grain boundary microstructure {{is an important factor in}} the exfoliation process. The four - point bend test tended to underestimate the depth of attack by virtue of measuring the whole area of the specimen whereas metallographic measurements only took into account the attacked areas. End grain testing suggested that the attack can not only proceed longitudinally but also "short - circuit" down the transverse path of the elongated grains in the 2 XXX series alloys.

A number of coupons with fasteners were cut from naturally exfoliated upper wing skins fabricated from 7178 -T 6 alloy, and the maximum depth of <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> was determined using an ultrasonic inspection technique. These coupons were tested to failure using constant amplitude compression dominated loading and the fracture surfaces were examined to determine the cracking mechanisms. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model associated with a 'soft inclusion' technique was developed to determine the local stress/strain distribution around the exfoliated fastener hole. The model included the local geometry change due to material loss, the contact effects between the fastener and the wing skin as well as the predominately compressive loading.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of aluminum 7075 T 651 in full clad (Alclad), partial clad, and bare (unclad) forms was compared after 300 hours of corrosion exposure in an acidic salt spray cabinet test at 36 °C. After corrosion exposure, severe to moderate <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> was observed on the unprotected medium sized test panel, light general corrosion was observed on the partially clad panel, and patches of corrosion not penetrating the clad layer were observed on the fully clad panel. After corrosion tests, the tensile strength of partially clad, fully clad, and unprotected panels decreased by 3. 4 %, 4. 0 %, and 5. 3 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Corrosion {{has been}} shown {{over the last decade}} to {{significantly}} reduce the structural integrity of aircraft as they age. Previous work at DSTO has shown that pitting and <b>exfoliation</b> <b>corrosion</b> are particularly deleterious to aircraft structural integrity. In addition to reducing fatigue endurance, pitting also increases the surface area of the component over which fatigue failures can occur. This paper reports the results of a Monte-Carlo model of this phenomenon, which has been labelled ‘corrosion criticality’. This model concentrates on the effect of the pit spatial density and position on the endurance of a fatigue coupon designed to mimic a simple aircraft component. The study’s results show that pitting increases the area of the coupon over which failures can occur. ...|$|E
