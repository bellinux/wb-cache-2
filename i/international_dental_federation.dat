40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the frequency with}} which dental materials are used for direct coronal restorations and to evaluate the quality of the result. Method: We performed a cross-sectional survey involving 31 dental-surgeon advisors (chirurgiens-dentistesconseils) of the three mandatory health insurance funds of the Rhône-Alpes region based on a sample of 7, 500 dental coronal restorations reimbursed in September 1998. The restorations were selected from a continuous series and appraised by using G. Ryge’s quality criteria, a guideline approved by the <b>International</b> <b>Dental</b> <b>Federation.</b> Results: We studied 7, 164 dental coronal restorations in 3, 796 patients which were performed by over 2, 000 dental surgeons (more than half the total number of all dental surgeons working in the Rhône-Alpes region). The average time between treatment and examination by a dental surgeon advisor was 6. 1 months (± 3. 3 months). Amalgam was used in 52. 2 % of the cases while 47. 8 % of the patients had received composite resins. Large posterior dental restorations on both maxillaries were treated with an amalgam. Qualitatively, composite resin restorations demonstrated a better marginal adaptation and anatomic morphology than amalgam, but the chromatic tone was not always appropriate. Dental coronal restorations were clinically acceptable in 63. 4 %, showed anomalies requiring clinical follow up in 19 % and 17. 6 % presented significant defects requiring direct repair. Decay recurrence with amalgam was 8. 6 % and 9. 4 % with composite resins. Each year, the health insurance funds of the Rhône-Alpes region of France reimburse at least 10. 7 million euros for defective dental coronal restorations (out of a total of 82. 3 million euros reimbursed for all dental coronal restorations). Conclusion: We instituted a campaign to increase practitioner awareness to this problem and in two years, the Rhône-Alpes Regional Union of Local Health Care Offices (URCAM) will conduct an impact study...|$|E
40|$|Because of its mercury content, {{the dental}} amalgam causes controversies for the 19 th century. Thus, {{at the time}} of the {{diffusion}} of the European reports of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Risks (SCENIHR) and of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), the positions of the scientific community in the United States, in Canada, and in Europe as for the risk of mercury coming from dental amalgams on health were analyzed. The principal points of the reports and the recommendations of good practice, emitted by the scientific authorities, are presented. It arises that the harmlessness of dental amalgams for the patients is recognized by the <b>International</b> <b>Dental</b> <b>Federation,</b> the World Health Organization, American Council one Science and Health, American Dental Association, Food and Drug Administration, and Health Canada. The French position is the same of that the United States. On the other hand, some Scandinavian countries took measures to limit or to prohibit the use of the dental amalgam. Norway made its decision of prohibition for environmental reasons and not of public health. The allergic risk exists for the mercury contained in the amalgams, but with a frequency it less low than for alternate materials containing resin seems. The latter would notreliable and studied enough to promote systematically their substitution of the dental amalgam. From the elements of the research evidence-based, it arises that the positions of the scientific community of the American northern countries and Europeans converge to indicate that the dental amalgam, in spite of the presence of mercury, does not present major health risks of the patients. It is thus important that the political decisions of the European institutions are made by holding account of the current scientific evidence and not under the pressure of professional lobbies and/or economic.

40|$|Dental Caries {{is still}} {{considered}} one of the most prevalent chronic diseases that affect children in the US. Access to oral care problems could be due to the limited availability of services or unwillingness of people to seek services. As a proposed solution to those challenges, Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART) was developed in the 1980 s as an affordable, patient friendly caries management procedure that does not need extensive operator training or special skills. ART was originally developed to be conducted in field settings; however, after initial evidence of effectiveness, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the <b>International</b> <b>Dental</b> <b>Federation</b> (FDI) promoted the use of ART in modern clinical settings worldwide. In the US, the practice of ART is not believed to be widely used. This may be a result of little attention given to (ART) in dental education and advanced training. This dissertation is comprised of three separate studies that investigated the extent and the factors related to the didactic and clinical instruction on ART in US pre- and post-doctoral pediatric dentistry programs and the factors related to the willingness of pediatric dentists to use ART with their child patients. survey post-doctoral pediatric dentistry program directors and pre-doctoral pediatric dentistry program directors. In study III a different instrument was used to survey pediatric dentists in the US. The survey instruments were tested for content and face validity by cognitive analysis interviews and pilot testing. Using web-based survey methodology, two questionnaires were sent out in May 2010 to investigate self-reported use of ART in educational training institutes (study I and II) and in April 2011, a third questionnaire was sent to a random national sample of pediatric dentists (study III).

Neste estudo, investigou-se a resposta inflamatória do tecido ósseo frente aos quatro tipos de MTAs disponíveis no mercado, através de implantes intra ósseos em cobaias guinea pigs, usando para isso, a metodologia recomendada pela Federação Dentária Internacional (1980) e aceita internacionalmente (ADA, 1982). Quarenta cobaias foram utilizadas nos períodos experimentais de quatro e doze semanas. Cada animal recebeu um implante em cada lado da região sinfisária da mandíbula. De cada implante foram confeccionadas 24 lâminas com 144 cortes histológicos, coradas com hematoxicilina-eosina e analisadas por dois observadores independentes. Verificou-se similaridade entre os materiais testados, uma vez que em todos os períodos de avaliação, tanto os MTAs ProRoot® cinza e branco quanto os MTAs Ângelus® cinza e branco apresentaram uma reação inflamatória ausentes/suaves evoluindo para um processo de reparo cicatricial com aposição de matriz mineralizada. Assim, através da metodologia empregada foi possível concluir que todos os tipos de MTAs, independentemente da marca comercial, foram biocompatíveis promovendo resposta tecidual similar quando em contato com o tecido ósseo. The material used in retrofilling {{is among}} others a decisive {{factor for the}} success in parendodontic surgeries; therefore they should have investigated their biocompatible characteristics since they remain {{in direct contact with}} the periapical bone tissue. This study investigated the inflammatory response of bone tissue when in contact with four types of MTAs available on the market, through intraosseous implants in guinea pigs, using for that purpose, the methodology recommended by the <b>International</b> <b>Dental</b> <b>Federation</b> (1980) which is internationally accepted (ADA, 1982). Forty guinea pigs were used in experimental periods of four and twelve weeks. Each animal received an implant in each side of the mandibular symphysis region. From each implant it was made 24 blades with 144 histological cuts, stained with hematoxylin-eosin and reviewed by two independent observers. There was similarity between the materials tested, since after 4 weeks all the implants with MTAs ProRoot ® gray and white as well as the ones with MTAs Angelus ® gray and white presented an absent/mild inflammatory reaction evolving into a process of scar repair with affixing of mineralized matrix. Thus, through the methodology employed it was possible to conclude that all types of MTAs, regardless the trademark, were biocompatible promoting similar tissue responses when in contact with the bone tissue...|$|E

O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a adaptação {{marginal}} em margens de esmalte e dentina de restaurações classe II com resina composta convencional (Gc), resina {{bulk fill}} (Gb) e resina bulk fill flow (Gf), após envelhecimento por ciclagem térmica e mecânica. Foram confeccionadas cavidades mésio-ocluso-distal (MOD) em 21 molares humanos (n= 7) com 4 mm de profundidade na caixa oclusal, 3 mm de largura em toda a cavidade, margem em esmalte posicionado 1 mm aquém da junção amelo-cementária (JAC) margem em dentina 1 mm além da JAC. O mesmo sistema adesivo foi utilizado em todos os grupos e os incrementos foram fotopolimerizados de acordo com as recomendações do fabricante. As amostras foram envelhecidas em ciclagem térmica (500 ciclos) e em ciclagem mecânica (força oclusal de 200 N por 250. 000 ciclos). Após envelhecimento, a margem da restauração foi avaliada segundo critérios para avaliação de fendas da Federação Dentária Internacional (FDI). Posteriormente, as amostras foram recobertas com esmalte para unhas, um milímetro aquém da margem da restauração e imersos em nitrato de prata por 24 h, posteriormente em solução reveladora por 8 h. Foram realizados dois cortes no sentido mésio-distal e selecionado a fatia com maior infiltração de prata. A fatia foi fotografada para análise da microinfiltração. Após realizadas as fotografias, as fatias foram desidratadas e recobertas com carbono para análise da nanoinfiltração (teste EDS). Os dados foram analisados pelo teste Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kruskal-Wallis e Mann-Whitney (p Abstract : The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the marginal adaptation in enamel and dentin margins in Class II restorations with conventional composite resin (Gc), bulk fill resin (Gb) and bulk fill flow resin (Gf), after aging by thermal and mechanical cycling. Mesial-occlusal-distal cavities (MOD) were made in 21 human molars (n = 7), with 4 mm of depth in the occlusal box, 3 mm of width in the whole cavity, margin in enamel positioned 1 mm below the cementoenamel junction (JAC) margin in dentin 1 mm beyond JAC. The same adhesive system was used in all the groups and the increments were photopolymerized according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The samples were aged in thermal cycling (500 cycles) and in mechanical cycling (occlusal strength of 200 N per 250, 000 cycles). After aging, the margin of the restoration was evaluated according to the criteria for the <b>International</b> <b>Dental</b> <b>Federation</b> (IDF) slit evaluation. Subsequently, the samples were covered with nail polish, one millimeter short of the restoration?s margin and immersed in silver nitrate for 24 hours, then in revealing solution for 8 hours. Two cuts were made in the mesio-distal direction and the slice with greater silver infiltration was selected. The slice was photographed for microleakage analysis. After the photographs were taken, the slices were dehydrated and covered with carbon for nanoinfiltration analysis (EDS test). Data were analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test (a = 0. 05). Regarding the behavior of the substrate, for all the resins, the enamel presented lower values in the FDI, microleakage and nanoinfiltration (statistically significant) than the dentin margins. As for the behavior of the material, Gc presented lower values in FDI, microleakage and nanoinfiltration (statistically significant) than Gb and Gf. When comparing the behavior of Gb and Gf, in all tests the first one obtained smaller values for enamel margins, while the second one obtained lower values for dentin margins only in the nanoinfiltration test (Gb dentine: 17. 43 % Gf dentin: 14. 61 %). It is concluded that Gc presents better behavior in relation to the marginal adaptation to margins in enamel and dentin.
