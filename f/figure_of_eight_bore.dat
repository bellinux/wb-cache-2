The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the stability <b>of</b> the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plus circular wiring fixation technique compared with four common internal fixation techniques and to provide experimental data for the selection of internal fixation techniques clinically. A total of 20 fresh cadaveric elbow joints were used as transverse, oblique and comminuted olecranon fracture models. Five techniques of internal fixation were investigated: circular wiring, <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> wiring, circular plus <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> wiring, Kirschner wire (K‑wire) and screw fixation. The elbow joints were flexed at 90. ̊ The fixation performance was tested using a high‑precision displacement sensor. Displacement‑load curves revealed that the strength of internal fixation was weakest when using circular wiring alone and that circular wiring plus <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> wiring fixation was stronger than that <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> wiring or screw fixation. The differ-ence was statistically significant (P 0. 05). However, <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plus circular wiring fixation was superior to K‑wire fixation in the comminuted fracture model, with a tensile force of 67. 42 ± 2. 17 vs. 58. 52 ± 2. 17 N, respectively (P< 0. 05). All 152 patients with olecranon fractures who received circular wiring plus <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> wiring fixation recovered and 108 were included in the follow‑up for an average of 12 months. The rate of excel-lent/fairly good recovery was 98. 10 %. Due to its reliability, simple surgery, lower invasiveness and lower cost, <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plus circular wiring fixation is an ideal choice for the internal fixation of olecranon fractures, particularly commi-nuted fractures, compared with circular wiring, <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> wiring or screw fixation...|$|R

40|$|Tension-band wiring is {{commonly}} used to treat transverse patella fractures. The most common configuration has parallel Kirschner (K) wires and a stainless steel wire loop placed in a vertically oriented <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight.</b> Early mobilisation is important but can cause detrimental displacement at the fracture site. A wooden model of a transversely fractured patella {{was used to compare}} different fixation constructs. The fracture was fixed using two K wires and a stainless steel wire loop. One or two wire twists were used, placed either arbitrarily or at corners of the loop. The loop was oriented either vertically or horizontally. Interfragmentary compression at the point of wire breakage and permanent displacement on cyclic loading was measured for each construct. Placement <b>of</b> the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> in a horizontal orientation with two wire twists at the corner improved interfragmentary compression by 63 % (p< 0. 05, Tukey post hoc test). On cyclic loading, all constructs with vertical <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> but none with a horizontal construct failed (p= 0. 01; Fisher’s exact test). Permanent fracture displacement after cyclic loading was 67 % lower with horizontal <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> constructs (p< 0. 05; t test). Placing wire twists at the corner and a horizontal placement <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> improves stability <b>of</b> the construct...|$|R

In both groups the fastest rate of alignment was between TO and T 1; 3. 20 mm/month and 3. 54 mm/month in the conventional and <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> module groups respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the results of bipolar hemiarthroplasty using calcar replacement stem for comminuted intertrochanteric fracture in elderly patients. Materials and Methods: Between March 1998 and March 2008, the clinical records of 79 cases who were older than 75 years of age and underwent bipolar hemiarthroplaty, using calcar replacement stem with <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> and cerclage wiring, were reviewed. Their mean age was 82. 4 years(75 - 92 years) and the mean follow-up period was 68 months(24 - 92 months). Results: The mean postoperative Harris hip score was 82. 1 (62 - 92), and preoperative walking ability was recovered in 56 cases(71 %). Bony ingrowth fixation was achieved in 70 cases(89 %), and fibrous stable fixation was in 9 cases(11 %). Stress shields were revealed in 21 cases(27 %). Nonunion of trochanter was found in 3 cases(4 %), and wire fixation breakages were in 3 cases after bony union. The mean duration of bony union was 16. 3 weeks(12 - 38 weeks). Aseptic loosening was observed in 1 case and protrusio acetabuli were in 2 cases. Conclusion: The result of clinical and radiological evaluations of bipolar hemiarthroplasty, using calcar replacement stem with <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> and cerclage wiring, were satisfactory in elderly patients with comminuted intertrochanteric fracture.

30|$|Angular {{deformities}} {{around the}} knee joint {{are common in}} the pediatric population. Physiological deformities account {{for the majority of}} these cases [1]. While physiological deformities usually correct with growth, pathological deformities can cause functional impairment in the form of abnormal gait, painful joint, and a potential risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Temporary hemiepiphysiodesis, timed permanent hemiepiphysiodesis, corrective osteotomy, and Ilizarov ring fixator application are the various surgical modalities for the correction of angular deformities around the knee joint [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Corrective osteotomies provide desired correction immediately but are associated with complications like increased blood loss, risk of compartment syndrome, neurovascular injury, and growth disturbance if the growth plate is damaged [2, 3, 4]. Prolonged period of immobilization following corrective osteotomy may also cause joint stiffness. Permanent hemiepiphysiodesis has unpredictable results, as the timing of the procedure is never precise. Overcorrection and undercorrection are common complications [7]. Limb length discrepancy can also occur, which may later require correction [7]. Staples, percutaneous screws, or <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plate (tension band plate) can be used for temporary hemiepiphysiodesis [8, 9, 10]. It is a less invasive technique compared to osteotomy. The results are more predictable and the process is reversible. The implants can be removed after the desired correction is achieved. <b>Figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plates and epiphyseal staples are both widely used methods of temporary hemiepiphysiodesis [8, 9]. Complications related to the use of staples include breakage, extrusion, and permanent physeal damage [9, 11, 12]. Eight plates have been shown to have fewer complications [9, 13]. Although costlier, <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plates are considered a better alternative to staples because of the fewer complications in comparative studies [14, 15, 16]. In this study, we have shared our experience with use <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> plates (Orthofix) and staples (locally manufactured stainless steel staples) for the correction of coronal plane deformities around the knee joint.|$|R
