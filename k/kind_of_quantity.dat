50|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{state of}} a thermodynamic system is its internal state as specified by its state variables. In {{addition to the}} state variables, a thermodynamic account also requires a special <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> called a state function, which {{is a function of}} the defining state variables. For example, if the state variables are internal energy, volume and mole amounts, that special function is the entropy. These quantities are inter-related by one or more functional relationships called equations of state, and by the system's characteristic equation. Thermodynamics imposes restrictions on the possible equations of state and on the characteristic equation. The restrictions are imposed by the laws of thermodynamics.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impacts of}} {{government}} energy and environmental policies on firm incen-tives to conduct R&D to (i) reduce costs of renewable energies such as biofuel, wind and solar, and (ii) increase the capacity of some renewable energies such as biofuel. We consider a range of policies including quantity mandates on biofuel use such as a minimum quantity requirement or a minimum blending requirement, taxes on nonrenewable energies or on environmental sensitive nonrenewable energies, subsidies on biofuel, wind and solar production, as well as direct subsidies on renewable R&D efforts. We find {{that there are a}} range of unintended consequences of these policies in a dynamic world. Taxes on nonrenewable energies discourage the development of cost reducing new technologies in solar, and may also discourage cost reducing and capacity enhancing innovations in biofuel. Subsidies to biofuel hurt the development of solar energy, but the impacts of solar subsidies on biofuel innovations depend on the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> restrictions in place.

It became apparent that on-line learning units were not suitable for all of the students: some students in the current cohort do not have regular access to the internet and most use dial-up internet connections on a pay-as-you-go basis. Obviously these students are not keen on being on-line for long periods of time. Consequently the production of lectures that could be directly downloaded and studied off-line were trialled. However it was found that dial-up is not suited to downloading the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> of material that would be needed for an on-line lecture.

40|$|Session - B 3. 11 Metaphysical Issues in the Philosophy of ScienceA realist about {{quantities}} {{holds that}} measurement procedures give us knowledge about quantities, where {{the latter are}} understood as entities that are in some relevant sense independent of the particular measurement procedures employed to determine them. An anti-realist about quantities holds {{that we can make}} sense of our measurement practices without introducing quantities as independent entities. With the development of formal measurement theory, which captures a wide range of measurement scales, there seems to be less need for realism about quantities. In this paper I argue in favor of a more realist approach to quantities, and lay out some conditions such a realism has to respect. A main consideration in favor of realism is the idea that in the establishment of a measurement scale, not just anything goes. A particular way of setting up such a scale is appropriate for a particular <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity.</b> I suggest that this appropriateness is best captured by assuming that the measurement aims to get right something about an independent entity. To avoid the restrictions of traditional realism about quantities, however, we must respect the idea that quantities can have different “structures”, captured by scales at different levels of fine-grainedness. I suggest {{that the best way to}} do so is structural realism about quantities. Structural realism about quantities is the idea that quantities are structures, characterized as relations among “positions”, which may or may not be occupied. Understanding quantities as structures permits us to characterize a plurality of possible values for a quantity like mass, even in the absence of a large number of massive objects. This is an advantage both over nominalistically understood representationalism, and property based realism...|$|E

5000|$|An antivector is {{an element}} of grade n − 1 in an n-dimensional {{exterior}} algebra. An antivector is always a [...] blade, and it gets its name from the fact that its components each involve a combination of all except one basis vector, thus being the opposite of a vector whose components each involve exactly one basis vector. Like a vector, an antivector has n components in n-dimensional space, and this sometimes leads to an inadequate distinction being made between the two types of entities. However, antivectors transform differently than vectors do, and this reveals that they are in fact different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities.</b> In physics, the names pseudovector and axial vector are used to describe vectors that transform {{in the same way that}} an antivector transforms.

Duhre’s formulations are slightly different from traditional geometric formulations, as he moved away from a purely geometrical context towards an algebraic one.

It is shown that the deformed-basis antisymmetrized molecular dynamics by the use of the Gogny D 1 S force reproduces successfully and unifiedly two types of coexistence phenomena in ^ 44 Ti. Namely, on one hand, the coexistence of the mean field structure and the cluster structure is confirmed by verifying the normally deformed structure of the K^π= 3 ^-_ 1 band with a 1 -particle-jump intrinsic configuration and the α + ^ 40 Ca cluster structure of the K^π= 0 ^-_ 2 band. The mixed character of the mean-field-like structure and the α + ^ 40 Ca cluster structure of the ground band is also shown. On the other hand, the coexistence of the normal deformed mean field and the superdeformed mean field is confirmed by verifying the triaxial superdeformation of the K^π= 0 _ 2 ^+ band and the K^π= 2 ^+_ 1 band which has a 4 -particle-jump intrinsic configuration. Good reproduction of the experimental data is shown for many <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> including the energy spectra, electric transition rates, alpha spectroscopic factors.

40|$|During {{the course}} of history, the natural {{sciences}} have seen the development of increasingly convenient short-hand symbolic devices for denoting physical quantities. These devices ultimately {{took the form of}} physical algebra. However, the convenience of algebra arguably came at a cost—a loss of the clarity of direct insights by Euclid, Galileo and Newton into natural quantitative relations. Physical algebra is frequently interpreted as ordinary algebra; i. e., it is interpreted as though symbols denote (a) numbers and operations on numbers, as opposed to (b) physical quantities and quantitative relations. The paper revisits the way in which Newton understood and expressed physical definitions and laws. Accordingly, it reviews a compact form of notation that has been used to denote both: (a) ratios of physical quantities; and (b) compound ratios, involving two or more <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity.</b> The purpose is to show that it is consistent with historical developments to regard physical algebra as a device for denoting relations among ratios. Understood in the historical context, the objective of measurement is to establish that a physical quantity stands in a specific ratio to another <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> the same <b>kind.</b> To clarify the meaning of measurement in terms of the historical origins of physics carries basic implications for the way in which measurement is understood and approached.
