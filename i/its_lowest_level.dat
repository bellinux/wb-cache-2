5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached <b>its</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> in the ninth century, when few books and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E
