However, while Muttawmp's soldiers were rude to the English emissaries, the sachem himself considered <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> feign friendship to the colonists and so told Curtis that he would show himself in Boston within seven days.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Gregory faced stark choices. Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more {{appropriate}} than public ministry? Was <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character and inspired his search for meaning and truth.|$|E
25|$|The Turks {{took the}} islands of Tinos and Aegina, crossed the isthmus, and took Corinth. Daniele Dolfin, {{commander}} of the Venetian fleet, thought <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> save the fleet than risk it for the Morea. When he eventually arrived on the scene, Nauplia, Modon, Corone, and Malvasia had fallen. Levkas in the Ionian islands, and the bases of Spinalonga and Suda on Crete which still remained in Venetian hands, were abandoned. The Turks finally landed on Corfù, but its defenders managed to throw them back.|$|E
25|$|He was {{archbishop}} for 42 years, unparalleled in Sweden, {{and during}} his time he was often in conflicts with the monarchs. In 1539 his brother Olaus {{was sentenced to death}} by the King over some arguments, and Laurentius was among those forced to sign the death sentence. It has been disputed whether Laurentius was doing this because of a weak character or if he thought <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> formally obey so that he could continue to spread the reformation ideas. Olaus did eventually get pardoned in 1542, much due to his influential friends, but he was forced to keep a low profile, leaving the role of main reformator solely to Laurentius.|$|E

Changes are similar to the U.S. market's CR edition, sharing the weight loss, a purpose built bodykit providing much higher downforce, bespoke wheels and interior. Although it shares the wheels with the CR edition, the Type S retains the rear tire size of 245/40R-17 for better handling. A specific Type S suspension setup with improved geometry was designed to enhance the handling, the setup is stiffer but more compromising than the CR setup to suit <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> everyday spirited driving and the Japanese touge experience. The Type S retains its soft top folding mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Kishi {{was born}} Nobusuke Satō in Tabuse, Yamaguchi Prefecture, but left his family {{at a young}} age to move in with the more {{affluent}} Kishi family, adopting their family name. Kishi was considered to be so brilliant as a boy that one of uncles thought <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> adopt him as he believed that his nephew could do much to advance the interests of the Kishi family. His biological younger brother, Eisaku Satō, would also go on to become a prime minister. He is also the grandfather of the current prime minister of Japan Shinzō Abe. Kishi attended Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) and entered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 1920. As a young man, Kishi was a follower of the Japanese fascist Ikki Kita whose writings called for a sort of monarchical socialism for Japan.|$|E
25|$|Voting in most Irish {{constituencies}} {{occurred on}} 14 December 1918. While {{the rest of}} the United Kingdom fought the 'Khaki election' on other issues involving the British parties, in Ireland four major political parties had national appeal. These were the IPP, Sinn Féin, the Irish Unionist Party and the Irish Labour Party. The Labour Party, however, decided not to participate in the election, fearing that it would be caught in the political crossfire between the IPP and Sinn Féin; it thought <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> let the people make up their minds on the issue of Home Rule versus a Republic by having a clear two-way choice between the two nationalist parties. The Unionist Party favoured continuance of the union with Britain (along with its subordinate, the Ulster Unionist Labour Association, who fought as 'Labour Unionists'). A number of other small nationalist parties also took part.|$|E

500|$|In August 1776, British General William Howe {{launched}} a massive naval and land campaign designed to seize New York. [...] Many of Washington's generals preferred retreating {{from the city}} and engaging in a defensive strategy, but he believed <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> engage in a major pitched battle. The Continental Army under Washington engaged the enemy {{for the first time as}} an army of the United States at the Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the entire war. The Americans were heavily outnumbered, many men deserted, and Washington was badly defeated. [...] He and his generals determined on a course of retreat, and Washington instructed General William Heath to make available every flat-bottom riverboat and sloop in the area. In little time, Washington's army crossed the East River safely under the cover of darkness to Manhattan Island and did so without loss of life or materiel.|$|E
500|$|Sherman {{pressured}} {{his friends}} in the Senate to defeat the bill, or to limit it to production of a larger silver dollar, which would actually be worth 1/16th its weight in gold. These efforts were unsuccessful, but Allison's amendment made the bill less financially risky. Sherman thought Hayes should sign the amended bill but did not press the matter, and the President vetoed it. [...] "In view of the strong public sentiment {{in favor of the}} free coinage of the silver dollar", he later wrote, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> make no objections to the passage of the bill, but I did not care to antagonize the wishes of the President." [...] Congress overrode Hayes's veto and the bill became law. The effects of the Bland–Allison Act were limited: the premium on gold over silver continued to grow, and financial conditions in the country continued to improve.|$|E
500|$|At about 08:00 the French {{artillery}} {{on their}} right wing opened fire, answered by Colonel Blood's batteries. The guns were heard by Baden in his camp before Ingolstadt, [...] "The Prince and the Duke are engaged {{today to the}} westward", he wrote to the Emperor. [...] "Heaven bless them." [...] An hour later Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin climbed Blenheim's church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that the Elector and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were, however, divided {{as to how to}} utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic – opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> close their infantry right up to the stream itself – was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. The plan was sound if all its parts were implemented, but it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle he had in mind.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson's {{success in}} the Senate {{rendered}} him a potential Democratic presidential candidate; {{he had been the}} [...] "favorite son" [...] candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party's national convention in 1956, and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination. Jim Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought <b>it</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> wait, thinking that John Kennedy's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited. Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration, another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy. Johnson's late entry into the campaign in July 1960, coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington, allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence, as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing [...] "Landslide Lyndon". Caro suggests that Johnson's hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure.|$|E
