5|$|Fructose, <b>galactose,</b> and glucose are all simple sugars, monosaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C6H12O6. They have five {{hydroxyl}} groups (−OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O) and are cyclic when dissolved in water. They each exist as several isomers with dextro- and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized light to diverge to the right or the left.|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>galactose</b> {{does not}} occur {{in the free state}} but is a {{constituent}} with glucose of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar. It is less sweet than glucose. It is a component of the antigens found on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood groups.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a purported {{new species}} of Streptococcus, named S.shiloi, was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} causes of an epidemic of meningoencephalitis (an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed rainbow trout and tilapia in Israel since 1986. Since S.shiloi was alpha-hemolytic, had a G+C% content of 37% and did not ferment sugar <b>galactose,</b> it was not classified as S.iniae, which is beta-hemolytic, has a G+C% content of 32%, and ferments <b>galactose.</b> In 1995, S.shiloi was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S.iniae and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S.iniae.|$|E
5|$|Some {{consumers}} prefer {{pizza cheese}} with less browning, {{which can be}} achieved using low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella with a low <b>galactose</b> content. Some varieties derived from skim mozzarella variants were designed not to require aging {{or the use of}} fermentation starter. Others can be produced through the direct acidification of milk, which may be used in place of bacterial fermentation.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include <b>galactose,</b> fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of <b>galactose</b> with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest lactose.|$|E
5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and <b>galactose.</b> Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, {{so many of the}} reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of <b>galactose,</b> a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{contains}} {{several different}} carbohydrate including lactose, glucose, <b>galactose,</b> and other oligosaccharides. The lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories. Lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and <b>galactose.</b> Bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous lactose, which amounts to about 50% {{of the total}} solids of skimmed milk. Levels of lactose are dependent upon the type of milk as other carbohydrates can be present at higher concentrations that lactose in milks.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of <b>galactose,</b> and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of <b>galactose.</b> While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
25|$|In industry, {{lactic acid}} {{fermentation}} is performed by lactic acid bacteria, which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or <b>galactose</b> to lactic acid. These bacteria can also grow in the mouth; the acid they produce {{is responsible for the}} tooth decay known as caries.|$|E
25|$|The {{gelling agent}} in agar is an {{unbranched}} polysaccharide {{obtained from the}} cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from the genera Gelidium and Gracilaria. For commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from Gelidium amansii. In chemical terms, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar <b>galactose.</b>|$|E
25|$|When two monosaccharides undergo {{dehydration}} synthesis whereby {{a molecule}} {{of water is}} released, as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides, the new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a disaccharide and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed hydrolysis. The most well-known disaccharide is sucrose, ordinary sugar (in scientific contexts, called table sugar or cane sugar to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is lactose, consisting of a glucose molecule and a <b>galactose</b> molecule. As most humans age, the production of lactase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and <b>galactose,</b> typically decreases. This results in lactase deficiency, also called lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and <b>galactose</b> (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of <b>galactose</b> and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free <b>galactose</b> 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E
25|$|Ricin B chain binds complex {{carbohydrates}} {{on the surface}} of eukaryotic cells containing either terminal N-acetylgalactosamine or beta-1,4-linked <b>galactose</b> residues. In addition, the mannose-type glycans of ricin are able to bind cells that express mannose receptors. RTB has been shown to bind to the cell surface on the order of 106-108 ricin molecules per cell surface.|$|E
25|$|The O-glucose on notch can {{be further}} {{elongated}} to a trisaccharide {{with the addition of}} two xylose sugars by xylosyltransferases, and the O-fucose can be elongated to a tetrasaccharide by the ordered addition of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar by an N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase called Fringe, the addition of a <b>galactose</b> by a galactosyltransferase, and the addition of a sialic acid by a sialyltransferase.|$|E
25|$|Glycolysis is a {{determined}} sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The intermediates provide entry points to glycolysis. For example, most monosaccharides, such as fructose and <b>galactose,</b> {{can be converted}} to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly useful. For example, the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat.|$|E
25|$|Lactase (also {{known as}} lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), {{a part of}} the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a {{glycoside}} hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent <b>galactose</b> and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.|$|E
25|$|Ricin toxic B chain (RTB) is a lectin {{composed}} of 262 amino acids that {{is able to}} bind terminal <b>galactose</b> residues on cell surfaces. RTB forms a bilobal, barbell-like structure lacking alpha-helices or beta-sheets where individual lobes contain three subdomains. At {{least one of these}} three subdomains in each homologous lobe possesses a sugar-binding pocket that gives RTB its functional character.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of animals and plants are able to synthesize vitamin C, through a sequence of enzyme-driven steps, which convert monosaccharides to vitamin C. In plants, this is accomplished through the conversion of mannose or <b>galactose</b> to ascorbic acid. In some animals, glucose needed to produce ascorbate in the liver (in mammals and perching birds) is extracted from glycogen; ascorbate synthesis is a glycogenolysis-dependent process.|$|E
25|$|The average {{ratio was}} 56% {{fructose}} to 44% glucose, but the ratios {{in the individual}} honeys ranged {{from a high of}} 64% fructose and 36% glucose (one type of flower honey; table 3 in reference) to a low of 50% fructose and 50% glucose (a different floral source). This NMR method was not able to quantify maltose, <b>galactose,</b> and the other minor sugars as compared to fructose and glucose.|$|E
25|$|All {{strains of}} S.cerevisiae can grow aerobically on glucose, maltose, and {{trehalose}} {{and fail to}} grow on lactose and cellobiose. However, growth on other sugars is variable. <b>Galactose</b> and fructose are shown to be {{two of the best}} fermenting sugars. The ability of yeasts to use different sugars can differ depending on whether they are grown aerobically or anaerobically. Some strains cannot grow anaerobically on sucrose and trehalose.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that A. salmonicida contains the spf gene (which encodes Spot 42), but lacks the galK operon (the natural Spot 42 target in E. coli), have inspired scientists {{to study the}} role of Spot 42 in this fish pathogen. A. salmonicida is unable to utilize <b>galactose</b> (lacks gal operon) in minimal medium and addition of <b>galactose</b> has {{little effect on the}} growth rate. When cells are grown in glucose the level of Spot42 is increased 16-40 folds, but is in contrast decreased 3 folds when cAMP is added, indicating that Spot42 probably have similar roles as in E. coli (i.e., in carbohydrate metabolism). It has been hypothesized that Spot 42 works in concert with a novel sRNA gene, called VSsrna24, located 262 nt downstream of spf. The VSsrna42 RNA is approximately 60 nt in length and has an expression pattern opposite to that of Spot42. Furthermore, in a spf deletion mutant a gene encoding a pirin-like protein was upregulated 16 folds. Pirin has key roles in the central metabolism by regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 and therefore select if pyruvate will be fermented or go through respiration through the TCA cycle and electron transport.|$|E
25|$|Pioneered by Stanley Fields and Ok-Kyu Song in 1989, the {{technique}} was {{originally designed to}} detect protein–protein interactions using the Gal4 transcriptional activator of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Gal4 protein activated transcription of a protein involved in <b>galactose</b> utilization, which {{formed the basis of}} selection. Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein–DNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use different host organisms such as Escherichia coli or mammalian cells instead of yeast.|$|E
25|$|Crystallisation {{experiments}} of galectins {{in complex}} with N-acetyllactosamine show that binding arises due to hydrogen bonding interactions from the carbon-4 and carbon-6 hydroxyl groups of <b>galactose</b> and carbon-3 of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) {{to the side}} chains of amino acids in the protein. They cannot bind to other sugars such as mannose because this sugar will not fit inside the carbohydrate recognition domain without steric hindrance. Due {{to the nature of}} the binding pocket, galectins can bind terminal sugars or internal sugars within a glycan. This allows bridging between two ligands on the same cell or between two ligands on different cells.|$|E
25|$|Aldose reductase is {{the first}} enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway {{responsible}} for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, {{as well as the}} reduction of <b>galactose</b> to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Aldose reductase inhibitors, which are substances that prevent or slow the action of aldose reductase, are currently being investigated as a way to prevent or delay these complications.|$|E
25|$|H5N1 {{is easily}} {{transmissible}} between birds, facilitating a potential global spread of H5N1. While H5N1 undergoes mutation and reassortment, creating variations which can infect species not previously known {{to carry the}} virus, {{not all of these}} variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of <b>galactose</b> receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the alveoli, structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{synthesis}} {{begins with}} a reaction between UDP-galactose and 2-hydroxylated or non-hydroxylated ceramide. This reaction is catalyzed by galactosyltransferase (CGT), where <b>galactose</b> is transferred to 2-hydroxylated, or non-hydroxylated ceramide, from UDP-galactose. This reaction occurs in the luminal leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum, and its final product is GalCer, or galactocerebroside, which is then transported to the Golgi apparatus. Here, GalCer reacts with 3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to make sulfatide. This reaction is catalyzed by cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST). CST is a homodimeric protein that {{is found in the}} Golgi apparatus. It has been demonstrated that mice models lacking CST, CGT, or both are incapable of producing sulfatide indicating that CST and CGT are necessary components of sulfatide synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Glucose {{is mainly}} metabolized {{by a very}} {{important}} ten-step pathway called glycolysis, the net result {{of which is to}} break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This also produces a net two molecules of ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) (e.g., in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in yeast). Other monosaccharides like <b>galactose</b> and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin {{published}} a book, The Problems of Cell Permeability, in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) {{in which he}} found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of <b>galactose</b> or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments {{cast doubt on the}} theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, the {{disaccharide}} sugar {{component of}} all milk, must be cleaved {{in the small}} intestine by the enzyme lactase, in order for its constituents, <b>galactose</b> and glucose, to be absorbed. Lactose intolerance is {{a condition in which}} people have symptoms due to not enough of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. These may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Severity depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. Those affected are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Spot42 can {{interact}} directly with mRNA targets through base pairing. The first Spot 42 target {{was discovered by}} Møller et al. who showed that Spot 42 specifically binds to a short complementary region at the translation initiation region of galK (encodes a galactoinase). galK is the third gene in the <b>galactose</b> operon, which contains four genes (galETKM) and produces a polycistronic mRNA. Spot 42 mediates discoordinate expression of the gal operon (i.e., the individual genes in the operon are not similarly expressed) by binding to the galK Shine-Dalgarno region, thereby blocking ribosome binding and translation of the galK gene. The physiological significance of the coordinate expression is unclear, but suggests that Spot 42 {{plays a role in}} fine-tuning gene expression to optimize the utilization of carbon sources.|$|E
25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the <b>galactose</b> moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E
25|$|Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern {{discovered}} the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910–11. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924. Watkins and Morgan, in England, {{discovered that the}} ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and <b>galactose</b> for the B-type. After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent {{the majority of the}} antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin. Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial ABC {{transporters}} {{are essential}} in cell viability, virulence, and pathogenicity. Iron ABC uptake systems, for example, are important effectors of virulence. Pathogens use siderophores, such as Enterobactin, to scavenge iron {{that is in}} complex with high-affinity iron-binding proteins or erythrocytes. These are high-affinity iron-chelating molecules that are secreted by bacteria and reabsorb iron into iron-siderophore complexes. The chvE-gguAB gene in Agrobacterium tumefaciens encodes glucose and <b>galactose</b> importers that are also associated with virulence. Transporters are extremely vital in cell survival such that they function as protein systems that counteract any undesirable change occurring in the cell. For instance, a potential lethal increase in osmotic strength is counterbalanced by activation of osmosensing ABC transporters that mediate uptake of solutes. Other than functioning in transport, some bacterial ABC proteins are also involved in the regulation of several physiological processes.|$|E
25|$|Like the chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycan}}s, keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) {{production is}} up regulated in reactive astrocytes {{as part of}} glial scar formation. KSPGs have {{also been shown to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting nerve regeneration. Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide <b>galactose</b> units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited.|$|E
