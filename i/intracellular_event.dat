The concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) remains unaltered, however. A similar effect is observed when the cysts are treated with H 2 O 2, with which we demonstrated that its action mimics light activation. The demonstrated decrease in cAMP is the earliest observed <b>intracellular</b> <b>event</b> after light induction.

40|$|Human {{extracellular}} {{superoxide dismutase}} (EC-SOD) is a tetrameric glycoprotein {{responsible for the}} removal of superoxide generated in the extracellular space. Two different folding variants of EC-SOD exist based on the disulfide bridge connectivity, resulting in enzymatically active (aEC-SOD) and inactive (iEC-SOD) subunits. As a consequence of this, the assembly of the EC-SOD tetramers produces molecules with variable activity and may represent a way to regulate the antioxidant level in the extracellular space. To determine whether the formation of these two folding variants is an intra- or extracellular event, we analyzed the biosynthesis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing wild-type EC-SOD. These analyses revealed that both folding variants were present in the intra- and extracellular spaces, suggesting that the formation is an <b>intracellular</b> <b>event.</b> To further analyze the biosynthesis, we constructed mutants with the capacity to generate only aEC-SOD (C 195 S) or iEC-SOD (C 45 S). The expression of these suggested that the cellular biosynthetic machinery supported the secretion of aEC-SOD but not iEC-SOD. The coexpression of these two mutants did not affect the expression pattern. This study shows that generation of the EC-SOD folding variants is an <b>intracellular</b> <b>event</b> that depends on a free cysteine residue not involved in disulfide bonding...|$|E

Transferaseless cells transport galactose at the same initial rate as wild-type cells and accumulate a mixture of free galactose and galactose- 1 -phosphate. The addition of 14 C-labeled galactose to cells preloaded with unlabeled galactose and galactose- 1 -phosphate results in {{a higher rate of}} labeling of the free-sugar pool than of the galactose- 1 -phosphate pool.

40|$|The <b>intracellular</b> <b>events</b> on the {{recycling}} pathway that lead from sorting endosomes to exocytosis at the plasma membrane {{are central to}} cellular function. However, despite intensive study, these processes are poorly characterized in spatial and dynamic terms. The primary {{reason for this is}} that, to date, it has not been possible to visualize rapidly moving intracellular compartments in three dimensions in cells. Here, we use a recently developed imaging setup in which multiple planes can be simultaneously imaged within the cell in conjunction with visualization of the plasma membrane plane by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This has allowed us to track and characterize <b>intracellular</b> <b>events</b> on {{the recycling}} pathway that lead to exocytosis of the MHC Class I-related receptor, FcRn. We observe both direct delivery of tubular and vesicular transport containers (TCs) from sorting endosomes to exocytic sites at the plasma membrane, and indirect pathways in which TCs that are not in proximity to sorting endosomes undergo exocytosis. TCs can also interact with different sorting endosomes before exocytosis. Our data provide insight into the <b>intracellular</b> <b>events</b> that precede exocytic fusion...|$|R
40|$|Among {{different}} {{features of}} cancer cells, {{two of them}} have retained our interest: their nearly universal glycolytic phenotype and their sensitivity towards an oxidative stress. Therefore, we took advantage of these features to develop an experimental approach by selectively exposing cancer cells to an oxidant insult induced by the combination of menadione (vitamin K(3)) and ascorbate (vitamin C). Ascorbate enhances the menadione redox cycling, increases the formation of reactive oxygen species and kills K 562 cells as shown by more than 65 % of LDH leakage after 24 hr of incubation. Since both lactate formation and ATP content are depressed by about 80 % following ascorbate/menadione exposure, we suggest that the major <b>intracellular</b> <b>event</b> involved in such a cytotoxicity {{is related to the}} impairment of glycolysis. Indeed, NAD(+) is rapidly and severely depleted, a fact most probably related to a strong Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation, as shown by the high amount of poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins. The addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) restores most of the ATP content and the production of lactate as well. The PARP inhibitor dihydroxyisoquinoline (DiQ) was able to partially restore both parameters as well as cell death induced by ascorbate/menadione. These results suggest that the PARP activation induced by the oxidative stress is a major but not the only <b>intracellular</b> <b>event</b> involved in cell death by ascorbate/menadione. Due to the high energetic dependence of cancer cells on glycolysis, the impairment of such an essential pathway may explain the effectiveness of this combination to kill cancer cells. status: publishe...|$|E

We show that scleroderma fibroblasts express more than eight times higher level of hsp 70 transcription in normal control fibroblasts at quiescent conditions in the absence of serum. After stimulation with serum, the transcription level of the hsp 70 gene is similar in scleroderma and normal control fibroblasts.

Soma-tostatin (SRIF) blocks the ACTH release response to each se-cretagogue but only inhibits forskolin-stimulated calcium mobili-zation suggesting that SRIF prevents the formation of CAMP rather than blocking the ability of cAMP to raise intracellular calcium concentrations. SRIF itself lowers intracellular calcium levels. The ACTH release response but not the rise in cytosohc calcium levels induced by the membrane-depolanzing agent K, is blocked by SRIF, indicating that SRIF can interfere with some <b>intracellular</b> <b>event,</b> other than calcium mobilization or CAMP formation, to reduce ACTH secretion.

40|$|To {{survive in}} a dynamic environment, all living cells {{must be able to}} {{identify}} and respond to variations in specific extracellular signals. Peptide hormones are one type of signal to which mammalian cells respond. Cells recognize hormones through specific receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane.

These metabolic responses include ion flux, enzyme activity, RNA and protein synthesis, steroid synthesis and secretion, protein secretion, cell division, cell motility, and cell-to-cell communication.

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease and}} prion {{diseases}} (e. g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) display profound neural lesions associated with aberrant protein processing and extracellular amyloid deposits. However, the <b>intracellular</b> <b>events</b> in prion diseases and their {{relation with the}} processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid generation are unknown. The adaptor protein Dab 1 may regulate intracellular trafficking and secretase-mediated proteolysis in APP processing. However, a putative relationship between prion diseases and Dab 1 /APP interactions is lacking. Thus, we examined, in inoculated animals, whether Dab 1 and APP processing are targets of the <b>intracellular</b> <b>events</b> triggered by extracellular exposure to PrP(106 - 126) peptide. Our in vitro results indicate that PrP(106 - 126) peptide induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab 1 by activated members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), which implies further Dab 1 degradation. We also corroborate these results in Dab 1 protein levels in prion-inoculated hamsters. Finally, we show that fibrillar prion peptides have a dual effect on APP processing and beta-amyloid production. First, they block APP trafficking at the cell membrane, thus decreasing beta-amyloid production. In parallel, they reduce Dab 1 levels, which also alter APP processing. Lastly, neuronal cultures from Dab 1 -deficient mice showed severe impairment of APP processing with reduced sAPP secretion and A beta production after prion peptide incubation. Taken together, these data indicate a link between <b>intracellular</b> <b>events</b> induced by exposure to extracellular fibrillar peptide or PrP(res), and APP processing and implicate Dab 1 in this link...|$|R

We demonstrate here that, while bFGF is a weak chemoattractant for VSMCs, it is required for the PDGF-directed migration of VSMCs and the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKinase II), an <b>intracellular</b> <b>event</b> that we have previously shown to be important in the regulation of VSMC migration. Neutralizing antibodies to bFGF caused a dramatic reduction {{in the size of the}} intracellular calcium transient normally seen after PDGF stimulation and inhibited both PDGF-directed VSMC migration and CamKinase II activation. Partially restoring the calcium transient with ionomycin restored migration and CamKinase II activation as did the forced expression of a mutant CamKinase II that had been "locked" in the active state by site-directed mutagenesis. These results suggest that bFGF links PDGF receptor stimulation to changes in intracellular calcium and CamKinase II activation, reinforcing the central role played by CamKinase II in regulating VSMC migration...|$|E

One of these genes, the Fv- 1 locus in mice, is expressed in vitro and may be studied in mouse-embryo cultures that are restrictive or permissive for replication of Friend leukemia virus. Two strains of Friend leukemia virus, N-or B-tropic, show reciprocal ability to replicate successfully in either NIH Swiss (N-type) or BALB/c (B-type) cells that differ at the Fv- 1 locus. These two strains of virus and two cell lines form a system to measure host restriction in vitro. Measurement of adsorption of Friend leukemia virus to permissive or restrictive cells reveals no difference in rate or total amount of virus bound. Furthermore, studies with virions of vesicular stomatitis virus phenotypically mixed within an envelope containing Friend leukemia virus protein show no differences in penetration or replication of vesicular stomatitis virus.

40|$|Summary. Cells are {{sensitive}} {{to a variety of}} signals in their environment, which they respond to and integrate. Signal transduction at the cellular level refers to the movement of signals from outside the cell to inside. A "cross-talk" between heterologous cell signaling systems gives a complex communication of molecules in various tissues a new dimension and specifies the type of the obtained biological response. A biochemical basis for transducing extracellular signals into an <b>intracellular</b> <b>event</b> has long been the subject of enormous interest. The mechanisms underlying ROS-mediated signal transduction in oxidative stress response involve a direct alteration in transcription factors and kinases and indirect modulation of cysteine-rich redox-sensitive signaling proteins. In a given signaling protein, oxidative attack induces either a loss of function, a gain of function, or a switch to a different function.

However, the mechanisms by which trypsinogen is activated are not well characterized. In the present work, trypsinogen activation was studied in intact acinar cells using bis-(CBZ-arginyl) -Rhodamine 110 [(CBZ-Arg) 2 -Rho 110] as a cell-permeant substrate for trypsin and also independently via the formation of trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP). Preincubation with 10 nM caerulein increased the Rho 110 -substrate cleavage more than threefold. This proteolytic activity was fully sensitive to a benzamidine (BA) -type serine protease inhibitor. The appearance of enzymatic activity was paralleled by the formation of TAP. The lack of effect of the high-molecular soybean trypsin inhibitor indicates an intracellular substrate cleavage. The cathepsin B inhibitor CA- 074 prevented neither the caerulein-induced formation of TAP nor the (CBZ-Arg) 2 -Rho 110 -cleaving activity. BA inhibited the Rho 110 -substrate cleavage and significantly reduced the TAP formation. These results show that trypsinogen activation in caerulein-hyperstimulated acinar cells may occur independently of the activity of cathepsin B.
