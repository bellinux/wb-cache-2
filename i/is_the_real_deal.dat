500|$|Conversely, Allmusic {{contributor}} Gregory Heaney {{gave the}} album an overall score of {{three out of}} a possible five, noting that the lyrics [...] "feel more genuinely personal than his earlier work", and that [...] "there's a real sense of urgent catharsis at work".

[...] Molly Walter of The University Leader felt the album was an attempt to recreate Escape the Fate prior to Radke's departure and noted that [...] "he fell short big time", calling the album's music [...] "out of date and overdone". Walter did comment on Radke's singing but felt the lyrical content was conceited, concluding the review saying, [...] "Face it, Ronnie, you did not magically turn tragedy into melody. You’re just not king of the music scene." [...] The [...] Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is You and said, [...] "In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal.</b> The lewd, crude and tattooed punk has survived jail, rehab and being turfed from Escape the Fate.

Jinkins made sure that his contract allowed him to take the series to another network if Nickelodeon did not complete the show's order.|$|E
