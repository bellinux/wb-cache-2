Cranch had also administered the oath to John Tyler in 1841, when Tyler succeeded to the presidency upon William Henry Harrison's death. In contrast to Tyler, whose legitimacy as president had been questioned by many after his accession to the presidency, Fillmore was widely accepted immediately.|$|R

Since 1999, an active surveillance programme involving <b>formal</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> all suspect CJD cases has been in place. The annual mortality rate has increased from 0. 34 cases/million in 1980 to 1. 27 cases/million in 2001.

In some of these areas, such as agriculture and fisheries, EU law has been the central source of legal regulation since we joined what was then the EEC in 1973. In other areas, EU law has played a role alongside domestic regulation, in greater or lesser degrees.

[...] After acknowledging the letter, and spending a sleepless night, Fillmore went to the House of Representatives, where, at a joint session of Congress, he took the oath as president from William Cranch, chief judge of the federal court for the District of Columbia, and the man who had sworn in President Tyler. The cabinet officers, as was customary when a new president took over, submitted their resignations, expecting Fillmore to refuse, allowing them to continue in office. Fillmore had been marginalized by the cabinet members, and the new president accepted the resignations, though he asked them to stay on for a month, which most refused to do. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet. He was already in discussions with Whig leaders, and on July 20 began to send new nominations to the Senate, with the Fillmore cabinet to be led by Webster as Secretary of State. Webster had outraged his Massachusetts constituents by supporting Clay's bill, and with his Senate term to expire in 1851, had no electoral future in his home state. Fillmore appointed his old law partner, Nathan Hall, as Postmaster General, a cabinet position that controlled many patronage appointments. The new department heads were mostly supporters of the Compromise, as was Fillmore.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{performance}} of blood transfusion committees in transfusion services linked to the public blood bank network {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between 2007 and 2008 using questionnaires and proficiency tests to evaluate the reporting and <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> transfusion reactions comparing transfusion services with and without transfusion committees in the public transfusion services of the state of Minas Gerais. RESULTS: Nineteen of Hemominas own transfusion services and 207 that contracted the services of the foundation located in 178 municipalities were visited between 2007 and 2008. Established transfusion committees were present in 63. 4 % of the services visited. Transfusion incidents were reported by 53 (36. 8 %) transfusion services with transfusion committees and by eight (9. 6 %) without transfusion committees (p < 0. 001) with 543 (97. 5 %) and 14 (2. 5 %) <b>notifications,</b> respectively. <b>Of</b> the reported transfusion incidents, 40 (75. 5 %) transfusion services with transfusion committees and only two (25 %) of those without transfusion committees investigated the causes. CONCLUSION: The incidence <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> the causes of transfusion reactions was higher in transfusion services where a transfusion committee was present.

The theory and method used in this study was Sociology of Law. Qualitative interviews were conducted with eight child investigators, one from each police district in Stockholm. The results of the study conclude that despite special qualifications, child investigators may find themselves in difficulty in receiving or interpreting information from chil-dren, therefore they may need to consult a person with expert knowledge. Fur-thermore the results conclude that all of the child investigators with no exception inform the social services when a report to the police is received. Moreover, the results show that child investigators in general are aware of the legislation and re-late in compliance with it. In conclusion, children are given special treatment in relation to adults, in order to place children on equality with them...|$|R
