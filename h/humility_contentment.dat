It has to {{be pointed out that}} the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, <b>humility,</b> <b>contentment,</b> gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the [...] "immeasurables" [...] — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity." ...|$|E

"I {{shall be}} frank with you, Littlepage, and confess I {{have been very}} anxious for the union of my {{daughter}} and Mr. Bulstrode," [...] added Herman Mordaunt, in the interview we had before I left the Nest; [...] "and I trust to your own good sense to account for it. I knew Bulstrode before I had any knowledge of yourself; and there was already a connection between us, that was just of a nature to render one that was closer, desirable. I shall not deny that I fancied Anneke fitted to adorn the station and circles to which Bulstrode would have carried her; and, perhaps, it is a natural parental weakness to wish to see one's child promoted. We talk of <b>humility</b> and <b>contentment,</b> Corny, though there is much of the nolo episcopari about it, after all.

40|$|May 7, 1989 The Yang’s spare {{living room}} was {{transformed}} into a vibrant cultural salon, with Gladys and Xianyi taking their habitual places in twin armchairs, bringing to mind a kindly old king and queen holding court. The rest of us, lined up on a long couch against the opposite wall behaved like loyal subjects, beaming with respect and admiration. The Yangs had been through unimaginably hard times, including solitary confinement during the Cultural Revolution, but remained true to one another through thick and thin, emerging with a rare degree of <b>contentment,</b> <b>humility</b> and self-knowledge. They did their best to make light of their significant literary accomplishments, and though rocked by cruel vicissitudes of fate, they could joke and tease one another about it, perhaps a secret to their health and the enduring affection they held not just for one another but the country they had chosen to call home. “The first time I met Mao…” Mr. Yang, said with a clipped British inflection, sounding rather like a seasoned raconteur who needed no prompting to start telling an oft-repeated tale, “the Chairman asked me if it was really possible to translate Chinese into English. He was really puzzled by that. Mao had a good mind, but he was not skilled at foreign languages…” “Xian-yi,” Gladys interrupted. “Why are you speaking in English again? Everyone here understands Chinese!” Gladys scowled at him like a mother trying to discipline a wayward son...|$|R
