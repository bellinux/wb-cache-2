6000|$|It is true {{that they}} who would most eagerly have sought my life deemed me already dead, drowned in the fosse, and so would make no search for me. Yet, as soon as I went about my master's affairs, as needs I must, I would be known and taken; and, {{as we say in}} our country proverb, [...] "my craig would ken the weight of my hurdies." [...] {12} None the less, seeing that the {{soldiers}} deemed me dead, I might readily escape at once from Chinon, and take to the roads again, if but I could reach my master's house unseen, and get rid of this foolish feminine <b>gear</b> of <b>cap</b> and petticoat which now I wore to my great shame and discomfort.|$|R
2500|$|In helical and worm gears, the {{helix angle}} denotes the {{standard}} pitch circle unless otherwise specified. Application of the helix angle typically employs a magnitude ranging from 15° to 30° for helical <b>gears,</b> with 45° <b>capping</b> the safe operation limit. The angle itself may be cut {{with either a}} right-hand or left-hand orientation. In its typical parallel arrangement, meshing helical gears requires that the helix angles are of the same magnitude and cut oppositely [...]|$|R

In 1909, Franklin concentrated their efforts on die-cast hard babbitt bushings for gasoline and other engines. The reason for the move was because so many manufacturers were producing engines there was huge demand.|$|R

50|$|The Buitenmolen is a brick tower mill with a 3.28 m high mound {{built up}} around the mill for the miller to reach the sails. The four common sails have a span of 24.4 m. They are carried on a wooden windshaft, 9 m in length which was {{initially}} fitted in 1969 and replaced in 2002. The windshaft carries the brake wheel which drives the wallower {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives the one pair of mill stones of 1.50 m diameter via a lantern pinion stone nut. The mill is winded by two sets of wooden <b>gears</b> in the <b>cap</b> engaging cogs on the curb. The gearing is operated by an endless rope running on a Y-wheel on the dust floor but can also be operated by an endless chain from outside the mill or powered by an electric motor. The cap rests on a live curb with flanged cast iron rollers and is covered by wood shingles.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, the masonry tower mill, on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more {{expensive}} to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or <b>gearing</b> inside the <b>cap</b> or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, {{at the rear of the}} windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.|$|R
50|$|The Grafelijke korenmolen van Zeddam is a five storey brick tower mill. The {{parallel}} walls {{are up to}} 2.8 m thick at the base. A 3.8 m high mound was thrown up around the mill for the miller to reach the sails. In the old situation the internal space at ground level was unused and the only entrance into the mill was at the current hoisting floor, only reachable by an outside staircase. In 1839 two extra floors were built into the mill body to house an extra millstone and a ground floor entrance and internal staircase built. The mill is winded by two sets of wooden <b>gears</b> in the <b>cap</b> engaging cogs on the curb. The gearing is powered by an endless rope running on a Y-wheel. The roofing felt covered cap rests on a live curb with flanged cast iron rollers.The four common sails have a span of 26.2 m. They are carried on a cast-iron windshaft cast by Enthoven & Co as number 0286 in 1861 {{though it was only}} fitted in the mill 1888 after the former wooden axle broke. As the cast iron shaft was to short it was partly encased in the remainder of the wooden shaft. The windshaft carries the brake wheel which drives the wallower {{at the top of the}} upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives the two pairs of mill stones of 1.60 m diameter via two lantern pinion stone nuts.|$|R
