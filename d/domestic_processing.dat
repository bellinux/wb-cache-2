50|$|Cashew {{production}} in Tanzania began {{towards the end}} of the British trusteeship of Tanganyika in the 1950s. In 2012, Tanzania was the world's eighth largest producer of cashews and the fourth largest in Africa. Poor regulation and lack of reliable payments to farmers has plagued production. Cashew mainly grows in the southern regions of the country such as Mtwara and Lindi, and more than 90 percent of the nuts are exported in raw form.

50|$|The e-waste {{disposal}} occurring after processing for reuse, {{repair of}} equipment, and recovery of metals may be unethical or illegal when e-scrap of many kinds is transported overseas {{to developing countries}} for such processing. It is transported as if to be repaired and/or recycled, but after processing the less valuable e-scrap becomes e-waste/pollution there. Another {{point of view is}} that the net environmental cost must be compared to and include the mining, refining and extraction with its waste and pollution cost of new products manufactured to replace secondary products which are routinely destroyed in wealthier nations, and which cannot economically be repaired in older or obsolete products. As an example of negative impacts of e-waste, pollution of groundwater has become so serious in areas surrounding China’s landfills that water must be shipped in from 18 mi away. However, mining of new metals can have even broader impacts on groundwater. Either thorough e-cycling processing, <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> or overseas repair, can help the environment by avoiding pollution. Such e-cycling can theoretically be a sustainable alternative to disposing of e-waste in landfills. In addition, e-cycling allows for the reclamation of potential conflict minerals, like gold and wolframite, which requires less of those to be mined and lessens the potential money flow to militias and other exploitative actors in third-world that profit from mining them.|$|E
40|$|Background: Preferences for sensory {{properties}} (e. g. {{taste and}} texture) {{are assumed to}} control cooking behaviour with respect to vegetables. Conditions such as the cooking method, amount of water used and the time-temperature profile determine the nutritional quality (e. g. vitamins and phytochemicals) of cooked vegetables. Information on <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> and any underlying motives {{can be used to}} inform consumers about cooking vegetables that are equally liked and are nutrient-rich. Methods: Two online self-reporting questionnaires were used to identify <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> conditions of broccoli and carrots by Dutch households. Questions on various aspects of <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> and consumer motives were included. Descriptive data analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed for both vegetables, separately, to group consumers with similar motives and behaviour towards vegetables. Results: Approximately 70 % of consumers boiled vegetables, 8 – 9 % steamed vegetables, 10 – 15 % stir fried raw vegetables and 8 – 10 % stir fried boiled vegetables. Mainly texture was used as a way to decide the ‘doneness’ of the vegetables. For both vegetables, three clusters of consumers were identified: texture-orientated, health-orientated, or taste-orientated. The texture-orientated consumers are identified as the most prevalent (56 – 59 %) group in the present study. Statistically significant associations are found between <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> conditions and clusters, whereas no such association are found between demographic details and clusters. Conclusions: A wide variation in <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> of broccoli and carrots is found in the present study. Mainly sensory properties (i. e. texture and taste) determined the <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> conditions. The findings of the present study can be used to optimise cooking to yield vegetables that meet consumer’s specific sensory preference and are higher in nutrients, and as well as to communicate with target consumer groups...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Chemical composition, {{bioavailability}} {{of minerals}} and in vitro digestibility of proteins in karkade seed (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) as affected by soaking, sprouting and cooking were studied. The different methods showed varied deviation of nutrients and antinutrients from the raw seeds. Sprouting and cooking significantly increased protein content and decreased starch and soluble carbohydrates levels. K, Na {{and all the}} trace elements studied were decreased by processing methods. Cooking was more effective in improving bioavailability of minerals studied than soaking or sprouting. Total polyphenols reduced more by cooking, while phytic acid did not change significantly by processing. In vitro protein digestibility was significantly reduced by all processing methods, with soaking gave {{the highest percentage of}} reduction and cooking the lowest percentage. The results also indicated that <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> methods changed total acidity and fat acidity as well as N solubility in water and 1 M NaCl. Amino acid profile of the karkade seed indicated that sulfur amino acids and threonine are the limiting amino acids. With respect to FAO pattern, considerable proportion of the essential amino acids were retained on processing, except for lysine on soaking and sprouting and sulfur acids on sprouting and cooking.

While the majority of the product is sold live for crawfish boils, approximately 15 %- 30 % of the domestic output has historically been processed for the tail meat. As a result of increasing competion from China, Lousiana processors filed an antidumping petition alleging that frozen tail meat product from China was being dumped resulting in material injury to the <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> industry. In the following year, the United States International Trade Commission found that dumped product from China was causing material injury to the <b>domestic</b> <b>processing</b> industry and large duties (generally in excess of 100 %), as determined by the U.

30|$|With the {{prevalence}} of processing trade, any measurement based on aggregate results, combining processing exports and other production, could highly overstate China’s economic benefits. Developing a framework to separate the production of Chinese processing exports from general exports so that the total domestic value added (short as DVA) from exports can be measured more accurately is therefore critical. Lau et al. (2006) developed a non-competitive input–output table that captures the Chinese processing trade (known as the DPN table). It differentiates input structures concerning production for <b>domestic</b> use, <b>processing</b> exports, and normal exports, facilitating the study of China’s exported DVA.
