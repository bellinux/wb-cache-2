40|$|Temporary {{disruption}} of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after cerebral angiography is presumably caused by nonionic radiographic contrast medium (CM). We hereby report a case of 58 -year-old woman who developed decreased mentality, global aphasia and aggravated right hemiparesis after cerebral angiography. Brain CT examination demonstrated <b>gyriform</b> enhancement throughout the left cerebral cortex and thalamus. MR diffusion did not reveal acute infarction. MR angiography did not show any stenosis, spasm or occlusion at the major cerebral vessels. Follow-up CT scan after 1 day did not show any <b>gyriform</b> enhancement. Worsened neurologic signs and symptoms were improved completely after 7 days. In the present study, {{disruption of}} the BBB with contrast medium after angiography {{seems to be the}} causative factor of transient neurologic deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Three {{cases of}} Sturge &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;" Weber {{syndrome}} are being reported. All our cases had incomplete form of Sturge- Weber syndrome. They had cutaneous facial angiomas and leptomeningeal agiomas evidenced by {{central nervous system}} manifestations (seizures) and /or computerized axial tomography showing typical <b>gyriform</b> calcification. None of our cases had glaucoma. The cases are being reported for its rarity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Stroke-like {{migraine}} attacks after radiation therapy, or SMART syndrome, is characterised by migraine-like headache with {{or without}} aura, transient neurological dysfunction, including seizures, and <b>gyriform</b> enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which resolves {{over a period of}} weeks. Detailed neuropsychological characterisation in SMART syndrome is lacking and there are no published data on the course and pattern of neurocognitive recovery. Results: The acute clinical presentation was one of unstable, fluctuating neurocognitive disturbances, complicated b...|$|E
30|$|On MRI, DNET usually {{appear as}} multilobulated or <b>gyriform</b> cysts which {{are located in}} the cortex or in the cortex and {{subcortical}} white matter. The multilobulated cysts are characteristically hypointense on T 1 - and strongly hyperintense on T 2 W images. On FLAIR images, they have mixed signal intensity and often a peripheral rim of high signal intensity, the so-called “bright rim sign”, can be seen. Enhancement is seen in about 30 % of cases, calcifications in less than 20 %. Rarely, only a solitary large cyst is seen. Diffusion restriction is absent [30].|$|E
40|$|Wilson’s {{disease is}} a genetic {{movement}} disorder with characteristic clinical and imaging features. We report a 17 - year-old boy who presented with sialorrhea, hypophonic speech, paraparesis with repeated falls and recurrent seizures along with cognitive decline. He had bilateral Kayser Flescher rings. Other than the typical features of Wilson’s disease in cranial MRI, there were extensive white matter signal abnormalities (T 2 and FLAIR hyperintensities) and <b>gyriform</b> contrast enhancement which are rare imaging features in Wilson's disease. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose Wilson’s disease when atypical imaging features are present...|$|E
30|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the {{combination}} of progressive dementia and pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and/or cerebellar signs caused by a prion (proteinaceous particle without DNA or RNA but capable of causing infection). DWI MR has high diagnostic accuracy and is the most sensitive neuroimaging technique for striatal and cortical lesions from an early stage [65]. Typically, diffusion-weighted hyperintensity is progressive and persistent over many weeks, affecting the striatum and cortex. The <b>gyriform</b> DWI-hyperintense areas in the cerebral cortex (“cortical ribbon” sign) correlate {{to the location of}} periodic sharp-wave complexes on EEG [66]. DWI hyperintensity may resolve late in the disease.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSturge Weber {{syndrome}} is a neurocutaneous disorder, characterised by vascular malformation with capillary venous angiomas. Though it presents with vascular anomalies, association with vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation is rare. ReportA 2 -year-old girl presented with delayed developmental milestones, head enlargement and convulsions. Examination revealed an ill-looking child with head enlargement, hypotonia and bilateral blindness. Computed tomographic angiography revealed <b>gyriform</b> cerebral calcifications with vein of Galen aneurysmal dilatation, showing multiple feeding arteries. Findings were also corroborated by ultrasound. DiscussionThis experience underscores {{the value of}} imaging in revealing this complex angio-architecture, which is necessary in the diagnosis and management...|$|E
40|$|A {{rare case}} of Sturge-Weber {{syndrome}} without facial nevus and epileptic seizures is reported. The other cases of incomplete {{form of the}} disease {{reported in the literature}} showed occipital calcification and epileptic seizures without facial nevus, while in the present case also the convulsions were absent. The possible pathogenic mechanism is discussed. The CT findings of these incomplete forms include unilateral or often bilateral occipital calcifications with no evidence of contrast enhancement. The Authors conclude that the radiologic finding of bilateral <b>gyriform</b> calcifications in the occipital region must suggest the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber disease {{even in the absence of}} facial nevus and epileptic seizures...|$|E
40|$|Cortical laminar {{necrosis}} {{has been}} rarely observed in osmotic demyelination syndrome. We report a 32 -year-old female patient who became comatose after the rapid correction of hyponatremia. There were high signal intensities in the pons and bilateral deep gray nuclei on T 2 -weighted MRI images, and linear hyperintensities along the cerebral cortices on T 1 -weighted images with a diffuse <b>gyriform</b> enhancement. MR spectroscopic findings showed {{a decrease of}} the N-acetyl aspartate peak {{and an increase in}} those of the lipid and lactate complex. The case demonstrates that a severe form of osmotic demyelination syndrome accompanying cortical laminar necrosis can result from the rapid correction of hyponatremia...|$|E
40|$|Imaging of a 29 -year-old {{man with}} {{seizures}} showed a frontal lobe mass with curvilinear narrow calcifications, cystic components and multiple flow-voids. An AVM was considered. A DSA confirmed the hypervascular {{nature of the}} lesion. It was resected and microscopic examination showed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma remarkable for a diffuse and hypertrophic vasculature with areas of frank vascular proliferation. The marked vascularity seen on the MRI, the <b>gyriform</b> calcifications and the cystic degeneration are all features which can be encountered in an AVM. This case illustrates that highly vascular malignant gliomas can simulate vascular lesions by radiology and may require an angiogram for diagnosis. © 2012 International Society of Neuropathology...|$|E
40|$|Reversible Posterior Leucoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) is a {{disorder}} characterized by headaches, confusion, and/or decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and visual changes. A 58 -year-old female was found unresponsive, with generalized rigidity and uri-nary incontinence for unknown duration. On presentation, she was febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypertensive. Neurological exam showed increased muscle tone and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Brain MRI revealed <b>gyriform</b> edema and white matter hypodensi-ties in parieto-occipital regions consistent with RPLS. Discontinu-ation of duloxetine, {{one of her}} home medications, led to resolution of symptoms. We report this case to discuss the syndrome of RPLS and propose the role of duloxetine in causing hypertension and ce-rebral vasoconstriction leading to RPLS. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} reported case of RPLS resulting from the use of duloxetine...|$|E
40|$|Sturge-Weber {{syndrome}} (SWS) {{also called}} as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a sporadically occurring rare neuro-cutaneous syndrome, characterized by vascular malformation with capillary venous angiomas involving face, choroidal layer of eye globe and leptomeninges responsible for ophthamological {{as well as}} neurological signs and symptoms. Authors report an interesting case, a six year old girl, who presented with seizures, facial port wine stain and normal psychomotor development. CT scan showed left cerebral hemiatrophy, left frontal and parieto occipital calcification with cortical calcification in left high frontal convexity. Cranial MRI scan also confirmed finding of left cerebral hemiatrophy and also revealed presence of <b>gyriform</b> cortical calcification, prominent flow voids seen in left basal ganglia. Her seizure is well controlled with antiepileptic medication. The pertinent literature is reviewed and management of such cases is discussed briefly...|$|E
30|$|Our report {{emphasizes}} that unenhanced CT {{of the head}} is capable to detect CAE if performed directly after symptom onset. Immediate brain imaging is thus required to verify the diagnosis. However, the absence of intracerebral air on CT does not exclude the diagnosis (Muth and Shank 2000). MRI demonstrated cortical ischemia predominately in {{the territory of the}} right middle cerebral artery. The <b>gyriform</b> pattern of restricted diffusion has been observed in several cases of CAE previously (Caulfield et al. 2006; Verro 2010; Koster et al. 2012) and {{may be the result of}} end-arterial occlusion and endothelial damage by air bubbles (Sobolewski et al. 2012). Interestingly, these cortical DWI changes resemble laminar necrosis on MRI in patients with hypoxic brain injury. If this finding exhibits a diagnostic value of CAE in cases without detection of intracerebral air on CT remains unclear and should be evaluated in prospective studies.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To report 4 {{different}} neurological {{complications of}} H 1 N 1 virus vaccination. Method: Four patients (9, 16, 37 and 69 years of age) had neurological symptoms (intracranial hypertension, ataxia, left peripheral facial palsy of abrupt onset, altered mental status, myelitis) starting 4 - 15 days after H 1 N 1 vaccination. MRI was obtained during the acute period. Results: One patient with high T 2 signal in the cerebellum interpreted as acute cerebellitis; another, with left facial palsy, showed contrast enhancement within both internal auditory canals was present, however {{it was more}} important in the right side; one patient showed <b>gyriform</b> hyperintensities on FLAIR with sulcal effacement in the right fronto-parietal region; and the last one showed findings compatible with thoracic myelitis. Conclusion: H 1 N 1 vaccination can result in important neurological complications probably secondary to post-vaccination inflammation. MRI detected abnormalities in all patients...|$|E
40|$|High signal in the {{cerebral}} cortex and/or basal ganglia on diffusion-weighted {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (DW-MRI) {{has been described as}} a good diagnostic marker for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). We report a case of sCJD with atypical clinical evolution and unusual DW-MRI findings. A 53 -year-old man was seen with a 2 -year history of a rapidly progressive dementia and cerebellar ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, including the test for 14 - 3 - 3 protein, was normal. EEG did not show periodic activity. However, DW-MRI showed <b>gyriform</b> hyperintensity involving practically the entire cortical ribbon of the left hemisphere, whilst being limited to the posterior cingulate gyrus in the right hemisphere. DNA analysis showed no mutations or insertions in the prion protein gene, and homozigozity for methionine in codon 129. A subsequent brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CJD. Thus, high signal on DW-MRI may be limited to {{the cerebral}} cortex and may present a very asymmetric distribution in sCJD...|$|E
30|$|Markers {{of small}} vessel disease have become {{increasingly}} important {{for the evaluation of}} patients with dementia, and have been suggested to have a contributory as well as a causative role in the neurodegenerative disease process. The “standards for research into small vessel disease” were established in 2013 summarizing the scales and criteria and proposing a terminology {{to be used in the}} realm of small vessel disease imaging. Important small vessel disease markers are: 1. Cerebral microbleeds, seen as punctate foci of hypointensity on susceptibility sensitive sequences. The location of cerebral microbleeds is also of importance to mention in reports as deep bleeds represent underlying hypertensive arteriopathy, and lobar cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 2. Cortical superficial siderosis implies <b>gyriform</b> linear hypointensities that have been suggested to be a sensitive markers of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. 3. Lacunes and recent small subcortical infarcts are other terms that preferably should be used depending on imaging manifestations. Although white matter changes are part of the small vessel disease spectrum, they are discussed separately above.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: We {{retrospectively}} reviewed {{clinical and}} imaging findings in 11 patients with stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy (SMART) syndrome {{to better understand}} this disorder previously thought to be reversible. Six men and 5 women had complex bouts of neurologic impairment beginning, on average, 20 years after cerebral irradiation. All had characteristic, unilateral <b>gyriform</b> enhancement onMR imaging that developedwithin 2 – 7 days and typically resolved in 2 – 5 weeks. Unlike prior reports, 45 % had incomplete neurologic recovery manifesting as dysphasia, cognitive impairment, or hemiparesis. The remaining 55 % recovered completely over an average of 2 months. Three of 11 patients developed cortical laminar necrosis. Brain biopsies in 4 of 11 did not demonstrate a specific pathologic substrate. These additional 11 patients contribute {{to the understanding of}} variability in stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy syndrome, which often but not uniformly manifests with headaches and seizures, demonstrates a typical evolution of imaging findings, and may result in permanent neurologic and imaging sequelae.
