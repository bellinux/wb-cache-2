A pump-probe set-up employing femtosecond lasers was established and modeling efforts were initialized. Tromborg led the effort to identify this as a topic that would remain important for many years and argued that Denmark should work to lead in the field. He also proposed theoretical methods that could be used to estimate the size of these ultrafast dynamical effects and their role in understanding the origin of nonlinear <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> in semiconductor lasers.|$|E

At very low power, the ratio of the powers of the CW and CCW modes depends mainly on the ratio of the coupling constants, while at high power <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> is dominant and the ratio of the powers depends on the ratio of the <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> and the weakest coupling coefficient.

40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} of the second-order harmonic distortion in the amplitude modulation-response of Fabry-Perot and distributed feedback lasers are presented {{and the influence}} of several nonlinerities, such as longitudinal spatial hole burning, <b>gain</b> <b>suppression,</b> and relaxation oscillations is considered in detail. Our analysis is valid for modulation frequencies ranging from a few megahertz to well beyond the resonance frequency of the relaxation oscillation. The numerical calculation of the distortion is based on the laser model CLADISS [1] and consists of an extended small signal solution (up to second-order) of the set of coupled wave equations and the local carrier density rate equations. The distortion is investigated for Fabry-Perot lasers for which the effects of spontaneous emission and <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> can be clearly illustrated and for DFB lasers where the emphasis is on the influence of spatial hole burning and its combination with other nonlinearities.

30|$|Figure 11 b {{shows the}} target <b>suppression</b> <b>gain</b> {{for the three}} BMs. As the DSB is only {{dependent}} on the target direction and the target source-array distance, the target <b>suppression</b> <b>gain</b> of the DSB for scenarios 2 to 4 {{is the same as}} for scenario 1. We simulate the ideal ABM by adapting the BM filter in a single-source scenario, i.e., scenario 1. Therefore, the performance of the ideal ABM is only shown for this scenario. It can be seen that in a single-source scenario, the target <b>suppression</b> <b>gain</b> of an ideal ABM is only slightly higher than Directional BSS, which indicates that in a single-source scenario, Directional BSS can reach to the upper limit. For scenarios 2 to 4, the target <b>suppression</b> <b>gain</b> of Directional BSS degrades but is always over 10 dB and clearly superior compared to the DSB. In Figure 11 c, the NSEDirBSS and NSEidealABM are shown. For scenario 1, where only the target source is active, the NSEs of the both BMs are very close and very low, which indicates that in a single-source scenario, the estimated RTFs are very close to the true RTF. With an increased number of sources or with more complicated acoustical conditions (higher reverberation time and larger source-array distance), it is more difficult to estimate the RTF. We can see that NSEDirBSS increases and the target <b>suppression</b> <b>gain</b> degrades. However, even in such complex scenarios, Directional BSS can produce an acceptable estimate of the RTF without any source activity detection. In the latest work [53], more evaluation results for comparing the estimated RTFs with the true RTFs are shown. The performance of Directional BSS is somewhat dependent on the signal characteristics (stationary or nonstationary, speech signal or white noise) of the involved sources. The energy of a white noise is distributed over full band while the energy of speech-like sources is usually limited to low frequencies. Besides, nonstationary sources make the adaptation of Directional BSS difficult as it needs to catch the variation of the signals within short frames. Therefore, different signal characteristics will lead to different results.|$|R

A higher target <b>suppression</b> <b>gain</b> indicates a higher blocking performance for the signal from the target source direction. This measure {{is very similar to}} the ‘signal blocking factor’ used in [52]. We compare the target suppression performance with (1) the DSB and (2) a simulated ideal ABM, where one microphone channel is simply adaptively subtracted with a LMS-type algorithm from the other. For this simulation, an ideal case is assumed, i.e., the microphone signal contains only the target signal. The simulated ABM can be regarded as an ideal version (in a supervised case) of a conventional ABM using an LMS algorithm as proposed in [23, 24].|$|R

40|$|Three mode {{parametric}} instability {{has been}} predicted in Advanced gravitational wave detectors. Here we present the first observation {{of this phenomenon}} {{in a large scale}} suspended optical cavity designed to be comparable to those of advanced gravitational wave detectors. Our results show that previous modelling assumptions that transverse optical modes are stable in frequency except for frequency drifts on a thermal deformation time scale is unlikely to be valid for suspended mass optical cavities. We demonstrate that mirror figure errors cause a dependence of transverse mode offset frequency on spot position. Combined with low frequency residual motion of suspended mirrors, this leads to transverse mode frequency modulation which suppresses the effective parametric gain. We show that this <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> mechanism can be enhanced by laser spot dithering or fast thermal modulation. Using Advanced LIGO test mass data and thermal modelling we show that <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> factors of 10 - 20 could be achieved for individual modes, sufficient to greatly ameliorate the parametric instability problem...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the past}} few decades, science has progressed towards the ability to probe many {{extremely}} fast processes and {{a large amount of}} research has been aimed at the area of few-femtosecond pulse generation. This thesis describes the generation of coherent broadband radiation through two-colour pumping of molecular hydrogen confined to a unidirectional ring cavity, and the subsequent synthesis of high peak power and few-femtosecond pulses. A set of normalised semi-classical field equations are derived in Bloch form describing the process of ultra-broadband multi-frequency Raman generation or UMRG, and a 3 -wave <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> analysis is derived from a subset of the plane wave UMRG field equations which describes <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> within the ring cavity in terms of both medium and cavity parameters. The <b>gain</b> <b>suppression</b> analysis is further generalised to include finite levels of linear two-photon frequency detuning of the pump beams. Simulations of the plane wave ultra-broadband multi-frequency Raman (UMRG) equations show that a broad frequency spectrum of mutually coherent sideband can be generated. The inverse Fourier transform of spectra generated in this way yields a train of high power near Fourier limited pulses in the time domain which can range from a few-femtoseconds in duration to tens of attoseconds with repetition rates equal to the Raman transition frequency. Pulses synthesised in this way are limited only by the level of medium dispersion, the reflection bandwidth of the chosen coupling mirror and the chosen Raman medium. Simulations of the transverse UMRG equations within the ring cavity geometry have shown ring cavity enhanced UMRG to be resilient to transverse effects such as finite beam width, beam diffraction and the transverse beam separation of the applied pump beams...|$|E

40|$|White pixel {{noise is}} widely used to {{estimate}} the level of internal noise in a system by injecting external variance into the detecting mechanism. Recent work (Baker & Meese, 2012, J Vis, 12 (10) : 20) has provided psychophysical evidence that such noise masks might also cause suppression that could invalidate estimates of internal noise. Here we measure neural population responses directly, using steady-state visual evoked potentials, elicited by target stimuli embedded in different mask types. Sinusoidal target gratings of 1 c/deg flickered at 5 Hz, and were shown in isolation, or with superimposed orthogonal grating masks or 2 D white noise masks, flickering at 7 Hz. Compared with responses to a blank screen, the Fourier amplitude at the target frequency increased monotonically {{as a function of}} target contrast when no mask was present. Both orthogonal and white noise masks caused rightward shifts of the contrast response function, providing evidence of contrast <b>gain</b> control <b>suppression.</b> We also calculated within-observer amplitude variance across trials. This increased in proportion to the target response, implying signal-dependent (i. e. multiplicative) noise at the system level, the implications of which we discuss for behavioural tasks. This measure of variance was reduced by both mask types, consistent with the changes in mean target response. An alternative variety of noise, which we term zero-dimensional noise, involves trial-by-trial jittering of the target contrast. This type of noise produced no <b>gain</b> control <b>suppression,</b> and increased the amplitude variance across trials...|$|R

Using as the reporter gene a mutant SUP 4 -o tRNA gene that in one case terminates prematurely {{and in the other}} case fails to terminate, we screened mutagenized RET 1 libraries for reduced and increased transcription termination, respectively. The <b>gain</b> in <b>suppression</b> phenotype was in both cases scored as a reduction in the accumulation of red pigment in yeast strains harboring the ade 2 - 1 ochre mutation. Termination-altering mutations were obtained in regions of the RET 1 gene encoding amino acids 300 to 325, 455 to 486, 487 to 521, and 1061 to 1082 of the protein. In degree of amino acid sequence conservation, these range from highly variable in the first to highly conserved in the last two regions. Residues 300 to 325 yielded mainly reduced-termination mutants, while in region 1061 to 1082, increased-termination mutants were obtained exclusively. All mutants recovered, while causing <b>gain</b> of <b>suppression</b> with one SUP 4 allele, brought about a reduction in suppression with the other allele, thus confirming that the phenotype is due to altered termination rather than an elevated level of transcription initiation.
