On a self-discovery trip {{in the middle of}} the first season, Brother Justin has an elaborate vision of two Russian <b>immigrant</b> <b>children,</b> Irina and her younger brother Alexei; Irina talks of her evil father. As revealed shortly afterwards, this vision is a repressed memory of Brother Justin of him and Iris as the only survivors of a train accident which also cost their mother's life.

5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned <b>immigrant</b> <b>children</b> in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} on child poverty has focused {{heavily on the}} roles of family structure and, to a lesser extent, parental work patterns to explain trends over time and differences across groups. However, <b>immigrant</b> <b>child</b> poverty has increased significantly {{over the past three}} decades even though labor force participation is high among immigrants and immigrant families are likely to be headed by a married couple. We document the levels and determinants of child poverty trends among <b>children</b> of <b>immigrants</b> and <b>children</b> of natives from 1970 through 2000. We find that much of the increase in <b>immigrant</b> <b>child</b> poverty can be linked to changing conditions in the U.
