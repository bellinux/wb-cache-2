Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys {{the set of the}} film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour {{deadline}} to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E

The Shipping Articles show all 40 crew members had enlisted {{on the day of}} her departure from Melbourne, February 18, 1865. However, nineteen of Waddell's crew deserted at Melbourne, some giving statements of their service to the United States Consul.|$|E

After a voyage which took her to Guantanamo Bay and Havana, Cuba, {{as well as through}} the Panama Canal, she arrived in her new home port—Long Beach, Calif.—on 28 January 1955. Between January 1955 and December 1957, the destroyer alternated three deployments to the western Pacific with operations out of Long Beach along the western coast of the United States. During each of her tours of duty with the 7th Fleet, Watts divided her time between escort duty with the carriers of TF77 and assignments with the Taiwan Strait patrol. Overhauls, type training, and refresher training <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> schedule when she returned to the west coast.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E
25|$|Kenny <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> {{final years}} with {{journeys}} in America, Europe and Australia {{in an effort}} to gain further acceptance of her method. She had also developed many methods for treating some serious illness. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, she returned home to Toowoomba in 1951, where she died on 30 November 1952 at her home Straun in Toowoomba after four days in a coma following a cerebral thrombosis. In a desperate attempt to save her life, Dr Irving Innerfield of New York sent his new experimental drug Trypsin by air mail, with the plane delayed so the drug package could be boarded, to Brisbane, where over 500 people waited for its arrival, after which it was then rushed by car to Toowoomba. Although the drug was administered on 29 November 1952, her doctor believed Kenny was too close to death to benefit from it, and she died the following day.|$|E

25|$|At {{one point}} in the comics an unrevealed god goes into the past and slaughters the {{majority}} of the world's Amazons, including Artemis. In this new timeline the trinity goddess The Morrígan revive Artemis from death, claiming her {{to be one of the}} Hysminai. The waters of the Underworld provided the following: Acheron cleased the pain of death, Cocytus aided lamentation, Phlegethon burned away all love, Lethe wiped all memories, and Styx <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> spirit with hate. She is then said to be an avatar to the dark goddess Alecto, and is sent by the goddesses to find the remaining Amazons and their princess in order to seek revenge for leaving her body on the battlefield. After several skirmishes, Diana is eventually able to remove the war goddesses' influence on Artemis by using the Lasso of Truth. Once this happens, Artemis resumes her place as one of Diana's Amazon subjects. She ultimately dies against her former goddesses defending Diana.|$|E

On this day, as she was heading down a steep mountainside—a route she had taken several times before—she lost control of her skis. She fell headfirst onto a layer of ice on a frozen stream near a waterfall, landing on her back. A hole opened up in the ice and Bågenholm's head and torso were pulled in as meltwater <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> clothes. Her body became trapped under the ice, which was [...] thick. When Falkenberg and Næsheim found Bågenholm, only her feet and skis were above the ice.|$|E

[...] Her father photographed Fawe Park and Potter probably used his photographs (or her own) as an aid in her work. The picture of Old Mr. Bunny attacking the cat did not satisfy her publisher, and she redrew it as she did the picture of Benjamin and Peter standing on the garden wall. In Peter Rabbit, Mr. McGregor's garden was in Perthshire, but in Benjamin Bunny, the rabbit clan and the garden setting were moved to the Lake District, where they remained for The Tale of Mr. Tod, the final book of the Peter Rabbit saga.|$|E
500|$|Gauguin {{depicts the}} Oviri figure {{in at least}} one drawing, two {{watercolor}} transfer monotypes and two woodcuts. It is possible that the woodcuts were created in Pont-Aven in the summer of 1894; before the ceramic. The last to appear is probably the drawing in what is apparently the first issue of Gauguin's Papeete broadsheet Le Sourire [...] "(The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)" [...] published between August 1899 and April 1900. It was accompanied by the inscription [...] "Et le monstre, entraînant sa créature, féconde de sa semence des flancs généreux pour engendrer Séraphitus-Séraphita" [...] (And the monster, embracing its creation, <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus-Séraphita). Séraphitus-Séraphita is an allusion to Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta which features an androgynous hero. In this first issue of Le Sourire, he reviewed a local Maohi author's play by that dealt with incest (among other themes), and invokes 'Séraphitus-Séraphita'. The review congratulated the play's [...] "savage author" [...] and ended with a plea for women's liberation through the abolition of marriage. The accompanying drawing is distinctly androgynous.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} she was cast as Lana, Kreuk had no idea who the {{character}} was in Superman lore. Her uncle, who owned a comic book shop, <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> in on the details and she learned more from the producers. Kreuk realized that the character in the comics and her character on the show were two different people. As a result, Kreuk learns about the development of Lana as Lana is learning in the show, just as Welling does with Clark Kent. When asked if her being cast as a traditionally red haired character caused outcry from fans, Kreuk believes that whoever did [...] "got over it pretty fast". By season three, Kreuk had decided to [...] "invest" [...] herself less in her character, as she felt that her character's ultimate development was entirely {{in the hands of the}} producers. She no longer became frustrated when the producers had Lana doing things that Kreuk felt were out of character, instead trusting that they would find the right direction for the character.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Imogen became seriously ill {{with what she}} {{described}} as [...] "a coronary angina". Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she [...] " [...] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder". [...] Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> days, making twenty-four hours contain {{what most of us}} need twice that time to do".|$|E
500|$|The {{youngest}} {{sister of}} the [...] "precious Jackson clan", Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael {{and the rest of}} the Jackson family.

[...] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, [...] "or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a [...] "superstar" [...] in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while [...] "successfully [...] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult." [...] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the [...] "Queen of Pop". Klein argued that [...] "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.".|$|E
