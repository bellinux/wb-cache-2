5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> turned upside down.|$|E

Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University).

25|$|Bismarck's {{government}} had to submit three draft bills before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> one passed by the Reichstag in 1884. Bismarck had originally proposed {{that the federal government}} pay a portion of the accident insurance contribution. Bismarck wanted to demonstrate the willingness of the German government to reduce the hardship experienced by the German workers so as to wean them away from supporting the various left-wing parties, most importantly the Social Democrats. The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of State Socialism, against which they were dead set. The Centre Party was afraid of the expansion of federal power at the expense of states' rights.|$|E

500|$|Met by an {{audience}} largely {{unaware of the}} Daddies' eclectic background, Soul Caddy was received negatively by both fans and critics, {{one of the more}} prevalent criticisms being its lack of swing tracks. Many reviewers chastised the band for what was being seen as an abandonment of their swing [...] "roots" [...] in favor of a trendier sound, while some criticized the Daddies' entire musical aesthetic — UGO's Hip Online stated bluntly, [...] "covering five or six genres on one album is just insane". The Los Angeles Daily News placed Soul Caddy on their list of the 10 worst albums of 2000, the reviewer wondering what made a swing band [...] "think <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away with an album of recycled psychedelic pop".|$|E

[...] In October 1906 Cornwall sold the ARC's charter to a syndicate of Winnipegers for $2,500 and a one-sixth share in the syndicate. [...] The syndicate costed out the construction of the railway, and found that cost per mile would be $13,700 from Edmonton to Lac la Biche, and one thousand dollars per mile more from Lac la Biche to Fort McMurray.

[...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy.

500|$|Another {{preliminary}} {{match was}} between the Raw and SmackDown! brands. The feud began on the October 3 episode of Raw, in which WWE Chairman Vince McMahon wanted a match between SmackDown! wrestlers on the program. A match was scheduled, but before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> underway, Eric Bischoff announced that McMahon had left the arena, thus leaving himself in charge. Seeing SmackDown! as inferior, Bischoff stopped the match by turning off the lights and going to a commercial break. At {{the end of the}} broadcast, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long, led SmackDown! superstars to the ring, and they fought with Raw superstars. On the October 17 episode of Raw, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield's (JBL) (SmackDown!) entrance music played during Edge's (Raw) match, the distraction caused Edge to lose the match. As part of the storyline, Edge and Chris Masters showed up to the SmackDown! program on the October 21 episode, in which they interfered in a match between JBL and Rey Mysterio, where they assaulted Mysterio. On the October 24 episode of Raw, a match was made between Edge and Masters, and two of five SmackDown! superstars chosen by the fans, and Mysterio attacked Edge from behind. The following week, Bischoff invited Mysterio to the Raw program to take the Master Lock Challenge, a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Masters' swinging full nelson submission hold, which he calls the Master Lock. Mysterio, however, attacked Masters instead, which caused Bischoff to call for other Raw superstars. Long called for SmackDown! superstars, and they fought until the Raw roster retreated.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time {{took a more}} {{negative}} stance. He wrote that [...] "The Purple Piano Project" [...] "was not a particularly good episode of Glee", one which was hindered by the vast number of central characters, [...] "but it did at least suggest where the third season of the show could find its strong core stories, and also ... the numerous ways in which <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> sidetracked into tangential ridiculousness." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "D+". He summarised it as [...] "a handful of okay performances, one or two pretty good lines, and then {{a whole bunch of}} awful". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman praised the episode's humor and plot development, but commented that it [...] "didn't hit any of the emotional notes Glee is capable of." [...] Robert Canning of IGN rated it an [...] "okay" [...] 6.5 out of 10. He too found [...] "there were still quite a few laughs to be had", but felt the episode suffered from its repetitiveness, as Sue's hatred of the glee club and New Directions' recruitment problems have been thoroughly explored before. The Dallas Morning News Samantha Urban noted that Murphy failed to deliver on his promise to increase Mercedes and Tina's roles, and couldn't accept that Sue would be allowed to promote her congressional campaign on her local news commentary spot, but overall was [...] "pretty impressed" [...] with what she called [...] "a solid episode of Glee that made [...] feel cautiously optimistic about the season ahead."

50|$|The {{sex abuse}} {{scandal in the}} Catholic Church broke into the public’s {{awareness}} with the well-known work of the Boston Globe reporters in 2002. Kennedy, who felt a deep love for the church, outlined two pathways for the church leadership to address the issue: 1) to develop a healthy sense of sexuality within the clergy and 2) to replace the current hierarchical structure that was unhealthy, unaccountable, and authoritarian with a healthy, accountable, authority structure. He felt that until the church was able to <b>get</b> sexuality right, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> humanity right and if humanity isn’t right, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> right the sacramental life of the Church which is its window into the mystery of God.|$|R

The team [...] "undersold" [...] the game to Electronic Arts, and James Sterrett of the fansite Through the Looking Glass believed that the team [...] "gambled that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the game out the door faster than the budget actually called for". In March 1999, the game was announced as the World War II-themed Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe, directed by Hantzopoulos and scheduled for release in fall of that year. That May, the game was shown at the Electronic Arts booth at E3. Computer Games Magazines Steve Udell wrote that the game would feature a new iteration of the Flight Unlimited terrain renderer, and IGN reported that one million square miles of terrain based on European landscapes would be available. Weather conditions such as snow and rain were planned. Udell wrote that Flight Combats flight physics were {{an updated version of}} those from recent Flight Unlimited games, with new material taken from operations manuals and flight tests. Plane models and textures were based on photographs, and many of the moving parts and flight control surfaces were modeled individually. Players were given the option to customize planes. Udell described a physics-based damage system that, according to the company, made it impossible to [...] "see the exact same kind of damage twice". Two campaigns—the Battle of Britain and the Defence of the Reich—were announced, with missions based on dogfights, air-to-ground combat and bombing runs. Looking Glass claimed that the game would feature [...] "moving tanks and ships duk it out on a dynamic battlefield" [...] as the player carried out missions. Aesthetically, IGN's Tal Blevins noted that the game had [...] "a very distinct 40s charm", which was present [...] "from the briefings to the options screens".|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Judge Me" [...] is a midtempo ballad {{that runs}} {{for three minutes}} and fifteen seconds, with {{instrumentation}} provided by drums.

Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him [...] "for his past indiscretions" [...] and [...] "move on with the future." [...] In the song, Brown encourages his lover {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, [...] "You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what they saying / Because most of it is true / But it was all before I fell for you." [...] He later declares [...] "that he is a changed man who can now be trusted" [...] as shown in the lines, [...] "Take me as I am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / The one that you can trust." [...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> ugly / before it gets beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna [...] "may be the inspiration" [...] for the lyrics.
