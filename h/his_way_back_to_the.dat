5|$|After the Internationals broke up, Costello {{returned}} to Australia to visit {{friends and relatives}} and to recuperate after many years on the road. On <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, Costello had a stop over in Detroit, Michigan, where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together {{for the rest of}} Costello’s life.|$|E
5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying a}} child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E
5|$|Ico awakens {{below the}} castle and makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After {{discovering}} that Yorda {{has been turned}} to stone by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight {{and at the end}} of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen's death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby.|$|E

5|$|Murat and Kellermann {{immediately}} {{pounced on}} the supporting Liechtenstein Dragoons who were {{too slow to}} respond and routed them as well. The fleeing Austrian horsemen crashed {{into the ranks of}} Pilatti's rattled troopers and carried them away. As the mob of terrified cavalry stampeded past them, the exhausted Austrian infantry of the main body lost heart, provoking a wild rush to the rear. The gun teams fled, pursued by French cavalry, while their whole infantry line advanced westward. The second grenadier brigade under GM Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed Boudet’s advance long enough for O’Reilly’s cavalry to return, and together with Frimont, they mounted a last defense around Marengo village as night fell, allowing the Austrian centre to reach safety behind the Bormida. Ott with the Austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through Castel Ceriolo blocked by French troops advancing northwest from the centre, but managed to fight <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bormida bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|After {{fighting}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} temple, Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, whom Ryu defeats. While dying, Malth {{reveals that}} {{he was the one who}} dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive and that Ryu will meet him as he presses onward. When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers that his father was not killed but was instead possessed by an evil figure. He destroys the evil figure, which releases Ken from its hold. Jaquio, enraged from Ken's release from the possession, shows himself; he immediately tries to kill Ryu with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Jaquio is killed during the ensuing fight by Ryu, but then a lunar eclipse occurs, causing the demon statues to transform into Jashin. After Ryu defeats the demon, Ken tells him he does not have much longer to live due to Jaquio's attack. He tells Ryu to leave him behind in the temple while it collapses and to take the young woman with him. Afterwards, Foster, communicating via satellite, orders the girl to kill Ryu and steal the demon statues; she chooses to be with Ryu instead of carrying out the order. The two kiss, and the girl tells Ryu her name, Irene Lew; the two watch as the sun rises.|$|E
5|$|Brannan {{was born}} in Saco, Maine, to Thomas and Sarah Emery Brannan. Because of {{problems}} with his abusive father, when he was fourteen years old Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio. It was there that Brannan learned the printer's trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan's brother-in-law bought {{a copy of the}} Book of Mormon from these street corner missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father's death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest in a patch of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment and hoping to get rich because of said investment, the market crashed and his land was worthless. He made a quick visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI {{was ordered}} {{to hold the line}} of the Sambre river. De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then {{made his way to the}} Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E
5|$|Valckenier {{had asked}} to be {{replaced}} late in 1740, and in February 1741 had received a reply instructing him to appoint van Imhoff as his successor; an alternative account indicates that the Lords XVII informed {{him that he was}} to be replaced by van Imhoff as punishment for exporting too much sugar and too little coffee in 1739 and thus causing large financial losses. By the time Valckenier received the reply, van Imhoff was already on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Valckenier left the Indies on 6 November 1741, after appointing a temporary successor, Johannes Thedens. Taking command of a fleet, Valckenier headed for the Netherlands. On 25 January 1742 he arrived in Cape Town but was detained, and investigated by governor Hendrik Swellengrebel by order of the Lords XVII. In August 1742 Valckenier was sent back to Batavia, where he was imprisoned in Fort Batavia and, three months later, tried on several charges, including his involvement in the massacre. In March 1744 he was convicted and condemned to death, and all his belongings were confiscated. In December 1744 the trial was reopened when Valckenier gave a lengthy statement to defend himself. Valckenier asked for more evidence from the Netherlands, but died in his prison cell on 20 June 1751, before the investigation was completed. The death penalty was rescinded posthumously in 1755. Vermeulen characterises the investigation as unfair and fuelled by popular outrage in the Netherlands, and arguably this was officially recognised because in 1760 Valckenier's son, Adriaan Isaäk Valckenier, received reparations totalling 725,000 gulden.|$|E

25|$|By 1904, Stieglitz {{was again}} mentally and {{physically}} exhausted and decided to take his family to Europe in May.
