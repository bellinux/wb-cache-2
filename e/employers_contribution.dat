40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{theoretical and}} empirical analyses of some effects of changes in payroll taxes. First, the implication of the standard partial equilibrium analysis is explored in Section II. In particular, the relationship between statutory and economic incidence are clarified and the textbook neutrality conventionally taken for granted is shown {{to be subject to}} strong qualifications. It is demonstrated that the wage and employment effects of a one percentage point increase in the <b>employers</b> <b>contribution</b> generally will differ from the effects of an increase by one percentage point of the employees ' tax rate. Given the institutional features of the U. S. income and payroll tax systems, the theoretical results imply that a given increase in the employees' payroll tax rate will induce greater employment reductions (and greater increases in wage costs) than an increase in the employers part of the tax. This non-neutrality, however, does not prevail when the incidence of incremental payroll tax changes is analyzed; labor's net income loss per tax dollar is exactly the same in the two policy alternatives...|$|E
50|$|As of 2013, {{the most}} common {{matching}} program increased to 100% of the first 6%.This program states that once the employee contributes 6% of their gross pay, the <b>employer’s</b> <b>contributions</b> stop until the following year. If the employee contributes less than 6% of their gross income, the employee foregoes additional compensation from the employer available to them had they contributed up to the 6% limit. For example, an employee whose annual gross pay is $50,000 contributes $3,000 (6% of gross pay) would receive a $3,000 <b>employer</b> <b>contribution.</b> If the employee contributed more than $3,000 the employee would not receive additional <b>employer</b> <b>contributions.</b> If the employee only contributed $2,000 (4% of gross pay), they would only receive a $2,000 <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> leaving $1,000 of potential <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> on the table.|$|R

40|$|Social {{security}} {{contributions in}} most countries are split between employers and employees. According to standard incidence analysis, social security contributions affect employment negatively, but it is irrelevant how they are divided between employers and employees. This paper considers the possibility that: (i) workers perceive a linkage between current contributions and future benefits and, (ii) they discount <b>employers</b> <b>contributions</b> more heavily, as they are less “visible”. Under these assumptions, I find that <b>employer</b> <b>contributions</b> have a stronger (negative) effect on employment than employee contributions. Furthermore, a change in how contributions are divided that reduces the share of employers is beneficial for employment. Finally, making <b>employers</b> <b>contributions</b> more visible to workers also has {{a positive effect on}} employment. Payroll tax, social security, tax incidence, tax visibility...|$|R

30|$|In 1980 a new reform contributed {{significantly}} to increase the system’s deficit, with the elimination of <b>employer</b> <b>contributions,</b> and its replacement with resources {{from the collection of}} the value added tax. The growing of informal employment, evasion, and the greater maturity of the system led to the primary deficit to reach 60  % of total expenditures. This meant that in the eighties the system was almost near the collapse, which meant the need for the reintroduction of <b>employer</b> <b>contributions.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{employee}} participation and contribution incentives among de®ned contribution retirement plans. Using data from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, probit and tobit analysis indicates no signi®cant relationship between <b>employer</b> <b>contributions</b> and an employee's decision to make contributions into his or her retirement plan. However, of those employees who are contributing to their pension plans, the <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> percentage has a signi®cant positive effect on employee contribution rates. Therefore, the ®ndings support our hypothesis of a direct relationship between the average employee deferral percentage and the existence of an <b>employer</b> matching <b>contribution.</b> # 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

50|$|When the CPF {{was started}} in 1955, both {{employees}} and employers contributed 5% of an employee's pay to the scheme. The rate of contribution was progressively increased along {{with the growth of}} Singapore's economy, reaching 25% for both employers and employees in 1985. The principle of equal contribution was abandoned in 1986 due to a sharp recession, when the <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> was cut to 10% of an employee's pay {{in an effort to keep}} Singapore attractive to business. The <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> rate reverted to the same level as the employee rate until the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis, when the rate for employers was again lowered to 10% for workers 55 years or younger. Since then, the <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> rate has been gradually increased, with ongoing economic problems blamed for postponing the reinstatement of the original principle of equal <b>contribution.</b> <b>Employers</b> currently contribute 3 fewer percentage points of salaries over S$750 for employees up to 55 years old.|$|R
