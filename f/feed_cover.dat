60|$|We cannot {{part with}} our friends. We cannot let our angels go. We {{do not see}} that they only go out that archangels may come in. We are idolaters of the old. We {{do not believe in}} the riches of the soul, in its proper eternity and omnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in to-day to rival or {{recreate}} that beautiful yesterday. We linger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can <b>feed,</b> <b>cover,</b> and nerve us again. We cannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit and weep in vain. The voice of the Almighty saith, 'Up and onward for evermore!' We cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will we rely on the new; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those monsters who look backwards.|$|E

50|$|Loading the M240 {{can be done}} {{either with}} the bolt forward or to the rear. If the bolt is to remain forward, the {{operator}} will then load the rounds into the feeding block (<b>feed</b> tray <b>cover</b> closed); or will open the <b>feed</b> tray <b>cover,</b> load the rounds onto the feeding tray, then close the <b>feed</b> tray <b>cover.</b> The charging handle will then be pulled to the rear, which locks the bolt to the rear. The weapon is then placed on safe and the charging handle is then placed back to the forward position (this is spring-loaded on the tank-mounted variation). The weapon is now ready for operation.|$|R
5000|$|... : The Canadian Forces C9 is a {{standard}} factory Minimi with a steel tubular stock. The C9A1 comes fitted with a Picatinny rail on the <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> mounting a 3.4x ELCAN C79 telescopic sight and can mount a vertical grip {{on the underside of}} the stock for added stability in prone firing. The C9A2 mid-life upgrade introduced a shorter barrel, green furniture, a C8-style collapsible stock, folding vertical foregrip and a laser aiming module (LAM). Two C9s are carried by each infantry section.|$|E
5000|$|By 2015, ROK {{forces were}} looking to obtain a new LMG, as the K3 was {{suffering}} from age and reliability issues. S&T Motiv is attempting to get win the contract by modernizing the K3 with a side-folding adjustable stock, an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail on <b>feed</b> <b>cover,</b> detachable side and underside rails, a carbon fiber heat shield over barrel, an improved muzzle brake/flash hider, folding iron sights, and an upgraded feed system. The same improvements would also {{be applied to the}} shorter [...] "Para" [...] version.|$|E
5000|$|Before WWII the Germans {{developed}} 75-round saddle-drum magazines for use {{in their}} MG 13 and MG 15 machine guns. The MG 34 machine guns could also use saddle-drum magazine when fitted with a special <b>feed</b> <b>cover.</b> The 75 rounds of ammunition were evenly distributed in {{each side of the}} magazine with a central feed [...] "tower" [...] where the ammunition is fed to the bolt. The ammunition was fed by a spring force, with rounds alternating from each side of the double drum so that the gun would not become unbalanced.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began in}} mid-1960, with the {{official}} opening on November 1, 1963. As the primary dish is spherical, its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as {{would be the case}} for a parabolic reflector. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line <b>feed</b> <b>covered</b> a narrow frequency band: 2–5% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.|$|R
5000|$|EPM {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the 1960s by the American biologist Dr. Jim Rooney. The disease is considered rare, though recently, {{an increasing number of}} cases have been reported. Previous research identified the [...] "barn cat" [...] as the definitive host of the disease. However, since that time it has been learned that the definitive host is a number of wildlife not only opossum, while any of a number of mammals can serve as intermediate hosts in the disease's two-host life-cycle. Those with horses should not panic and kill opossums or wildlife rather keep <b>feed</b> <b>covered</b> and stalls clean.|$|R
50|$|While the Facebook Home {{interface}} {{is officially}} incompatible {{with all other}} Android devices, some of its features were backported to Facebook's main apps. An update to the Facebook Messenger app added Chat Heads, while an update to the main Facebook app in August 2013 added the ability to enable <b>Cover</b> <b>Feed</b> as the lock screen (however, <b>Cover</b> <b>Feed</b> only supports devices that would otherwise support Facebook Home).|$|R
50|$|Both the {{standard}} and Para models {{come with a}} rear sight, adjustable for windage and elevation, that provides a peep aperture for ranges from 300 to 1000 m in 100 m increments. The hooded front sight is installed in a post on the gas block and is also adjustable for elevation and windage. Early models of the Minimi had the rear sight mounted forward of the <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> and the front post secured to the barrel, closer to the muzzle end. An adapter {{can also be used}} that allows the use of standard NATO night and day sights.|$|E
50|$|The K12 {{is based}} on the K3's design, layout, and {{function}} using a gas piston and rotating bolt. It is fed through a STANAG M13 disintegrating belt link and cannot accept a magazine. The cross-bolt type safety is the same as K3/Minimi, and the receiver is made from steel press with an aluminum alloy <b>feed</b> <b>cover.</b> Although similar in design, the receiver and other important parts are enlarged to accommodate the larger round. The K12 is somewhat heavy for the gun class at 12 kg, mainly because it has pistol grip, spade grip, and metal sliding stock all in one gun for the purpose of being quickly converted into a ground-fire machine gun by a dismounted operator; the spade grip can be removed by taking out two pins, removing the grip, and unfolding the stock which is similar in design to the FN Minimi’s Para version. Standard machine gun features are included like a folding (K3-style) bipod, quick change barrel, gas regulator, and (M240H-style) flash suppressor. It also has a folding ring sight for firing on helicopters with a folding ladder type sight for more accurate aiming. The sight is attached on a Mil-Std 1913 rail, which is also on the <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> and both sides of the handguard. No laser or optical sight has yet been selected for use on the K12, but some kind of electro-optical accessories are expected in the near future.|$|E

50|$|In all of {{the species}} in the genus Pyrgulopsis, the radula (a strong rasping <b>feeding</b> ribbon <b>covered</b> in {{microscopic}} teeth) is of taenioglossan type (seven teeth in each row, i.e. one middle, two laterals and 4 marginals.) The radula of Pyrgulopsis neomexicana was described in detail by Hershler (1994).|$|R
5000|$|Quinyambie {{was placed}} on the market in June 2010 when it was stocked with only 1,430 cattle. The maximum herd size is 11,000 head with an average of 9,000 head. The station was advertised as having over 3000000 acre of {{outstanding}} <b>feed</b> <b>cover.</b> [...] The property was sold July 2010 to the Mutooroo Pastoral Company, run by the Morgan and Wells families, who own the adjoining Mulyungarie Station and other property in the region. Mulyungarie was running between 3,000 and 4,000 head of cattle and shares a 110 km boundary fence with Quinyambie. It was believed that the sale price was between $8 million and $10 million.|$|E
50|$|The buttonholer's adaptor {{attaches}} to the machine's presser bar, replacing the presser foot. In its place the buttonholer employs a cloth clamp with teeth on the underside to hold the material firmly whilst manipulating the cloth side to side and forwards and backwards. Driven by {{the up and down}} stitching motion of the needle bar via the fork arm straddling the needle clamp, it executes the series of movements to complete a buttonhole by moving the material rather than by moving the needle position. Buttonholers usually include a metal <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> plate to cover the machine's feed dogs, so that they do not interfere with that of the buttonholer, though some machines allow the feed dogs to be disengaged or ‘dropped’.|$|E
50|$|The M240H (formerly {{designated}} as the M240E5) is an improvement of the M240D, the M240H features a rail-equipped <b>feed</b> <b>cover,</b> an improved flash suppressor, and has been configured {{so that it can}} be more quickly converted to infantry standard using an Egress Kit. The M240H has an overall length of 41.6 in (1056.6 mm) with a 21.7 in (551.2 mm) barrel and weighs 26.3 lb empty, and has a rate of fire of 550-650 rounds per minute (RPM). The M240H entered service in 2004 on U.S. Army helicopters. It is equipped with dual spade grips and thumb-activated trigger systems, and can be quickly converted for dismounted infantry use via an egress components kit that includes a bipod and conventional pistol grip trigger module.|$|E

50|$|The Sumitomo NTK-62 is a gas {{operated}} machine gun chambered in the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge, belt fed {{with the use}} of M13 disintegrating links. It has an unusual feed tray as the pivoting lever is above the bolt in the receiver rather than in the <b>feed</b> tray <b>cover</b> found on most machine guns.|$|R
50|$|The NEGEV has a quick-change chrome-lined barrel that is {{manufactured}} using a cold {{hammer forging}} process. The barrel is {{fitted with a}} slotted flash suppressor and a fixed carry handle, {{which is used to}} transport the weapon and change-out an overheated barrel. The barrel can be changed only after lifting open the <b>feed</b> tray <b>cover.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MG 3 feeds {{from the}} left side through a feed block using metal, 50-round continuous-link DM1 {{ammunition}} belts (which can be combined by cartridge) or disintegrating-link M13 or DM6 belts. In the light machine gun role, the MG 3 is deployed with a 100-round (or 120-round in case of disintegrating belts) belt fitted inside a synthetic ammunition drum developed by Heckler & Koch that is latched on to {{the left side of the}} receiver. The rear wall of the drum is transparent and serves as a visual indicator for the amount of ammunition available. The feed system operates through a feed arm that is housed in the <b>feed</b> <b>cover.</b> Two feed pawls are linked to the front end of the arm by an intermediate link and move in opposite directions, moving the belt in two stages as the bolt moves back and forward during firing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increasing}} American {{involvement in}} Vietnam created {{a demand for}} small arms, especially the new M60 machine gun. The Navy had surplus machine guns left over from World War 2 and Korea, but they were chambered for the earlier [...]30-06 Springfield cartridge rather than the new standard 7.62mm NATO cartridge. The Mk 21 Mod 0 was a US Navy conversion of the [...]30 M1919A4 to fire the 7.62mm NATO cartridge. This was accomplished by replacing the barrel, bolt, and <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> and adding a chamber bushing, a link-stripper, and a second belt-holding pawl {{to allow it to}} feed and fire the new cartridge. Spacer blocks were added to the front and back of the feedway to guide the shorter round and block the use of the longer [...]30-06 Springfield ammunition. A six-inch flash hider was also added to the barrel to reduce the muzzle flash from firing the shorter cartridge.|$|E
50|$|The rimmed 7.62×54mmR {{cartridges}} {{are set in}} a metal ammunition belt, and {{are held}} against the shoulder inside non disintegrating looped links, leaving the rim exposed at the rear. The belt is mounted from the right side into the feedway of the PK machine gun. The PK uses a non-reciprocating charging handle {{on the right side}} of the receiver to charge the gun. Since the PK uses a rimmed rifle cartridge and closed-link belts used for feeding, a two-stage feed mechanism with a preliminary extraction of a cartridge from a belt link was preferred over a direct ammunition feed design often used for rimmed cartridges. The PK machine gun is equipped with a lever-type feed mechanism, mounted on the <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> and operated by the feed lever, mounted on the right wall of the receiver and wrapping around the bolt carrier with its feed pawl and roller. The PK feed mechanism pulls the rimmed 7.62×54mmR cartridges out from the back of the ammunition belt and drops the cartridges down into the feed way, allowing the bolt to strip and feed the cartridges into the chamber for firing.|$|E
50|$|Biogas {{is part of}} the wet gas and {{condensing}} gas (or air) {{category that}} includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters, landfills, and animal <b>feeding</b> operations (<b>covered</b> livestock lagoons).|$|R
50|$|In its {{standard}} form, the MG4 {{is equipped}} with closed type iron sights with range settings up to 1,000 m in increments of 100 m. Optical or night sights or laser pointers can be mounted on a length of MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail located on the receiver <b>feed</b> tray <b>cover.</b> Bundeswehr models are equipped with telescopic sights with 3x magnification.|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} of the instrument system for the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program is briefly described and the development approach used to implement the operational instruments is discussed. The {{two versions of the}} instrument system include a target survey instrument to observe at a very high sensitivity a selected set of interesting stars that have particular a priori promise, and a sky survey instrument to observe the entire celestial sphere at a lower sensitivity. The targeted survey utilizes the 305 meter antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, a 64 meter DSN antenna, and other large radio telescopes. The Arecibo instrument provides the highest sensitivity by virtue of the antenna gain. The antenna line <b>feeds</b> <b>cover</b> an instantaneous frequency range of 50 MHz (tunable over 100 MHz), while the multichannel spectrum analyzer/signal detector is capable of analyzing a frequency segment 16 MHz wide with a maximum resolution of 1 Hz. The sky survey employs a listen-only, 34 meter antenna. The SETI breadboard development is also described...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s the US {{military}} {{was looking for}} an upgrade to the M1919 that could feed from either side for use as an improved coaxial machine gun. Saco-Lowell developed a model that had the driving spring attached to the back plate (eliminating {{the need for a}} mainspring and driving rod protruding out the back of the bolt), a solenoid trigger for remote firing, a <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> that could open from either side, a bolt with dual tracks that could feed from either side, and a reversible belt feed pawl, ejector, and feed chute. The experimental T151 had a flat backplate (?), the T152 had spade grips and a [...] "butterfly" [...] trigger like the M2HB, and the T153 had a pistol grip and back-up trigger like the M1919A4 and an extended charging handle similar to those on the M1919A5. The T153 was adopted as the M37 and was produced by SACO-Lowell and Rock Island Arsenal from 1955 to 1957. It was in regular service from 1955 until it was replaced by the M37E1 in the late 1960s and the M73A1 in the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, the German Army {{introduced}} the MG 34, {{considered to be}} the first modern general-purpose machine gun. Equipped with a quick-change barrel and fed either with belts, or from 50-round or 75-round spring-loaded saddle-drum Patronentrommel 34 magazines (with a simple change of <b>feed</b> <b>cover),</b> the MG 34 could sustain fire for much longer periods of time than other portable squad-level weapons such as the American B.A.R. and the British Bren Gun, both of which were fed by box magazines, while also being much lighter and more portable than crew-served weapons like the Browning M1919 or Vickers machine guns (which also lacked quick-change barrels). The MG 34 was also quite versatile; not only was it able to be fed from belted ammunition or a saddle drum magazine, it could also be fired from a bipod, heavy tripods or various pintle mounts for armored vehicles. Switching between a bipod and a tripod required no special tools, as the mounting latch was spring-loaded. Later in the war, the MG 34 was used {{as the basis for the}} Luftwaffe's MG 81 flexible defensive gun, and as the MG 34 Panzerlauf, it was used throughout the war as secondary armament on panzers and other vehicles. However, it did have its drawbacks, such as sensitivity to dirt and comparatively expensive production. One attempt at improvement was the MG 34S, an incremental improvement on the basic 34 design.|$|E
50|$|All Stoner 63/63A barrels are gas {{nitrided}} {{and have}} a quick-detach capability and can be removed {{in a matter of}} seconds in field conditions by simply pushing down a latch located on top of the weapon in front of the <b>feed</b> <b>cover</b> and pulling the barrel forward (with the bolt retracted). The chamber portion of the barrel rests on a U-shaped barrel bracket attached to the gas cylinder. The barrel is firmly locked in position by means of a spring-loaded latch (with two nested coil springs) which drives a steel pin into a hole in the barrel socket. All barrels have a gas block to which a bayonet lug and front sight assembly are mounted. The barrels are equipped with a bird cage type flash suppressor with six oval ports. The AR and standard machine gun barrels also have a carrying handle that can be snapped into one of three positions or removed altogether. The black-painted wooden handles are attached to a steel rod via roll pin. With a few exceptions, all the barrels used in the Stoner 63/63A have a six-groove right-hand rifling with a twist rate of 1:12-inch (305 mm), designed to stabilize the lightweight 55-grain M193 projectile, which was standard at the time. At the Army's request, Cadillac Gage submitted for testing rifles, carbines, and light machine guns, with 1:9-inch (230 mm) twist barrels, respectively designated XM22E2, XM23E2, and XM207E2. The different twist was to test the 68-grain XM287 and XM288 bullets. After NWM obtained a license to produce the Stoner 63A, some barrels were manufactured with a 1:8-inch (200 mm) in rifling pitch to be used with heavier experimental bullets. None of these were ever produced in significant numbers.|$|E
50|$|The L8A2 coaxial tank {{machine gun}} (replaced the L8A1) has a {{different}} gas valve switch (closed, single-position), {{when compared to the}} analogous Model 60-40, a different flash hider and a modified cocking handle. The weapon also has a trigger group that accepts electrical input and a lever in the feed tray that enables the belt to be removed without lifting the <b>feed</b> tray <b>cover.</b>|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{continuous}} and {{rapid growth of}} aquaculture in terms of size and annual total production {{has resulted in the}} need to seek for pragmatic measures to reduce the cost of production which <b>feeding</b> <b>covers</b> approximately 60 %. This present work reviews the advances made in the use of palm oil as an alternative lipid source in aquafeeds. In this review it is documented that with respect to price, availability and cost effective wise palm oil is the best choice as compared to other vegetable oils as well as fish oil. Also it is made clear that the use of palm oil in aquafeeds partially or exclusively does not compromise the growth, feed utilization as well as body composition of fish. It is also made clear based on existing information that palm oil impacts on the quality of aquafeeds positively. We therefore suggest that the use of palm oil in aquafeeds should be well embraced and much work should be done concerning its effects on non-specific immunity as well as effects on the expression of genes responsible for growth promoting and lipid metabolism...|$|R
