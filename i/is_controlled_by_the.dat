5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lux operon.|$|E

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends {{to create a more}} resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wii, while the swinging of the racket <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules. The process <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and {{supplied by the}} recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve.

The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, {{this is the result}} of a direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
