40|$|The {{investigations}} on bituminous-coal char and lignite char combustion {{under conditions}} of elevated pressure of oxygen in O 2 &CO 2 environment {{as well as the}} temperature range of 873 - 1273 K are described in this paper. The apparent reaction rate and the time of <b>fuel</b> <b>burn-out</b> as well as the progress in fuel conversion were determined. The experimental results were compared with the computations based on Shrinking-Core Model. Generally, the influence of oxygen concentration was found to be much stronger than the impact of the temperature...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} gaseous <b>fuel</b> <b>burn-out</b> has been devised, and an optimum {{value of the}} characteristic parameter of the flame has been determined, which provides {{the increase in the}} capacity and reduction in specific fuel consumption. The methods of calculating the heat exchange in the tube rotating furnaces by using average gas flow and material temperatures have been refined. A method of defining the distribution of the gas flow and material temperatures along the furnace has been developed. The operation of the furnaces, with aluminium hydroxide preliminary heated with waste gases has been proved to be advisable, and a rational waste gas temperature has been determined. A means of reducing the nitrogen oxide content of the waste gases has been developed. The results {{associated with the use of}} the investigation finding for the PYKALEVSKOYE OBYEDINENYE GLYNOZEM have been given. The field of application is tube rotating furnaces in non-ferrous metals metallurgy and cement industry.

40|$|An optical {{measurement}} and registration system of electronic radiation of electron-excited radicals ОН in flames {{is presented in}} this work. To investigate diffusion hydrogen-air torches the mentioned system was used. The obtained experimental data were used for analysis of a thrust formation of the ramjet ejector combustor with acoustic resonator by vibrating burning of hydrogen. It was offered a way to determine geometrical parameters of ejector system and hydrogen consumptions providing the largest thrust values. Picture registration in different spectral ranges is the central instrument for solution of scientific-technical problems connected with the burning processes. The pictures enable to give a valuable information both about local and integral characteristics of the investigated process. For example, one of the methods of <b>fuel</b> <b>burn-out</b> completeness {{is based on the}} effect of OH hydroxide group chemiluminescence which is formed as intermediate product of burning. Act of the OH radical formation is accompanied by a light quantum radiation in the range of 280 - 350 nm. Intensity of luminous radiation from the controlled flame region in the given spectral range can serve as an index of the reacted fuel quantity. Figure 1 presents a block-scheme of the registration system for solution of simila...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Despite the Government’s {{intervention}} of an intensive electrification program in South Africa, which {{has resulted in}} more than 87 % of households being connected to the grid, a majority of low-income households still depend on coal as a primary source of energy, especially on the central Highveld. In informal settlements, combustion of coal is done in inefficient self-fabricated braziers, colloquially known as imbaulas. Emissions from domestic coal combustion result in elevated household and ambient air pollution levels that often exceed national air quality limits. Continued dependence on coal combustion exposes households to copious amounts of health-damaging pollutants. Despite the health significance of coal-burning emissions from informal braziers, {{there is still a}} dearth of emissions data from these devices. Consequently, evaluating the emission characteristics of these devices and to determine the resultant emission factors is needed. The effects of ignition methods and ventilation rates on particulate and gaseous emission from coal-burning braziers are reported in literature. However, to date there are no studies carried out to investigate the influence of the size of coal pieces on brazier emission performance. In this paper, we report on controlled combustion experiments carried out to investigate systematically, influences of coal particle size on gaseous and condensed matter (smoke) emissions from informal residential coal combustion braziers. Results presented are averages of three identical burn-cycles of duration three hours or <b>fuel</b> <b>burn-out,</b> whichever was the soonest...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} flame properties of O 2 /CO 2 combustion (oxy-fuel combustion) with focus on the radiation characteristics and the burn-out behaviour. The experiments were carried out in a 100 kWth test unit which facilitates O 2 /CO 2 combustion with real flue gas recycle. The tests comprise a reference test in air and two O 2 /CO 2 test cases with different recycled feed gas mixture concentrations of O 2 (OF 21 @ 21 vol. % O 2, 79 vol. % CO 2 and OF 27 @ 27 vol. % O 2, 73 vol. % CO 2). In-furnace gas concentration, temperature and total radiation (uni-directional) profiles are presented and discussed. The {{results show that the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>burn-out</b> is delayed for the OF 21 case compared to air-fired conditions as a consequence of reduced temperature levels. Instead, the OF 27 case results in more similar combustion behaviour compared to the reference conditions in terms of in-flame temperature and gas concentration levels, but with significantly increased flame radiation intensity. The information obtained from the radiation and temperature profiles show that the flame emissivity for the OF 21 and OF 27 cases both differ from air-fired conditions. The total emissivity and the gas emissivity of the OF 27 and the air-fired environment are discussed by means of an available model. The gas emissivity model shows that the increase in radiation intensity (up to 30 %) of the OF 27 flame compared to the air flame can partly, but not solely, be explained by an increased gas emissivity. Hence, the results show that the OF 27 flame yields a higher radiative contribution from in-flame soot compared to the air-fired flame in addition to the known contribution from the elevated CO 2 partial pressure...|$|E
