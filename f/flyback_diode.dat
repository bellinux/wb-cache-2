25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a <b>flyback</b> <b>diode).</b> Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} commercially {{available}} inexpensive single and dual H-bridge packages, {{of which the}} L293x series includes the most common ones. Few packages, like L9110, have built-in <b>flyback</b> <b>diodes</b> for back EMF protection.|$|R
50|$|The ULN2003A is {{an array}} of seven NPN Darlington {{transistors}} capable of 500 mA, 50 V output. It features common-cathode <b>flyback</b> <b>diodes</b> for switching inductive loads. It can come in PDIP, SOIC, SOP or TSSOP packaging. In the same family are ULN2002A, ULN2004A, as well as ULQ2003A and ULQ2004A, designed for different logic input levels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flyback</b> <b>diodes</b> are {{commonly}} used when inductive loads are switched off by semiconductor devices: in relay drivers, H-bridge motor drivers, and so on. A switched-mode power supply also exploits this effect, but the energy is not dissipated to heat and instead used to pump a packet of additional charge into a capacitor, in order to supply power to a load.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> is used {{to simply}} {{dissipate}} the inductive energy, as with a solenoid or motor, cheap 1N540x and 1N400x general-purpose diodes are used instead.|$|E
50|$|These images {{show the}} voltage spike and its {{elimination}} {{through the use}} of a <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> (1N4007). The inductor in this case is a solenoid connected to a 24V DC power supply. Each waveform was taken using a digital oscilloscope set to trigger when the voltage across the inductor dipped below zero. In Figure 1 the voltage as measured across the switch bounces/spikes to around -300 V. In Figure 2, a <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> was added in antiparallel with the solenoid. Instead of spiking to -300 V, the <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> only allows approximately -1.4 V of potential to be built up (-1.4 V is a combination of the forward bias of the 1N4007 diode (1.1 V) and the foot of wiring separating the diode and the solenoid). The waveform in Figure 2 is much less bouncy than the waveform in Figure 1. In both cases, the total time for the solenoid to discharge is a few milliseconds.|$|E
5000|$|... in the Off-state, {{the switch}} {{is open and}} the only path offered to {{inductor}} current is through the <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> D, the capacitor C and the load R. This results in transferring the energy accumulated during the On-state into the capacitor.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{standard}} buck converter, the <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> turns on, on its own, {{shortly after the}} switch turns off, {{as a result of}} the rising voltage across the diode. This voltage drop across the diode results in a power loss which is equal to ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> (sometimes {{called a}} snubber diode, commutating diode, {{freewheeling}} diode, suppressor diode, suppression diode, clamp diode, or catch diode) is a diode used to eliminate flyback, {{which is the}} sudden voltage spike seen across an inductive load when its supply current is suddenly reduced or interrupted.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimise}} the antenna-like radiation of this {{electromagnetic energy}} from wires {{connected to the}} inductor, the <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> should be connected as physically close to the inductor as practicable. This approach also minimises {{those parts of the}} circuit that are subject to an unwanted high-voltage — a good engineering practice.|$|E
50|$|Schottky diodes are {{preferred}} in <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> {{applications for}} switching power converters, {{because they have}} the lowest forward drop (~0.2 V rather than >0.7 V for low currents) and are able to quickly respond to reverse bias (when the inductor is being re-energized). They therefore dissipate less energy while transferring energy from the inductor to a capacitor.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> solves this starvation-arc {{problem by}} {{allowing}} the inductor to draw current from itself (thus, [...] "flyback") in a continuous loop until the energy is dissipated through losses in the wire, the diode and the resistor (Figure 3). When the switch is closed the diode is reverse-biased against the power supply and doesn't exist in the circuit for practical purposes. However, when the switch is opened, the diode becomes forward-biased relative to the inductor (instead of the power supply as before), allowing it to conduct current in a circular loop from the positive potential {{at the bottom of}} the inductor to the negative potential at the top (assuming the power supply was supplying positive voltage at the top of the inductor prior to the switch being opened). The voltage across the inductor will merely be a function of the forward voltage drop of the <b>flyback</b> <b>diode.</b> Total time for dissipation can vary, but it will usually last for a few milliseconds.|$|E
50|$|A {{bootstrap}} capacitor {{is connected}} from the supply rail (V+) to the output voltage. Usually the source terminal of the N-MOSFET {{is connected to}} the cathode of a recirculation diode allowing for efficient management of stored energy in the typically inductive load (See <b>Flyback</b> <b>diode).</b> Due to the charge storage characteristics of a capacitor, the bootstrap voltage will rise above (V+) providing the needed gate drive voltage.|$|E
50|$|When {{used with}} a DC coil relay, a <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> can cause delayed {{drop-out}} of the contacts when power is removed, due to the continued circulation of current in the relay coil and diode. When rapid {{opening of the contacts}} is important, a low-value resistor can be placed in series with the diode to help dissipate the coil energy faster, at the expense of higher voltage at the switch.|$|E
50|$|In {{an ideal}} <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> selection, one would seek a diode which has very large {{peak forward current}} {{capacity}} (to handle voltage transients without burning out the diode), low forward voltage drop, and a reverse breakdown voltage suited to the inductor's power supply. Depending on the application and equipment involved, some voltage surges can be upwards of 10 times the voltage of the power source, so it is critical not to underestimate the energy contained within an energized inductor.|$|E
50|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur.

50|$|According to Lenz's law, if {{the current}} through an {{inductance}} changes, this inductance induces a voltage so the current will go on flowing {{as long as there}} is energy in the magnetic field. If the current can only flow through the air, the voltage is therefore so high that the air conducts. That is why in mechanically-switched circuits, the near-instantaneous dissipation which occurs without a <b>flyback</b> <b>diode</b> is often observed as an arc across the opening mechanical contacts. Energy is dissipated in this arc primarily as intense heat which causes undesirable premature erosion of the contacts. Another way to dissipate energy is through electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
50|$|If an {{ordinary}} switch {{is used to}} control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch. This doesn't occur when the magnet is switched on, because the voltage {{is limited to the}} power supply voltage, but when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an arc across the switch contacts, which can damage them. With small electromagnets a capacitor is often used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current. More often a diode is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat. The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during steady state operation and doesn't conduct. When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the reactive current continues to flow through the winding, through the diode and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a <b>flyback</b> <b>diode.</b>|$|E
