25|$|A {{fiduciary}} {{must not}} {{profit from the}} <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position.</b> This includes any benefits or profits which, although unrelated to the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> came about because of an opportunity that the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> afforded. It is unnecessary that the principal would {{have been unable to}} make the profit; if the fiduciary makes a profit, by virtue of his role as fiduciary for the principal, then the fiduciary must report the profit to the principal. If the principal provides fully informed consent, then the fiduciary may keep the benefit and be absolved of any liability for what would be a breach of fiduciary duty. If this requirement is not met then the property is deemed by the court to be held by the fiduciary on constructive trust for the principal.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, it is {{said the}} {{fiduciary}} has a duty {{not to be in}} a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and not to profit from his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> without express knowledge and consent. A fiduciary cannot have a conflict of interest.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{earliest}} corporations were formed, courts have imposed minimum standards to prevent directors using their office {{to pursue their}} own interests over {{the interests of the}} corporation. Directors can have no conflict of interest. In trusts law, this core fiduciary duty was formulated {{after the collapse of the}} South Sea Company in 1719 in the United Kingdom. Keech v Sandford held that people in <b>fiduciary</b> <b>positions</b> had to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, and this rule [...] "should be strictly pursued". It was later held that no inquiry should be made into transactions where the fiduciary was interested in both sides of the deal. These principles of equity were received into the law of the United States, and in a modern formulation Cardozo J said in Meinhard v Salmon that the law required [...] "the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive... at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd." ...|$|R

We begin this article with a summary discussion of how fiduciary duties have developed and been applied in the pension fund context. We then review the efforts of the Supreme Court of Canada to develop a broader conceptual framework for fiduciary duties and consider steps that might be taken to address and mitigate liability in respect of these duties in the context of pension fund administration.

25|$|An {{account of}} profits is another {{potential}} remedy. It is usually used where the {{breach of duty}} was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify. The idea of an account of profits is that the fiduciary profited unconscionably {{by virtue of the}} <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> so any profit made should be transferred to the principal. It may sound like a constructive trust at first, but it is not.|$|E
25|$|An {{account of}} profits is the {{appropriate}} remedy when, for example, a senior employee has taken advantage of his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> by conducting his own company {{on the side and}} has run up quite a lot of profits over a period of time, profits which he wouldn't have been able to make otherwise. The fiduciary in breach may however receive an allowance for effort and ingenuity expended in making the profit.|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the profit be directly made from the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> merely {{in a way that}} causes a conflict between the fiduciary's personal interests and his duties. If a trustee was informed by the trust's stockbroker that only one parcel of highly sought-after stocks remained and chose to purchase it for himself rather than for the trust, he would be taking advantage of the trust and causing a conflict of interest. On the second issue, Boardman confirmed a defence of authorisation; if the fiduciary has informed the beneficiaries that he is and will be acting on his own behalf, and received permission to do so, the property would not have been held on constructive trust. The third issue is who does the fiduciary owe duties to. In Boardman the case was concerning a trust, and it was held that the duties were towards the beneficiaries. Section 170 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that in situations concerning companies, the duties of the directors and other fiduciaries are to that company.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{petitions}} by {{the company}} or creditors, an administrator {{has the power to}} move a company into liquidation, carrying out an asset sale, if its attempts at rescue come to an end. If the liquidator is not an administrator, he is appointed by the court usually on the nomination of the majority of creditors. The liquidator can be removed by the same groups. Once in place, the liquidator has the power to do anything set out in sections 160, 165 and Schedule 4 for the purpose of its main duty. This includes bringing legal claims that belonged to the company. This is to realise the value of the company, and distribute the assets. Assets must always be distributed in the order of statutory priority: releasing the claims of fixed security interest holders, paying preferential creditors (the liquidator's expenses, employees and pensions, and the ring fenced fund for unsecured creditors), the floating charge holder, unsecured creditors, deferred debts, and finally shareholders. In the performance of these basic tasks, the liquidator owes its duties to the company, not individual creditors or shareholders. They can be liable for breach of duty by exercising powers for improper purposes (e.g. not distributing money to creditors in the right order,) and may be sued additionally for negligence. As a person in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> he may have no conflict of interest or make secret profits. Nevertheless, liquidators (like administrators and some receivers) can generally be said to have a broad degree of discretion about the conduct of liquidation. They must realise assets to distribute to creditors, and they may attempt to maximise these by bringing new litigation, either to avoid transactions entered into by the insolvent company, or by suing the former directors.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{fiduciary}} duty is imposed, equity requires a different, stricter, standard of behavior than the comparable tortious {{duty of care}} at common law. The fiduciary has a duty {{not to be in}} a situation where personal interests and {{fiduciary duty}} conflict, not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and a duty not to profit from his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a conflict of interest. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves [...] "at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd" [...] and that [...] "he distinguishing or overriding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty".|$|E
2500|$|Whether or {{not someone}} is a {{fiduciary}} {{depends on their}} position. Trustees, company directors, agents and business partners are all fiduciaries, as in Yugraneft v Abramovich, but other positions may be recognised by the court if the misuse of powers in a particular circumstance renders them so, as in Reid. In Brink's Ltd v Abu-Saleh (No. 3), a security guard who was bribed to give information on a company's security systems, allowing a gang of armed robbers to burgle their warehouse, {{was found to be}} in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position.</b> While a security guard would not normally be a fiduciary due to not holding a senior enough role, in relation to security arrangements the guard would be found to be acting in a fiduciary capacity. Bribes may also be synonymous with [...] "secret commissions", where somebody is given an undisclosed [...] "kickback".|$|E
2500|$|The {{corporate}} opportunity doctrine {{does not}} apply to all fiduciaries of a corporation; rather, it is limited to directors, officers, and controlling shareholders. [...] The doctrine applies regardless of whether the corporation is harmed by the transaction; indeed, it applies even if the corporation benefits from the transaction. [...] The corporate opportunity doctrine only applies if the opportunity was not disclosed to the corporation. [...] If the opportunity was disclosed {{to the board of directors}} and the board declined to take the opportunity for the corporation, the fiduciary may take the opportunity for him- or herself. [...] When the corporate opportunity doctrine applies, the corporation is entitled to all profits earned by the fiduciary from the transaction. [...] In the leading English law case of [...] it was held that [...] "The rule of equity which insists on those who by use of a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> make a profit, being liable to account for that profit, in no way depends on fraud, or absence of bona fides ... or whether the plaintiff has in fact been damaged or benefited by his action." ...|$|E
2500|$|Constructive trusts {{arise in}} a number of {{situations}} that are generally classified as [...] "wrongs", {{in the sense that they}} mirror a breach of duty by a trustee, by someone who owes fiduciary obligations, or anyone. In a seventh group of constructive trust cases (which also seems uncontroversial), a person who murders their wife or husband cannot inherit their property, and are said by the courts to hold any property on constructive trust for another next of kin. Eighth, it was held in Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd that information, or intellectual property, taken in breach of confidence would be held on constructive trust. Ninth, a trustee or another person in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> who breaches a duty and makes a profit out of it, has been held to hold all profits on constructive trust. For instance in Boardman v Phipps, a solicitor for a family trust and one of the trust's beneficiaries, took the opportunity to invest in a company in Australia, partly on the trust's behalf, but also making a profit themselves. They both stood in a [...] "fiduciary" [...] position of trust because as a solicitor, or someone managing the trust's affairs, the law requires they act solely in the trust's interest. Crucially, they failed to gain the fully informed consent of the beneficiaries to invest in the opportunity and make a profit themselves. This opened up a possibility that their interests could conflict with the interest's of the trust. So, the House of Lords held they were in breach of duty, and that all profits they made were held on constructive trust, though they could claim quantum meruit (a salary fixed by the court) for the work they did. More straightforwardly, in Reading v Attorney-General the House of Lords held that an army sergeant (a fiduciary for the UK government) who took bribes while stationed in Egypt held his bribes on constructive trust for the Crown. However, more recently it has become more controversial to classify these constructive trusts along with wrongs on the basis that the remedies that are available should differ from (and usually go further than) compensatory damages in tort. Also, it has been doubted that a constructive trust should be imposed that would bind third parties in an insolvency situation. In Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd, Lord Neuberger MR held that company's liquidators could not claim a proprietary interest in the fraudulent profits its former director had made if this would prejudice the director's other creditors in insolvency. The effect of a constructive trust would accordingly be limited so that it did not bind third party creditors of an insolvent defendant. The United Kingdom Supreme Court, however, has subsequently overruled Sinclair in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC, holding that a bribe or secret commission accepted by an agent is held on trust for his principal..|$|E

5000|$|Where {{an agent}} acquires a benefit in breach of his {{fiduciary}} duty, the relief accorded by equity is [...] "primarily restitutionary or restorative rather than compensatory," [...] representing a personal remedy for the principal against the agent. However, {{in some cases}} where an agent acquires a benefit which came to his notice {{as a result of}} his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> or pursuant to an opportunity which results from his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position,</b> the equitable rule is that he is to be treated as having acquired the benefit on behalf of his principal, so that it is beneficially owned by the principal. In such cases, the principal has a proprietary remedy in addition to his personal remedy against the agent, and the principal can elect between the two remedies. The equitable rule is strictly applied, and has its origins in the 1726 case of Keech v Sandford.|$|E

5000|$|Where {{a person}} in a {{fiduciary}} office earns unauthorised profits {{as a result of their}} position, this money will be held on constructive trust. This principle originated with Keech v Sandford, and the rule was first fully defined in Bray v Ford, where Lord Herschell said that: [...] It is an inflexible rule of the court of equity that {{a person in}} a fiduciary position...is not, unless otherwise authorised, entitled to make a profit; he is not allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty conflict.

The author suggests the ultimate victory by Wintle was the “right result by the wrong route”, because {{at the time of the}} appeal to the House of Lords “everyone was mindful of the newspaper headlines”; he suggests that the Law Lords were forced to resort to sophistry to uphold Wintle’s appeal, and concludes that it “is a case which has haunted this branch of the law for a generation”. Nevertheless, it could also be said that the House of Lords decision is consistent with long standing principles and authority that a person in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> such as a solicitor should not be permitted to benefit from abusing that relationship, particularly in the case of an elderly client 'unversed in business' like the testator in this case. It should also be noted that while Wintle lost his case on the first appeal, Lord Justice Sellers (one of the three judges on the Court of Appeal) dissented and considered that he should have won it. Thus, of the nine judges who heard the case at its various stages, six sided with Wintle.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{what came}} out in the Pecora Commission {{investigation}} into the Wall Street crash, was that beginning in September 1929, Wiggin had begun selling short his personal shares in Chase National Bank {{at the same time he}} was committing his bank's money to buying. He shorted over 42,000 shares, earning him over $4 million. His earning were tax-free since he used a Canadian shell company to buy the stocks. Wiggin was not alone, other executives in powerful positions did the same thing. A member of the committee counsel from the Senate Banking Committee named Ferdinand Pecora said of Wiggins, [...] "In the entire investigation, it is doubtful if there was another instance of a corporate executive who so thoroughly and successfully used his official and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>position</b> for private profit" [...] (Pecora, p. 161). As a result of all the controversy, the Wiggin Provision was promptly named after him which prevented company directors from selling short on their own stocks and making a profit from their own company’s demise. As head of one of America's most important banks, Wiggin was consulted by the Hoover Administration for suggestions on how to deal with the Great Depression. Wiggin opposed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and according to the Ludwig von Mises Institute, [...] "One of the best counsels on the depression was set forth in an annual report by Albert H. Wiggin, chairman of the board of the Chase National Bank, in January, 1931."
