40|$|Universities {{are under}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to demonstrate that}} continuous performance improvement is being delivered for user satisfaction, but the importance of <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> as a student-staff focused tool needs to be emphasised. This research sought answers to questions relating to the underlying structure of sustainable <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> and user satisfaction, {{and the number of}} factors that make up the <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> scale. Three universities from the south-western part of Nigeria were selected randomly using ownership structure to define the cases: University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso and Joseph Ayo Babalola University, Ikeji Arakeji, each representing the Federal, State, and Private ownership. A questionnaire survey was used on a random sample of 651 staff and students from the three universities. Six hundred questionnaires were retrieved (response rate of 92. 2 %). An exploratory factor analysis was used to understand the responses and the interrelationships. The results showed a two-factor solution of ‘locational advantages and user needs’ and ‘adequacy of facilities/functional connection and four core determinants for acceptance. It is concluded that universities should factor student-staff focus points into their <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> schemes to optimise their service deliveries. The study contributes to the discussion on factor structure of sustainable <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> scale with a focus on students and staff of universities.   Keywords: <b>Facilities</b> <b>planning,</b> universities, data structure, factors, Nigeria. </p...|$|R
