2500|$|Some Protestants, however, {{reject the}} {{position}} that contraceptive use {{is a matter of}} conscience. Although some Quiverfull adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of Unless The Lord Magazine, states, [...] "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal {{in the sense that it}} is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century." [...] Charles D. Provan additionally argues:"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

For many centuries now we have accepted the paradigm of a hierarchy of life where the vegetative world is ranked lower than the animal world, with “Man”, of course as the “Crown of Creation ” on top. But for our Northern European ancestors, as with all so-called “primitive ” cultures, all Nature was experienced as alive, numinous, ensouled. And because most of Old Europe was covered with a vast, trackless wilderness of trees, the forest was viewed as the very cradle of life, providing as it did food, shelter and protection to a hunting and gathering people.
