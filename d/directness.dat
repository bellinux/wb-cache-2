5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending upon {{the power of the}} weapon and the <b>directness</b> of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced to zero or by being knocked into the water around and below the level.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as <b>directness</b> of presentation and economy of language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use free verse.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a <b>directness</b> and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought as}} enounced {{in the first}} stanza is the {{supremacy}} of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered... which gives an effect of poverty {{in spite of the}} beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible <b>directness.</b>|$|E
5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit. Nevertheless, his <b>directness</b> and socially confident nature singled him out for command. His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike. He is said to have tended to see everything and everyone in black and white.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{criteria}} {{measure the}} usability {{of different types}} of public transport and its overall appeal, although they overlap somewhat. The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness and <b>directness.</b> Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before they can begin the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. Timeliness is how long they must wait for the vehicle. <b>Directness</b> records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the shortest route.|$|E
25|$|The <b>directness</b> and {{absence of}} {{embroidery}} with which Zakaria Tamer writes {{is a powerful}} weapon in giving distinctive form to the basic themes to which he returns again and again.|$|E
25|$|John Frawley (born 16 May 1955 in London, England) is a {{traditional}} astrologer, writer and educator, who has been noted for practicality and <b>directness</b> of approach, a depth of scholarship, and a provocative, challenging and witty style.|$|E
25|$|Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928– February 27, 2003) was an American {{television}} personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers {{was famous}} for creating, hosting, and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968–2001), which featured his kind-hearted, grandfatherly personality, and <b>directness</b> to his audiences.|$|E
25|$|Fredric Jameson {{suggests}} postmodern works abjure {{any claim}} to spontaneity and <b>directness</b> of expression, making use instead of pastiche and discontinuity. Against this definition, Art and Language's Charles Harrison and Paul Wood maintained pastiche and discontinuity are endemic to modernist art, and are deployed effectively by modern {{artists such as}} Manet and Picasso.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} its {{popularity}} are clear enough; it is a score replete with beguiling orchestral colors, fresh and piquant melodies, {{with a mild}} oriental flavor, a rhythmic vitality largely absent from many major orchestral works of the later 19th century, and a <b>directness</b> of expression unhampered by quasi-symphonic complexities of texture and structure.|$|E
25|$|Many U.S. {{law schools}} teach legal {{writing in a}} way that {{acknowledges}} the technical complexity inherent in law and the justified formality that complexity often requires, but with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and <b>directness.</b> Yet many practicing lawyers, busy as they are with deadlines and heavy workloads, often resort to a template-based, outdated, hyperformal writing style in both analytical and transactional documents. This is understandable, but it sometimes unfortunately perpetuates an unnecessarily formal legal writing style.|$|E
25|$|One {{difference}} between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts {{is that they}} preferred realistic <b>directness</b> and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal {{was to create a}} realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by Caravaggio in Italy, which became popular with artists in Seville, from which many migrants came to New Spain came. Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called estofado, the application of paint over gold leaf.|$|E
25|$|Bravery, {{self-reliance}} {{and strength}} {{are the greatest}} virtues. Underhandedness of any kind are dishonorable and at odds with Ulric's nature of <b>directness</b> and honor. Obey your military superiors and never refuse an order unless doing so would break another of Ulric's tenets. Never refuse a direct challenge. Modern weapons, such as gunpowder weapons, artillery, crossbows and fire-bombs, {{because they do not}} rely any physical strength are shunned. Followers of Ulric must never allow one of the fires of a shrine or temple to go out. Oppose Chaos wherever you see it. Never flee a fight unless facing overwhelming odds and the greater good would be served by such a flight.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{striking}} {{example of the}} line used to divide Dada and Surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925's Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (Von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen) with The Kiss (Le Baiser) from 1927 by Max Ernst. The first is generally held to have a distance, and erotic subtext, whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly. In the second the influence of Miró and the drawing style of Picasso is visible {{with the use of}} fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a <b>directness</b> that would later be influential in movements such as Pop art.|$|E
25|$|When Henry {{tried to}} divorce Queen Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter. As such, he {{appeared}} on the Queen's behalf in the legates' court, where he startled the audience by the <b>directness</b> of his language and by declaring that, like St John the Baptist, {{he was ready to}} die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by it that he composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared the royal anger. The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher's personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave him for what he had done.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and <b>directness</b> of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when he gets to the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake like someone trying to follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
25|$|The Court buttressed its {{determination}} {{based upon}} the underlying premises of the <b>directness</b> requirement. First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions. For example, in this case, National could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud. Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can pursue their own claim. Here, the State of New York could file suit and in that situation, {{it would be much}} easier for a court to calculate New York's damages. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court reversed the Second Circuit's holding that Ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962(c) claim.|$|E
25|$|A {{street network}} pattern {{can affect the}} {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the <b>directness</b> of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.|$|E
500|$|In Ind's view, Tristano [...] "was {{always so}} gentle, so charming and so quietly spoken that his <b>directness</b> could be unnerving." [...] This <b>directness</b> was noted by others, {{including}} bassist Chubby Jackson, who commented that Tristano {{had almost no}} tact and would not worry about being rude or making others feel incompetent. Some of his students described Tristano as domineering, but others indicated that this impression came from his demanding discipline in training and attitude to music.|$|E
500|$|The band {{sought to}} be more direct with this record than the {{previous}} two, resulting in a more mellow album. Tweedy attributes the lyrical <b>directness</b> to his listening to material by The Byrds and Fairport Convention while recording the album. He disliked the reliance on studio effects on previous albums: ...|$|E
500|$|The feminist author Virginia Woolf {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Times Literary Supplement in 1909, writing that [...] "Cookery books are delightful to read... A charming <b>directness</b> stamps them, with their imperative 'Take an uncooked fowl and split its skin from end to end' and their massive commonsense which stares frivolity out of countenance".|$|E
500|$|Jim is different. He {{does his}} own dirty work. Jim {{is one of}} those people who are willing to say, [...] "I didn't like your movie." [...] <b>Directness</b> is disarming to people who are used to sugar-coating. It's tough for people who need {{approval}} to see somebody who doesn't. Myths and legends begin to surround that kind of person.|$|E
500|$|Meikle {{primarily}} plays as a winger and {{can also}} play as a striker. He {{is known for his}} high workrate, on which Cox commented that [...] "He works so hard and is full of energy". When signing for York in 2014 manager Nigel Worthington commented that he has [...] "pace and that <b>directness</b> to get at defenders".|$|E
500|$|Ingres {{was more}} {{successful}} with female than male portraits. His 1814 Portrait of Madame de Senonnes {{was described as}} [...] "to the feminine what the Louvre's Bertin is to the masculine". The sitter for his 1848 Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild {{looks out at the}} viewer with the same <b>directness</b> as Bertin, but is softened by her attractive dress and relaxed pose; she is engaging and sympathetic rather than tough and imposing.|$|E
500|$|The song's sound {{has been}} {{described}} as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, at once young and jeeringly cynical. Critic Michael Gray described the track as [...] "a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense <b>directness</b> in the central chorus: 'How does it feel. The song had an enormous impact on popular culture and rock music. Its success made Dylan a pop icon, as Paul Williams notes: ...|$|E
500|$|... musical {{language}} organised {{itself into}} a shimmering, luminous gradation between simplicity and harshness. The melodies have a Hebraic tint, and Ornstein does not shy from placing dissonant and tonal music side by side. This shifting of style {{is just one of}} Ornstein's creative tools. More importantly, there is a <b>directness</b> of emotion that makes the music genuinely appealing. It {{should also be noted that}} his music is ideally written for the piano and is clearly the work of a master pianist.|$|E
500|$|Golf Ball is {{an example}} of the {{emerging}} [...] "confident authority" [...] of his single-image paintings with its [...] "Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness". The [...] "frontal and centralized presentation"'s <b>directness</b> lacked the sophistication to market the images of household goods for advertising but was considered daring artistically. The black and white painting on a grey background challenges both the natural perception of realism and the boundaries of abstraction. [...] The work [...] "gives us both the impression of space and the fact of surface".|$|E
500|$|Geoff Brown, {{reviewing}} Marin Alsop and Sarah Connolly's recording in The Times, {{praised the}} <b>directness</b> of both Kay's and Turnage's writing and described Twice Through the Heart and its [...] "awful clarity" [...] as [...] "among {{the best in}} Turnage's recent output". David Gutman suggested in Gramophone that [...] "if listeners feel uncomfortable with the mix of artful delivery and documentary realism, that {{may be part of}} the intended effect." [...] The critics of The Daily Telegraph were later to list this disc among the hundred best classical recordings.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideology}} {{or political}} style that {{is derived from}} Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called Fortuynism. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged elitism and bureaucratic style of the Dutch purple coalitions or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one [...] "of openness, <b>directness</b> and clearness", populism or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just one ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and nationalism.|$|E
500|$|According to Rodgers' biographer William Hyland, {{the score}} for The King and I {{is much more}} {{closely tied to the}} action than that of South Pacific, [...] "which had its share of purely {{entertaining}} songs". [...] For example, the opening song, [...] "I Whistle a Happy Tune", establishes Anna's fear upon entering a strange land with her small son, but the merry melody also expresses her determination to keep a stiff upper lip. Hyland calls [...] "Hello, Young Lovers" [...] an archetypical Rodgers ballad: simple, with only two chords in the first eight bars, but moving in its <b>directness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was known}} for the <b>directness</b> of his speech, which {{sometimes}} offended those around him. Asked to comment in an interview for Newsweek on his opinion of the British Armed Forces, Brown replied, [...] "They're no longer a world power. All they've got are generals, admirals and bands." [...] Reaction in Britain was mixed. Some, like Lord Allenby condemned Brown's remarks, while others, like Lord Monckton acknowledged {{the truth of the}} remarks. [...] Brown also said that Israel was a [...] "burden" [...] to the United States, and predicted that Iran would become an important military power in the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|Joyce Kilmer's {{reputation}} as a poet is staked largely on the widespread popularity of this one poem. [...] "Trees" [...] was liked immediately on first publication in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse; when Trees and Other Poems was published the following year, the review in Poetry focused on the [...] "nursery rhyme" [...] <b>directness</b> and simplicity of the poems, finding a particular childlike naivety in [...] "Trees", which gave it [...] "an unusual, haunting poignancy". However, the same review criticized {{the rest of the}} book, stating [...] "much of the verse in this volume is very slight indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|Aikido {{training}} is mental {{as well as}} physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations. This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and <b>directness.</b> Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one [...] "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" [...] in order to execute techniques without hesitation. As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.|$|E
500|$|Grandma Moses {{died at age}} 101 on December 13, 1961 at the Health Center in Hoosick Falls, New York. She {{is buried}} there at the Maple Grove Cemetery. President John F. Kennedy memorialized her: [...] "The death of Grandma Moses removed a beloved figure from American life. The <b>directness</b> and {{vividness}} of her paintings restored a primitive freshness to our perception of the American scene. Both her work and her life helped our nation renew its pioneer heritage and recall {{its roots in the}} countryside and on the frontier. All Americans mourn her loss." [...] After her death, her work was exhibited in several large traveling exhibitions in the United States and abroad.|$|E
500|$|In Koechlin's view, [...] "Apart {{from the}} Préludes of Chopin, {{it is hard}} to think of a {{collection}} of similar pieces that are so important". The critic Michael Oliver wrote, [...] "Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense <b>directness...</b> more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity." [...] Jessica Duchen calls them [...] "unusual slivers of magical inventiveness." [...] The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.|$|E
