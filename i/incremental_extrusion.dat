40|$|In this paper, the {{calculation}} of <b>incremental</b> <b>extrusion</b> and intrusion versus incremental arbitrary multi-axial fatigue loadings in single crystals is presented. An arbitrary sequence of multi-axial loadings is considered. The first loading is applied until slip occurs to some extent. Then the residual stress field caused by this loading is considered as the initial stress for the next loading. This process is continued until the loading ends. A numerical example is shown.

Solid reconstruction from orthographic opaque views using <b>incremental</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Computers & Graphics 1997; 21 (6) : 787 – 800; Shum SSP et al. A low-cost wireframe-to-solid implementation for reverse engineering. AUTOFACT' 97 Conference, 3 – 6 November 1997, MS 98 (159), 1 – 7] for translucent object domain. The algorithm has two extrusion stages. In each stage, geometric entities from only three orthogonal views (viz. top, front and right) are used. The entities involve both solid and dashed lines in each view. In the first stage, an exterior contour region in each view is swept along its normal direction {{according to the}} corresponding object dimension. As a result, three extrusion-solids are produced. Intersection of the three extrusion-solids forms a basic-solid. Next, all interior entities of each view are treated by a filtering process. If all interior entities are discarded in the filtering, the second stage will be skipped and the basic-solid becomes a solution-solid. On the other hand, if any interior entity remains after filtering, they are processed in the second stage to generate an excess-solid. In this case, the basic-solid subtracts the excess-solid to form the final three-dimensional solution-solid. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Excellent {{mechanical}} properties and corrosion resistance combined with low weight qualify b-titanium materials for lightweight applications in aviation, automotive and energy engineering. Thus far, actual applications {{of these materials}} have been limited due to high material costs and limited processing knowledge. One approach for developing resource-efficient manufacturing methods is the application of incremental forming methods. This article focuses {{on the development of}} the <b>incremental</b> spin <b>extrusion</b> process, which creates hollow profiles from solid bars. This method allows hollow shape manufacturing with a much higher flexibility than other forming methods and a significantly improved material utilization in comparison to machining methods, such as deep hole drilling. Beta-titanium alloys basically have very good cold forming suitability and the resulting material properties can be controlled. The application of incremental forming methods with high hydrostatic compressive stress is a promising manufacturing approach. The b-titanium Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al material has an excellent combination of the properties strength, ductility and fatigue strength. In order to utilize these properties the forming conditions and the temperature control need to be optimized. The investigations show that the Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al material can be formed only in a narrow semi-hot forming temperature window. The paper describes the investigation and presents results on the design of partial forming process sequences, forming properties, microstructure formation and failure prevention. The process design objective is a very fine microstructure with a homogeneous secondary a-phase and very small grained b-phase...|$|R
