5000|$|Due to Pough's violent {{behavior}} in the past, it was also ruled that he should never be allowed to own a gun, though this was never forwarded to police.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} frauds {{from the perspective of}} banking industry. The study seeks to evaluate the various causes that are responsible for banks frauds. It aims to examine the extent to which bank employees follow the various fraud prevention measures including the ones prescribed by Reserve Bank of India. It aims to give an insight on the perception of bank employees towards preventive mechanism and their awareness towards various frauds. The study signifies the importance of training in prevention of bank frauds. A strong system of internal control and good <b>employment</b> practices prevent <b>frauds</b> and mitigate losses. The research reveals that implementation of various internal control mechanisms are not up to the mark. The results indicate that lack of training, overburdened staff, competition, low compliance level (the degree to which procedures and prudential practices framed by Reserve bank of India to prevent frauds are followed) are the main reasons for bank frauds. The banks should take the rising graph of bank frauds seriously and need to ensure that there is no laxity in internal control mechanism...|$|R
50|$|If <b>employment</b> <b>fraud</b> is suspected, {{one should}} seek legal advice immediately. Whilst the main aim {{will be to}} obtain {{evidence}} that will stand up in court, one should proceed with caution. There is a risk of being taken to an employment tribunal should one's suspicions prove incorrect or should one act {{in a way that}} breaches an employee's employment law rights. In addition, the way one gathers evidence or checks personal data on employees must comply with the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act. Employers should always carry out a full identity check on any new employee.|$|E
50|$|Bangladesh {{does not}} fully comply with the minimum {{standards}} {{for the elimination of}} trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government has continued to address the sex trafficking of women and children. Despite these significant efforts, the government did not demonstrate evidence of increased efforts to prosecute and convict labor trafficking offenders, particularly those responsible for the fraudulent recruitment of Bangladeshi workers for the purpose of forced labor overseas. Similarly it did not demonstrate increased efforts to prevent the forced labor of Bangladeshi workers overseas through effective controls on high recruitment fees and other forms of fraudulent recruitment; therefore, Bangladesh is placed on the Tier 3 Watch List for the second consecutive year. Some government officials and members of civil society continue to believe the forced labor and debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers abroad was not considered labor trafficking, but rather <b>employment</b> <b>fraud</b> perpetrated on irregular migrants.|$|E

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Identity theft is a serious and growing problem in the United States.

The {{hundreds of thousands of}} taxpayers with tax problems caused by identity theft represent {{a small percentage of the}} expected 140 million individual returns filed, but for those affected, the problems can be quite serious.

GAO's testimony is based on its previous work on identity theft. GAO updated its analysis by examining data on identity theft cases and interviewing IRS officials. ...|$|E
