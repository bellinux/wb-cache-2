5|$|Johan Björnsson Printz, who it {{had been}} ennobled, was {{appointed}} {{to be the first}} royal governor of New Sweden, arriving in the colony on 15 February 1643.

5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E
5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, {{published}} an early form of periodic table, which <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> telluric helix or screw. He {{was the first}} person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|Olajuwon {{emigrated from}} Nigeria to play {{basketball}} at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} music of both {{sessions}} for its free, relaxed sound, but the lyrics {{were considered to be}} simple compared with those of his previous work. Morrison had intended to record the album a cappella with only vocal backing by a vocal group <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Street Choir, but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a backing band. Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir, and these changes and others have led him to regard Street Choir poorly in later years.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely {{another name for the}} elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Britain in November 1916, Crean resumed naval duties. On 15 December 1916 {{he was promoted}} to the rank of warrant officer (as a boatswain), in recognition of his service on the Endurance, and was awarded his third Polar Medal. On 5 September 1917, Crean married Ellen Herlihy of Annascaul. In early 1920, Shackleton was organising another Antarctic expedition, later {{to be known as the}} Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. He invited Crean to join him, along with other officers from the Endurance. By this time, however, Crean's second daughter had arrived, and he had plans to open a business following his naval career. He turned down Shackleton's invitation. On his last naval assignment, with HMS Hecla, Crean suffered a bad fall which caused lasting effects to his vision. As a result, he was retired on medical grounds on 24 March 1920. He and Ellen opened a small public house in Annascaul, which <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> South Pole Inn. The couple had three daughters, Mary, Kate, and Eileen, although Kate died when she was four years old.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler {{had ordered the}} {{construction}} of fortifications <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Wall all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. Concrete gun emplacements were constructed at strategic points along the coast, and wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{were placed on the}} beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. In addition to several static infantry divisions, eleven panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions were deployed nearby. Four of these formations were Waffen-SS divisions. In addition, the SS-Das Reich was located in Southern France, the LSSAH was in Belgium refitting after fighting in the Soviet Union, and the newly formed panzer division SS-Hitlerjugend, consisting of 17- and 18-year-old Hitler Youth members supported by combat veterans and experienced NCOs, was stationed west of Paris. The creation of the SS-Hitlerjugend was a sign of Hitler's desperation for more troops, especially ones with unquestioning obedience.|$|E
