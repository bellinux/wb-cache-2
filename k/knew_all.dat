5|$|She {{moved to}} Los Angeles and quickly secured {{a role in}} Dawson's Creek. Williams said later that she thought she <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> she needed to know since age15. She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> along and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{introduces}} his illegitimate son, Donald (Michael Benjamin Washington), to the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy {{as they do}} not believe that Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate and gives it to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> about Donald's scam, explaining he decided {{to go along with it}} because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E

40|$|Recently, several {{philosophers}} {{have moved}} from a classical account of divine omniscience according to which God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> truths to a restricted account of divine omniscience according to which God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> knowable truths. But an important objection offered by Alexander Pruss threatens to show that if God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> knowable truths, God must also <b>know</b> <b>all</b> truths. In this paper, I {{show that there is}} a way out of Pruss’s objection for the advocate of restricted omniscience if she will define her view in terms of ways of knowing rather than in terms of logical possibilities...|$|R

5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that Stern had paid ninemillion DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> along that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{appointed}} Victor Olof as his orchestral manager, {{and they}} started recruiting. At {{the top of their}} list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> Britain's orchestral leaders at first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.|$|E

5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E
25|$|Part III {{contains}} odes to four writers: Hart Crane, Delmore Schwartz, George Santayana, and Ford Madox Ford. At {{the time}} that Lowell published these poems, only Schwartz was still alive, and {{with the exception of}} Hart Crane, Lowell <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> of them personally and considered them to be mentors at different stages of his career.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} that St Peter's was completed, a style of {{architecture}} was developed by architects who <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> the rules that had been so carefully recovered, and chose to break them. The effect was a dynamic style of architecture in which the forms seem to take on life of their own, moving, swaying and undulating. The name Baroque means 'mis-shapen pearl'.|$|E

25|$|García Ábrego's {{arrest was}} even subject to {{allegations}} of corruption. It is believed the Mexican government <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> García Ábrego's whereabouts all along and {{had refused to}} arrest him due to information he possessed {{about the extent of}} corruption within the government. The arresting officer, a FJP commander, is believed to have received a bullet-proof Mercury Grand Marquis and $500,000 USD from a rival cartel for enacting the arrest of García Ábrego.|$|E
25|$|The ad depicts Mrs Claus as {{more modern}} than {{previous}} examples, with her riding a snowmobile and flying a helicopter while Santa is out delivering gifts {{in the traditional}} sleigh. At {{the conclusion of the}} ad, she says to Santa “Well it wouldn’t be fun if you <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> my secrets” suggesting she has a secret life assisting with Christmas present delivery. The brand also created a social media campaign in which Mrs. Claus answered requests and questions from members of the public.|$|E

25|$|Lanata also {{covered the}} fact that Báez, who was {{described}} as monopolizing all public works in Santa Cruz province, had bought several estates in Santa Cruz for US$28 million in 2007, allegedly having been informed that the province intended to build hydroelectric dams on the land. In addition, Lanata's program aired hidden-camera footage in which a Báez associate, Leonardo Fariña, admitted to involvement in a money-laundering network that handled proceeds from government corruption. Fariña had deposited 55 million euros of Báez's funds in Switzerland and said that Kirchner <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> about Báez's operations and was a partner in all of them.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged to {{continue}} her career, McVie recorded a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success {{as a member of}} Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name The Legendary Christine Perfect Album. After marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie, she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970. She had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House. The band had just lost founding member Peter Green, and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and since she <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> the lyrics to their songs, she went along.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Arab-Israeli {{friction}} {{that led up to}} the Israeli war of Independence, the Porat Yosef Yeshivah was virtually turned into a fortress against frequent flashes of violence. When the Jewish quarter of the Old City fell to the invading Jordanian Army, the Jordanians set fire to the yeshivah and all surrounding houses, destroying all the books and manuscripts that Rabbi Kaduri could not smuggle to Beit El Yeshiva (Yeshivat HaMekubalim) in Jerusalem. He <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> the writings of Rabbi Yitzhak Luria, the founder of modern Kabbalah by heart. After the passing of the leading kabbalist, Rabbi Efraim Hakohen, in 1989, the remaining kabbalists appointed Rabbi Kaduri as their head.|$|E

25|$|In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a {{non-profit}} group which {{assisted in the}} search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and unjust enrichment. TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead. TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children. It only learned that Anthony <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> along that Caylee was dead when the trial began. TES and Anthony eventually settled out of court on October 18, 2013. TES was listed as a creditor to Anthony and was entitled to $75,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{expeditions to}} inland Brazil {{are divided into}} two types: the entradas and the bandeiras. The entradas were done {{in the name of}} the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main {{objective}} was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and chart unknown territory. The bandeiras, on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the São Paulo region (the Paulistas). The expeditions of the bandeirantes, as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. The Paulistas, who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> the old indigenous pathways (the peabirus) through the Brazilian inland and were acclimated to the harsh conditions of these journeys.|$|E
25|$|His schoolbooks proved Macropedius to {{be a man}} {{of great}} humanist culture and {{follower}} of Erasmus. He <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> about the seven Free Arts and the Three Languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He was very familiar with classic Greek and Roman literature, with the Bible and with the writings of the Fathers of the Church as well. Many reprints of his textbooks in the Netherlands, in Germany, in France and in England prove that Macropedius’ activities were highly esteemed by his contemporaries and by the next generation of humanists as well. By writing his books and his teachings, Macropedius contributed very much to the successful humanist educational reform {{in the first part of}} the sixteenth century. He indefatigably promoted Greek, not only the reading of the New Testament but also the study of the works of the classic Greek authors.|$|E
