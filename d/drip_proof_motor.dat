50|$|Compare to the ODP (Open <b>Drip</b> <b>Proof)</b> <b>motor</b> design, {{which has}} {{ventilation}} openings which are guarded to prevent falling water {{from entering the}} motor windings.|$|E
50|$|Standardized NEMA & IEC {{motor frame}} sizes {{throughout}} the industry result in interchangeable dimensions for shaft, foot mounting, general aspects {{as well as}} certain motor flange aspect. Since an open, <b>drip</b> <b>proof</b> (ODP) <b>motor</b> design allows a free air exchange from outside to the inner stator windings, this style of motor tends to be slightly more efficient because the windings are cooler. A lower speed requires a larger frame.|$|R
5000|$|The {{handling}} of the XS Eleven was not as well received. [...] "When this behemoth of a motorcycle actually hits a corner at anything approaching interesting speeds then it takes {{a good deal of}} muscle to lay it down. While the Yamaha doesn't disgrace itself in corners (not as much as some Z1000s I have known, for example) it doesn't commend itself either." [...] Testers of the day all echoed the same story: [...] "The XS1100 was a solid bullet in a straight line, but cornering at high speeds was done at your own risk." [...] "Cycle warned its readers that the bike could easily go, stop and steer — just never two at the same time."Which Bike magazine simply described the XS1100 as having 'a bullet <b>proof</b> <b>motor,</b> and tea trolley handling'.|$|R
40|$|A {{biodiesel}} processor {{was developed}} and consists of a 20 - litre capacity reaction chamber in which the mixture was stirred {{by means of a}} mechanical stirrer with 7 blades and 4 baffles inside the chamber to reduce foaming and promote localized induced turbulence to enhance stirring. The stirrer is driven by a sparkless explosion <b>proof</b> electric <b>motor</b> through a reduction system to a maximum speed of 1000 rpm. The reactor is heated internally, thermally lagged and the temperature is controlled thermostatically to a maximum of 400 oC. The processor was tested with food grade palm oil and used cooking oils and the results obtained are similar to those for diesel fuel and within the specifications for biodiesel thus confirming that the processor can produce biodiesel within specification. This work aims at developing small biodiesel production plant that would enable small scale production of the commodity, for private consumption and commercial production...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a scalable design and verification methodology for FPGA-based motor drives for aircraft application, working at high-temperature environment. ProASICPlus from Actel Family (0. 22 μm digital CMOS 4 Layer Metal Flash-Based CMOS Process) {{was chosen to}} implement the studied motor drive which consists on a current control. The design is implemented at a frequency of 24 MHz and junction temperature above 125 °C. The die is supplied with 2. 25 v. The proposed methodology is based on similar ASIC design verification including synthesis, place and route, timing analysis steps for each control block. As entire system verification, a Real-Time Simulation (RTS) of the electrical systems is used to guarantee the <b>proof</b> of the <b>motor</b> drive functionality under several operating conditions. Co-simulation results are provided in order to prop up efficiency and interest of the proposed methodology in such application...|$|R
50|$|Office of Stop-DWI and Drug Prevention - {{works closely}} with {{municipalities}} in Westchester to minimize {{alcohol and drug abuse}} and reduce related injuries and traffic fatalities. The STOP-DWI program’s Patrol Project coordinates joint enforcement activities and reimburses municipalities for added DWI patrols and sobriety checkpoints. The STOP-DWI program also supports and funds the Standardized Field Sobriety Testing training given to police recruits and veteran officers from departments around the county. The office is also involved in numerous public education initiatives in Westchester communities that teach middle school, high school and college students about the hazards of alcohol and drugs. A driving simulator is brought to local high schools to give students hands-on <b>proof</b> that a <b>motor</b> vehicle cannot be operated safely when a driver is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. And Operation Safe Prom is a partnership between the county and local communities {{to reduce the number of}} alcohol-related incidents during prom season.|$|R
