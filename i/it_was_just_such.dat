500|$|Regarding the Wizard of Oz references, Underwood {{commented that}} [...] "it {{was all about}} having subtle references," [...] such as the plaid shirt and red shoes she wore on the video. When asked if her aim was to {{generate}} controversy with the storyline, the singer {{said that it was}} not what she were aiming for at all, adding: [...] "I try to stay away from controversy in any form or fashion. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a great story and such a mini-movie, listening to the song, and we really wanted to do it justice in the video." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{short film}} was {{produced}} by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh. [...] "City of Angels" [...] marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track [...] "Hurricane" [...] (2010).|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{treatment}} {{he received}} from the Pharisees was due to his having deserted their ranks at such a critical time. Quite in harmony with this supposition are the other sins laid to his charge; namely, that he rode in an ostentatious manner {{through the streets of}} Jerusalem on a Day of Atonement which fell upon a Sabbath, and that he was bold enough to overstep the [...] "teḥum" [...] (the limits of the Sabbath-day journey). Both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds agree here, and cite this as proof that Elisha turned from Pharisaism to heresy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> non-observance of customs that excited the anger of Akiva (Sotah 27b). The Jewish Encyclopedia writes that the mention of the [...] "Holy of Holies" [...] in this passage is not an anachronism, as Grätz thinks, for {{while it is true that}} Eliezer and Joshua were present as the geonim par excellence at Elisha's circumcisionwhich must, therefore, have occurred after the death of Johanan ben Zakkai (80)it is also true that the [...] "Holy of Holies" [...] is likewise mentioned in connection with Rabbi Akiva (Makkot, end); indeed, the use of this expression is due to the fact that the Rabbis held holiness to be inherent in the place, not in the building (Yevamot 6b).|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an {{engagement}} as {{might lead to}} one between yourself and Priscilla!" [...] exclaimed Dus, certainly not without alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense! You are a {{guest of}} my house, and for all I know <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an {{opportunity}} as this that Girolamo is seeking.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I am {{too much}} {{interested}} to judge fairly," [...] said Julius. [...] "I should {{like you to}} consult some one--say Dr. Easterby--but {{it seems to me}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a vow as you may well be absolved from." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Needwood {{took out}} her pocket-handkerchief, where her initials, H. N., were beautifully worked. Jessie had admired her own work, but this was much better. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an N as she wanted, and she exclaimed-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> {{a report}} as medical men often make--one which leaves the anxious ones in {{quite as much}} {{suspense}} as before, and neither Ralph nor Bob was just certain whether it was favorable to their friend or not.|$|E
60|$|The {{representation}} struck Tom as so comical that he {{was compelled}} to laugh outright; he simply couldn't help it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a joke as he might have played years before, perhaps on old Josiah Crabtree, when at Putnam Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> {{an excuse}} as yours. I did not {{positively}} command {{you not to}} go near the boys, or {{not to have any}} conversation with them at all, though I expressed my wish that you would not, so that you could not help understanding it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was,</b> indeed, <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a spot as Jet {{would have}} asked for.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Munger seized her opportunity. [...] "Yes; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> {{cases as}} this that the Social Union is {{designed}} to meet. If this man had some such place to spend his evenings--and bring his family if he chose--where {{he could get a}} cup of good coffee for the same price as a glass of rum--Don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t give a cent for the directory,” said he, “I’ve been past {{here one}} night in the {{schooner}} Eugenie; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a night as this; they were fishing with torches, and the beach was thick with lights like a town.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} it," [...] said Benjamin doubtfully. [...] "I don't half like {{the look of}} things. I believe we're in for a squall before long. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a day {{three years ago when}} that terrible squall came up that Joe Otway got drowned in." ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner we {{rode out}} to see the old church, in whose {{enclosure}} the remains of Clarkson repose. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a still, quiet, mossy old church as you have read of in story books, with the graveyard spread all around it, like a thoughtful mother, who watches the resting of her children.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Naturally. But I {{am looking}} {{for a young man}} who is making {{sketches}} in some of these buildings, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> as likely as not that he is in the crypt under this choir, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> out-of-the-way nooks that he prefers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> very provoking that he should not have told me more distinctly in his letter where to find him.' ...|$|R
60|$|Drayton is a sweet poet, and Selden's {{notes to}} {{the early part of}} the Polyolbion are well worth your perusal. Daniel is a {{superior}} man; his diction is pre-eminently pure,--of that quality which I believe has always existed somewhere in society. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> English, without any alteration, as Wordsworth or Sir George Beaumont might have spoken or written in the present day.|$|R
60|$|How I {{have been}} sleeping! This relief of renewed {{normality}} is delicious--thanks to Miss West. Now why did not Captain West, or Mr. Pike, both experienced men, diagnose my trouble for me? And {{then there was}} Wada. But no; it required Miss West. Again I contemplate the problem of woman. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an incident among a million others that keeps the thinker's gaze fixed on woman. They truly are the mothers and the conservers of the race.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{no doubt}} what it was, and cried out joyfully to ask how he had done it. [...] "I told him who first {{discovered}} {{the capabilities of the}} clay, and laid the state of the case before him. He was very much touched, said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a matter as needed severity at the time, but was sure to be pardoned now." ...|$|E
60|$|A shout {{came from}} the woods as Pollock approached. This {{surprised}} the Germans and Duval, and, noting {{the number of men}} coming on, they were bewildered and {{did not know what to}} do. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a diversion as the boys were hoping for, and in a trice they had rushed for their guns and secured their weapons. Then Jack sent up a shout.|$|E
60|$|They {{carried me}} in, and laid me {{down on a}} bed, in a sweet little room, very plain but dainty. It was {{panelled}} with polished pitchpine, and roses peeped in at the open window. Everything about the cottage bore the impress of native good taste. I knew it was Jack's home. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a room as I should have expected from Elsie.|$|E
60|$|When, however, I saw {{indications}} {{rather than}} traces {{that someone had}} already used it to camp in, I changed my mind, and thought that whenever I should get an opportunity I would tell the Vladika of <b>it,</b> as he <b>is</b> a man on whose discretion I can rely. If we ever have a war here or any sort of invasion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> places that may be dangerous. Even in my own case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much too near the Castle to be neglected.|$|R
6000|$|LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--It {{is a small}} {{help that}} I can afford, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> help that one can give as coming from the heart through the mouth. The report of Mr. Meyer was admirable, and I was as {{interested}} in it as you have been. Why, I'm twice as old as he, and I've had so much experience that I would say to him, when he makes his appeal for help: [...] "Don't make it for to-day or to-morrow, but collect the money on the spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hester nodded sympathetically. “Of course, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in <b>just</b> <b>such</b> {{cases the}} effort {{is most likely to}} prove beneficial,” she said. “Have you had any word from Tony since he left?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is nothing, Chebron; but {{the sight}} of this wide water takes my {{thoughts}} homeward. Our city stood on a sea like this, not so large as they say is this Great Sea we are looking at, but far too large for the eye to see across, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a view as this that I looked upon daily from the walls of our palace, save that the shores were higher." ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{not taken}} above half of his first nap, when he was awakened by the clock of the chateau, in the turret over his chamber, which struck midnight. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an old clock as ghosts are fond of. It had a deep, dismal tone, and struck so slowly and tediously that my uncle thought it would never have done. He counted and counted till he was {{confident}} he counted thirteen, and then it stopped.|$|E
60|$|Anna {{looked about}} her admiringly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a bedroom {{as she would}} have chosen for herself. The {{colouring}} was green and white, with softly shaded electric lights, an alcove bedstead, which was a miracle of daintiness, white furniture, and a long low dressing-table littered all over with a multitude of daintily fashioned toilet appliances. Through an open door was {{a glimpse of the}} bathroom--a vision of luxury, out of which Annabel herself, in a wonderful dressing-gown and followed by a maid presently appeared.|$|E
60|$|It {{has also}} the faintest and most {{ethereal}} perfume,--a perfume {{that seems to}} come and go in the air like music; and you perceive it at a little distance from a tuft of them, when you would not if you gathered and smelled them. On the whole, the primrose is a poet's and a painter's flower. An artist's eye would notice an exquisite harmony between the yellow-green hue of its leaves and the tint of its blossoms. I do not wonder that <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> so great a favorite among the poets. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a flower as Mozart and Raphael would have loved.|$|R
6000|$|... “If this be so,” cried Keawe, “it is a {{very ill}} way to serve me by killing my relatives. But <b>it</b> may <b>be,</b> indeed; for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a station that I saw the house with my mind’s eye.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> by <b>just</b> <b>such</b> sophistries {{that the}} Cardinal-legate seeks to cloak the {{disorders}} of his life. 'Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor?' is his philosophy. If he would encage the most sacrilegious fellow in Piacenza, let him encage himself." ...|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Whitefoot {{was very}} well {{satisfied}} with her old home {{and not at all}} anxious to leave it. It was in an old hollow stump close to the ground. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a place as Shadow the Weasel would be sure to visit should he happen along that way. It didn't seem at all safe to Whitefoot. In fact it worried him. Then, too, it was not in such a pleasant place as was his own home. Of course he didn't say this, but pretended to admire everything.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} the stranger {{entered the room}} where she {{was standing by the}} window, looking out upon the bare branches of the trees in Bloomsbury Square. She remembered afterwards, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> another foggy afternoon as the afternoon of the stranger's arrival three months before. No one else was in the room. The stranger closed the door, and came towards her with that curious, quick-leaping step of his. His long coat was tightly buttoned, and in his hands he carried his old felt hat and the massive knotted stick that was almost a staff.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a {{party that}} {{continually}} grew up at Hollywell, for Mr. Edmonstone was so fond of inviting, that his wife never knew in the morning how many would assemble at her table in the evening. But {{she was used to}} it, and too good a manager even to be called so. She liked to see her husband enjoy himself in his good-natured, open-hearted way. The change was good for Charles, and thus it did very well, and there were few houses in the neighbourhood more popular than Hollywell.|$|E
60|$|Second. So, then, the everlastingness of the {{punishment}} lieth here, {{if the person}} suffering be not able to make amends to justice for the sins for which he suffereth; else justice neither would nor could, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just,</b> keep <b>such</b> still under punishment.|$|R
6000|$|... "If this be so," [...] cried Keawe, [...] "it is a {{very ill}} way to serve me by killing my relatives. But <b>it</b> may <b>be,</b> indeed; for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a station that I saw the house with my mind's eye." ...|$|R
60|$|Hardly had {{the words}} left the soldier's lips when down came {{something}} tumbling about his ears from {{up in the}} air; and what should <b>it</b> <b>be</b> but <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a suit of clothes as {{he had in his}} mind--all crusted over with gold and silver and jewels.|$|R
