[...] By default, the <b>email</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> {{converted into a}} format that does not allow a crawler to see the full email address; for example, [...] "mailme@example.com" [...] would be converted to [...] "mai...@example.com". The visitor would then click on the [...] "..." [...] and solve the CAPTCHA {{in order to obtain}} the full email address.

Several thousand U.S[...]mil and [...]gov <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>were</b> registered on the site. In the days following the breach, extortionists began targeting people whose details {{were included in the}} leak, attempting to scam over US$200 worth of Bitcoins from them. One company started offering a [...] "search engine" [...] where people could type <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> of colleagues or their spouse into the website, and if the <b>email</b> <b>address</b> <b>was</b> on the database leak, then the company would send them letters threatening that their details were to be exposed unless they paid money to the company.|$|R

50|$|Assuring an <b>email</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> of a {{good quality}} {{requires}} a combination of various validation techniques.

5000|$|Images : Using {{images to}} display part {{or all of}} an <b>email</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> a very {{effective}} harvesting countermeasure.

50|$|An <b>email</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} recognized as having two parts joined with an at-sign (@).

40|$|Analysis {{of traffic}} logs of email {{received}} {{by a large}} UK ISP shows considerable disparity between the proportions of spam received by addresses with different first characters. This disparity is quite marked when only <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> {{that appear to be}} ?real? are considered. The root cause is likely to be spammers using ?dictionary? or ?Rumpelstiltskin? attacks to guess valid <b>email</b> <b>addresses.</b> There <b>is</b> limited evidence for these attacks taking place in real-time, suggesting that most ?fake? <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>were</b> constructed sometime in the past and are now immortalised within spammer databases...|$|R
5000|$|Spam 2.0 {{offers a}} far more {{attractive}} proposition for spammers as compared to traditional spam specifically email spam. Web 2.0 applications can be discovered through a simple search engine query that contains domain keywords and a web 2.0 application (e.g. [...] "photography forum" [...] for web 2.0 forum groups that are interested in photographs). <b>Email</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> procured {{in a similar fashion}} except <b>email</b> <b>address</b> details <b>are</b> commonly tightly controlled online and are far more difficult to source.|$|R
50|$|<b>Email</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> often {{requested}} as {{input to}} website as user identification {{for the purpose}} of data validation.

5000|$|If someone's <b>email</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> [...] "someone@finance.somecompany.example", the doppelganger domain {{would be}} [...] "financesomecompany.example".

5000|$|The {{format of}} <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>is</b> [...] where the local part may {{be up to}} 64 {{characters}} long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 characters—but the maximum of 256-character length of a forward or reverse path restricts the entire <b>email</b> <b>address</b> to <b>be</b> no more than 254 characters long. The formal definitions are in RFC 5322 (sections 3.2.3 and 3.4.1) and RFC 5321—with a more readable form given in the informational RFC 3696 and the associated errata.|$|R
