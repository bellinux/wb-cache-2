5|$|Deprived of a {{rationale}} for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation {{that all of the}} town's <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> invalid, since the <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elections</b> <b>were</b> held on 19 November 1933. A {{second round}} of voting was held in sixteen {{constituencies}} on 3 December.|$|E
5|$|Presidential <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> again held in 2002 amid {{allegations}} of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud. The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and intimidation {{were made by}} the MDC and Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies. Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.|$|E
50|$|Unless {{an early}} <b>election</b> <b>is</b> called or the <b>election</b> date <b>is</b> set to {{circumvent}} holding a by-election, a general <b>election</b> <b>is</b> held every three years. The last <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held on Saturday, 20 September 2014.|$|R
50|$|Note: The 2004 <b>election</b> <b>was</b> for {{the whole}} Council. Other <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> for {{a third of the}} Council. For them the overall totals, after the <b>election,</b> <b>are</b> given in brackets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Elections</b> <b>are</b> held {{at least}} every four years. The last <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held on 8 June 2015. The system of <b>elections</b> <b>is</b> Westminster-style. The parties {{nominate}} candidates on a nomination day, then the <b>election</b> <b>is</b> held several weeks later. Government is formed by the leader best able to command {{a majority in the}} House.|$|R
5|$|Under Tshombe's interim government, fresh <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> {{scheduled}} for 30 March and the rebellion {{broke out in}} the central and eastern parts of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|After Laporta's {{departure}} from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes. Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40million and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elections</b> <b>were</b> {{not held}} {{on a regular}} schedule; they {{occurred}} usually every five to six years, upon Emperor's decree. Thus the deputies' term of office lasted about six years. The Diet had ten elections: 1861, 1867, 1870, 1877, 1883, 1889, 1889, 1895, 1901, 1908, and the final one, in 1913.|$|E
40|$|Abstract One of {{the common}} {{normative}} assumptions about <b>elections</b> <b>is</b> that competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> inherently good, and non-competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> problematic. This paper challenges that assumption. At the level of individual elections, competitive elections pro-duce either sub-optimal results or trivially optimal results, but competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> never uniquely optimal. In aggregation, competitive elections {{for a set of}} offices are inher-ently sub-optimal. From a procedural perspective, the circumstances in which competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> appropriate are rare, and from a diagnostic perspective, we cannot conclude that there are problems in the electoral system based on a lack of competition. In the context of social choice theory, competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> not inherently good...|$|R
5|$|Depending {{on whether}} the judge has {{determined}} that the <b>election</b> <b>was</b> valid or void, the <b>election</b> return <b>is</b> confirmed or altered. If the <b>election</b> <b>is</b> declared void, the Prime Minister is empowered to order that another <b>election</b> <b>be</b> held within {{six months of the}} determination.|$|R
50|$|The <b>election</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} on 5 April 2005 and the <b>election</b> <b>is</b> {{to be held}} on 5 May 2005.|$|R
5|$|General <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008. The {{official}} results {{required a}} runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader; the MDC challenged these results, claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} recent polls in 2012, Abdel Karim Abu Aql was elected mayor on a leftist {{alliance}} list as were the other 12 people elected to the council.

50|$|The <b>election</b> <b>was</b> contested again {{using the}} STV system of {{proportional}} representation, and {{similar to the}} 2012 Scottish Local <b>Election</b> <b>was</b> delayed 1 year to ensure this <b>election</b> <b>was</b> not held {{the same day as}} the 2016 Scottish Parliament <b>elections</b> (that <b>was</b> delayed a year due to the 2015 General Election).|$|R
50|$|After the 2014 <b>election</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} void, a new <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held on 11 June 2015.|$|R
5|$|The 1991 <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> {{characterized}} by {{a large number of}} competing parties, many claiming the legacy of anti-communism, and the Solidarity party garnered only 5% of the votes.|$|E
5|$|The President of the European Parliament (Parliament's speaker) is Antonio Tajani (EPP), {{elected in}} January 2017. He presides over a multi-party chamber, {{the two largest}} groups being the Group of the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S). The last union-wide <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> the 2014 elections.|$|E
5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the constitutional name {{in order to}} join NATO. <b>Elections</b> <b>were</b> called {{following the}} 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the centre-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> marred by violence that was criticized by NATO members. Ethnic tensions have persisted in Macedonia, and NATO has called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. Zaev also floated the idea of Macedonia joining the alliance under the provisional name it uses at the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|According to top Marine officials, the <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} to help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott. The simultaneous elections for the provincial council were won by the Iraqi Islamic Party, which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{imbalance}} {{was created}} in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite. Southern Cameroon opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while Northern Cameroons chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. In 1963, the nation established a Federal Republic, with Azikiwe as its first president. When <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> held in 1965, the Nigerian National Democratic Party came to power in Nigeria's Western Region.|$|E
