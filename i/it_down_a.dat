5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|On 3/4 June 1942 MacLachlan {{infiltrated}} a {{group of}} Do 217s from KG 2 as they orbited in preparation for landing at Saint-André-sur-Orne. Within 14 seconds he had shot down two bombers and damaged two more (victories 12–13) before German defences were alerted and began returning fire. Flying with Kuttelwascher, they trailed a formation of 15 German bombers that had raided Poole. Sighting them over their own airfield he destroyed one and then was detected by searchlights. Taking evasive action he latched onto another and shot <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> <b>A</b> third and fourth were damaged. Kuttelwascher arrived and as MacLachlan left and claimed another He 111 and Do 217. MacLachlan saw two flashes on the ground denoting a crashed aircraft after he attacked. German records show two Do 217s shot down one crash-landed and one severely damaged. MacLachlan's first victim {{appears to have been}} Unteroffizier Gerhard Wagner's Wrk Nr. 5392 Do 217 from 3./KG 2. Wagner, Feldwebel Wilhelm Oberwohr, Unteroffizier Josef Maier and Oberfledwebel Anton Lamm were killed. Another II./KG 2 Do 217 crashed there while another was severely damaged. Another Do 217 fell 40 miles south of Cherbourg but this machine—Wrk nr. 5331 piloted by Feldwebel Hans Koch of 7./KG 2—was likely a victim of Kuttelwascher. All of the crew were killed in action. It was MacLachlan's last victory with the squadron. He flew five more intruder sorties during which he returned via Antwerp and Ostend at near-zero feet after his map had blown out the side-canopy window on 26 June and chased a Ju 88 45 miles south of Selsey Bill without result on 2 July.|$|E

25|$|Pop bumpers are {{operated}} by a switch connected to a ring surrounding the bottom circumference of the bumper that is suspended several millimeters above the playfield surface. When the ball rolls over this ring and forces one side of <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> <b>a</b> switch is closed that activates the bumper's solenoid. This pulls down a tapered ring surrounding the central post of the bumper that pushes downward and outward on the ball, propelling it away.|$|E

Crystal later went on to provide the voice of Mike Wazowski in the blockbuster Pixar film Monsters, Inc. (2001), and reprised his voice role in the prequel, Monsters University, which was released in June 2013. Crystal also provided the voice of Calcifer in the English version of Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle (2004).|$|E
25|$|The sizable {{decline in}} U.S. {{manufacturing}} jobs since 2000 has been blamed on various causes, such as trade with a rising Asia, offshoring of jobs with few restrictions to lower wage countries, innovation in global supply chains (e.g., containerization), and other technology improvements. The millions of construction jobs created during the housing bubble that peaked in 2006 helped mask {{some of this}} adverse employment impact initially. Further, households dramatically increased their debt burden from 2001-2007, extracting home equity for use in consumption. However, the housing bubble collapse in 2006-2008 contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis and resulting Great Recession, which resulted in households switching from adding debt to paying <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> <b>a</b> headwind to the economy for several years thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Franklin Pierce was {{a member}} of the U.S. House of Representatives by the time they married and became a U.S. Senator in 1837. She was forced to become the {{political}} wife she never wanted to be. Jane hated life in Washington, D.C., and encouraged her husband to resign his Senate seat and return to New Hampshire, which he did in 1842. She blamed politics for all the troubles in her life including the death of her child and Franklin's excessive alcohol consumption. Service in the Mexican-American War brought him the rank of Brigadier General and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four more years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire. Unfortunately their son Frank passed from typhus a year later, causing stress for the entire family and leading to health issues for Jane. In 1842, President James K. Polk offered Franklin the U.S. attorney post; however, due to Jane's objection, he turned <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> <b>A</b> senate seat and New Hampshire governor was also offered, and again he turned it down for family reasons.|$|E

25|$|When the U.S. Civil War commenced, a {{training}} camp {{was established in}} West Chester, and the Union army recruited heavily in the region. Named Camp Wayne in 1861 after Revolutionary War general Anthony Wayne, it was situated {{at the corner of}} Church Street and Rosedale Avenue. Critics complained about the poor location as a strategic point, but supporters praised its flat terrain and open space. In any case the Ninth Regiment, with three Chester County companies, arrived at the camp on May 4, 1861, although some men were forced to temporarily lodge at the court house. The 97th regiment was formed by local businessman Henry Guss and trained at the camp, and 143 of its 950 men were from West Chester. The Village Record reported on January 18, 1862, that threats of arson at Camp Wayne forced its commanders to take <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> <b>A</b> second camp, named Camp Elder, was formed it West Chester in 1863 as a recruiting point for black soldiers. However, it became a parole camp after the Battle of Gettysburg, and 2,000 men were sent there to work on farms for three months.|$|E

[...] "Achtung Baby was U2's 'Holy shit!' moment," [...] remarked drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. [...] "I {{was in high school}} when it came out and we'd drive around in my friend's mom's car and rock that shit all the time. When we were asked to record a cover, 'Ultraviolet' was a unanimous choice. It's reassuring to know that we're still on the same page after all these years. We brought it back to its bare bones, dumbed <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> little, took it back to the rock song underneath." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2006, pre-trial {{proceedings}} began in Grasse, before the investigating Magistrate, Catherine Bonnici. The proceedings {{were part of}} the French investigative process that is used to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to send a case to trial. During the first week of June, the court travelled to the site where the peer's body was found. Mohamed M'Barek was transported in leg chains for the one-day reenactment. Once they arrived, M'Barek demonstrated that he had enough strength to have acted alone. He managed to lift a [...] dummy — the same weight as Shaftesbury's body — out of the boot of a car and dump <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> ravine.|$|E

They discover that Retna Sari's mother is Soerijati, explaining the familial resemblance. She reveals {{that she had been}} found and raised by Noesa Brama's father; she also tells of a statue of Vishnu in a cave atop Mount Ciwalirang with the inscription [...] "At the time when I am damaged, the land and all your descendants will be destroyed, cursed by Rakata's anger", damage to which the priests believe caused the Krakatoa eruption. Unknown to them, Noesa Brama– enraged at the thought of his daughter marrying a commoner– has deliberately destroyed this statue by throwing <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> well, causing the eruption which stopped the fugitives.|$|E
500|$|Stewart {{declared}} that his rally {{was intended for}} the majority of Americans, [...] "the 70–80 percenters," [...] who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media. To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: [...] "Take <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> notch for America." [...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." [...] Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own [...] "March to Keep Fear Alive."

500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The fear in of {{the fourth}} floor refers to tetraphobia, the superstitious fear of the number four. Jokes about this have been {{featured}} in such pop culture works as the 1999 film Being John Malkovich and the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. The song [...] "Unskinny Bop", a 1990 single by the band Poison, plays {{during one of the}} strip club scenes. Leslie said Tom hides his emotions behind [...] "a very thick layer of Axe body spray", a reference to the real-life male grooming product. The Parks department employees eat at a restaurant called Jurassic Fork, a reference to the Steven Spielberg dinosaur adventure film Jurassic Park, which was adapted from a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. During one scene, Tom refers to Ron as [...] "Rondoleezza Rice", a reference to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the strip club, Leslie mistakenly refers to a stripper named Sierra by the name Seabiscuit, a champion thoroughbred racehorse. Reflecting on his marriage, Tom said, [...] "At least we lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and that guy from Sum 41", a reference to the pop singer's short-lived marriage to Sum 41 guitarist Deryck Whibley. Tom says one of the strippers also works at Quiznos, a sandwich fast-food franchise; Tom says of her: [...] "She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos." [...] Andy said he has a T-shirt that is [...] "literally priceless" [...] because he was wearing it when he tackled American singer Eddie Vedder. When Ron was commenting on how well Tom was pretending to be sad about his divorce, he tells Tom, [...] "Take <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> notch. You've already won your Oscar, DiCaprio," [...] which is a reference to the Academy Awards and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.|$|E
