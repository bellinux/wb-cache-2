5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{observed}} {{values of}} the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction would bind the dineutron and the diproton, and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen {{in the early universe}} to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> <b>would</b> not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be fair to say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters {{asserted}} that Erotica [...] "set the blueprint for modern pop... Without Madonna, modern pop as we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be unimaginable." [...] He noticed the album's influence on various {{artists such as}} Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lady Gaga, and Nicki Minaj. Critics also found its influence on Janet Jackson's 1997 album The Velvet Rope, with Daryl Easlea from BBC writing that Jackson's album [...] "resembles Erotica by Madonna at times, in subject manner and style." [...] Jeni Wren Stottrup from The Portland Mercury believed that [...] "Erotica should be {{recognized as one of}} Madonna's greatest albums. While it marks the end of the pinnacle of her fame, it set the stage for empowered pop artists like Beyoncé and Britney, de-stigmatizing the bedroom and expanding the possibilities for women in pop. Erotica lives today as a reminder of the true fearlessness that made Madonna an icon." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} the song [...] "Montana" [...] by Youth Lagoon {{during the final}} scene. Many viewers wondered if the series creator had changed the ending for the last episode, due to the cancellation of the series. This caused series creator and executive producer Killen to assure viewers that the episode would have been [...] "exactly the same" [...] {{if it had been}} renewed for a second season. In a pre-broadcast interview by Entertainment Weekly with Killen and actor Jason Isaacs, Isaacs claimed that he found it [...] "strangely ironic and amusing" [...] to be promoting the series finale of the Awake series. Killen claimed that [...] "When we wrote the episode, we didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be the end of the}} series". He stated that it had a [...] "satisfying conclusion", [...] "and I think it will be a satisfying way to leave the show".|$|E

500|$|The cast began rehearsing, {{but after}} 20 minutes {{stopped and turned}} to Cherones, who agreed to talk to Charles. While {{on his way to}} Charles' office, Cherones met Castle Rock {{executive}} Glenn Padnick and informed him about the cast's reaction to the episode. Cherones said that Padnick was relieved to hear this, and they both discussed the problem with Charles, and decided not to use the script. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable." [...] The replacement episode called [...] "The Phone Message" [...] was written by David and Seinfeld in two days.|$|E
500|$|On the surface, it {{may seem}} that the Smoking Man merely tries to hide {{information}} from Mulder and Scully, but {{there is much more}} to him. He is involved in the Syndicate, a shadow organization which includes members of the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize Earth. The Smoking Man often ruthlessly protects the secrets of the conspiracy, and serves as the main antagonist to Mulder, who has an equally consuming devotion to reveal the truth in the first seven seasons. His stated justification is a desire to prevent the alien colonization for as long as possible; in the episode [...] "One Breath", he tells Mulder that he is in the conspiracy (which he calls [...] "the game") because he believes that the secrets he keeps could, if publicly revealed, threaten the social order that preserves society: [...] "If people were to know of the things that I <b>know...</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> all fall apart". He is at times shown working towards that goal, particularly in connection with developing a vaccine to protect people from the [...] "black oil", a parasitic agent which the alien Colonists use to propagate themselves.|$|E
500|$|However, {{during the}} {{read-through}} of the episode, it was negatively received by {{cast and crew}} members; both Alexander and director Tom Cherones felt the episode's gun content was too provocative. When she read a scene that referenced the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and William McKinley, Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander and stated, [...] "I'm not gonna do this." [...] Though {{they did not want}} to, the cast started rehearsing. After twenty minutes they convinced Cherones to talk to Charles. On his way to Charles' office, Cherones bumped into NBC executive Glenn Padnick, with whom he talked to Charles, eventually agreeing not to film the episode. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable." [...] Both Lathan and Sabella were given roles in later episodes; Lathan appeared as Patti in the season three episode [...] "The Stranded", while Sabella was cast as the [...] "greasy naked guy" [...] in [...] "The Subway", also for the show's third season.|$|E

2500|$|Thus, {{while there}} is reason to suspect that the four [...] "life elements" [...] ought to be readily {{available}} elsewhere, a habitable system probably also requires a supply of long-term orbiting bodies to seed inner planets.

2500|$|Is it {{not obvious}} {{that there are}} always enough moral {{problems}} without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. [...] "But", someone says, [...] "we didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> happen." [...] Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; {{and it would be}} nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 August 2009, Megrahi {{withdrew his}} appeal. South of Scotland SNP MSP Christine Grahame said, [...] "There {{are a number}} of vested {{interests}} who have been deeply opposed to this appeal continuing as they <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> go a considerable way towards exposing the truth behind Lockerbie... In the next days, weeks and months new information will be placed in the public domain that will make it clear that Mr Megrahi {{had nothing to do with}} the bombing of Pan Am 103." [...] Tam Dalyell, the former Labour MP for West Lothian, has long believed Megrahi was the victim of a catastrophic miscarriage of justice, and has publicly stated that Megrahi is merely a scapegoat. Dalyell was supported by Nelson Mandela, the Church of Scotland, the Catholic Church, the law faculties of the Scottish universities, the representatives of British relatives and the UN's official observer at the trial in The Hague.|$|E

2500|$|Carter {{chose to}} focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has {{resulted}} in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the [...] "fundamental parameters"—that is, the dimensionless physical constants and initial conditions for the Big Bang. Carter and others have argued that life as we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is fine tuned to permit life. Collins & Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that [...] "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions". If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the [...] "typical" [...] universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.|$|E
