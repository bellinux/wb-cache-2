Present paper highlights a rare variation of branching pattern of coeliac trunk which was observed during rou-tine dissection. In a 63 year old male cadaver, we observed a bifurcation of coeliac trunk into short hepato-splenic and longer hepato-gastric trunks.

40|$|The good {{knowledge}} for the normal <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> distribution {{and the possible}} anatomical variations is significant in liver transplantation {{in order for the}} vascularity not to be disturbed and to cause necrosis of the liver parenchyma postoperatively. Disruption of an anatomical artery variation is uncommon in liver hilum dissection, but non establishment of continuity in time of reconstruction is an important cause for postoperative complications such as acute liver failure and augment morbidity and mortality. The aim of this case report is to present a non published anatomical variation of accessory right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising from <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> between the branching of gastroduodenal artery and bifurcation of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> to right and left branches...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{safety and}} feasibility of microcoil embolization {{of the common}} <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> under <b>proper</b> or distal balloon inflation in preoperative preparation for en bloc celiac axis resection for pancreatic body cancer. METHODS: Fifteen patients (11 males, 4 females; median age, 67 years) with pancreatic body cancer involving the nerve plexus surrounding the celiac artery underwent microcoil embolization. To alter the total hepatic blood flow from superior mesenteric artery (SMA), microcoil embolization of the common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> (CHA) was conducted in 2 cases under balloon inflation at the proximal end of the CHA and in 13 cases under distal microballoon inflation at the distal end of the CHA. RESULTS: Of the first two cases of microcoil embolization with proximal balloon inflation, the first was successful, but there was microcoil migration to the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> in the second. The migrated microcoil was withdrawn to the CHA by an inflated microballoon catheter. Microcoil embolization was successful in the other 13 cases with distal microballoon inflation, with no microcoil migration. Compact microcoil embolization under distal microballoon inflation created sufficient resistance against the vascular wall to prevent migration. Distal balloon inflation achieved the requisite 1 cm patency at the CHA end for vascular clamping. All patients underwent en bloc celiac axis resection without arterial reconstruction or liver ischemia. CONCLUSION: To impede microcoil migration to the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> during CHA microcoil embolization, distal microballoon inflation is preferable to proximal balloon inflation...|$|R
5000|$|Between the {{two layers}} of the lesser omentum, close to the right free margin, are the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper,</b> the common bile duct, the portal vein, lymphatics, and the hepatic plexus of nerves—all these {{structures}} being enclosed in a fibrous capsule (Glisson's capsule).|$|E
50|$|The {{portal vein}} or {{hepatic portal vein}} is a blood vessel that carries blood from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. This blood is rich in nutrients that have been extracted from food, and the liver processes these nutrients; it also filters toxins {{that may have been}} ingested with the food. 75% of total liver blood flow is through the portal vein, with the remainder coming from the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper.</b> The blood leaves the liver to the heart in the hepatic veins.|$|E
50|$|The {{central area}} or hilum, {{known as the}} porta hepatis is where the common bile duct, hepatic portal vein, and the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper</b> enter the liver. The duct, vein, and artery divide into left and right branches, and {{the areas of the}} liver {{supplied}} by these branches constitute the functional left and right lobes. The functional lobes are separated by the imaginary plane, Cantlie's line, joining the gallbladder fossa to the inferior vena cava. The plane separates the liver into the true right and left lobes. The middle hepatic vein also demarcates the true right and left lobes. The right lobe is further divided into an anterior and posterior segment by the right hepatic vein. The left lobe is divided into the medial and lateral segments by the left hepatic vein.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Anatomic {{variations}} in the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> were studied in donor livers that were used for orthotopic transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Variations have occurred in 25 % to 75 % of cases. Donor livers represent an appropriate model for study because extrahepatic arterial anatomy must be defined precisely to ensure complete arterialization of the graft at time of transplantation. METHODS: Records of 1000 patients who underwent liver harvesting for orthotopic transplantation between 1984 and 1993 were reviewed. RESULTS: Arterial patterns in order of frequency included the normal Type 1 anatomy (n = 757), with the common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising from the celiac axis to form the gastroduodenal and <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> and the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> dividing distally into right and left branches; Type 3 (n = 106), with a replaced or accessory right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> originating from the superior mesenteric artery; Type 2 (n = 97), with a replaced or accessory left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising from the left gastric artery; Type 4 (n = 23), with both right and left <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> arising from the superior mesenteric and left gastric arteries, respectively; Type 5 (n = 15), with the entire common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising as {{a branch of the}} superior mesenteric; and Type 6 (n = 2), with the common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> originating directly from the aorta. CONCLUSIONS: These data are useful for the planning and conduct of surgical and radiological procedures of the upper abdomen, including laparoscopic operations of the biliary tract...|$|R
40|$|The {{shortage}} of organ donors has stimulated {{interest in the}} possibility of using animal organs for transplantation into humans. In addition, pigs are now considered to be the most likely source animals for human xenotransplantation because of their advantages over non-human primates. However, the appropriate standard values for estimations of the liver of micropigs have not been established. The determination of standard values for the micropig liver using multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) would help to select a suitable donor for an individual patient, determine the condition of the liver of the micropigs and help predict patient prognosis. Therefore, we determined the standard values for the livers of micropigs using MDCT. The liver parenchyma showed homogenous enhancement and had no space-occupying lesions. The total and right lobe volumes of the liver were 698. 57 ± 47. 81 ml and 420. 14 ± 26. 70 ml, which are 51. 74 % and 49. 35 % of the human liver volume, respectively. In micropigs, the percentage of liver volume to body weight was approximately 2. 05 %. The diameters of the common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> and <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> were 6. 24 ± 0. 20 mm and 4. 68 ± 0. 13 mm, respectively. The hepatic vascular system of the micropigs was similar to that of humans, except for the variation in the length of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> In addition, the diameter of the portal vein was 11. 27 ± 0. 38 mm. In conclusion, imaging evaluation using the MDCT was a reliable method for liver evaluation and its vascular anatomy for xenotransplantation using micropigs...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Despite {{the fact}} that {{anatomical}} variations of the celiac trunk are well explored in the literature, information on these vessels diameters is scanty. The aims {{of the present study}} were to describe the arterial diameters of the celiac trunk and its main branches, and to investigate if these diameters are altered in those cases presenting anatomical variations of these vessels. METHODS: Twenty-one formalin fixed adult male cadavers were appropriately dissected for the celiac trunk identification and arterial diameter measurements. Arteries measured included the celiac trunk and its main branches (splenic artery, left gastric <b>artery</b> and common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery),</b> as the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> right gastric artery, the left and right <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> and the gastroduodenal artery. RESULTS: From the 21 cadavers, 6 presented anatomical variations of, at least, one of the above mentioned branches. The average arterial diameter comparisons between groups (normal and variable) clearly showed smaller diameters for variable vessels, but with no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Our data indicates the possibility of a diameter reduction of the celiac trunk main branches in the presence of anatomical variations. This should be taken into account on the selection for the liver transplantation donors...|$|R
50|$|The <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper</b> (also proper hepatic artery), {{arises from}} the common hepatic artery and runs {{alongside}} the portal vein and the common bile duct to form the portal triad. A branch of the common hepatic artery -the gastroduodenal artery gives off the small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb. Then the right gastric artery comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the left gastric artery, which is {{a branch of the}} celiac trunk. It subsequently bifurcates into the right and left hepatic arteries. Of note, the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy. A misplaced right hepatic artery may arise from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and a misplaced left hepatic artery may arise from the left gastric artery. The cystic artery generally comes from the right hepatic artery.|$|E
5000|$|The final common pathway for {{transport}} of venous blood from spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and the abdominal {{portion of the}} gastrointestinal tract [...] (with {{the exception of the}} inferior part of the anal canal and sigmoid) is through the hepatic portal vein. The portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein posterior to the neck of the pancreas at the level of vertebra body L1. Ascending towards the liver, the portal vein passes posterior to the superior part of the duodenum and enters the right margin of the lesser omentum. It is anterior to the omental foramen and posterior to both the bile duct, which is slightly to the right, and the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper,</b> which is slightly to the left. On approaching the liver, the portal vein divides into right and left branches which enter the liver parenchyma. It gives tributaries: the right and left gastric veins, the cystic vein and the para-umbilical veins.|$|E
40|$|Replaced right {{hepatic artery}} and {{accessory}} right hepatic artery (ARHA) are the rare form of variant hepatic arterial system. During routine dissection of abdominal cavity, we observed an ARHA {{arising from the}} proximal part of superior mesenteric artery. This anomalous artery {{was found to be}} compensating the nutritional source of the right lobe of the liver which might have been deprived due to rudimentary right branch of <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper.</b> In addition to this, the AHA was also supplying the gall bladder and cystic duct through its cystic branches. Presence of ARHA in addition to original right branch of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper</b> may get unnoticed by the surgeons or therapeutic radiologists leading to serious complications following its iatrogenic injury. Therefore, ascertaining {{the presence or absence of}} ARHA is prerequisite before planning and executing surgical or radiological interventions in this region...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The splanchnic {{circulation}} has {{an important}} function in the body under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Despite its importance, no reliable noninvasive procedures for estimating splanchnic circulation have been established. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate MRI as a tool for assessing intra-abdominal blood flows of the aorta, portal vein (VPO) and the major intestinal and hepatic vessels. METHODS: In nine healthy volunteers, the proximal aorta (AOP) and distal abdominal aorta (AOD), superior mesenteric artery (SAM), celiac trunk (CTR), <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> (common and <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> AHC and AHP, respectively), and VPO were localized on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography images. Volumetric flow was measured using a two-dimensional cine echocardiogram-gated phase contrast technique. Measurements were taken before and 30 min after continuous intravenous infusion of somatostatin (250 microg/h) and were independently evaluated by two investigators. RESULTS: Blood flow measured by MRI in the VPO, SAM, AOP, AHP, and CTR significantly decreased after drug infusion. Flows in the AOD and AHC showed a tendency to decrease (P> 0. 05). Interrater agreement on flows in MRI was very good for large vessels (VPO, AOP, and AOD), with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0. 94, as well as for smaller vessels such as the CTR, AHC, AHP, and SAM (concordance correlation coefficient = 0. 78). CONCLUSION: Somatostatin-induced blood flow changes in the splanchnic region were reliably detected by MRI. MRI may be useful for the noninvasive assessment of blood flow changes in the splanchnic region...|$|R

We report {{a patient with}} bile duct carcinoma infiltrating the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> Presentation of case: A 66 -year old male with jaundice was diagnosed with mid-distal bile duct carcinoma. A replaced left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> originated from the left gastric artery. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) with combined resection of <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> was planned. To promote the development of collateral blood flow after excision of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> preoperative segmental embolization of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> was performed. The patient underwent PPPD with concurrent resection of the common hepatic, right hepatic, and middle <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> without arterial reconstruction. He received adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine {{for six months and}} is alive three years after surgery without tumor recurrence. Discussion: The growth of collateral vessels after selective embolization of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> has been used for hilar lesions and bile duct lesions. Resection of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> without the need for complex arterial reconstruction, allowing a radical resection, may have contributed to this patient's relatively unremarkable recovery and long-term survival. Retroperitoneal mobilization of the pancreatic head and duodenum must be limited as important collaterals may originate in that area. Conclusion: Preoperative segmental embolization of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> before PPPD for a patient with a replaced left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> encouraged the growth of collateral blood supply, allowing radical resection including the vessels and obviated the need for arterial reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is {{performed}} in neonates and children for significant gastroesophageal reflux. An aberrant left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> encountered during laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication makes dissection around the esophageal hiatus more difficult if the artery is not transected. Although some suggest {{division of the}} aberrant left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> this is associated with risk of significant hepatic injury from ischemia. We routinely preserve the aberrant left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> and sought to determine (1) the incidence of aberrant left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> and (2) the results following preservation of the aberrant left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery...</b>|$|R
