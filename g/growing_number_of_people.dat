5|$|A <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> {{among them}} Captain William Rooke Creswell, the {{director}} of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was not impressed with the Admiralty, and in 1908 invited the United States Great White Fleet to visit Australia. The visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700-ton s, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in German naval construction in 1909 led the Australian admiralty to change its position on an Australian navy, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was a <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} {{temple in}} Guadalajara is pyramidal {{and has an}} innovative structure. The project began in 1983, when the Church's former temple built to accommodate 8,000 people was deemed insufficient to accommodate the <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who attended various annual celebrations. Construction began on July 3, 1983 when Flores laid the cornerstone and lasted until August 1, 1992. The temple was completed largely {{by members of the}} Church. It is a notable architectural feature in Guadalajara in a working-class district {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Dozens of institutions, architects, and engineers were invited to submit proposals for a new temple. The pyramidal design submitted by Leopoldo Fernández Font was from the final shortlist of four proposals. Fernandez Font was later awarded an honorary degree for this and other structures. He said that one of his favorite works is the Temple of the Resurrection, but that the temple of La Luz del Mundo seemed difficult to him. The temple was built to accommodate 12,000 worshipers and is used for annual ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. A <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as {{only a small percentage of}} the country use Swedish as their first language and that a large number of government officials do not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E

25|$|The <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{living to}} their 80s and 90s in the {{developed}} world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.|$|E

This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites.

In his 1982 book The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850-1940, William F.

2500|$|Another {{development}} {{facilitating the}} invention and popularization of the proto-hamburger was the increased production of beef through livestock intensification. By the late 19th century, an increasing {{amount of land}} was being devoted to cattle and a <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> being employed as cowboys, resulting in the United States {{becoming one of the}} world's largest producers and consumers of beef. The 1880s were declared The Golden Age of Beef, during which the abundance of rural beef production made vital its transportation by rail from agricultural to urban areas. This gave rise to various methods of meat preservation for making possible the consumption of fresh meat in urban and industrialized areas, among the refrigerator cars and different methods of packaging meat (such as corned beef), which were promoted by industrialists like Gustavus Swift (1839–1903). Around this time, the city of Chicago, along with other cities on the East Coast, became a focal point for the large-scale processing of beef. Beef was already inexpensive at that time, and it was available to the working class. This put the Hamburg steak within reach of {{the vast majority of the}} population, giving rise to what some authors jokingly call the [...] "American beef dream". In this era, the number of steakhouses that specialized in serving steaks increased markedly; some restaurants even served steak along with seafood, in a dish known as Surf and turf.|$|E

The bishops spoke of the emigration of the many young Eritreans who risk their lives in the hope of emigrating to other countries. They repeated what they had written in 2001: [...] "o-one leaves a land of milk and honey to seek another country offering the same opportunities. If one's homeland is a place of peace, jobs and freedom of expression {{there is no reason to}} leave it to suffer hardship, loneliness and exile in an effort to look for opportunity elsewhere." [...] They spoke also of [...] "the delusion engendered as result of the non-achievement of the ends proposed, the uselessness of one’s own aspirations, looking to distant lands as the only alternative for self-fulfilment, are bringing a <b>growing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to frustration and desperation. They find themselves looking at a horizon that grows always darker and heavier. Alongside this, the breakup of the family unit inside the country – through military service unlimited in terms of time and monetary reward and through the imprisonment of many young people in actual prison or in punishment camps – is exposing to misery not only elderly parents with no visible means of support, but also entire families and it is having serious consequences at the economic level as well as at the psychological and mental levels." ...|$|E
