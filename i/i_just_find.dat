2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked [...] "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" [...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4. The album was ranked at number 177 on Spins [...] "The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)" [...] list.|$|E

50|$|When papa died in 1957, {{three years}} later, I walked around his treasured gardens and the orchard. I looked {{again on the}} chance that <b>I</b> might <b>just</b> <b>find</b> my ring, papa’s gift to me, but it {{remained}} hidden.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{surprised}} to learn that her fans—thousands weighed in with supportive comments—had worried about her so much during her absence. [...] "When I'm really, really depressed, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>find</b> myself funny at all," [...] she explains. [...] "It's hard to know whether what I'm doing is something worth posting." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Atlantics {{editor-in-chief}} James Bennet in 2011 noted, [...] "Part of {{the incredible}} {{power of this}} image I think is the dignity of that man. Hes posing. His expression is almost indifferent. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> that remarkable. Hes basically saying, This is a fact." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vocalist, Alex Koehler, {{stated that}} the record holds a {{specific}} concept in contrast to their previous albums; [...] "I {{wanted to make the}} lyrics based more on a story of a man's journey from being a selfish tyrant, to being condemned to hell, seeking forgiveness, and salvation. I wasn't trying to write a religious or spiritual album. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> the concept of heaven and hell completely fascinating, so it makes it easy to write about." ...|$|E
5000|$|As a {{self-described}} journalist, proofreader, ghostwriter and pedant, Forsyth started a blog called the Inky Fool in 2009 {{as a forum}} to share his love of words. His posts often involve an exploration of words; {{where they come from}} and how they relate to each other. [...] "Etymology is fun," [...] Forsyth said in a Skepticality interview, [...] "Some people talk about the true meaning. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it interesting and delightful and often just very, very funny. That's the main thing I love about etymology." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am {{so stupid}} and so slow," [...] he said naïvely. [...] "Why! {{look at me}} now. My heart is simply {{bursting}} with all that I {{want to say to}} you, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> can't <b>find</b> the words, and I do nothing but talk rubbish and feel how you must despise me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Leland Hoisington, whose 28-year-old daughter, Abbie, {{was killed}} in the fire, told reporters, [...] "I think they should not even bother with a hearing—just let Biechele out... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>find</b> him as guilty of anything." [...] The state parole board {{received}} approximately 20 letters, the majority of which expressed their sympathy and support for Biechele, some going as far as to describe him as a [...] "scapegoat" [...] with limited responsibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's why I'm here," [...] replied Mrs. Quack. [...] "I hope {{others feel}} the same way. I came here because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> HAD to <b>find</b> some place where people wouldn't expect to find me and so wouldn't come looking for me. Little Joe Otter saw me {{yesterday}} on the Big River and told me of this place, and so, because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had to go somewhere, I came here." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Jones {{made her}} {{theatrical}} debut after playing the princess Young Fiona {{in the original}} cast of Shrek the Musical at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 2013, Jones appeared in Rebecca Lenkiewicz's stage adaptation of Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. She held the role of nine-year-old Flora with two other girls, alternating between them each night. After her performance on press night, Jones commented, [...] "I don’t find it scary, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it so much fun. I love every bit of it." ...|$|E
50|$|I'm {{just really}} {{inspired}} by R&B, hip-hop, and alternative music so I {{just wanted to}} combine {{all three of those}} for the sound. And the type of person I am, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> darkness interesting in a way. I just love songs that sound like a little crazy, I think it creates an interesting juxtaposition between my voice because it is so bright, and soft, and like pretty, and sweet that I don't want my music to come across sweet or nice. I do like the opposite, so I think of something that's dark and heavy and then I put like sweet and light on top.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, Mike Love voiced {{appreciation}} of its musical form and content, which he believed goes {{beyond what is}} normally expected of commercial pop music. He has said of Parks' lyrics [...] "I appreciate them for their artistry. It's like {{if you were to}} go to a modern art museum... maybe you don't understand art, but you can appreciate that it's beautiful." [...] Al Jardine stated in 2007, [...] "'Surf's Up' is just beyond description.… It's just one of those extraordinary compositions that along with Van Dyke's somewhat arcane lyrics… bring together more of a tapestry… of music and lyric that just transcend meaning. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it extremely deep musically." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't <b>find</b> anybody {{good for}} the part of Judah... He read it, and he was {{completely}} natural. It's an interesting thing. Of all the actors I've ever worked with, he gives expression to my dialogue exactly as I hear it. His colloquialisms, his idiom, his inflection is exactly correct. So {{of all the people}} who've ever read my lines, he makes them correct every time... One of the reasons for this must be that Martin Landau came from my neighborhood in Brooklyn, right near where I lived, only a few blocks away.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you, Juliana," [...] {{said the}} young rector {{to his sister}} across the breakfast table--and there was {{something}} as near to bitterness in his look as his saintly, smooth-shaven face was capable of reflecting--"no, thank you, no more porridge. Prunes? no, no, thank you; I don't think I care for any. And, by the way," [...] he added, [...] "don't bother to keep any lunch for me. I {{have a great deal}} of business--that is, of work in the parish--to see to, and <b>I</b> must <b>just</b> <b>find</b> time to get a bite of something to eat when and where I can." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>just</b> {{happened}} to <b>find</b> this beautiful boat {{that was built}} as a houseboat and was very cheap, so I bought it. And then only afterward did I think I could maybe use it to record. The control room is a 30-foot by 20-foot room. It's a very comfortable working environment--- three bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, a big lounge. It's 90 feet long.:—David Gilmour ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Somebody like Jennifer Anistonwill only do an {{interview}} with copy approval and picture approval. I've never had anybody on the cover, ever, who's had copy approval and picture approval. I just don't think it's a proper thing if you do. It's this thing of people just basically treating you as if you're bound {{to be doing something}} that is in some way going to be insulting to their client. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> that so offensive." [...] —Shulman, discussing her stance on copy approval. [...] As the editor of Vogue, Shulman makes various decisions on the magazine's stance. She has stated that, [...] "we never publish diets. We've never published things on cosmetic surgery", adding that she does not want to prescribe as specific way a woman should look to the reader. She also refuses to put celebrities on the cover if they demand copy approval and picture approval, saying [...] "I just find that so offensive".|$|E
5000|$|Suzanne Moore, a {{columnist}} for The Guardian and The Sunday Mail, writes: [...] "... abundant tripe trickles down from on high, even academe. Every so often a new tome details how men, not women, are discriminated against (apart from rape, murder, equal pay, genital mutilation, the power imbalance in politics, business, education, law and arts {{they may have a}} point). Things are tough for some guys. Really, I know that. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it hard to accept feminism has gone too far, that a bit of underarm hair signals the end of western civilisation." [...] In a brief letter to The Guardian, Benatar sought to correct some errors in Moore's account of his views; [...] Benatar had predicted criticisms in the book: [...] "Given the prevailing orthodoxy in the academy and the sensitivity of the issues I shall be discussing, the views I defend in this book will be deemed threatening by many. I am under no illusions. My position, no matter how clearly stated, is likely to be misunderstood." ...|$|E
5000|$|Andy Kelly, for PC Gamer, scored Spintires 60/100, commending the game's {{gameplay}} {{and variety}} of vehicles. However, he also found fault with the game's limited scope and camera system, writing, [...] "... as endearingly bizarre as I find Spintires, {{and as much as}} I admire the technology, I can't say I really ever enjoyed it. There are moments of what I could loosely call excitement—like almost rolling over and spilling my load just metres from the delivery point, or thinking I was crossing a shallow pond only to become totally submersed in a river—but they're few and far between. Mostly <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> myself swearing at mud." [...] James Cunningham in Hardcore Gamer praised the game, stating, [...] "... Spintires is a game that wants people to play rather than work. The great outdoors is big and beautiful, and the maps have plenty of personality and memorable locations, but they’re also the enemy. The inviting gameplay and lovely scenery make it easy to underestimate what an unforgiving bastard the great outdoors can be, but it only takes getting irretrievably stuck a couple of times before that illusion gets shattered. After that it’s time to stomp the scenery flat with the biggest earth-gouging, fume belching trucks Spintires has to offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was over}} on the Big River," [...] said Mrs. Quack. [...] "That's why it isn't safe for me over there. That's why <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had to <b>find</b> some other place. Oh, dear, the very sound of a gun sets me to shaking and makes my heart feel {{as if it would}} stop beating. Are you sure I am {{perfectly}} safe here?" ...|$|R
60|$|You mustn't {{think that}} I've {{forgotten}} somebody's birthday. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>find</b> <b>just</b> the thing <b>I</b> wanted to send, but I {{know where it}} can be had, and it will reach you in a few days. So, when it comes you'll know it is for a birthday remembrance.|$|R
5000|$|... "That Summer {{started out}} as a single guy and a married woman meeting at a party. The married woman being ignored by whom she was with, and they snuck off together. Allen Reynolds told me, [...] "Man, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>find</b> myself pulling for these characters. It doesn't seem innocently cool." [...] I was {{thinking}} that he was right. Going home that night in the truck I started singing she has a need to feel the thunder. Sandy started helping me write the chorus and we got the chorus done. Probably one of the neat things that I love about That Summer is that I think the song is very sexy." ...|$|R

5000|$|Lauren Steussy {{describes}} the experience: “It was not {{quiet on the}} set of [...] "Ferry Play" [...] when the show began. Dozens of tourists pushed to find their places, positioning their cell phones and cameras to the front, yelling at one another in different languages to come closer, stepping on toes and uttering insincere apologies. The set was the Staten Island Ferry and I was listening through my earphones. [...] "Ferry Play" [...] is a new site-specific play written by Jessie Bear and directed and conceived by Erin Mee. It can be downloaded to any iPhone or Android smartphone and listened to on the ferry, preferably the upper decks on a nice day … The play begins with much of the same scene that's happening before us in real time. Tourists clamoring for the best backdrop to their vacation photos, a harried mom quieting a whiny child, a beer can cracking open. Woven through these natural sounds and bits and pieces of stories, two main characters reflect on what's really happening when everyone boards. “They like to capture things on screens," [...] a character named April says, almost as if whispering in your ear. [...] "Take pictures. I guess to prove you were somewhere. You really, really were somewhere. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> — the more images we capture, the less we actually see. Maybe." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, on London's Royal Court Theatre stage Willcox played Sharon in Nigel Williams' Sugar and Spice, {{the play}} about [...] "hate, despair and sexual derision", climaxing with an unsettling jab of {{physical}} violence (the main character Steve having his genitals twisted {{out by the}} broken whisky bottle). [...] "I was offered the part of Carol, who is the bird that ends up naked, and I instantly refused it. I just couldn't handle a part like that. I sent the script back, and was offered the part of Sharon, which I was quite happy to take. The nudity would freak me out. Completely", she explained in the 1980 NME interview. The part took six weeks to learn and still proved demanding, lots of words Willcox muffled on stage. [...] "You {{get to the point}} where if you're not concentrating I find I'm talking a load of gibberish because I'm missing certain words out. I'm not thinking about what I'm saying, and the cast are looking at me in horror. You do things like that 'cos there's so many lines, you forget you are talking sense", she explained. Still she insisted on having at least one stage play a year, merely as a mental stimulant. [...] "'Cos it's training, really good training. Film can be so related and you don't have to concentrate so much. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it a good refresher course. It just makes you think", she told ZigZag in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the film}} has been mixed. JoBlo.com was also mixed, stating that it [...] "had some decent acting and tunes and at times, slick directing, but on the whole, rubbed me the wrong way from every freaking angle. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn’t <b>find</b> an anchor to the story and I truly, and I mean TRULY, despised the characters in it." [...] Variety panned the movie, writing [...] "From its ripped-from-the-headlines topic of teen bloodsuckers to the blandness of a low-budgeter shockingly low on shocks, true story {{of the murder of}} a family is translated by scripter Aaron Pope into a woefully standard depiction of wayward youth." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dinah Doll (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) is a toy plastic doll, the Toy Town shopkeeper. Her stall, though small, {{contains}} {{everything a}} Toyland resident could ever possibly want. From toy trains and kite strings to Googleberry muffins, she greets every request with her favorite promise: [...] "I have that, now <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>find</b> it!"

5000|$|Gomes has {{expressed}} interest in recording a solo album in the hip hop genre, stating [...] "I would like to but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>find</b> {{the time to do}} it. ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> need to get my discipline down and use my time more wisely than watching South Park for eight hours straight." [...] In 2007, Gomes appeared on Twiztid's sixth studio album, Independents Day, contributing to the track [...] "Weak Shit'z Out". According to Gomes, he had previously discussed appearances on solo albums by System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian and Korn guitarist James Shaffer, but the projects had fallen through.|$|R
3000|$|I {{generally}} try {{to stick}} to the racing where there is some sort of skill involved. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>find</b> it’s a bit more hands on a bit more enjoyable than pushing a button over and over again. (Kate, Receptionist, 21  years old) [...]...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend Mr. Farewell has {{recommended}} you to me," [...] I said with my usual affability. [...] "I {{was telling him}} just awhile ago that I needed a man to look after my office in the Rue Daunou of a morning, {{and he told me}} that in you <b>I</b> would <b>find</b> <b>just</b> the man <b>I</b> wanted." ...|$|R
500|$|There {{had to be}} a cost. There {{had to be a}} price {{somebody}} {{paid for}} that discovery. Not everybody could take that. Not everyone could just say, [...] "OK, that didn't work out, let's go on to next week's episode." [...] It felt like somebody would just say, [...] "No, I'm done. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want to <b>find</b> a little moment of time where I can feel good about myself one last time, then I'm finished with this long nightmare." [...] And that seemed like that would be Dualla.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{than these}} few performances, no concerts or tours were {{arranged}} to promote Medúlla. Björk said in numerous interviews {{that this was}} because she wished to immediately continue writing and recording yet another new album. She spoke to Rolling Stone in June 2004: [...] "Every album I've done, the minute that it's done, I feel really lubricated and, like, 'Wow, now I can write an album in five minutes'... And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want to <b>find</b> out if that's just a fantasy or if it's true." [...] Also, Björk {{thought it would be}} too difficult to play the songs live.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2010, Shyne criticized Def Jam and {{announced}} hopes of signing to Cash Money Records.

Who knows? That's the beauty about being in the business for yourself. You can decide {{where you want to}} go and what you want to do.Although he blamed Def Jam CEO L.A. Reid for his frustration, later that month Shyne issued an apology. In November 2010, Birdman said that Shyne's deportation had stalled his Cash Money deal, as it would prevent him from appearing in the US.|$|R
