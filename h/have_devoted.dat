25|$|In {{terms of}} structure, a hadith and a khabar are very similar. They both contain isnads (chains of transmission). Thus {{starting}} from the 8th and 9th century, many scholars <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> their efforts to both kinds of texts equally. Also some historians consider the sīra and maghāzī literature to be a subset of Hadith.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{typically}} large, bi-stable spin anisotropy, single-molecule magnets promise {{the realization}} of perhaps the smallest practical unit for magnetic memory, and thus are possible building blocks for a quantum computer. Consequently, many groups <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> great efforts into synthesis of additional single-molecule magnets; however, the Mn12O12 complex and analogous complexes remain the canonical single-molecule magnet with a 50cm−1 spin anisotropy.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{returned}} to the New York Giants in 1939. He appeared in nine games and scored 19 points on four field goals and seven extra points. Strong is also {{believed to be the}} second player (after Mose Kelsch) to <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> an entire season to placekicking; his 1939 season with the Giants had him playing very little outside of kicks.|$|E
25|$|Louis Feldman, who {{believes}} the Josephus passage on John is authentic, states that Christian interpolators {{would have been}} very unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> almost twice as much space to John (163 words) as to Jesus (89 words). Feldman also states that a Christian interpolator would have likely altered Josephus' passage about John the Baptist to make the circumstances of the death of John become similar to the New Testament, and to indicate that John was a forerunner of Jesus.|$|E

25|$|Since 2009, Radwańska and {{her sister}} Urszula <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> time during the {{off-season}} to Szlachetna Paczka ("Noble Box"). The charity has its volunteers go door-to-door throughout the year compiling a database of families in need, asking them what would help ease {{the pressures of the}} holidays. Then, for a three-week period from mid-November to early December, donors are given a list to take with them to the supermarket, where they fill a shopping cart with the food, clothing and more to donate to them.|$|E
25|$|From {{this time}} he seems to <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> his whole time to jurisprudence. His {{training}} in the science had been derived principally from Trebatius Testa. To {{his knowledge of the}} law he added a wide general culture, devoting his attention specially to dialectics, philology (grammatica), and antiquities, as valuable aids in the exposition, expansion, and application of legal doctrine. Down to the time of Hadrian his was probably the name of greatest authority; and several of his works were abridged and annotated by later hands.|$|E
25|$|The {{fraternity}} {{also gives}} out three alumni awards: The Significant Sig Award {{is given to}} a member who has excelled greatly in his field of study or occupation. The first seven Significant Sig awards were given to George Ade, Roy Chapman Andrews, John T. McCutcheon, Chase S. Osborn, James Wallington, F. Dudleigh Vernor, and Samuel P. Cowley. The Order of Constantine is awarded to alumni members who <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> long and distinguished service to the Fraternity. The Semi-Century Sig Award is given to brothers who have {{been active in the}} fraternity for 50years or more.|$|E

25|$|From {{that time}} Hamilton appears to <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> himself almost wholly to mathematics, though he always kept himself {{well acquainted with}} the {{progress}} of science both in Britain and abroad. Hamilton found an important defect in one of Laplace's demonstrations, and he was induced by a friend to write out his remarks, {{so that they could}} be shown to Dr. John Brinkley, then the first Royal Astronomer of Ireland, and an accomplished mathematician. Brinkley seems to have immediately perceived Hamilton's talents, and to have encouraged him in the kindest way.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{focus on}} hierarchical order generated {{the impression that}} DGs have little to say about linear order, and it {{has contributed to the}} view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, {{is that there is a}} dearth of dependency-based explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard discontinuities. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition are mostly absent from many established dependency-based frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with constituency grammars, which <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} {{attitudes toward the}} family have survived without being questioned. It is taken for granted that everyone should marry, and marriage remains part {{of the definition of}} normal adult status. Marriage is expected to be permanent. That marriage requires a woman to move into her husband's family and to become a daughter-in-law as well as a wife is still largely accepted. The norm of patrilineal descent and the assumption that it is sons who bear the primary responsibility for their aged parents remain. The party and government <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> great effort to controlling the number of births and have attempted {{to limit the number of}} children per couple. But the authorities have not attempted to control population growth by suggesting that some people should not marry at all.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Tutankhamun's mummy, {{there has been a}} lot of speculation and theories on the exact cause of death, which until recent studies had been hard to prove with the evidence and data available. While it was a widely debated topic for many Egyptologists, it had also spread to the general public as popular culture has come up with many conspiracy theories that played out in movies, TV shows, and fictional books. Author James Patterson has even recently written his own take in his book, The Murder of King Tut. There are many educated and respected Egyptologists as well as trained professionals in other fields who <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> a lot of time researching Tutankhamun and who have varying beliefs to his cause of death. Some have stood by their theories even in light of new evidence. Some of the theories are better known and supported than others.|$|E
25|$|From the start, St. John Nepomucene Church {{served as}} a focal point, {{although}} other churches would soon spring up in the other communities. The first settlers would <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> all energies to clearing land, planting, building small homes and barns, fencing and raising livestock. The private Fox River Canal was a failure. The State “Fox and Wisconsin Improvement Company” took over operations in 1850 and finished the canal and adjoining dam by 1856. Railways approached {{from the south and}} steamship lines were established on Lakes Michigan and Winnebago. The 16 feet of water head at La Petite Chute and other falls was used for mills, a practice that continues. Little Chute post office was established in 1849. In 1898 the fiftieth anniversary of the founding was commemorated and the surviving “48’ers” recognized. In 1898, residents of La Petite Chute petitioned the State of Wisconsin for incorporation as the Village of Little Chute, which was formally granted on March 8, 1899.|$|E
25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the write-up in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty and we use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency and guilt that chain the human spirit.|$|E

500|$|Late in 2009 {{a review}} of the legal {{situation}} by Eric Johnson, a lawyer, was published in the Tennessee Law Review. [...] In this paper, Johnson states, remarkably, that [...] "Given such a state, {{it is not clear that}} any particle-physics testimony should be allowed in the courtroom", in reference to the dual problems that (a) the scientific arguments regarding the risks are so complex that only persons who <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> many years to particle physics study are competent to understand them, but (b) any such persons, by reason of this huge personal investment, will inevitably be highly biased in favor of the experiments, and also endangered by severe professional censure if they threaten their continuation. [...] In February 2010 a summary of Johnson's article appeared as an opinion piece in New Scientist.|$|E
500|$|Off track, the {{argument}} {{over the new}} rules implemented at the Grand Prix and the inclusion of lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward was renewed. FIA president Max Mosley published a letter dated from 19 October to Ron Dennis which accused him of damaging the image of Formula One with his recent stream of comments over the issues. Mosley also defended Race Director Charlie Whiting's announcement that marshals could use racing flags to caution drivers over unsportsmanlike behaviour. Dennis responded by apologising for his comments, saying {{that he did not}} intend to bring Formula One into disrepute and cause disrespect to Causo. [...] "It certainly has not ever been my intention to damage a sport to which I <b>have</b> <b>devoted</b> most of my working life." [...] he said.|$|E
