5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E

500|$|... "Start Over" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Beyoncé taken from her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was written by Shea Taylor, Knowles and Ester Dean and produced by the former two. The song's development was motivated {{by the fact that}} Knowles traveled around the world and experienced different cultures which inspired love and purity inside her. A mid-tempo pop, pop rock and soul-influenced R ballad, [...] "Start Over" [...] finds the female protagonist affirming her individuality and expressing her love <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> whom she attempts to start a relationship all over again.

Her vocals throughout the song are [...] "so vulnerable that they're almost tortured" [...] as stated by Rubenstein. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy further noted that the [...] "raspy and husky growls" [...] that Knowles adopts occasionally on [...] "Start Over", show an [...] "offering moments of raw, heartfelt emotion".|$|E

500|$|... "The Simpsons Guy" [...] {{attracted}} controversy {{before it}} had aired. Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy, wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it [...] "less outrageous in real life", and that people who watch The Simpsons but not Family Guy would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman {{declined to comment on}} the joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was [...] "pretty funny... in context".

500|$|Frederick had {{benefited from}} an obliging enemy. First, Charles {{saw what he}} wanted to see {{regarding}} the principal attack instead of using his efficient light cavalry {{to figure out what the}} Prussians really intended. Frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered the truth. The cavalry he had left demonstrating in front of the northernmost position of the Austrian line was simply a screen, a diversion, to hide his real movements. Second, the Austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of Leuthen. Nádasdy's omission of outposts on his open flank south of Leuthen was a surprising failure <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> his long years of experience against the Prussians; he should have considered the possibility of an attack from an unexpected direction because this was Frederick's modus operandi. [...] Third, even when confronted with the attack on his left, the diversion on the right flank near Frobelwitz continued to mesmerize Charles. By the time the Prince moved cavalry to support the faltering troops south of, and in, Leuthen, they had too far to travel in too little time.|$|E

2500|$|Yusuf {{believed}} his inclusion on a [...] "watch list" [...] may have simply been an error: a mistaken identification of him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> the same name, but different spelling.

On 20 October 2005, John Samuel Humble, an unemployed alcoholic and long-time resident of the Ford Estate in Sunderland – a few miles from Castletown – was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice for sending the hoax letters and tape.

2500|$|A {{report by}} the secretariat of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) quotes: [...] "one of the strongest appeals of {{polygyny}} to men in Africa is precisely its economic aspect, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> several wives commands more land, can produce more food for his household and can achieve a high status due to the wealth which he can command.". According to Esther Boserup, {{over much of the}} continent of Africa, tribal rules of land tenure are still in force. This implies that members of a tribe, which commands a certain territory, have a native right to take land under cultivation for food production and in many cases also for the cultivation of cash crops. Under this tenure system, an additional wife is an economic asset that helps the family to expand its production.|$|E

For women, marriage to Jews, Sabians and Christians and to polytheists (Idolatry) (or [...] "idolaters": Yusufali translation or [...] "disbelievers": Pickthall translation) is prohibited; they are only allowed to marry Muslims. There is no express prohibitionin the Qur'an or elsewhere about a Muslim woman marrying a [...] People of the Book.

The movement of Islamic jurists and imams that do not agree on this interpretation is growing.|$|E
