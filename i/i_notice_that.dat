60|$|LIZA. I'm no preacher: I don't notice {{things like}} that. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> you don't notice me.|$|E
60|$|CONFUCIUS. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> {{the honorable}} Domestic Minister, on {{learning}} the advanced {{age of the}} venerable prelate, shews no sign of surprise or incredulity.|$|E
6000|$|Deringham made a {{whimsical}} gesture of resignation. [...] "In the meantime <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> our late conductor has arranged a comfortable seat for you," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|ANN. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> you {{got more}} sense. You were a dreadfully {{destructive}} boy before that.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Superstition {{stood in}} the light of the doorway looking down on us.|$|R
60|$|We talked {{along for}} half an hour, and then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he looked tired, and spoke of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] Carson said coolly. [...] "I'm not {{pressed for}} time--and <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> {{you have been}} cooking. I wonder if I might ask for some supper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and {{we always}} like to fancy {{something}} pathetic in the fate of pretty girls that other fellows marry. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> we don't sorrow much over the plain ones. How's the divine Clara?" ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. When {{you write}} to the Deercourt girl, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> you {{generally}} fill three or four sheets. Can't you let an old woman babble on paper once in a way? She means well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a musket, sir. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that,</b> when Joel first {{detailed}} his detachments. Can it {{be possible}} that the savages have retired?" ...|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{shut the}} book up with a snap. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> there {{was a sort of}} {{peculiar}} alacrity in everything he did.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] whispered Euphemia, [...] "of course not. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> smell, {{and he said}} he {{had been}} {{cleaning}} his clothes with alcohol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems like}} it at first," [...] replied the King, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> {{whenever}} any of my subjects get {{near the end of}} their six hundred, they grow nervous and say the life is altogether too short." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> God is on {{both sides}} in this war; thus history repeats itself. But I am {{the only person who}} has noticed this; {{everybody}} here thinks He is playing the game for this side, and for this side only.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} ask you again about {{something}} you said the other day. Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak hastily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Baas, everything," [...] he answered, and <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he {{kept his}} eyes fixed upon the ground and that his lips twitched.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her conduct {{seems to}} worry you vastly, Mr. Crocker. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> you were quite upset {{this morning in}} the cave. Why was it?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> his face was very thin under the sun-burn, and perhaps he read my thoughts, for he laughed.|$|R
6000|$|After {{some more}} talk about this, I says: [...] "Sandy, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> I hardly ever see a white angel; where I run across one white angel, I strike {{as many as}} a hundred million copper-colored ones--people that can't speak English. How is that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To get {{yourself}} in trouble {{is a very}} easy thing. [...] <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> to others it will always worries bring. [...] But getting out of trouble's always quite the other way-- [...] The more you try to wriggle out, the longer you must stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the first}} night we have been left alone in the manse," [...] Margaret said, as she was {{retiring}} to her bedroom," [...] and we must not grudge the minister {{to those who have}} sore need of him. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> you have barred the doors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Griffiths dined {{here the}} other night," [...] Philippa remarked, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he and Mr. Lessingham {{seemed to get}} on very well." ...|$|R
60|$|As we {{went along}} in silence <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Peterkin sighed {{once or twice}} very heavily, and I {{asked him if he}} was quite well.|$|R
60|$|Ernest had by {{this time}} reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he was {{carrying}} something over his arm.|$|R
60|$|Every now {{and again}} she looks towards the door and listens: then turns to the open window. And <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> each time she looks towards the door the evil in her face shrinks back; but each time she turns to the window it grows more fierce and sullen.|$|E
60|$|We are now off the Plate, {{a region}} notorious for storms, and Mr. Pike {{is on the}} lookout for a pampero. Captain West {{does not seem to be}} {{on the lookout for}} anything; yet <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> he spends longer hours on deck when the sky and {{barometer}} are threatening.|$|E
60|$|Our white ducks are gone, and, {{in south}} {{latitude}} thirty-five, we are wearing the garments of a temperate clime. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> Wada {{has given me}} heavier underclothes and heavier pyjamas, and that Possum, of nights, is no longer content with {{the top of the}} bed but must crawl underneath the bed-clothes.|$|E
60|$|Lord Langerdale {{shook his}} head, and <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{he failed to}} {{look me in the}} face. I braced myself up with a great effort.|$|R
6000|$|Trying {{to record}} <b>that</b> thought, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> my note-book was damp with dew. The cattle were lying down. It {{was too dark}} to see. 1911 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{first read}} it. 'My brother and I have seen your advertisement, by chance, in {{a copy of}} your local journal' ...|$|R
60|$|P. S.--I {{gave the}} P.O. Department a blast {{in the papers}} about sending {{misdirected}} letters of mine back to the writers for reshipment, and got a blast in return, through a New York daily, from the New York postmaster. But <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> misdirected letters find me, now, without any unnecessary fooling around.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} {{good thing}} for others as well as O'Grady," [...] Terence said, quietly. [...] "I suppose in Ireland the whisky does not do much harm, seeing that it is a wet country; but here <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> they cannot drink half as much as they were {{accustomed}} to without feeling it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Pappoose!' says John Tom, and <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> {{the flowers}} {{of the white}} man's syntax have left his tongue. He is the {{original}} proposition in bear's claws and copper color. 'Me bring,' says he, and he lays the kid in his mother's arms. 'Run fifteen mile,' says John Tom--'Ugh! Catch white man. Bring pappoose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I {{think that}} this is just the place. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> tall tree rising above the general line just {{opposite}} where we were anchored." ...|$|R
60|$|He smiled, {{making no}} answer, but <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{during the rest}} of that night he was careful to keep behind me as much as possible.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not been}} long on the road, before <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> other people--by twos and threes--appeared to be {{travelling}} {{in the same direction}} as myself.|$|R
