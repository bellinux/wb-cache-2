5|$|When Ben Bradley (Ben Richards) daughter, Carly (Sophie Wise), {{is found}} dead, Ben {{initially}} blames Darren {{as he was}} supposed to drive her up to Scotland to a rehab center that day but cancelled the <b>job</b> <b>so</b> he could support Maxine through a dinner party with Patrick. Patrick later manipulates Darren and Maxine's relationship causing Maxine to break up with Darren as she doesn't believe his claims that he's still controlling her.|$|E
5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a <b>job,</b> <b>so</b> she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the <b>job,</b> <b>so</b> as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

5|$|Beresford was {{alerted to}} the French advance by reports {{received}} on 12 May from Spanish patriots in Seville, who had sent word of Soult's departure. Beresford {{kept up the}} pretence of besieging Badajoz by sending an unsuccessful demand for surrender to the French commander {{on the afternoon of}} that same day, but he realized he would now not have time to finish the <b>job,</b> <b>so</b> he ordered the withdrawal of his siege guns and supplies. On 13 May, the Spanish cavalry attached to Colborne's brigade came into contact with the French force and, in accordance with orders given by Wellington in April, they fell back while sending word of Soult's new position to Beresford. Later that day Long's British cavalry also encountered the advancing French and hastily pulled back—although Long, too, was following Wellington's orders not to engage, Beresford considered his withdrawal somewhat premature and thought Long could have delayed the French by forcing them to deploy.|$|E
5|$|On graduating a year later, Ramage {{once again}} {{expressed}} {{a preference for}} a flying <b>job,</b> <b>so</b> he received command of Heavy Attack Wing One, which was based at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. This wing consisted of the nuclear attack squadrons flying the A3D Skywarrior, detachments from which were posted to the aircraft carriers. The post was a senior one for a captain; Robert Goldthwaite had held the post {{while he was a}} rear admiral. Ramage had never flown the A3D before, so he started by becoming carrier qualified on it, which required eight carrier landings. To his surprise, he found that the aircraft was easy to fly, and he was successful at lifting the training level of the entire wing.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} meeting John in the NEMS office, Alf (who was then 56 years old) {{turned up at}} Kenwood again, with his fiancée Pauline Jones. Pauline had been an 18-year-old Exeter University student and a Rolling Stones fan when she met the 54-year-old Alf in 1966. Alf and Pauline grew tired of trying to {{convince}} Pauline's mother {{to allow them to}} marry, so they eloped and were married in Gretna Green, Scotland. In 1966, Alf asked John if he could give Pauline a <b>job,</b> <b>so</b> she was hired to help, looking after Julian Lennon and also the piles of fan mail. Pauline spent a few months living at Kenwood in the attic bedroom. Alf and Pauline moved to a flat in Bourne Court, London Road, Patcham (a suburb of Brighton) before moving to Ladies Mile Road, Brighton, in November 1969. Alf had two sons with Pauline: David Henry Lennon (February 26, 1969) and Robin Francis Lennon (October 22, 1973).|$|E

5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad <b>job</b> <b>so</b> she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E

30|$|Third, the {{preference}} of the insured for retirement delay is {{inversely proportional to}} the substitution effect (μ). For the insured, the higher the substitution effect is, the less tolerant they will be to retirement delay and vice versa. This indicates that as time passes, the human capital of the low-skilled workers will depreciate, and they will feel increasingly unfulfilled with their payment and <b>jobs.</b> <b>So</b> they will prefer a shorter retirement delay. However, the high-skilled workers are in a different case. As their human capital will accumulate and ramp up, the high-skilled workers will feel increasingly fulfilled with the payment and their <b>jobs.</b> <b>So</b> they will prefer a longer retirement delay. Thus, it is more politically feasible to allow high-skilled workers with low substitution effect to retire later than low-skilled workers with high substitution effect.|$|R

25|$|Landrith {{was traded}} to the San Francisco Giants along with {{teammates}} Billy Muffett and Benny Valenzuela for Ernie Broglio and Marv Grissom on October 8, 1958. Landrith was originally considered to be a throw-in player for this five player deal. The Giants announced in late February they would only be keeping two catchers on the roster. Bob Schmidt already had a foothold on the starting <b>job,</b> <b>so</b> the battle for Schmidt's backup came down to Landrith and Albert Stieglitz. Stieglitz was optioned to the AAA Phoenix Giants at the beginning of April, removing all doubt that Landrith would serve as Schmidt's backup to begin the 1959 season. For the first two months, Schmidt pulled most of the duty behind the plate for the Giants.
