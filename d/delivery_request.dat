40|$|SUMMARY In this study, {{we propose}} an object-based {{multimedia}} model for specifying the QoS (quality of service) requirements, {{such as the}} maximum data-dropping rate or the maximum data-delay rate. We also present a resource allocation model, called the net-profit model, in which the satisfaction of user’s QoS requirements {{is measured by the}} benefit earned by the system. Based on the net-profit model, the system is rewarded if it can allocate enough resources to a multimedia <b>delivery</b> <b>request</b> and fulfill the QoS requirements specified by the user. At the same time, the system is penalized if it cannot allocate enough resources to a multimedia <b>delivery</b> <b>request.</b> We first investigate {{the problem of how to}} allocate resources efficiently, so that the QoS satisfaction is maximized. However, the net-profit may be distributed unevenly among the multimedia delivery requests. Thus, the second problem discusses how to allocate the resource efficiently so that the net-profit difference is minimized between any two multimedia requests. A dynamic programming based algorithm is proposed to find such an optimal solution with the minimum net-profit differences. key words: scheduling, imprecise computation, object-based multimedia, delay, drop, quality-of-service (QoS), optimization, bipartite matching 1...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims to {{optimize}} the final part of a firm’s value chain with regard to attended last-mile deliveries. It is assumed that to be profitable, ecommerce businesses need to maximize the overall value of fulfilled orders (rather than their number), while also limiting costs of delivery. To do so, {{it is essential to}} decide which <b>delivery</b> <b>requests</b> to accept and which time windows to offer to which consumers. This is especially relevant for attended deliveries, as delivery fees usually cannot fully compensate costs of delivery given tight delivery time windows. The literature review shows that existing order acceptance techniques often ignore either the order value or the expected costs of delivery. The paper presents an iterative solution approach: after calculating an approximate transport capacity based on forecasted expected <b>delivery</b> <b>requests</b> and a cost-minimizing routing, actual <b>delivery</b> <b>requests</b> are accepted or rejected aiming to maximize the overall value of orders given the computed transport capacity. With the final set of accepted requests, the routing solution is updated to minimize costs of delivery. The presented solution approach combines well-known methods from revenue management and time-dependent vehicle routing.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} two {{important}} practises in supply chain management, postponement and product perishability. In the first essay, we consider a retailer that replenishes its inventory {{by making a}} <b>delivery</b> <b>request</b> without specifying order quantity, then deciding the quantity when the delivery vehicle arrives after one period. A fixed cost is incurred whenever a <b>delivery</b> <b>request</b> is made. The new feature {{of this research is}} the postponement of ordering until one-period demand information is observed. We show that the optimal policy for delivery requests is of a threshold type. The optimal decision on ordering is more complex, there might be multiple order-up-to levels. Numerical studies show that the cost of an ordering policy that considers (at most) two order-up-to levels is close to the minimal, especially when the planning horizon is not too short. We also identify conditions under which a base-stock policy is optimal for ordering. To understand the effects of ordering postponement, we compare our model with the traditional model (Scarf 1960). We show that postponement leads to a lower cost and a higher threshold for making delivery requests. In the second essay, we consider a supply chain of a supplier and a retailer where the product lifespan is controllable and subject to investment. We derive the optimal order quantity and product lifespan decisions for several decentralized supply chain models, one assumes only the retailer may invest into the product lifespan and the other allows both parties to invest. Our analysis indicates that the investment opportunity creates significant benefits to the entire supply chain. Whenever a party, the retailer or the supplier, chooses to invest into product lifespan, both parties benefit yet her profit share within the supply chain decreases. Other relevant issues such as the impacts on channel coordination and pricing are also investigated.

Therefore, the entire logistic plan should be considered over a certain period for the total op-timization. We formulate the storage and delivery problem as a mixed integer programming.

40|$|Food {{rescue and}} {{delivery}} program helps to alleviate hunger by rescuing the unspoiled surplus food {{that would have}} otherwise {{found its way to}} landfill, and distributing it to people in need. This is a large scale collection, distribution and inventory management problem and is challenged by numerous operational issues. The gap between the food recovered (supply) and the <b>delivery</b> <b>request</b> (demand) have increased the attention on the effective and the equitable allocation of rescued food. The rescue and the delivery of food surplus should meet several criteria such as minimising routing costs and waste as well as ensuring an equitable distribution of the resources collected among welfare agencies. Specifically, the traditional cost minimising approach in pickup and delivery operations focuses mainly on efficient routing, and may lead to an inequitable distribution of the rescued food. In this paper, the authors propose two additional objective functions designed to promote their social interest, fair and equitable resource allocation within the food rescue program: maximize the total satisfaction of delivery customers (welfare agencies) and maximize the satisfaction of the least satisfied delivery customer. Both objectives are combined with the traditional transportation cost minimization to provide balanced solutions. They explore the behaviour and the performance of the proposed models as well as the satisfaction of the welfare agencies and the structure of the obtained routes. They compare the ability of the proposed models to enhance the equitable distribution of rescued food without losing sight of the transportation costs...|$|E
40|$|Data-driven {{decision}} making {{has become more}} popular in today’s businesses including logistics and vehicle routing. Leveraging historical data, companies can achieve goals such as customer satisfaction management, scalable and efficient operation, and higher overall revenue. In the management of customer satisfaction, logistics companies use consistent assignment of their drivers to customers over time. Creating this consistency takes time and depends on the history experienced between {{the company and the}} customer. While pursuing this goal, companies trade off the cost of capacity with consistency because demand is unknown on a daily basis. We propose concepts and methods that enable a parcel delivery company to balance the trade-off between cost and customer satisfaction. We use clustering methods that use cumulative historical service data to generate better consistency using the information entropy measure. Parcel delivery companies route many vehicles to serve customer requests on a daily basis. While clustering was important to the development of early routing algorithms, modern solution methods rely on metaheuristics, which are not easily deployable and often do not have open source code bases. We propose a two-stage, shape-based clustering approach that efficiently obtains a clustering of <b>delivery</b> <b>request</b> locations. Our solution technique is based on creating clusters that form certain shapes with respect to the depot. We obtain a routing solution by ordering all locations in every cluster separately. Our results are competitive with a state-of-the-art vehicle routing solver in terms of quality. Moreover, the results show that the algorithm is more scalable and is robust to problem parameters in terms of runtime. Fish trawling can be considered as a vehicle routing problem where the main objective is to maximize the amount of fish (revenue) facing uncertainty on catch. This uncertainty creates an embedded prediction problem before deciding where to harvest. Using previous catch data to train prediction models, we solve the routing problem a fish trawler faces using dynamically updated routing decisions allowing for spatiotemporal correlation in the random catch. We investigate the relationship between the quality of predictions and the quality of revenue generated as a result...|$|E
40|$|The National Research Council (CNR) Bologna Research Area Library is a {{multidisciplinary}} scientific library serving {{a community of}} about 1. 500 local and remote users among researchers staff, PhD, undergraduate students and visiting scientists. The Library became operative in 1997, progressively integrating the existing resources of the Institutes belonging to the Research Area thus reducing costs whilst increasing {{the quantity and quality}} of advanced library services, such as: access to over 6. 000 online journals, access to specialised bibliographical databases, document delivery, etc [...] . Library online collections cover, among the Earth Sciences, the fields of Geology, Ocenography, Climatology, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. Among library services, the Document Delivery Service allows rapid supply of scientific documents, books, theses and other documents not owned by the Library through Inter-Library loan and exchange or purchase. This service is for internal users. On the other side, the Library offers rapid and comprehensive document supply and interlibrary loan to other Italian libraries from its extensive collection. Document Delivery (DD) plays an important role in Italian research and university libraries. The main Internet resources for Document Delivery and Resource Sharing are the Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici (ACNP, the collective serials Italian catalogue), the Sistema Bibliotecario Nazionale Catalogue (SBN) and the MetaOpac Azalai Italiano (MAI). In 1999 the Library started a project aiming at the development of an Internet-based Document Delivery Service, in order to: - exploit the new Internet technologies; - promote cooperation among CNR and Italian university libraries; - reduce service costs; - achieve short turnaround times and higher user satisfaction. The resulting system, NILDE (Network Inter-Library Document Exchange), is a web based software for libraries and end-users, that allows libraries to manage the entire work-flow of document delivery activities. The main advantages for libraries are the provision of synthetic and analytical statistics, provision of performance indicators such as ?fill-rate? and ?turn-around time?, and support for secure electronic delivery via Internet by means of a file-uploading/web-server. The main advantages for end-users are the possibility to forward a document <b>delivery</b> <b>request</b> to their library from any OpenURL-compliant bibliographical database (e. g. Web of Science, Scopus, Scifinder, PubMed, CSA Illumina and SFX platforms) and to check the status of their requests. NILDE is presently used by more than 500 Italian libraries and counts about 3. 000 registered end-users. It has allowed to build up a large library network, based on cooperation, resource sharing and a degree of standard quality of service and fair behaviours. Technical-scientific and bio-medical libraries represent the core of the NILDE network, performing more than 80 % of the total number of document exchanges. The most recent progress and implementation of the NILDE project and software will be presented.

Rapid developments in information technologies introduced {{a new dimension to}} document delivery services: documents can now be supplied quickly and more easily. This study aims to review the document delivery requests submitted to the Document Delivery Services Unit of the National Academic Network and Information Center (ULAKBIM). It concentrates on the journals and their age whence document delivery requests were filled, and compares the length of time (in days) it takes to fill a request and the unit cost of supplying requests from printed journals as opposed to electronic ones. We tracked the data with regards to document delivery requests that were submitted to the Unit for two months and obtained needed information from the Center to calculate the unit cost. We reviewed the user profiles, requests, journal titles and libraries from which requests were filled. We tested a) if the data about journals conform to Bradford's Law of Scattering, and b) if the ages of requested articles conform to the notion of "literature obsolescence. " We calculated the average unit cost of supplying a document by dividing total cost {{by the total number of}} document delivery requests. We found that the Document Delivery Services Unit satisfied two-thirds (6036) of a total of 9213 document delivery requests submitted to the Unit during the two months' period of our study. Requests were satisfied from a total of 1671 journal titles. Almost half (42 %) of those journal titles were used only once for document delivery purposes. A small number (135) of "core" journals satisfied one- thirds (35 %) of requests and the distribution of journals conforms to Bradford's Law of Scattering. Half (median) of all requests were satisfied from journal issues that were published within the last 7 years. This indicates that more recent articles are requested much more heavily, which is parallel with the phenomenon of literature obsolescence. The unit cost of supplying an article in the year 2000 was found as about 3 million Turkish liras. From submission to the mailing of the document, it took a total of 15 days to fill a document <b>delivery</b> <b>request.</b> As the process of supplying documents from printed journals is no different than that of electronic journals, the length it takes to satisfy a request and its unit cost are similar for both electronic and printed journals. Nevertheless, once the requests that were satisfied from electronic journals were routed to the libraries, the length of providing the documents was much shorter than those for printed journals. The median duration of filling the requests from electronic journals was 1 day as opposed to 4 days from printed journals. In conclusion, costs studies should be done so as to find out the more economical method of document delivery (subscription, commercial document delivery services, and electronic means, among others). Data regarding document delivery requests should be gathered for collection development purposes. It would then be possible to identify core journals and their back issues that should be acquired and maintained. In order to speed up the document delivery process and decrease the costs, ULAKBIM should make a transition to an electronic document delivery system and subscribe to electronic versions of the most heavily requested journals. Requests that are satisfied from electronic and printed journals should be processed separately to speed up the document delivery services...|$|E

The number of core journals satisfying one third of all requests submitted to the Document Delivery Unit (DDU) and Reference Services Reading Room (RDRR) desk (in-library use) was 184 and 97, respectively, and 87 of which were common. The mean half-life of all journals used in DDU was 10 years while it was 10. 3 years for core journals only.

40|$|The dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) {{is faced}} by courier {{companies}} serving same-day pickup and <b>delivery</b> <b>requests</b> for {{the transport of}} letters and small parcels. This article focuses on the dynamic PDPTW for which future requests are not stochastically modelled or predicted. The standard solution methodology for the dynamic PDPTW {{is the use of}} a rolling time horizon as proposed by Psaraftis. When assigning a new request to a vehicle it may be preferable to consider the impact of a decision both on a short-term and on a long-term horizon. In particular, better managing slack time in the distant future may help reduce routing cost. This paper describes double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic PDPTW. Computational results show the advantage of using a double-horizon in conjunction with insertion and improvement heuristics. ...|$|R
