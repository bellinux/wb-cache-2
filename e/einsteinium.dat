5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of <b>einsteinium,</b> any primordial <b>einsteinium,</b> that is <b>einsteinium</b> that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of <b>einsteinium</b> from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial <b>einsteinium</b> is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including <b>einsteinium,</b> occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. <b>Einsteinium</b> was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{available}} <b>einsteinium</b> toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% <b>einsteinium</b> ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of <b>einsteinium</b> isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where <b>einsteinium</b> stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of <b>einsteinium</b> over the bone surfaces is uniform and {{is similar to that}} of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic <b>einsteinium</b> being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of <b>einsteinium</b> (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). <b>Einsteinium</b> is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of <b>einsteinium</b> {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated <b>einsteinium</b> is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of <b>einsteinium</b> is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common <b>einsteinium</b> isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including <b>einsteinium,</b> remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of <b>einsteinium</b> has {{a potential}} use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized {{in order to}} deliver <b>einsteinium</b> atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting <b>einsteinium</b> citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing <b>einsteinium</b> complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.|$|E
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of <b>einsteinium</b> {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of <b>einsteinium.</b> Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of <b>einsteinium</b> was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
5|$|Thus, most <b>einsteinium</b> {{samples are}} contaminated, and their {{intrinsic}} properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques {{to circumvent the}} contamination problem include selective optical excitation of <b>einsteinium</b> ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the lighter}} {{actinides}} californium, berkelium, curium and americium which crystallize {{in a double}} hexagonal structure at ambient conditions, <b>einsteinium</b> {{is believed to have}} a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry with the space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal <b>einsteinium</b> metal with a = 398 pm and c = 650 pm, which converted to the fcc phase upon heating to 300°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> halides {{are known}} for the {{oxidation}} states +2 and +3. The most stable state is +3 for all halides from fluoride to iodide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of <b>einsteinium</b> isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its {{chemistry is}} typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of about}} 3% per day. The isotope of <b>einsteinium</b> with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. <b>Einsteinium</b> is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the seventh transuranic element, and an actinide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced <b>einsteinium</b> and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, <b>einsteinium</b> was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, <b>einsteinium</b> {{is rather}} reactive. Its {{trivalent}} oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent <b>einsteinium</b> is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{synthetic}} transuranic elements, isotopes of <b>einsteinium</b> {{are very}} radioactive and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.|$|E
5|$|There {{is almost}} {{no use for}} any isotope of <b>einsteinium</b> outside basic {{scientific}} research aiming at production of higher transuranic elements and transactinides.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium(III) {{chloride}} (EsCl3) can {{be prepared}} by annealing einsteinium(III) oxide in the atmosphere of dry hydrogen chloride vapors at about 500°C for some 20 minutes. It crystallizes upon cooling at about 425°C into an orange solid with a hexagonal structure of UCl3 type, where <b>einsteinium</b> atoms are 9-fold coordinated by chlorine atoms in a tricapped trigonal prism geometry.|journal=Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters|volume=5|pages=245–250|date=1969|doi=10.1016/0020-1650(69)80192-3|issue=4|last2=Cunningham|first2=B. B.|last3=Parsons|first3=T. C.|last4=Peterson|first4=J. R.}} Einsteinium(III) bromide (EsBr3) is a pale-yellow solid with a monoclinic structure of AlCl3 type, where the <b>einsteinium</b> atoms are octahedrally coordinated by bromine (coordination number 6).|$|E
5|$|Known oxyhalides of <b>einsteinium</b> include EsOCl, EsOBr and EsOI. They are {{synthesized}} {{by treating}} a trihalide with a vapor mixture {{of water and}} the corresponding hydrogen halide: for example, EsCl3 + H2O/HCl to obtain EsOCl.|$|E
5|$|The first {{microscopic}} {{sample of}} 253Es sample weighing about 10 nanograms was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance {{was designed to}} estimate its weight. Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the <b>einsteinium</b> yields (mostly 253Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978. These quantities however refer to the integral amount in the target right after irradiation. Subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure <b>einsteinium</b> roughly tenfold.|$|E
5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} <b>einsteinium</b> target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for {{chemical}} isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the <b>einsteinium</b> was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the <b>einsteinium</b> target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Although no new {{elements}} (apart from <b>einsteinium</b> and fermium) {{could be}} {{detected in the}} nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Among the 16 known {{isotopes}} of <b>einsteinium</b> {{with mass}} numbers from 241 to 257 the most affordable is 253Es. It is an α-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days, a relatively weak γ-emission and small spontaneous fission rate {{as compared with}} the isotopes of californium. Prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a long-lived isotope 254Es (t1/2 = 275.5 days).|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an <b>einsteinium</b> target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and <b>einsteinium</b> is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{mendelevium}} isotopes (245Md to 247Md) {{are mostly}} produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions, while slightly heavier ones (248Md to 253Md) {{are produced by}} bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen. The most important and most stable isotopes {{are in the range}} from 254Md to 258Md and are produced through bombardment of <b>einsteinium</b> isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. 259Md is produced as a daughter of 259No, and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium-254 and oxygen-18. Typically, the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer. Using available microgram quantities of <b>einsteinium,</b> femtogram quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid <b>einsteinium</b> and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
5|$|These {{results were}} {{published}} in several articles in 1954 with the disclaimer that these were not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The Berkeley team also reported some results on the chemical properties of <b>einsteinium</b> and fermium. The Ivy Mike results were declassified and published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Among the 15 known {{isotopes}} of mendelevium (mass {{numbers from}} 245 to 260), the most studied is 256Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter, 258Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are produced from rare <b>einsteinium</b> (253Es and 255Es respectively), that therefore limits their availability.|$|E
5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column. The <b>einsteinium</b> separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than <b>einsteinium</b> (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of nobelium {{are mostly}} produced by bombarding actinide targets (uranium, plutonium, curium, californium, or <b>einsteinium),</b> {{with the exception}} of nobelium-262, which is produced as the daughter of lawrencium-262. The most commonly used isotope, 255No, can be produced from bombarding curium-248 or californium-249 with carbon-12: the latter method is more common. Irradiating a 350μgcm−2 target of californium-249 with threetrillion (3×1012) 73MeV carbon-12 ions per second for ten minutes can produce around 1200 nobelium-255 atoms.|$|E
5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after <b>einsteinium).</b> The element was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einsteinium</b> {{was first}} {{identified}} in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley {{in collaboration with}} the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the Ivy Mike nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E
5|$|Irradiation of 241Am by 12C or 22Ne ions {{yields the}} {{isotopes}} 247Es (<b>einsteinium)</b> or 260Db (dubnium), respectively. Furthermore, the element berkelium (243Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding 241Am with alpha particles, in 1949, {{by the same}} Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of 243Am with 15N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium, discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of 243Am with 18O.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium was {{discovered}} by bombarding <b>einsteinium</b> with alpha particles in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, father of the periodic table of the chemical elements. Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour. The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium {{and all of its}} isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen nuclides {{and three}} nuclear isomers {{are known for}} <b>einsteinium</b> with atomic weights ranging from 240 to 258. All are {{radioactive}} and the most stable nuclide, 252Es, has a half-life of 471.7 days. Next most stable isotopes are 254Es (half-life 275.7 days), 255Es (39.8 days) and 253Es (20.47 days). All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, {{and most of them}} decay within less than 30 minutes. Of the three nuclear isomers, the most stable is 254mEs with half-life of 39.3 hours.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} <b>einsteinium</b> target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive <b>einsteinium</b> target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
