5|$|Le Guin's father Alfred Louis Kroeber was an anthropologist, and the {{exposure}} that this gave Le Guin influenced {{all of her}} works. Many of the protagonists of Le Guin's novels, such as The Left Hand of Darkness and Rocannon's World are also anthropologists or social investigators of some kind. Le Guin uses the term Ekumen for her fictional alliance of worlds, a term which she <b>got</b> <b>from</b> her father, who derived it from the Greek Oikoumene to refer to Eurasian cultures that shared a common origin.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse's mother, Luann Van Houten, {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in this episode. She was designed to look very similar to Milhouse. Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden. The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice. It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which he <b>got</b> <b>from</b> one of his wife's friends.|$|E

Preparing to leave, the duplicated pair sitting nearby accidentally take the empty backpack from the unlucky pair, while the real Stewie takes the duplicated pair's backpack, which is full of money.|$|E

5|$|Vainio began {{composing}} {{actively in}} the late 1970s, although he had already published his own compositions {{at the beginning of}} the decade. His earliest compositions include Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää. Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is Käyn ahon laitaa ("I Walk by the Side of a Glade") from the 1979 album of the same name. Even though Vainio had already quit drinking, he still occasionally sang about alcohol. Vainio started writing more sensitive songs, a trend which became evident in his next albums. 1981's Albatrossi ja sorsa ("The Albatross and the Duck") contains one of Vainio's most well-known songs, Albatrossi. The topic of the song was lost youth. Another sensitive song on the album is Apteekin ovikello ("The Pharmacy Doorbell"), the idea for which Vainio <b>got</b> <b>from</b> Tapio Rautavaara. Other well-known songs were Panaman konsuli ("The Consul of Panama") and Kun mä rupesin ryyppäämään ("When I Started Drinking").|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had <b>got</b> <b>from</b> Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau’s only travels outside of the United States. It is {{as a result of}} this trip that he {{developed}} lectures that eventually became A Yankee in Canada. He jested that all he <b>got</b> <b>from</b> this adventure “was a cold.” In fact, this proved an opportunity to contrast American civic spirit and democratic values with a colony apparently ruled by illegitimate religious and military power. Whereas his own country had had its revolution, in Canada history had failed to turn.|$|E

He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for.

The Lakers traded both each for a 2011 second-round draft pick and cash. They kept their final pick and selected Chinemelu Elonu. The Texas A center earned All-Big 12 honors last season after averaging 9.8 points and a team-best 7.3 rebounds and 53 blocked shots. He set a school record by making 66.5 {{percent from the field}} and was named the Big 12's most improved player.|$|E

25|$|In May 2012, Celtic {{were rated}} 37th in Brand Finance's annual {{valuation}} of the world's biggest football clubs. Celtic's brand was valued at $64million (£40.7million), $15million {{more than the}} previous year. It {{was the first time}} a Scottish club had been ranked in the top 50. Matt Hannagan, Sports Brand Valuation Analyst at Brand Finance, said that Celtic were constrained by the amount of money they <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the SPL and that if they were in the Premiership then, due to their large fan base, they could be in the top 10 clubs in the world. Later that month David Low, the financial consultant who advised Fergus McCann on his takeover of Celtic in 1994, said that Celtic's 'enterprise value' (how much it would cost to buy the club) was £52million.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, Seattle {{finally got a}} scoring {{opportunity}} when Hawkins fumbled {{the ball on the}} first play from scrimmage and the Seahawks recovered. However, all they <b>got</b> <b>from</b> this was Krieg's third interception, this one to linebacker Matt Millen on the first play after the fumble. At this point, Krieg was benched and replaced by backup Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, LA drove to the Seahawks 9-yard line. Defensive back Gregg Johnson intercepted a pass from Plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game, but even {{this turned out to be}} insufficient. Just two plays later, Davis recorded his second interception of the day, this one on the Seattle 46. On the next play, Allen took off for a 43-yard burst, and then caught a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{heuristic}} algorithm {{relies on}} the iterative strategy, scilicet based on a comparison method, optimizing the results of multiple sequence alignment by the iterative process.

All these algorithms generally are robust and insensitive to the number of sequences, but they also have shortcoming, for example, the result <b>got</b> <b>from</b> particle swarm optimization algorithm is unstable and its merits depend on the selection of random numbers, the runtime of A * search algorithm is too long and the genetic algorithm is easy to fall into local excellent.|$|E

25|$|Although the USA is most {{commonly}} known as the cradle of graffiti, American writers were also influenced by European tendencies. BG138 from Tats Crew confirmed in an interview that Europe was more advanced in some aspects, among those also being the 3D-style and a very cooperative working process – DAIM and Loomit shaped both. DAIM also realized works in Los Angeles and Miami among other cities in the USA. Crome, a writer from Miami commented on getting to know DAIM and Loomit and being impressed by how much planning was involved in their working process. In that way the graffiti could be finished at the location at a much faster pace. After the meeting Crome began to plan his works in advance, too. He also talked about his insights into proportions that he <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the Europeans. The writer Pest from Miami talks about DAIM and Loomit bringing the first Belton cans there, which changed the colour palette of the local writers. Freek used the (German) Belton cans only very economically and only as a crowning finale mixed with American colour, because he could never be sure when the next shipping was going to happen.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, New York {{introduced}} {{incentives to}} replace its current yellow cabs with electric hybrid vehicles {{such as the}} Toyota Prius and Ford Escape Hybrid. In May 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a five-year plan to switch New York City's taxicabs to more fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles {{as part of an}} agenda for New York City to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the plan was dropped after Cab companies complained that the cost of maintaining the new hybrid vehicles vastly outweighed the tiny amount of fuel savings they <b>got</b> <b>from</b> going smaller. Proponents of the traditional Lincoln Town Car and Ford Crown Victoria say they were well suited to their task, while others said customers who cared for the environment preferred hybrids. Not only that, but passenger safety also became an issue with the newer vehicles, and 6 months after the program took effect, it was dropped. Still, the proportion of the taxi fleet made up of Crown Victorias has dropped over time. In 2010, it stood at about 60% of yellow cabs, as the number of Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Sienna minivans kept rising. The percentage of Crown Victoria taxis in the city would be further undercut by the adoption of the similarly-sized Toyota Camry Hybrids since 2010, and the Toyota Prius V. By 2015, the Ford Victoria fleet would be nearly entirely replaced.|$|E
