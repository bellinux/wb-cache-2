5000|$|Ditto reappeared after a {{break of}} more than ten months when he ran at the Craven meeting at Newmarket {{in the spring of}} 1804. On 17 April he ran in the Claret Stakes over the two mile [...] "Ditch In" [...] course in which he was re-opposed by Frank Standish's still unnamed Brother to Stamford. Ditto started the 4/7 {{favourite}} and reproduced his Derby-winning form to beat the Brother to Stamford and <b>Discussor</b> to take the first prize of 1,200 guineas. Ditto was then off the course for a year.|$|E
40|$|The <b>discussor</b> {{brings up}} a number of good points {{regarding}} the difculties in characterizing spatial variability of soils. The main points of concern raised by the <b>discussor</b> are the high coefcients of variation considered by the authors and the methodology used to simulate the random soil property elds. It is hoped that the following discussion will {{shed some light on}} these concerns. Regarding the range in coefcients of variation (COV) considered by the authors, which were 0 1 to 5 0, the authors believe that it is still unknown what value(s) of COV should be used in geotechnical characterization. The appropriate COV depends on several things, such as the intensity of site investigation, the level of deterministic site characterization (eg. higher order trend, layerwise descriptions, etc.), and how the soil variance affects the response quantity, or engineering property, of interest (ie. is the property itself a measure of some form of local average, or is it highly dependent on microscale `defects'?). The issue of site investigation intensity is intimately connected to the degree of deterministic site characterization for example, if only a single value global average property is employed in the design of a footing then the site investigation results could yield a large COV, particularly if the site is large and the investigation points widely seperated. The COV would then be interpreted as one's `uncertainty ' about the value of the property at the footing if no tes...|$|E
40|$|In Fig. 7 it is {{seen that}} the {{calculated}} peak pressure rise is reduced from 0. 74 to 0. 66 (11 percent) as the tip clearance/ chord ratio is increased by 1 percent from 0. 25 to 1. 25. This is a rather large effect; some time ago this <b>discussor</b> correlated mostly subsonic test data {{and concluded that the}} slope should be more like 5 percent for 1 percent clearance/chord ratio. Could the authors clarify how the tip clearance flow was mod-eled in their calculations? N. A. Cumpsty 2 This is a very useful contribution {{to our understanding of the}} difficult problem of tip clearance flow. I think that our understanding could be further helped if the authors would complete the test cases given in Fig. 16 and show the effect of having clearance near the front of the blade but zero clearance near the rear...|$|E
