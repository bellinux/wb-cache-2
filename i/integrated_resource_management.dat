This chapter suggests that <b>integrated</b> water <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> debate {{needs to be}} taken beyond its prima facie grounds if the concept is to yield fruit. According to the Collins Concise Dictionary Plus, integrate means to make or be made into a whole. If this is applied to the subject at hand, the question becomes what constitutes <b>integrated</b> water <b>resource</b> <b>management?</b> Stated differently, what exactly is being integrated in <b>integrated</b> water <b>resource</b> <b>management?</b> The task of the chapter is not just to argue for <b>integrated</b> water <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> but to sketch a conceptual framework. A conceptual framework can be regarded as a template incorporating (a set of) ideas about how a subject can be visualized and operationalized. A useful conceptual framework, we suggest, needs {{to come to grips with}} both theoretical and practical issues.

5000|$|As of September 2014 {{there are}} 283 family-owned cottages in Rondeau Park. The oldest cottages were built over 100 years ago; most {{were built in}} the 1920s. The cottage {{community}} has been assessed as a Cultural Heritage Landscape of provincial significance. The MNR Statement of Philosophy of <b>Integrated</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Management</b> (Feb. 1985) contains the following statement: [...] "Multiple Use Policy is not consistent with a province-wide policy of restricting cottage leases in provincial parks. Instead, planning policy in specific parks should be based on the values, traditions and classification of each park." [...] Rondeau is a Natural Environment -class park, but the cottages are recognized in the official Park Management Plan as Cultural Heritage assets. This requires that the cottages be protected under the Provincial Parks & Conservation Reserves Act, the Class Environmental Assessment for parks and the Ontario Heritage Act. Nevertheless, all current private leases expire on December 31, 2017, at which time the MNR expects all 283 cottages and the Rondeau Yacht Club will be demolished at the owners' expense.|$|E

However, a review of basic concepts could play a decisive role in providing efficient and effective solutions {{in the area of}} sustainable development. Implementation of <b>integrated</b> water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> (IWRM) in the catchment area is the best example for this issue. <b>Integrated</b> water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> problems is an important and complex task for planner and manager of water resources systems. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that the water problems of a country can no longer be resolved exclusively by the water professionals, alone. The water problems are becoming increasingly more and more interconnected with social, economic, environmental, legal and political considerations, at local and national levels, and sometimes even at regional and international levels. One of the main questions is how can be successfully answered in a socially acceptable and economically efficient manner. The present paper analyzes the <b>integrated</b> water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> with respect to principles and general objective of integrated catchment management. Also the toolbox of <b>integrated</b> water <b>resources</b> <b>management,</b> problems and challenges in implementation of IWRM and the necessity of implementing IWRM method are proposed...|$|R
