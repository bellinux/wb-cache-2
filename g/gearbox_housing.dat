50|$|The {{cylinder}} block was from CZ which had an over square bore x stroke.

50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>housing</b> where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{topology}} optimization methods have existing and been improving theoretically since 1980 s; however, in industry, {{with respect to}} the certain conditions, proper modification is always desired. This study develops a specific method to utilize {{topology optimization}} for <b>gearbox</b> <b>housing</b> design. <b>Gearbox</b> <b>housing</b> maintains the position of the shafts to ensure the precision of gear engagement in all operational states (Naunheimer, et al., 2010). The current housing design processing used in Vicura AB, a Swedish powertrain company, is able to achieve stiff optimal housing material distribution, but difficult to fulfil gear misalignment requirement. This work overcomes the above shortages to develop a new methodology for <b>gearbox</b> <b>housing</b> topology optimization concerning the gear misalignment as well. The paper is starting with an introduction of the previous method and its defects, followed by a discussion of three possible improvements. Only one of them is feasible and two main difficulties need to be resolved to make it applicable. One of the difficulties is finding a linear assumption of the non-linear components and the other is deriving an approach for topology optimization involving both external forces and non-zero prescribed displacements. The corresponding solutions are described subsequently in detail both theoretically and practically. Then the results by implementing the new method and also the comparison with the results getting from the old method are presented.

Grey cast iron FG 260, Grey cast iron HT 200, structural steel and Al alloys are the four materials used for the weight calculation process. Zero displacement constraint based boundary condition was applied for simulation. FEA based numerical simulation method was used to find the natural frequency, mode shapes and weight calculation of housing. The FEA simulation results show that the natural frequency of all materials varies (1669 - 4655) Hz. In weight calculation the weight of Al alloys housing is minimum (21. 102 kg). The housing weight of Grey cast iron HT 200 and FG 260 is same, 54. 85 kg. The density of structural steel is high, which increases the weight of housing as 59. 80 kg.

40|$|One main {{contributor}} for gearbox rated lifetime estimation is {{the assessment}} of bearing loading during predicted operating conditions. This paper investigates an approach to determine input bearing loading {{by means of a}} TPA (Transfer Path Analysis) approach.

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{issues can}} be dealt with using several approaches. Using the source - transfer path - receiver approach, a vibration issue could be solved by attenuating the source, modifying the transfer path or by influencing the receiver. Applying this approach on a wind turbine gearbox would respectively correspond with lowering the gear excitation levels, modifying the <b>gearbox</b> <b>housing</b> or by trying to isolate the gearbox {{from the rest of the}} wind turbine. This paper uses a combination of multi-body modelling and typical transfer path analysis (TPA) to investigate the impact of bearings on the total transfer path and the resulting vibration levels. Structural vibrations are calculated using a flexible multi-body model of a 3 stage wind turbine gearbox. Because the high speed mesh is often the main source of vibrations, focus is put on the 4 bearings of this gear stage. The TPA method using structural vibration simulation results shows which bearing position is responsible for transmitting the highest excitation levels from the gears to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>housing</b> structure. Influences of bearing stiffness values and bearing damping values on the resulting vibration levels are investigated by means of a parameter sensitivity study and are confirmed with the results from the TPA. Because both the TPA and the parameter sensitivity analysis revealed a big influence on radial stiffness for a certain bearing this was investigated in more detail and showed the big importance of correct axial bearing position. Main conclusions of this paper are that the total vibration behaviour of a wind turbine gearbox can be altered significantly by changing both bearing properties such as stiffness, damping and position; and bearing support stiffness. status: publishe...|$|E
