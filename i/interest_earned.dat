5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the <b>interest</b> <b>earned</b> by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of a {{consumption}} tax {{argue that the}} income tax system creates perverse incentives by encouraging taxpayers to spend rather than save: a taxpayer is only taxed once on income spent immediately, while any <b>interest</b> <b>earned</b> on saved income is itself taxed.

We apply this model to the recent experience of Argentina and we find that the inflation rate experienced by Argentina during the first year of the monetary program is close to the predictions of the weakly time consistent solution.

25|$|The 2011 {{annual report}} by the program's Board of Trustees noted the following: in 2010, 54 million people were {{receiving}} Social Security benefits, while 157 million people were paying into the fund; of those receiving benefits, 44 million were receiving retirement benefits and 10 million disability benefits. In 2011, there will be 56 million beneficiaries and 158 million workers paying in. In 2010, total income was $781.1 billion and expenditures were $712.5 billion, which meant a total net increase in assets of $68.6 billion. Assets in 2010 were $2.6 trillion, an amount {{that is expected to}} be adequate to cover the next 10 years. In 2023, total income and <b>interest</b> <b>earned</b> on assets are projected to no longer cover expenditures for Social Security, as demographic shifts burden the system.

40|$|Banks are principally in the <b>{{interest}}</b> <b>earning</b> business. The <b>interest</b> <b>earning</b> {{nature of}} banks {{comes with the}} amount of loans that banks are able to advance to their customers. To ensure that the stream of interest is not treacherous, banks must put in place stringent credit risk management practices. In this study, we investigate credit risk and default among Ghanaian banks and how these banks are coping with such pressures. Using a survey method, we found that though varied in nature, all the banks have some form of credit management procedures put in place to manage their loan portfolios. We found loan application processes to be bank specific. However, there are some common requirements that banks usually demand from customers in the process of assessing their suitability for a loan. We also found most of the credit management practices of banks to be consistent with the CAMPARI model. We recommend that the Central Bank facilitate in the establishment of a vibrant credit-referencing bureau in order to provide credit history of customers of the banks...|$|R

The state also filed a lawsuit in Coos County, demanding removal, storage fees of USD$1,500 per day, restoration of the beach, and other unspecified damages. The state alleged negligence on the part of Morgado and also accused Green Atlas shipping of attempting to avoid the expense of the stern dismantling. [...] On November 13, 2002, a Coos County jury found the ship's owners guilty of negligent trespass after a six-week trial; the state was awarded US$25million in damages.

2500|$|The Lebanese {{banking system}} is endowed with several {{characteristics}} that promote {{the role of}} Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on {{the free flow of}} capital and earnings {{into and out of the}} Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the [...] "secret of the profession".

6000|$|Estimating {{these risks}} at 1/3 per cent., the {{remaining}} 3 per cent. {{may be considered}} as the remuneration of capital, apart from insurance against loss. On {{the security of a}} mortgage 4 per cent. is generally obtained, but in this transaction there are considerably greater risks--the uncertainty of titles to land under our bad system of law; the chance of having to realize the security at a great cost in law charges; and liability to delay in the receipt of the interest even when the principal is safe. When mere money independently of exertion yields a larger income, as it sometimes does, for example, by shares in railway or other companies, the surplus is hardly ever an equivalent for the risk of losing the whole, or part, of the capital by mismanagement, {{as in the case of}} the Brighton Railway, the dividend of which, after having been 6 per cent. per annum, sunk to from nothing to 1-1/2 per cent., and shares which had been bought at 120 could not be sold for more than about 43. When money is lent at the high rates of interest one occasionally hears of, rates only given by spend-thrifts and needy persons, it is because the risk of loss is so great that few who possess money can be induced to lend to them at all. So little reason is there for the outcry against [...] "usury" [...] as one of the grievous burthens of the working-classes. Of the profits, therefore, which a manufacturer or other person in business obtains from his capital no more than about 3 per cent. can be set down to the capital itself. If he were able and willing to give up the whole of this to his laborers, who already share among them the whole of his capital as it is annually reproduced from year to year, the addition to their weekly wages would be inconsiderable. Of what he obtains beyond 3 per cent. a great part is insurance against the manifold losses he is exposed to, and cannot safely be applied to his own use, but requires to be kept in reserve to cover those losses when they occur. The remainder is properly the remuneration of his skill and industry--the wages of his labor of superintendence. No doubt if he is very successful in business these wages of his are extremely liberal, and quite out of proportion to what the same skill and industry would command if offered for hire. But, on the other hand, he runs a worse risk than that of being out of employment; that of doing the work without earning anything by it, of having the labor and anxiety without the wages. I do not say that the drawbacks balance the privileges, or that he derives no advantage from the position which makes him a capitalist and employer of labor, instead of a skilled superintendent letting out his services to others; but the amount of his advantage must not be estimated by the great prizes alone. If we subtract from the gains of some the losses of others, and deduct from the balance a fair compensation for the anxiety, skill, and labor of both, grounded on the market price of skilled superintendence, what remains will be, no doubt, considerable, but yet, when compared to the entire capital of the country, annually reproduced and dispensed in wages, it is very much smaller than it appears to the popular imagination; and were the whole of it added to the share of the laborers it would make a less addition to that share than would be made by any important invention in machinery, or by the suppression of unnecessary distributors and other [...] "parasites of industry." [...] To complete the estimate, however, of the portion of the produce of industry which goes to remunerate capital we must not stop at the <b>interest</b> <b>earned</b> out of the produce by the capital actually employed in producing it, but must include that which is paid to the former owners of capital which has been unproductively spent and no longer exists, and is paid, of course, out of the produce of other capital. Of this nature is the interest of national debts, which is the cost a nation is burthened with for past difficulties and dangers, or for past folly or profligacy of its rulers, more or less shared by the nation itself. To this must be added the interest on the debts of landowners and other unproductive consumers; except so far as the money borrowed may have been spent in remunerative improvement of the productive powers of the land. As for landed property itself--the appropriation of the rent of land by private individuals--I reserve, as I have said, this question for discussion hereafter; for the tenure of land might be varied in any manner considered desirable, all the land might be declared the property of the State, without interfering with the right of property in anything which is the product of human labor and abstinence.|$|E
