The air quality in Las Vegas (Clark County) and Reno (Washoe County) is significantly worse than the surrounding rural areas and vehicle emissions have been identified as one of the primary sources of the pollution. Inspection and maintenance programs, mandated by the federal government, have been implemented in both urban areas.

Since then, Taiwan has continued doing remote sensing each year. By the year 2001, Taiwan has accumulated over 7 millions valid records of remote sensing measurement, {{the highest in the}} world.

We then model the inter-cell interference power statistics using the Gamma distribution by matching the first two moments analytically derived. This cooperation and interference analysis provides the theoretical basis for quantitatively evaluating performance impacts of user-assisted relaying in cellular networks. We then numerically evaluate the average transmission rate performance and show that user-assisted relaying can significantly improve per-user transmission rate despite of increased inter-cell interference. This throughput gain is significant for active users near the cell edge and further increases with <b>higher</b> <b>idle</b> user density, supporting user-assisted relaying as a viable solution to crowded population areas...|$|R
