5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued {{his study of}} Aesthetic Realism, and under the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade in <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E

Her mother, Helen Mackintosh, who {{was born in}} Winnipeg, was of Scottish ancestry. Having decided early to become an artist, Howard studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto from 1948 to 1951, where she was a pupil of Will Ogilvie, who taught her figure drawing, and Jock Macdonald, who taught her painting and composition. In her final year she won the silver medal in <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although born in Missoula, Montana, Lynch {{spend his}} youth {{traveling}} across the United States {{due to his}} father Donald's job for the Department of Agriculture; as a result, Lynch attended school across several states. Raised in a contented, happy family, the young Lynch {{was a member of}} the Boy Scouts of America, reaching the highest rank of Eagle Scout. However, Lynch took to building fireworks and playing the bongos in a Beat Generation nightclub as acts of rebellion, before discovering that he could translate his childhood fascination with <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting</b> into a career in fine art. Lynch and his close friend Jack Fisk travelled to Austria hoping to study under Oskar Kokoschka, but the artist was not present at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Buczynski {{started at}} the Old School Elementary in Queens, where he made good grades and {{particularly}} enjoyed music, reading, <b>drawing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting.</b> In August 1954, his mother gave birth to his first brother, Frank, whom he would remain fond of despite the seven-year age gap. Although his family was Roman Catholic, he took an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Ancient Egypt and Classical Greece, which he read about in books. He began devising and performing his own rituals to the deities of these religions, sparking his lifelong interest in Contemporary Paganism. His interest in Pagan religion only increased following his father's sudden death {{from a heart attack}} at age 31 in August 1958. His mother married Edward Nascato in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Rodin {{was born}} in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police {{department}} clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the Petite École, a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting.</b> His drawing teacher, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.|$|E
5|$|Visual art study {{begins with}} <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting</b> and then {{advances}} to more complex {{techniques such as}} sculpture, stained glass, architecture, photography, and pottery. Students learn {{in a variety of}} media, including watercolor, oil pastels, charcoal, and clay. Music study begins in the early childhood program. As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in vocal music, playing Orff instruments and recorders, dancing, and public performance. In middle school, students develop music literacy by reading and writing music, playing choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture and the history of jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought {{on the side of the}} insurgents. Faced with a {{difficult}} choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, the noted artist Aleksander Orłowski, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to further their military education, but as foreigners they were barred from enrolling in French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. There Kościuszko pursued his interest in <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting</b> and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.|$|E

5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1786, {{the year}} that he died, Samuel {{published}} a short work that was titled On the utility of <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting.</b> It has been supposed that as his work {{does not appear to}} have ever fully developed (or that he retired), he died at a young age.|$|E

25|$|Crnčić's most {{important}} legacy is his graphical work. Trained in the European tradition, he achieved {{a high level}} of professionalism. His portrait work was realistic, solid and balanced. The same realism is present in his larger compositions, such as his coloured etchings of old Zagreb, which are freer in the <b>drawing</b> <b>and</b> <b>painting,</b> and evoke an impression accentuated by color.|$|E
25|$|Gustave Courbet {{was born}} in 1819 to Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans (department of Doubs).
