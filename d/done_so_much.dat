5|$|Honoré III was {{succeeded by}} his son Honoré IV (1758–1819) whose {{marriage}} to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. Much of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honoré IV.|$|E
5|$|The Church that Sigeberht had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to {{establish}} in East Anglia survived for two centuries, enduring 'evil times' (such as {{the period when}} the kingdom was under attack by the armies of Penda of Mercia). It lasted continuously under a succession of bishops until the Danish Great Heathen Army invaded East Anglia in the 860s.|$|E
5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E

By the way, there is one small {{question}} which I might ask you now. Can you tell me who a young lady is with very dark hair, grey eyes, and a finely chiselled face? She wore a blue dress when I saw her, with astrachan about her neck and cuffs." ...|$|R
5|$|When {{it came to}} {{personal}} politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E
25|$|Another {{confrontation}} with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of Val d'Aoste. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France, and sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to liberate France.|$|E
25|$|With time, however, and widowhood, a haughtiness and an overt {{craving for}} power and the outward trappings of status came {{increasingly}} to the fore. Livia {{had always been a}} principal beneficiary of the climate of adulation that Augustus had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to create, and which Tiberius despised ("a strong contempt for honours", Tacitus, Annals 4.37). In AD 24, typically, whenever she attended the theatre, a seat among the Vestals was reserved for her (Annals 4.16), and this may have been intended more as an honor for the Vestals than for her (cf. Ovid, Tristia, 4.2.13f, Epist. Ex Ponto 4.13.29f).|$|E

25|$|The IRT was not {{finished}} visiting the all-steel car idea, however. In 1903, George Gibbs used his influence to {{contract with the}} Pennsylvania Railroad's shops in Altoona to build an all-steel prototype for the new subway. The all-steel prototype would serve as {{the inspiration for the}} Gibbs Hi-V cars, so named after George Gibbs, who had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to see to their creation. Along with similar all-steel equipment that arrived later, the Gibbs cars would eventually phase the Composites out of subway service. Meanwhile, as the effort to design a steel car continued in 1903, the IRT awaited arrival of the Composites.|$|E
25|$|Pan {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} Astaire {{right up until the}} latter's last musical picture, Finian's Rainbow (1968), which was a disaster on a number of fronts, not least for Pan himself. The young director Francis Ford Coppola had no prior experience with musical films, and proceeded to ride roughshod over Astaire and Pan's plans for the film's dance routines, reintroducing the style of dancing camera of the early 1930s which Astaire had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to banish from the Hollywood musical. Eventually, Coppola fired Pan, who had a small walk-on part in the film; Coppola has since acknowledged his own primary responsibility for the film's artistic failure.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Boys had one meeting with Napoleon {{though there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence of it having taken place. When Cipriani, Napoleon's major-domo died, Boys and his junior chaplain buried the man, a Catholic, according to the rites of the Protestant Church. Napoleon was astonished when he heard of it, and said a priest would not have <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for a Protestant. As a token of appreciation of their conduct Napoleon desired to give the two chaplains a present. A snuffbox was purchased in Jamestown and offered to Boys, but was refused owing to the severe penalties attached to any acceptance of gifts from the exile.|$|E

500|$|Such {{opinions}} are {{evidence of how}} a more nuanced appreciation of Mendelssohn's work has developed over the last 50 years, together {{with the publication of}} a number of modern biographies placing his achievements in context. Mercer-Taylor comments on the irony that [...] "this broad-based reevaluation of Mendelssohn's music is made possible, in part, by a general disintegration of the idea of a musical canon", an idea which Mendelssohn [...] "as a conductor, pianist and scholar" [...] had <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to establish.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher was Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister {{at a time}} of {{increased}} racial tension in Britain. Commentating on the local elections of May 1977, The Economist noted [...] "The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties. That specifically includes the National Front (NF), which suffered a clear decline from last year". Her standing in the polls rose by 11% after a January 1978 interview for World in Action in which she said [...] "the British character has <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for democracy, for law and <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in", as well as [...] "in many ways [...] add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened". In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives attracted voters from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a meeting in July 1979 with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw she objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of Vietnamese boat people allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000.|$|E
500|$|When Secretary Wilbur {{spoke at}} the {{ceremony}} starting {{the building of the}} railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam [...] "Hoover Dam", citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was [...] "the great engineer whose vision and persistence... has <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to make [...] possible". One writer complained in response that [...] "the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the country." ...|$|E

500|$|Commenting on the platform, Alan Dershowitz wrote, [...] "It {{is a real}} {{tragedy that}} Black Lives Matter — which has <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> good in raising {{awareness}} of police abuses — has now moved away from its central mission and has declared war against the nation state of the Jewish people." [...] He noted that Black Lives Matter is not monolithic and [...] "is a movement comprising numerous groups. ... But the platform {{is the closest thing}} to a formal declaration of principles by Black Lives Matter." [...] Dershowitz called on [...] "all decent supporters of Black Lives Matter" [...] to demand removal of the paragraph accusing Israel of genocide.|$|E

Julie Nixon Eisenhower stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence. Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to [...] "private love letters—for one person alone". Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him.

500|$|Lamont was a {{prominent}} figure in the Better Together Campaign, the cross-party political movement founded to keep Scotland {{as part of the}} United Kingdom following the SNP's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014. She was outspoken in her opposition to Scottish independence, using a keynote speech at UK Labour's 2013 conference in Brighton to accuse the SNP of nurturing hostility between Scotland {{and the rest of the}} UK, and describing nationalism as a [...] "virus that has affected so many nations and <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> harm". Lamont is in favour of greater devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament, and established a Commission to look at how this can be achieved.|$|E
500|$|When The Whitsun Weddings was {{released}} Alvarez continued his attacks {{in a review}} in The Observer, complaining of the [...] "drab circumspection" [...] of Larkin's [...] "commonplace" [...] subject-matter. Praise outweighed criticism; John Betjeman felt Larkin had [...] "closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of {{the last fifty years}} have <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to widen." [...] In The New York Review of Books Christopher Ricks wrote of the [...] "refinement of self-consciousness, usually flawless in its execution" [...] and Larkin's summoning up of [...] "the world of all of us, the place where, in the end, we find our happiness, or not at all."

500|$|In July 1942, Carpender {{arrived in}} the Southwest Pacific Area, where he {{reported}} to [...] Vice Admiral Herbert F.

Lockwood in command of the naval forces based in Western Australia, known as Task Force 51. The main U.S. naval forces based in the west were the submarines, which remained under Lockwood. As a submariner himself, Carpender took a great interest in submarine operations, and did not like what he saw. Carpender and Lockwood did not get along well, and soon came to detest one another. [...] "I've heard about how they run things in the Atlantic Fleet", Lockwood wrote, [...] "so often that I'm ready to shoot any Atlantic Fleet sailor on sightand they, after all, haven't <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to write home about." ...|$|E
