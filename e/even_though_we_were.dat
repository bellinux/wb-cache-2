6000|$|There {{was such}} an air of quiet dignity and evident sincerity in the man that Mark was {{strongly}} impressed. Rising promptly, he stretched his hand across the fire, saying, [...] "We will trust you, friend, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not in your power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. But, {{before that}} time, {{we shall be}} ready with the money; and, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a {{creditor}} in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!" ...|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Corney {{would take}} {{no part in}} the discussion. He flatly refused to give an opinion until after the matter had been fully decided; but I knew full well the old man would remain with us, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> only a company of boys.|$|E

30|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{using the}} column vector f, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking the {{transform}} multiplying by Φ on the right, that is, computing the entries of f^†Φ.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not need}} that the dear lad should go {{into the details of}} what he would do. I {{realized}} on the instant that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> within the enemy's encampment, there was a possibility we might work our will, and no time was wasted.|$|E
60|$|It did really {{seem as if}} we {{had reason}} to be ashamed of grumbling when matters had been so much worse, and I mentally {{resolved}} that I would make the best of the situation, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> forced to remain in hiding a full month.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course you'll {{have your}} way, {{so far as}} leading us lads is concerned," [...] I said quickly. [...] "Surely you have earned the right an hundred times over, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{disposed}} to contest it, which we are not. How do you count on getting to Cambridge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hast prayed to-day, my daughter?" [...] said Ruth, {{struggling}} to be composed. [...] "Thou shouldst not forget thy duty to His blessed name, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> houseless in the woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it keeps}} on it {{certainly}} will be a blizzard," [...] put in Roger. [...] "In one way <b>we</b> can <b>be</b> glad <b>we</b> <b>are</b> under shelter, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a good many miles from home." ...|$|R
50|$|In her Biosculptures {{and other}} works, Brookner {{frequently}} uses imagery where {{parts of the}} body stand for the whole. This reflects the paradox of how humans consider themselves as independent wholes <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> actually parts of an interdependent universe.|$|R
6000|$|... "But yet {{you will}} be, Fitz Hamilton, and that before this night-fall. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{inclined}} to starve ourselves, thinking it might benefit the Cause, {{we have two}} prisoners to look after, and {{now that we have}} no longer reason to fear a meeting with Abel Hunt, what prevents us from going through the encampment?" ...|$|E
60|$|Pierre and Saul {{must have}} {{understood}} {{that they could do}} no less than enter this place of shelter, for it was the only one open to them in the town of York, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> led by an enemy, and so thrust Horry Sims forward on my heels until Uncle 'Rasmus closed the door behind us.|$|E
6000|$|That same {{afternoon}} we were arrested, {{and here we}} are, ready to die if we must, but I swear that I have told you the truth, and I ask you, {{in the name of}} justice, if we have done anything wrong, and if we did not act like loyal and true citizens, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> pitted against an emissary of the devil? ...|$|E
50|$|Spread {{over two}} levels, the Conservatorium Library is light-filled and spacious.

40|$|Recent {{neutrino}} oscillation {{experiments are}} yielding valuable {{information on the}} nature of neutrino masses and mixings <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> far from a complete understanding of the new physics implied by them.

50|$|In psychology, reward {{dependence}} {{is considered}} a moderately heritable personality trait which is stable throughout our lives. It is an inherited neurophysiological mechanism that drives our perception of our society and the environment. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> born with these personality traits, their expression during our life span can be modulated throughout our development.|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> minded {{to be so}} {{reckless}} as to {{take the}} chances of disobeying an order, it could avail us nothing, for pursuit would be given immediately, and how might we hope to escape from a vessel of war's boat, manned most like by a dozen men, we being only two lads not overly well skilled in rowing.|$|E
60|$|We lads were weary with {{watching}} the wicked work; Jim and Dody had toasted {{a large piece}} of bacon over the embers of the tavern; we had partaken of a second meal rather because the food was at hand than owing to hunger, and now all hands felt the need of sleep, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> literally surrounded by enemies.|$|E
60|$|I felt that, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at {{war with}} Russia, we, as a discovery-ship, had no right {{whatever}} to interfere in the capacity of a war-ship, and I was about to remonstrate with the captain at all hazards, when my thoughts were suddenly changed by the order being given to fire a shot across the stranger's bows. The gun at which I was stationed was run out.|$|E
40|$|How can a {{computer}} algebra system (CAS) help {{in getting a}} good numerical approximation to an oscillatory quadrature problem? Our assumption here <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> primarily interested in the rapid and accurate numerical estimation of an integral, and that, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> using a CAS, an exact expression cannot be obtained for theoretical or practical reasons. ...|$|R

40|$|Whoever {{keeps his}} word, truly has {{the love of}} God in him. " <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> {{discrimination}} is a cutting phrase these days, and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all described as being equal - despite differences in color and in race and in sex and in temperament, {{as well as in}} native ability; the truth is that life is not nearly so equalized as we paint it [...] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in {{the cellar}} with a heavy {{flooring}} of planks above us, {{there could be no}} question but that Job Lord would succeed in alarming some of the neighbors unless his wind was shut off, and I saw Archie dig his fingers into the fellow's throat with a grip that must have caused intense pain, but yet I am bound to give the traitor credit for struggling to raise his voice again.|$|E
60|$|I {{was near}} to blessing Seth Jepson because of having played the traitor, since it {{might result in}} our winning {{a name for the}} Minute Boys, and without delay I went back to my comrades, hurriedly giving them to {{understand}} that at last our company was to be armed as befitted soldiers, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lads, and, what was to me the more gratifying, it was possible that we would be called upon to measure strength with the lobster backs.|$|E
60|$|These facts {{caused me}} no little anxiety of mind, and I saw plainly by the {{expression}} on Pierre's face that he was deeply disturbed, as indeed he {{had good reason to}} be. All us lads, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not experienced in warfare, knew that during the time of siege it would be next to impossible for any person to make his way into the American camp from the village, because the outer works would be heavily manned night and day, and every red-coated soldier be on the alert to prevent information being carried to the so-called rebels.|$|E
40|$|Grade Level(s) : 4 - 10 One of {{the many}} {{challenges}} of traveling in foreign countries is trying {{to determine how much}} things actually cost in U.

6000|$|... "We {{must get}} under the roof, where I made the loopholes," [...] Mark said to Susan and Luke. [...] "There's no {{question}} but that the Indians will make a try at coming over the stockade before the fire has destroyed it, else they have changed their natures completely, and we won't give them full swing, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> cooped up here like rats in a trap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're in a shower, lad, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> underground," [...] remarked Leroy. [...] "I {{must say}} I hope this don't last. If it does, we'll soon be wet to the skin." [...] The vaulted cave soon {{came to an}} end, however, and now they found {{themselves}} in an opening cut up into a hundred different chambers, like a coal mine supported by arches. Each looked at the other in perplexity.|$|R
60|$|Now {{we come to}} {{the fourth}} or last Catiline oration, which was made to the Senate, convened on the 5th of December with the purpose of {{deciding}} the fate of the leading conspirators who were held in custody. We learn to what purport were three of the speeches made during this debate--those of Cæsar and of Cato and of Cicero. The first two are given to us by Sallust, but we can hardly think that we have the exact words. The Cæsarean spirit which induced Sallust to ignore altogether the words of Cicero would have induced him to give his own representation of the other two, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to suppose that {{he had been able to}} have them taken down by short-hand writers--Cicero's words, we have no doubt, with such polishing as may have been added to the short-hand writers' notes by Tiro, his slave and secretary. The three are compatible each with the other, and we are entitled to believe that we know the line of argument used by the three orators.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary Kilkenny hurler, Eddie Keher, said: [...] "He was brilliant. I {{was always}} a great fan of his <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> great rivals. Jimmy was also a gentleman {{both on and off}} the field and such a {{beautiful}} striker of the ball." ...|$|E

"Cooler heads quickly prevailed," [...] Andrus continues, [...] "It {{proved the}} old adage that there's nothing like a hanging {{in the morning to}} focus the mind. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{creating}} tomorrow's controversies, a 103-million acre preservation plan ... was a lot better than nothing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was only}} in sport, Amos," [...] Hardy hastened to say, as he {{understood}} that his friend was angry. [...] "Of course I didn't suppose for a moment you were afraid; {{but it seems to}} me as if we might get through with the work at once, rather than wait around here all night.
