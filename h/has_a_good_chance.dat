5|$|Krichell is {{considered}} one of the greatest scouts in baseball history. Birdie Tebbetts, a member of the Veterans Committee in the 1980s, led a campaign to have Krichell, along with fellow scouts Charlie Barrett and Hugh Alexander, inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Under Hall of Fame rules, scouts are not eligible for induction. Tibbets appealed to the Hall of Fame Board of Directors every year from 1981 to 1986 to make the three scouts members of the Hall of Fame, but with no success. In The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, James awards the Paul Krichell Talent Scout Award to an example of a team that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of signing a player who later becomes a star, who they end up passing on as the result of poor scouting.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason for}} the game's success is the strong sense of {{atmosphere}} it evokes. Soldiers are vulnerable to alien attacks even when armored (a single shot from an alien <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of bringing a soldier in perfect condition to death), {{and the use of}} features such as night-time combat, a line of sight, and opportunity fire allows for alien sniper attacks and ambushes. The enemy comes in numerous forms, and the players that are new to the game will run into new kinds of aliens without any knowledge of their characteristics and capabilities beforehand. The course of skirmishes is also dictated by the individual morale levels of their participants on both sides; a low morale can result in them either dropping their weapons and fleeing in panic or going berserk and opening fire indiscriminately. At night, the battlefield needs to be illuminated by flares or fires or else the humans can only spot their enemies at a very short range.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the risk}} of viability—and the {{corresponding}} legal implications that can come with a live birth—most experts recommend induced fetal demise, also referred to as feticide, for abortions after 18 to 20 weeks gestation. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstericss states that abortions [...] "after 22 weeks [...] must be preceded by feticide." [...] If medical staff observe signs of life, they may be required to provide care: emergency medical care if the child <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of survival and palliative care if not.|$|E

She performed [...] "Ako ang Nasawi, Ako ang Nagwagi" [...] by Dulce and Gloria Estefan's [...] "Reach". [...] Prior to the main show, Marcelo was concerned if {{she would be able}} to represent the country since the Philippines' Idol franchise moved from ABC to GMA Network, thinking that the country's participation in Asian Idol would be scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Reichert, at {{the time}} serving as the sheriff of King County, beat his Democratic {{opponent}} Dave Ross by 52% to 48%, a surprisingly small margin, {{in the race to}} replace 12-year incumbent Jennifer Dunn; that year, voters in the district favored Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Responding to Reichert's perceived vulnerability, former Microsoft program manager Darcy Burner (D) challenged Rep. Reichert in 2006, in what was widely expected to be a close election. Influential election analyst Charlie Cook listed the contest among 68 competitive or potentially competitive House races to watch in 2006, categorizing it as a [...] "toss-up" [...] (defined as [...] "the most competitive; Either party <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of winning."

60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--Your {{delightful}} letters duly arrived this morning. They {{were the}} only good feature of the day, which was not a success. Fanny was in bed--she begged I would not split upon her, she felt so guilty; but as I believe she is better this evening, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to be right again {{in a day or}} two, I will disregard her orders. I do not go back, but do not go forward--or not much. It is, in one way, miserable--for I can do no work; a very little wood-cutting, the newspapers, and a note about every two days to write, completely exhausts my surplus energy; even Patience I have to cultivate with parsimony. I see, if I could only get to work, that we could live here with comfort, almost with luxury. Even as it is, {{we should be able to}} get through a considerable time of idleness. I like the place immensely, though I have seen so little of it--I have only been once outside the gate since I was here! It puts me in mind of a summer at Prestonpans and a sickly child you once told me of.|$|E

I forced open a window and ran up. I found that a robber had entered the house. He had seriously wounded the old servant, {{and was on the}} point of attacking Mr. Harvey when I entered. Taken by surprise, the man fled almost immediately. Mrs. Harvey had fainted. At first, we thought the servant was killed, but, finding that he lived, I ran off and fetched Dr. Hodges, who has dressed the wound, and thinks that the man <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of recovery. As Mrs. Harvey had now come round, and was capable of assisting her husband, they did not accept my offer to stay and do anything I could. I said I was coming to you, and Mr. Harvey asked me to say that, although they were too much shaken to see you this evening, they should be glad if you would go round to them the first thing in the morning." ...|$|E

60|$|With {{the truth}} he told I have no {{objection}} to offer, as already indicated. I think it was not premeditated but an inspiration. With his fine military mind, he had probably arranged to let his brother Edward in for the cherry tree results, but by an inspiration he saw his opportunity in time and took advantage of it. By telling the truth he could astonish his father; his father would tell the neighbours; the neighbours would spread it; it would travel to all firesides; in the end it would make him President, and not only that, but First President. He was a far-seeing boy and would be likely to think of these things. Therefore, to my mind, he stands justified for what he did. But not for the other Tower; it was a mistake. Still, I don't know about that; upon reflection I think perhaps it wasn't. For indeed it is that Tower that makes the other one live. If he hadn't said 'I cannot tell a lie' {{there would have been no}} convulsion. That was the earthquake that rocked the planet. That is the kind of statement that lives for ever, and a fact barnacled to it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to share its immortality.|$|E
