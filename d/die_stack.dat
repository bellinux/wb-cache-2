40|$|In the {{competitive}} semiconductor manufacturing industry where {{large amounts of}} data are generated, data driven quality control technologies are gaining increasing importance. The primary goal of this thesis is to build machine learning models for variation analysis and yield improvement. In this thesis, we first propose a novel method to estimate and characterize spatial variations on dies or wafers. This new technique exploits recent developments in matrix completion, enabling estimation of spatial variation across wafers or dies with {{a small number of}} randomly picked sampling points while still achieving fairly high accuracy. This new approach can also be easily generalized, including for estimation of mixed spatial and structure or device type information. Then machine learning models for high yield and time varying semiconductor manufacturing processes are developed. Challenges include class imbalance, concept drift (temporal variation) and feature selection. Batch and online learning methods are introduced to overcome the class imbalance. Incremental learning frameworks are developed to handle concept drift and class imbalance simultaneously. We study the packaging and testing process in chip stack flash memory manufacturing as an application, and show the possibility of yield improvement with machine learning based classifiers detecting bad dies before packaging. Experimental results demonstrate significant yield improvement potential using real data from industry. Without concept drift, for stacks of eight dies, approximately 9 % yield improvement can be achieved. In {{a longer period of time}} with realistic concept drift, our incremental learning approach achieves approximately 1. 4 % yield improvement in the eight <b>die</b> <b>stack</b> case and 3. 4 % in the sixteen <b>die</b> <b>stack</b> case. by Hongge Chen.

40|$|Die {{stacking}} is {{a promising}} {{new technology that}} enables integration of devices in the third dimension. Recent research thrusts in 3 D-integrated microprocessor design have demonstrated significant improvements in both power consumption and performance. However, this technology is currently being held back {{due to the lack}} of test technology. Because processor functionality is partitioned across different silicon die layers, only partial circuitry exists on each layer pre-bond. In current 3 D manufacturing, layers in the <b>die</b> <b>stack</b> are simply bonded together to form the complete processor; no testing is performed at the pre-bond stage. Such a strategy leads to an exponential decay in the yield of the final product and places an economic limit on the number of die that can be stacked. To overcome this limit, pre-bond test is a necessity. In this paper, we present a technique to enable pre-bond test in each layer. Further, we address several issues with integrating this new test hardware into the final design. Finally, we use a sample 3 D floorplan based on the Alpha 21264 to show that our technique can be implemented at a minimal cost (0. 2 % area overhead). Our design for pre-bond testability enables the structural test necessary to continue 3 D integration for microprocessors beyond a few layers...|$|E
40|$|The 3 D {{integration}} of dies promises {{to address the}} problem of increased die size caused by the slowing of scaling. By partitioning a design among two or more dies and stacking them vertically, the average interconnect length is greatly decreased and thus power is reduced. Also, since smaller dies will have a higher yield, 3 D integration will reduce manufacturing costs. However, this increase in yield can only be seen if manufactured dies can be tested before they are stacked. If not, the overall yield for the <b>die</b> <b>stack</b> will be worse than that of the single, larger die. One of the largest issues with prebond die testing is that, to save power, a single die may not have a complete clock distribution network until bonding. This thesis addresses the problem of prebond die testability by ensuring the clock distribution network on a single die will operate with low skew during testing and at a reduced power consumption during operation as compared to a full clock network. The development of a Delay Lock Loop is detailed and used to synchronize disconnected clock networks on a prebond die. This succeeds in providing a test clock network that operates with a skew that is sufficiently close to the target postbond skew. Additionally, a scheme to increase interdie bandwidth by multiplexing Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) by the system clock is presented. This technique allows for great increase in the number of effective signal TSVs while imposing a negligible area overhead causing no performance degradation...|$|E

The TSV connections combined with the presence of multiple memory controllers near the memory arrays form a device that exposes significant memory-level parallelism and is capable of delivering an order of magnitude more bandwidth than current DDRx solutions. While the architecture of this type of device is still nascent, we present several parameter sweeps to highlight the performance characteristics and trade-offs in the HMC architecture. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we attempt to understand and optimize the architecture of a single HMC device that is not connected to any other HMCs. We begin by quantifying the impact of a packetized high-speed serial interface on the performance of the memory system and how it differs from current generation DDRx memories. Next, we perform a sensitivity analysis to gain insight into how various queue sizes, interconnect parameters, and DRAM timings affect the overall performance of the memory system. Then, we analyze several different cube configurations that are resource-constrained to illustrate the trade-offs in choosing the number of memory controllers, DRAM dies, and memory banks in the system. Finally, we use a full system simulation environment running multi-threaded workloads on top of an unmodified Linux kernel to compare the performance of HMC against DDRx and "ideal" memory systems. We conclude that today's CPU protocols such as coherent caches pose a problem for a high-throughput memory system such as the HMC. After removing the bottleneck, however, we see that memory intensive workloads can benefit significantly from the HMC's high bandwidth. In addition to being used as a single HMC device attached to a CPU socket, the HMC allows two or more devices to be "chained" together to form a diverse set of topologies with unique performance characteristics. Since each HMC regenerates the high speed signal on its links, in theory any number of cubes can be connected together to extend the capacity of the memory system. There are, however, practical limits on the number of cubes and types of topologies that can be implemented. In the second part of this work, we describe the challenges and performance impacts of chaining multiple HMC cubes together. We implement several cube topologies of two, four, and eight cubes and apply a number of different routing heuristics of varying complexity. We discuss the effects of the topology on the overall performance of the memory system and the practical limits of chaining. Finally, we quantify the impact of chaining on the execution of workloads using full-system simulation and show that chaining overheads are low enough for it to be a viable avenue to extend memory capacity...|$|E
40|$|As {{integrated}} circuits (ICs) continue to scale to smaller dimensions, long interconnects {{have become the}} dominant contributor to circuit delay and a significant component of power consumption. In {{order to reduce the}} length of these interconnects, 3 D integration and 3 D stacked ICs (3 D SICs) are active areas of research in both academia and industry. 3 D SICs not only have the potential to reduce average interconnect length and alleviate many of the problems caused by long global interconnects, but they can offer greater design flexibility over 2 D ICs, significant reductions in power consumption and footprint in an era of mobile applications, increased on-chip data bandwidth through delay reduction, and improved heterogeneous integration. Compared to 2 D ICs, the manufacture and test of 3 D ICs is significantly more complex. Through-silicon vias (TSVs), which constitute the dense vertical interconnects in a <b>die</b> <b>stack,</b> are a source of additional and unique defects not seen before in ICs. At the same time, testing these TSVs, especially before die stacking, is recognized as a major challenge. The testing of a 3 D stack is constrained by limited test access, test pin availability, power, and thermal constraints. Therefore, efficient and optimized test architectures are needed to ensure that pre-bond, partial, and complete stack testing are not prohibitively expensive. Methods of testing TSVs prior to bonding continue to be a difficult problem due to test access and testability issues. Although some built-in self-test (BIST) techniques have been proposed, these techniques have numerous drawbacks that render them impractical. In this dissertation, a low-cost test architecture is introduced to enable pre-bond TSV test through TSV probing. This has the benefit of not needing large analog test components on the die, which is a significant drawback of many BIST architectures. Coupled with an optimization method described in this dissertation to create parallel test groups for TSVs, test time for pre-bond TSV tests can be significantly reduced. The pre-bond probing methodology is expanded upon to allow for pre-bond scan test as well, to enable both pre-bond TSV and structural test to bring pre-bond known-good-die (KGD) test under a single test paradigm. The addition of boundary registers on functional TSV paths required for pre-bond probing results in an increase in delay on inter-die functional paths. This cost of test architecture insertion can be a significant drawback, especially considering that one benefit of 3 D integration is that critical paths can be partitioned between dies to reduce their delay. This dissertation derives a retiming flow that is used to recover the additional delay added to TSV paths by test cell insertion. Reducing the cost of test for 3 D-SICs is crucial considering that more tests are necessary during 3 D-SIC manufacturing. To reduce test cost, the test architecture and test scheduling for the stack must be optimized to reduce test time across all necessary test insertions. This dissertation examines three paradigms for 3 D integration - hard dies, firm dies, and soft dies, that give varying degrees of control over 2 D test architectures on each die while optimizing the 3 D test architecture. Integer linear programming models are developed to provide an optimal 3 D test architecture and test schedule for the dies in the 3 D stack considering any or all post-bond test insertions. Results show that the ILP models outperform other optimization methods across a range of 3 D benchmark circuits. In summary, this dissertation targets testing and design-for-test (DFT) of 3 D SICs. The proposed techniques enable pre-bond TSV and structural test while maintaining a relatively low test cost. Future work will continue to enable testing of 3 D SICs to move industry closer to realizing the true potential of 3 D integration. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Boundaries with {{specified}} behavior, phase boundaries, crack surfaces or {{singular points}} are, geometrically speaking, lower-dimensional features relative to two- or three-dimensional geometrical domains. Often, the distinguishing {{characteristics of the}} behavior at these features are known a priori and may be exploited to enrich isogeometric models. Explicit geometrical representations possess parametrically computable tangents, normals and curvature, while in implicit strategies, the geometric 2 ̆ 2 exactness 2 ̆ 2 of enriching lower-dimensional features is not exploited or retrieved only {{in the limit of}} mesh refinement. In the present work, CAD-inspired hierarchical partition of unity field compositions are extended to modeling explicitly defined enrichments within the isogeometric framework. The base approximations are 2 ̆ 2 enriched 2 ̆ 2 isogeometrically on parametrically defined lower-dimensional geometrical features of the base entity and by constructing distance fields from them. The efficiency and robustness of distance computations is significantly improved by composing monotonic distance measures, defined piecewise on the enriching geometric entity, using R-Functions. The procedure allows both the behavioral approximation as well as the material description to be enriched enabling the modeling of material damage (or, alternatively, local stiffening). Further, the enrichments may ensure known function value or its derivative. Function value enrichments are demonstrated to model Dirichlet boundary conditions and propagating cracks. The derivative enrichments are used to model Neumann boundary conditions as well as strain jumps across material interfaces. The material enrichments are demonstrated {{through the use of a}} cohesive damage law to model arbitrary crack initiation and propagation within the domain. ^ The developed behavioral as well as material enrichment strategies for modeling fracture are used to study fracture behavior in multilayered structures. A propagating crack impinging an interface between dissimilar materials could either deflect along the interface or penetrate the interface. The competition between crack deflection along the interface or penetration across the interface is numerically investigated. The energy release rate at the crack tip along with the fracture toughness of the interface as well as those of materials forming the interface play an important role in the competition. The numerically evaluated energy release rate for the deflected crack is compared with the maximum energy release rate for the crack penetrating the interface under Mode I and mixed mode conditions. Under Mode I conditions, the ratio of interfacial fracture toughness to the bulk fracture toughness of the material is numerically evaluated for the case of singly and doubly deflected cracks. For cracks under mixed mode conditions, the angle of crack penetration is numerically investigated. Based on the above studies, an automatic crack propagation algorithm is developed for simulating fracture in layered structures, which is demonstrated on an example problem. ^ As a second application, the hierarchical enrichments are used to model a critical failure mechanism in semiconductor chip dielectric stacks. At the present time, fracture in the ILD (interlayer dielectric) stacks induced by assembly to either an organic substrate or a <b>die</b> <b>stack</b> (3 -D) is an important reliability consideration. These interactions include what is popularly referred to as the chip-package interactions (CPI). In this work, insights are developed on the potential crack initiation site within the ILD, die-substrate geometrical parameters that cause most damage, as well as insights on the manufacturing process that is critical to failure. Towards this end analytical models based on classical elasticity theory as well as the enrichment technique that is capable of nucleating and propagating cracks at arbitrary locations within the structure without remeshing are utilized. Specifically, the strength of singularities at all the possible multimaterial corners in the ILD stack are analytically estimated to provide insight on the likely damage nucleation sites for various material configurations in the ILD stack. Both of the enrichment approaches developed in this thesis are used for fracture simulation. In the first, cracks are modeled as discontinuous enrichments over an underlying continuous behavioral approximation. In the second approach, the underlying material description is enriched with a cohesive damage description whose stiffness is evolved according to a prescribed damage law. Multi-level finite element models are used to determine the load imposed on the ILD structure by the substrate. Maximum damage induced in the ILD stack by the above load is used as an indicator of the reliability risk. Parametric simulations are conducted by varying ILD material, die size, die thickness, as well as the solder material. Through analytical models of bonded assemblies, groups of relevant dimensionless parameters are identified to relate the numerically estimated damage in ILD stacks to the die/substrate material and geometrical parameters. It is demonstrated that the damage in the ILD stack is least when the flexural rigidity of the die is matched to that of the assembled substrate. It is also demonstrated that ILD damage is only weakly correlated to shear deformation on the die surface due to assembly. The above observations are generalized into mathematical fits (for use as design rules) relating damage in ILD stacks to ILD material choice, relative substrate flexural rigidity, and die size. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the growing need in a simulation-based design verification flow capable to analyze any design of 3 D IC stacks {{and to determine}} across-die out-of-spec variations in device electrical characteristics caused by layout and through-silicon-via (TSV) /packageinduced mechanical stress. The limited test and characterization capabilities of 3 D IC stacks and a strict "good die" requirement make this type of analysis really critical for the achievement of an acceptable level of functional and parametric yield and reliability. The paper focuses {{on the development of}} a design-for- manufacturability (DFM) type of methodology for managing mechanical stresses during a sequence of designs of 3 D TSV-based <b>dies,</b> <b>stacks</b> and packages. A set of physics-based compact models for a multi-scale simulation, to assess the mechanical stress across the device layers in silicon <b>dies</b> <b>stacked</b> and packaged with the 3 D TSV technology, is proposed. A strategy for a materials data genera tion to feed simulation and a respective materials characterization approach are proposed, with the goal to establish a database for multi-scale materials parameters of wafer-level and package-level structures. A proposal for model validation based and a calibration approach based on fitting the simulation results to measured local stress components and to electrical characteristics of the test-chip devices are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. - This paper {{presents}} novel 2 D geospatial-based predictive {{models for}} exploring the complex thermal spatial behavior of three-dimensional (3 D) <b>die</b> <b>stacked</b> multi-core processors at the early design stage. Unlike other analytical techniques, our predictive models can forecast the location, size and temperature of thermal hotspots. We evaluate the efficiency of using the models for predicting within-die and cross-dies thermal spatial characteristics of 3 D multi-core architectures with widely varied design choices (e. g. microarchitecture, floor-plan and packaging). Our results show the models achieve high accuracy while maintaining low complexity and computation overhead...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of High Bandwidth Memory began at AMD in 2008 {{to solve the}} problem of ever increasing power usage and form factor of computer memory. Amongst other things AMD developed procedures to solve the <b>die</b> <b>stacking</b> problems with a team led by Senior AMD Fellow Bryan Black. Partners from the memory industry (SK Hynix), interposer industry (UMC) and packaging industry (Amkor Technology and ASE) were obtained to help AMD realize their vision of HBM. High volume manufacturing began at a Hynix facility in Icheon, Korea in 2015.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{increase}} {{in demand for}} product miniaturization, high package density, high performance and integration of different functional chips has {{lead to the development}} of three dimensional packaging technologies. Face-to-face silicon (Si) <b>dies</b> <b>stacking</b> is one of the three dimensional (3 D) packaging technologies to form a high density module. In this work, a chip level stacked module was demonstrated for medical application and assessed its package level reliability. The chip level stack module is achieved by <b>stacking</b> two thin <b>dies</b> of different size and thickness together using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects. Electrical simulations are carried out to obtain RLC parameters of micro bump interconnect and complete interconnection from daughter die to substrate. Mechanical simulations are also carried out to study the stress analysis on micro bumps and CSP bumps in the package and parametric study of stacked module package to study the effect of substrate material, underfill material die thicknesses on package reliability and warpage. Test chips are designed and fabricated with daisy chain test structures to access the reliability of the stack module. Pb-free (SnAg) micro bumps of 40 μm on daughter die wafers and Eutectic SnPb solder CSP bumps of 200 μm height on Mother die wafers are fabricated. Mother die and daughter die bumped wafers were thinned to 300 μm and 60 μm respectively using mechanical backgrinding method. These thin <b>dies</b> are <b>stacked</b> using chip to wafer flip chip bonding and underfill process is established for the micro bump interconnects. The assembled Si <b>die</b> <b>stacked</b> modules are subjected to JEDEC package level reliability tests in terms of temperature cycle test (TC), high temperature storage test (HTS), moisture sensitivity test level 1 (MST L 1) and MST L 3, and un-biased High accelerated stress test (uHAST) and results are presented. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} 3 -dimensional {{integrated}} circuits requires new specialized tools, methods and flows. Whereas some tools {{are on the}} market and some design flows for standard ICs are extended to handle <b>die</b> <b>stacking</b> and through-silicon vias, much R&D has still to address relevant and crucial problems. We can roughly classify design problems and tools into three categories: i) synthesis of 3 D structures, ii) analysis, verification and test support, and iii) thermal management. We briefly survey methods and tools addressing these problems. Index Terms— 3 D placement, 3 D routing, Network on Chip, GALS, signal integrity, power integrity, thermal management. I...|$|R
