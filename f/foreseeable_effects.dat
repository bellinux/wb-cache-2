The theoretical benchmark, based on the existence of Pricing to Market strategies, also takes into account some hypotheses about the effects of demand variations and market power on prices. The empirical analysis, using firm panel data for the nineties, points out the positive (though small) impact of the exchange rate on the evolution of price ratio. Additionally, the results also suggest a procyclical behavior of prices in both markets, which is positively affected by the degree of competition.

40|$|The {{thrust of}} this article is that the {{objective}} of preventing directors from frustrating hostile takeover offers cannot be fully realised under the proposed reform. By allowing directors freedom to continue 'conducting the ordinary business of the company', {{in the face of an}} unsolicited takeover attempt, the proposed reform confers wide discretion on the directors to block any takeover bid unacceptable to them. There is no means of identifying intransigent resistance from honest efforts by the directors to manage the business of the company. In order to protect the hostile takeover process more effectively, the proposed reform needs to be refined to spell out with more certainty the proper role of directors in contests for corporate control. The governing rule should explicitly require the directors of a company that is, or is likely to be, the target of a hostile takeover bid to desist from taking any action which may have the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>effect</b> of blocking the offer without the prior consent of the offeree shareholders.

On the planet Dunstan Hammer's Slammers are fighting for the government and Danny Pritchard is becoming romantically involved with one of their representatives; a young woman named Sonna. After a short skirmish, Pritchard's section makes camp in a rural area of Dunstan. Sonna invites Pritchard out for a ride to show him something. They take a skimmer, a low laying hover-vehicles designed for infantry to a nearby structure made of an opaque, yet glass-like material. Pritchard is urged to enter by Sonna and when he enters, he finds the inside presents him with various images of strange and alien creatures, bird-like in appearance, Sonna explains they are an alien race named the Gedel. Shaken, he leaves the ruin and Sonna explains that the Gedel were a race capable of creating many wonders and this ruin is just one of many scattered over Dunstan. Pritchard seems uncaring and uninterested in the nature of the race, especially if the presence of their creations does not directly help his regiment. After decamping, the tank section becomes engaged in another fight, on the edge of a city seemingly made of irreplaceable Gedel structures. Despite Sonna's protestations, Pritchard allows the use of the tanks' heavy ordinance in order to flush out the enemy.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{the fact that}} the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>effects</b> of the climate changes will {{have a major impact on}} the environment, and the human activities, especially fossil fuel combustion, represents the main cause of global warming. Both climate changes and the raise of the world consumption of energy and the perspective of diminishing the mineral energy resources turn the renewable energy into the main viable alternative. Between the renewable resources, the wind (Aeolian) energy has a great potential. In this context, in the last few decades, as a result of the political support towards the renewable energy, the global production of wind energy has met considerable development. In Romania, the insertion of the promotion of electric energy produced by the renewable energy sources system has gathered plenty investments, leading to spectacular risings. The evolution in this domain has though been mostly influenced by the governmental policies.

40|$|In the Festo decision, the Federal Circuit {{significantly}} {{changed the}} scope of the doctrine of equivalents in patent law. The doctrine of prosecution history estoppel precludes a patent owner from claiming during litigation to own ground given up during patent prosecution. Under the old rule, called the "flexible bar," estoppel was based on a multi-factor test and would apply only if the patentee {{had no choice but to}} amend its claims in the way it did. Festo replaced the flexible bar with an "absolute bar," under which virtually any amendment to a patent precludes resort to the doctrine of equivalents for that claim element. The Supreme Court is now considering whether the flexible or absolute bar is the right rule. We believe there is middle ground in this debate that has been ignored with both parties. Whether prosecution history estoppel applies to any given amendment should depend on the reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> <b>effect</b> of that amendment. Normally, patentees will understand that they are surrendering coverage by amending their patent claims, and so a rule precluding them from reclaiming that ground makes sense. But in some cases the absolute bar will produce unexpected and unintended results. We argue that the application of estoppel should turn on whether the effect of a change would be foreseeable to a reasonable patentee at the time of the amendment. This "foreseeable" bar better balances the competing policies of strong protection for pioneering inventors and notice to improvers who wish to design around a patent...|$|R

40|$|Since 1996, the Netherlands {{has adopted}} a flood risk {{management}} policy based on making more room for the rivers. Currently, the focus in flood risk management is being adapted again, in view of increasing societal vulnerability and <b>foreseeable</b> <b>effects</b> of climate change. In this context, the choice between making more room for the river and/or strengthening embankments is again of major concern. This calls for further quantification of the effectiveness, {{costs and benefits of}} all possible measures. Making room for rivers was originally advocated by referring to a reduction of the probability of failure of the embankments and a reduction of the consequences in case of breaching. These arguments still apply, but the effect of making more room for rivers on flood risk has never been properly quantified yet. In this paper we identify three potential risk reducing effects, and quantify their effect for along the Rhine and Meuse Rivers in the Netherlands. We show that lowering the flood levels means smaller flood probabilities, that larger floodplain surface area significantly influences the relationship between discharge and flood level, and that lower flood levels in the river translate into smaller flooding depths and/or flood extent, and thus reduce the consequences of flooding...|$|E
40|$|This study {{starts with}} a quote by Professor Meessen: “The {{function}} of scholars of international law offers less opportunity for creative thinking [compared to scholars of conflict of laws]: they may compile and analyze state practice, but they cannot replace it with their own concepts. ”[1] This study, which primarily looks at the phenomenon of jurisdiction through a (public) international law lens, rejects that limiting claim. While {{the current state of}} the international law of jurisdiction is described at length on the basis of State practice, a consistent doctrine of jurisdiction has been developed, on the basis of both State practice and rational thinking. The exercise of jurisdiction is in practice often characterized by a sheer lack of objectivity – which is not surprising as States, when unilaterally asserting jurisdiction – will almost variably emphasize their own interests over foreign States’ interests. A doctrine that gives States almost unlimited discretion to exercise jurisdicition as they see fit – the doctrine that was seemingly coined by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the 1927 Lotus case – is not workable, because it justifies the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction and allows powerful States to outmaneuver weaker ones. It is shown that there are no hard and fast rules of public international law that limit States’ jurisdictional assertions and confer jurisdiction on the State with the strongest nexus to a situation. Nonetheless, it is also shown that there are a number of international law principles that may serve to restrain the exercise of jurisdiction when the legitimate rights of other States would be encroached upon. The principles of non-intervention, sovereign equality, equity, proportionality, and the prohibition of abuse of law, have been cited in this context. While these principles are typically used in a non-jurisdictional context, this should, given their generic nature, not exclude their application to the law of jurisdiction. In chapter 5, the use of a jurisdictional rule of reason, as set forth in § 403 of the Restatement (Third) of U. S. Foreign Relations Law, is therefore advocated, pursuant to which States are entitled to exercise jurisdiction only if they do so reasonably. The jurisdictional rule of reason may not be a rule de lege lata, for there is insufficient evidence that States, if they restrained their jurisdictional assertions, have done so because international law obliged them to do so. Yet, undeniably, a system of international jurisdiction is only viable if States balance their regulatory interests with the interests of other affected foreign nations, as if they were a global regulator who objectively assesses the merits of any one State’s legal and policy interests. Jurisdictional reasonableness is the main focus throughout this study, and has been applied consistently to the different fields of the law studied. In the final part of this study, the principle of jurisdictional reasonableness is given more ‘body’. For one, it is argued that reasonable jurisdiction could emerge through transnational communicative networks wiring State, international, and private actors. For another, it is shown how States, in different legal contexts, if a situation has a stronger nexus to another State, tend to apply their own laws only on a subsidiary basis. This principle of subsidiarity serves to restrain the exercise of jurisdiction by giving the State with the strongest nexus the primary right to exercise jurisdiction. If the ‘primary’ State fails to exercise jurisdiction, even if, from a global perspective, such were desirable, the ‘subsidiary’ State has the right – and, it may be argued, sometimes the duty – to step in, in the interest of the global community. Such a jurisdictional system connects sovereign interests – on which the law of jurisdiction was traditionally based – with global interests, and ensures that impunity and globally harmful underregulation do not arise. Sovereignty then becomes a “relative” concept: international law and the international interest determine when States could invoke it. [2] If, finally, States, regulators, courts and various legal practitioners are searching for one useful jurisdictional rule of thumb in this study, it is this one: the State with the strongest nexus to a situation is entitled to exercise its jurisdiction, yet if it fails to adequately do so, another State with a weaker nexus (and in the case of violations of jus cogens without a nexus) may step in, provided that its exercise of jurisdiction serves the global interest.

40|$|In an {{examination}} of Hayek?s social philosophy, the article seeks to distinguish between socio-epistemological arguments, which postulate the radical ignorance of social actors, and the conservative political conclusions usually associated with Hayek?s thought, which prophesy {{the destruction of the}} spontaneous order owing to efforts to intervene in the social world. The ultimate purpose of drawing this distinction is to lay the ground for a discussion of a new alliance, one between these arguments and the possibility of design. This exploration of multi-sided Hayekian argumentation allows us to identify some ambiguities essential towards the article?s purposes. The most important ambiguity appears in the argument against planned changes, where Hayek describes the foreseeable negative consequences of such changes and also sketches the scenario shaped by the <b>foreseeable</b> beneficial <b>effects</b> of the undisturbed operation of the spontaneous order...|$|R

50|$|It is {{commonly}} seen that nowadays {{most of the}} organisations have a clear set of hierarchical chains where people in the upper level come up with plans pass them down to their subordinates known as executors, who then carry them out. It appears that the further the individuals are away from the end results, the feeble is the binding power of the <b>foreseeable</b> destructive <b>effects.</b> Disengagement of personal control normally exists among people who are situated between the top and the bottom in a hierarchical system because {{they can get away}} with the responsibility of formulating the plans, and they are not involved in executing the decisions. As a transmitter, they attempt to model dutiful behavior and further legitimize their superiors. Therefore, intermediaries are much more prone to implement destructive commands than are those who are in charge of coming up with new plans and who are responsible for carrying them out and facing the results.|$|R

40|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Llobregat and Ter Rivers are the main sources of water resources for the metropolitan areas of Barcelona and Girona. The historical discharge records of the headwater basins of these rivers during the period 1940 - 2000 have been analysed in relation with the changes in climate forcing and land cover occurring in these South Eastern Pyrenees catchments. Flow records showed high inter-annual variability, with a succession of decadal wet and dry spells, which made the detection of long-term trends {{in most of the}} gauging stations difficult. A comparison of the measured flows with those simulated by two rainfall-runoff models from climatic records showed some clear divergences. The trends of the measured flows for the study periods were negative whereas those explained by climate forcing had practically no trend. Analyses of other data periods may show negative and positive trends. Differences found between observed and simulated flows showed negative trends that were attributed to land use changes. Indeed, middle mountains in the study catchments have undergone an important increase of forest cover in the last decades. The main change observed in the area was an improvement of forest from sparse to dense coverage, and secondarily the change of land use from agriculture to pasture and forestry. The <b>foreseeable</b> <b>effect</b> of this land cover change is an increase of land evaporation caused by the increase in forest cover, not taken into account by the models used. The conclusion is that, although stream flows showed great decadal variability and significant trends driven by climate during some decadal-scale periods, water resources modelled from climate data for the whole period 1940 - 2000 did not show significant trends. In contrast, actual water resources experienced an annual decrease of about 0. 25 % of the mean annual resources during the same time span, due to an increase in forest cover in the headwaters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} European financial markets' {{comprehension and}} interpretation of ECB communication signals. By applying a novel indicator developed by Berger et al. (2006), that quantifies {{the contents of the}} ECB's introductory statements, we find that communication affects the term structure of interest rates in the medium run over a horizon between five months to one year. Our results suggest that financial market agents expect the ECB to prepare them for a change in interest rates well in advance. However, judging upon the dynamics of the response, the exact timing of a decision is less <b>foreseeable.</b> Disentangling the <b>effects</b> of ECB statements on prices, the real and the monetary sector, we provide evidence that especially the ECB's interpretation and forecasts of price developments represent important news to financial market agents...|$|R
40|$|The Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals {{adopted a}} Resolution in 2005 {{recognising}} {{the impacts of}} climate change on migratory species. It called on Contracting Parties to undertake more research to improve our understanding of these impacts and to implement adaptation measures to reduce <b>foreseeable</b> adverse <b>effects.</b> Given the large diversity of taxa and species affected by climate change, {{it is impossible to}} monitor all species and effects thereof. However, it is likely that many of the key ecological and physical processes through which climate change may impact wildlife could be monitored using a suite of indicators, each comprising parameters of species/populations or groups of species as proxies for wider assemblages, habitats and ecosystems. Herein, we identify a suite of 17 indicators whose attributes could reveal negative impacts of climate change on the global status of migratory species: 4 for birds, 4 for marine mammals, 2 for sea turtles, 1 for fish, 3 for land mammals and 3 for bats. A few of these indicators would be relatively straightforward to develop, but most would require additional data collation, and in many cases methodological development. Choosing and developing indicators of the impacts of climate change on migratory species is a challenge, particularly with endangered species, which are subject to many other pressures. To identify and implement conservation measures for these species, indicators must account for the full ensemble of pressures, and link to a system of alerts and triggers for action...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{accident}} analysis for Korean OPR 1000 with MELCOR 1. 8. 6 {{was performed by}} adapting a mitigation strategy under different entry conditions of Severe Accident Management Guidance (SAMG). The analysis {{was focused on the}} effectiveness of the mitigation strategy and its adverse effects. Four core exit temperatures (CETs) were selected as SAMG entry conditions, and Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA), Station Blackout (SBO), and Total Loss of Feed Water (TLOFW) were selected as postulated scenarios that may propagate into severe accidents. In order to delay reactor pressure vessel (RPV) failure, entering the SAMG when the CET reached 923 K, 923 K, and 753 K resulted in the best results for SBLOCA, SBO, and TLOFW scenarios, respectively. This implies that using event-based diagnosis for severe accidents may be more beneficial than using symptom-based diagnosis. There is no significant difference among selected SAMG entry conditions in light of the operator&# 39;s available action time before the RPV failure. Potential vulnerability of the RPV due to hydrogen generation was analyzed to investigate the <b>foreseeable</b> adverse <b>effects</b> that act against the accident mitigation strategies. For the SBLOCA cases, mitigation cases generated more hydrogen than the base case. However, the amount of hydrogen generated was similar between the base and mitigation cases for SBO and TLOFW. Hydrogen concentrations of containment were less than 5 % before RPV failure for most cases.
