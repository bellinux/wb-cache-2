25|$|On the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial,</b> {{the streets}} {{that led to}} the court were full of people. Shops and stores of the medina quarter were closed and law {{enforcement}} could not handle the turmoil. The crowd carried them in triumph as their hearings were, once again, postponed. Fearing overthrow, Fran√ßois Manceron, then-resident-general, met with Chedly Khairallah, manager of La Voix du Tunisien, at his residence in La Marsa, to find a compromise. That very afternoon, he invited the drafting committee of the newspaper and declared that he had an interview, that morning, with Khairallah. He also announced that a compromise was found. This lie made mischief within the group. Bourguiba asked Khairallah for further clarifications and he confirmed the rendezvous with the resident-general. In response the drafting committee demanded the management of the daily journal but, upon Khairallah's refusal to do so, decided to leave the newspaper.|$|E
500|$|District Judge J. P. Mauffray, Jr. {{presided over}} Bell's trial. On the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial,</b> June 26, 2007, Walters reduced the charges to aggravated second-degree battery and {{conspiracy}} to commit aggravated second-degree battery. The charge of aggravated battery {{requires the use of}} a [...] "dangerous weapon", and Walters argued that the tennis shoes worn by Bell while allegedly kicking Barker were dangerous weapons. A number of witnesses testified that they saw Bell strike Barker, while other witnesses were unsure Bell was involved at all.|$|E
500|$|On {{the sixth}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial,</b> alcohol tax agent Patrick Donoghue testified that, {{in a case}} that Donoghue had investigated, Glasser persuaded a grand jury to reverse itself after {{returning}} an indictment by placing the matter on the pending call indefinitely. Another government witness, bootlegging handyman Ralph Sharp testified that he had paid Kretske $250 in order for Kretske, as prosecutor, to recommend that the charges against him be dismissed (which they were). Frank Hodorowicz, another bootlegger turned government witness, testified that he had paid Kretske $1,300 to recommend the dismissal of two cases and was convicted in the third case after he refused to pay $1,000. After he was indicted the third time, he testified, Glasser declined to intervene on his behalf, saying: [...] "You're going to jail for five years; I can't do anything about it. For {{all the money in the}} world I couldn't help you. This isn't an ordinary case. Agents are in town from Washington." ...|$|E

This time the trial judge observed Cooper and heard testimony from people including lay witnesses, defendant Cooper, and a third psychologist who concluded that Cooper was incompetent. While expressing his uncertainty and not disagreeing with the psychologist, the judge ruled against Cooper and ordered the trial to proceed, finally opining: ...|$|E

He sat with folded arms, {{listening}} intently {{to the trial}} proceedings and eating apples. He was entranced by the flies walking on {{the ceiling of the}} courthouse, and laughed audibly when a constable lost his footing and slipped while trying to bring him out of the defendant's box. Agnes Macdonald wrote in her journal that he was a [...] "small, mean-looking" [...] man, who stroked his moustache nervously.|$|E
2500|$|It can be {{said with}} a high degree of {{certainty}} that most of the time in the first half of 1948 the mass-exodus was the natural, thoughtless, pitiful movement of ignorant people who had been badly led and who in the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> found themselves forsaken by their leaders. Terror was the impulse, by hearsay most often, and sometimes through experience as in the Arab port of Jaffa which surrendered on the 12th of May and where the Irgunists, to quote Mr. John Marlowe, [...] "embellished their Deir Yassin battle honours by an orgy of looting". But if the exodus was by and large an accident of war in the first stage, in the later stages it was consciously and mercilessly helped on by Jewish threats and aggression towards Arab populations.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial,</b> the half brother of McInerney, James Bing, was admonished by Judge Campbell {{because it was}} overheard that Bing went to the jury outside of the {{courtroom}} and addressed them. [...] He said: [...] "The fate of my brother is in your hands." [...] Bing was then banned from the courtroom unless he is summoned to testify. [...] The prosecutor depicted McInerney as a popular teenager, who was skilled in martial arts and firing guns {{as well as being}} a white supremacist. [...] She went on to describe King as a small guy who had often been picked on, saying that King wore high-heeled boots, makeup and jewelry along with his school uniform to school. [...] Scott Wippert, McInerney's attorney described King as the aggressor, saying he often was sexually aggressive and often made inappropriate remarks, provoking McInerney.|$|E

2500|$|The Court of Appeals of Virginia {{issued a}} ruling on April 23, 2013, which granted Huguely an appeal {{based on two}} key issues. The court agreed with the defense's {{argument}} that Huguely's right to counsel was violated {{when one of his}} attorneys, Rhonda Quagliana, fell ill and missed a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial.</b> The court also granted the appeal based on the failure to exclude [...] "Juror 32" [...] because of possible doubts about his/her impartiality. The Court of Appeals then heard oral arguments from Huguely's new lawyer, Paul Clement (former Solicitor General of the United States), on December 11, 2013. Clement argued for a new trial, arguing Huguely was denied his right to an attorney when one of his (two) lawyers fell ill during the trial. Nine days into the trial, Huguely co-counsel Rhonda Quagliana became visibly ill with stomach flu, but the trial judge refused to grant a continuance, even though Huguely objected: co-counsel Frances Lawrence was asked by the trial judge whether he could proceed without Quagliana, he said he could. In addition to raising questions about [...] "Juror 32", Huguely's appeal team also objected to the trial judge's refusal to allow [...] "blame the victim" [...] questions of jurors and said the jury was not properly instructed on the definition of [...] "malice", an element in a second-degree murder conviction. The Court of Appeals ruled against Huguely on March 4, 2014, affirming the second-degree murder conviction. In November 2014 the Virginia Supreme Court declined to consider Huguely's appeal.|$|E
