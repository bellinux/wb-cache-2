5000|$|Journal (friction, radial or rotary) bearing: This is {{the most}} common type of plain bearing; it is simply a shaft {{rotating}} in a bearing. [...] In locomotive and railroad car applications a journal bearing specifically referred to the plain bearing once used at the ends of the axles of railroad wheel sets, enclosed by <b>journal</b> <b>boxes</b> (axleboxes). Axlebox bearings today are no longer plain bearings but rather are rolling-element bearings.|$|R
50|$|This was not {{the first}} {{railroad}} accident in which an overheated <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> caused an axle to break and derail a train. The first-ever train wreck involving passenger fatalities, the Hightstown rail accident of 1833, had an identical cause.|$|E
50|$|In total, 79 {{passengers}} died, {{all from}} cars #7 and #8, and 117 were injured, some seriously. The inquiry quickly established the overheated <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> {{as the cause}} of the accident, but railroad mechanics who had inspected and lubricated the box earlier that day swore it had been in good order. Normal practice was for signal towermen to watch passing train wheels for signs of problems and for train crew to look back as trains rounded curves. How this hot box escaped attention until too late has never been explained.|$|E
50|$|The tenders {{initially}} rode on drawing x-6002 standard bogies {{fitted with}} grease-lubricated bearings. Later, drawing x-10161 bogies, still fitted with grease-lubricated bearings were substituted on some locomotives {{as they came}} in for overhaul. A later variant was the drawing x-11183 'Timken' roller-bearing bogie fitted to the WAB class conversions of 1947-57 and as used under the G class locomotive tenders from 1937. Enthusiasts {{were able to identify}} these different types of bogies by their design characteristics - for example, the x-6002 bogies had a prominent <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> and were made of steel bar sections.|$|E
50|$|The bogies, in turn, {{not having}} to sustain the engines' weight, were {{redesigned}} by taking inspiration {{from those of the}} first electrical railway motor cars: they featured <b>journal</b> <b>boxes</b> on the external part of the frame, a main volute spring suspension and an auxiliary one based on the traditional leaf-spring design. This bogie design, which was very easy to build and maintain, also proved to be very reliable in the long run.|$|R
50|$|In June 1956, Boxing Magazine, the Japan's oldest {{surviving}} <b>boxing</b> <b>journal,</b> {{was launched}} by the Baseball Magazine Company. Currently {{there is only one}} other monthly <b>boxing</b> <b>journal</b> in Japan, called Boxing Beat. This has been renamed twice from World Boxing since 1968.|$|R
50|$|Plans {{had existed}} in 1901 to rebuild further F class locomotives, {{but these were}} {{scrapped}} and in 1902-03 a further six FB class locomotives were built, numbers 315 and 372-376. These locomotives differed from the other rebuilds in having a redesigned frame and piston valves {{in place of the}} original slide valves fitted to the earlier rebuilds. FA 9 also differed from the standard rebuilds in that its trailing truck had outside <b>journal</b> <b>boxes</b> instead of the internal type used on the other engines.|$|R
5000|$|Everything {{appeared}} in order {{as the train}} passed through North Philadelphia station ahead of schedule and slowed its speed, but shortly afterward, as it passed a rail yard, workers noticed flames coming from a <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> (a hot box) {{on one of the}} cars and rang the next signal tower at Frankford Junction, but the call came too late. Before the tower man could react, disaster struck as the train passed his signal tower at 6:06 pm traveling at a speed of 56 mph. The <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> on the front of car #7 seized and an axle snapped, catching the underside of the truck and catapulting the car upwards. It struck a signal gantry, which peeled off its roof along the line of windows [...] "like a can of sardines". Car #8 wrapped itself around the gantry upright in a figure U. The next six cars were scattered at odd angles over the tracks, and the last two cars remained undamaged, with bodies of the 79 dead lying scattered over the tracks. As it was wartime, many servicemen home on leave were aboard who helped the injured, workers from the nearby Cramp's shipyard arrived with acetylene torches to cut open cars to rescue the injured, a process that took until the following morning. The rescue work was directed by mayor Bernard Samuel. The work of removing the dead was not complete until 24 hours after the accident.|$|E
5000|$|The train {{had been}} {{travelling}} from South Amboy to Bordentown {{at a speed}} of 35 mph, when despite having stopped [...] "to oil the wheels" [...] and slowing to 20 mph, a <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> overheated (a condition known as hot box) and caught fire, causing an axle to break {{on one of the}} carriages, derailing and overturning it. All but one of the 24 passengers it carried were injured; one was killed outright and another died later from his injuries. Among the injured was Cornelius Vanderbilt, who broke a leg and vowed never to travel by train again, although he later broke his vow and eventually became a railway magnate, owning the New York Central Railroad, among others. Another passenger was Congressman and former US President John Quincy Adams, who escaped injury, but described the accident in his diary as [...] "the most dreadful catastrophe that ever my eyes beheld". Irish actor Tyrone Power was also aboard the train and recorded the accident in his two-volume journal Impressions of America.|$|E
5000|$|The packing {{and bearing}} {{had to be}} {{regularly}} inspected by yard crews, and packing was often added at major stops. The journal bearing was replaceable, but if neglected, it would heat to a temperature where the babbitt bearing alloy would melt away, leaving the brass carrier riding on the steel axle, and result in a [...] "taper journal". This would eventually lead to the axle fracturing and the car above falling onto the wheel, {{or failure of the}} taper journal, causing the side frame and <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> to fall below the level of the rails, either of which could cause a major derailment of the train. Train worker duties consisted partly of inspecting the train as it ran by, looking for smoke, sparks, or fire. They would then sound the audible report [...] "All Black" [...] to mean the train was not giving off any light energy that would indicate combustion or destruction of the wheel bearings. If the train worker saw [...] "Red" [...] or smoke, he would alert other crew members, or else make an emergency stop to the train to prevent further damage.|$|E
50|$|Although born in Malmö, Dorch {{grew up in}} Södermalm in Stockholm. Signs of {{a talent}} in writing were {{detected}} early, and he was self-taught, with a self-chiseled style using elaborate yet straightforward language. He was also an accomplished amateur boxer with national team qualifications and it was mainly in boxing where he was active. Dorch founded the Swedish <b>Boxing</b> society <b>journal</b> <b>Boxing</b> and an association called Punchpralinerna (in English, Punch chocolates). He collaborated with childhood friend, the legendary football player Nacka Skoglund with whom he finished his football career, on various advertising assignments, etc.|$|R
50|$|The DVM-4 is of a hood-type design, with a cab at one end, {{external}} walkways {{around the}} engine compartment, and a welded steel frame. It has two-axle bogies with box beams and transverse pivot bars; the <b>journal</b> <b>boxes</b> have SKF roller bearings. Tractive and braking forces are transmitted via pins. The gearbox was set with {{a gear ratio}} of 73:21=3.476. The locomotive is equipped with Knorr air brakes and handbrakes; air for the brake system is supplied by an MK-135 three-cylinder, two-stage compressor. Brake pads are located at either side of each wheel.|$|R
50|$|Also, the ATSF was {{the first}} company to have roller bearing trucks made by Timken under their {{passenger}} cars, much {{to the delight of}} their passengers, and the bottom line for the company. Timken commissioned the construction of a demonstration boxcar in 1943 that was first seen at the 1948 Chicago Rail Fair. It was a rolling advertisement for a new way of reducing friction - roller bearings (made by the Timken Roller Bearing Company). The car's trucks lacked the then common axle <b>journal</b> <b>boxes,</b> with the bearings mounted on the ends of the axles outside the wheels.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{undesired}} whirl of rotating machines can {{be reduced}} by elastic <b>journal</b> <b>box</b> suspension systems equipped with dry friction dampers. The critical speeds can be cut off by the adhesion of the friction surfaces and the whirl amplitude can be restrained throughout the remaining sliding range by a proper choice of the suspension-to-shaft stiffness ratio and of the support-to-rotor mass ratio. The dry friction forces counteract also efficiently the well known destabilising effect of the shaft hysteresis in the supercritical range. This lecture deals firstly with the natural precession speeds, investigates the steady response to unbalance and defines the ranges of adhesive or sliding contact. Then, the stabilisation “in the small” of the hysteretic whirl by means of other external dissipative sources is studied applying the Floquet approach through a perturbation procedure, while the stability “in the large” is checked by the direct numerical solution of the motion equation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{systematically}} {{studying the}} possibilities of minimizing devastating consequences of high-speed rail vehicle derailments by appropriate measures and features in the train design including the running gear. Firstly, an empirical database is established containing as much relevant information as possible of past incidents and accidents that have occurred at substantial running speeds due to mechanical failure close to the interface between the running gear and the track. Other causes that ultimately brought the train in a derailed condition are also covered. Although various accidental circumstances make each derailment a unique event, certain patterns appear to emerge which lead to several critical vehicle parameters capable of influencing {{the outcome of a}} derailment or preventing a derailment to occur. Secondly, the possibility of preventing wheel climbing derailments after an axle journal failure is studied by implementing mechanical restrictions between wheelsets and bogie frame. In this respect, a multi body system (MBS) computer model is developed to account for such an axle failure condition, which is successfully validated on the basis of two authentic passenger car events. In order to study the overall post-derailment vehicle behaviour, in particular the wheelsets’ vertical motion and lateral deviation on sleepers, a comprehensive MBS post-derailment module is developed and implemented in the commercially available software GENSYS. The model detects wheel-sleeper impact conditions and applies valid force resultants calculated through linear interpolation based on a pre-defined look-up table. The table was constructed through exhaustive finite element (FE) wheel to concrete sleeper impact simulations utilising the commercially available software LS-DYNA. The MBS post-derailment module has been validated successfully in several stages, including a correct prediction of the derailing wheelset’s trajectory over ten consecutive sleepers in comparison with an authentic passenger vehicle derailment event. An extensive simulation analysis on the feasibility of utilizing alternative substitute guidance mechanisms attached to the running gear on rail vehicles is presented, as means of minimizing the lateral deviation. Three low-reaching guidance mechanisms attached onto the running gear (bogie frame, brake disc and axle <b>journal</b> <b>box)</b> are analysed in terms of geometrical parameters for a successful engagement with the rail in order to prevent large lateral deviations after twelve different derailment scenarios. Three conventional coupled passenger trailing cars are investigated in terms of lateral deviation and vehicle overturning tendency after derailments on tangent and curved track. This is performed as a function of various vehicle design features and parameters such as: maximum centre coupler yaw angle, carbody height of centre of gravity, coupler height and additional running gear features. In a similar manner, the articulated train concept is investigated in terms of the post-derailment vehicle behaviour as a function of different inter-carbody damper characteristics and running gear features.

5000|$|Including the domes, {{the total}} {{height of the}} cars [...] "from rail to roof" [...] was 15 ft. Each car {{measured}} 85 ft in length, and weighted 150,000 lbs kg when unloaded. Each of the cars was built using low-alloy, high-tensile steel, and constructed using the welded-girder technique. The trucks on the train's passenger cars were developed from locomotive trucks, with outside-mounted swing hangers spaced 96 in apart (instead of the typical practice of mounting them 56 in apart {{on the inside of}} the trucks) and rolling bearing <b>journal</b> <b>boxes,</b> which helped to improve truck alignment, smooth the train's ride, and reduce body roll on curves from 28 in to 6 in.|$|R

50|$|The coal output accumulates at the pit {{heads and}} cannot be moved. The {{transport}} system is seriously damaged by bombing and under-maintenance. Brown coal {{is no longer}} available in West Germany, since 75 percent of German brown coal lies in the Russian Zone, which is an additional catastrophe. In November 1947 only 70.000 freight cars in the U.S. Zone will be available, instead of 93.000 in January 1947. The reason is the slow rate of repairs resulting from shortage of necessary supplies as lumber, steel, asbestos packing and lagging, cotton waist for <b>journal</b> <b>boxes,</b> oil pads and spare parts of all kind. Key supply parts and even rolling stock should be shipped from the US, before the winter 1947 may have brought a complete breakdown in the transportation system.|$|R
50|$|At {{least three}} of the ex-Russian {{locomotives}} that have entered service, 862, 863 and 870, are of the DM62 type. The DM62 was a variant of that, originally delivered to the Soviet Army between 1982 and 1994. These were operated by the 10th, 52nd and 36th Guards Missile Divisions of the Soviet Army to pull the combat missile trains in which RT-23UTTKh rail-mobile ICBMs were carried. The DM62 differs from the standard M62S {{by a number of}} changes designed to improve the reliability and survivability of the locomotive; some of these changes were later incorporated into the design of the (2)M62U. External spotting differences include the bogies, the rectangular housings for the headlights, and the box between the headlight on which the number plates are mounted. Other differences include heat sensors in the <b>journal</b> <b>boxes,</b> automatic starters for the engine, blackout shields, and multiple-unit operation regardless of the locomotives position in the train. Following the dissolution of the Railway Rocket Troops in 2000, these locomotives were transferred to the Russian Railways.|$|R
50|$|While making {{contributions}} to those issues over years, Honda {{worked on the}} world title fights of Cesar Bazan (since the 1990s), Edwin Valero et al. in the 2000s. In July 2007, he sent Jorge Linares to Las Vegas, Nevada, to successfully fight for and win his first world title. He became the Japan's eighth world champion to be crowned across the sea. In April 2010, Honda arranged the de facto unification match Hozumi Hasegawa vs. Fernando Montiel. At that time, Montiel's WBO title was not at stake under {{the policies of the}} Japan Boxing Commission. Hasegawa had wished to move to the featherweight division from more than two months ago, but he asked Honda to negotiate saying that he wanted to fight against Montiel even if his match fee would decline (Honda actually did not do it though). The Japan's oldest surviving <b>boxing</b> <b>journal</b> <b>Boxing</b> Magazine placed that fight as the best card in Japan's boxing history as of April 2010. Montiel received the second highest purse following Mike Tyson among the world champions fought in Japan.|$|R
