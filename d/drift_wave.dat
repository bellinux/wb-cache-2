40|$|The role of {{large-scale}} fluctuation structures in electrostatic drift-wave-type plasma turbulence is highlighted. In particular, well-defined laboratory experiments allow one {{to study the}} dynamics of <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> mode structures as well as 'eddies' in <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence. In the present paper we discuss the mutual relationships between observations made in linear magnetic geometry, purely toroidal geometry and magnetic confinement. The simplest structure, a saturated, nonlinear drift mode, is {{the starting point for}} a Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse transition route to chaos and weakly developed turbulence. Both spectral and phase space analysis are applied to characterize in detail the transition scenario, which is enforced due to an increased drive by the plasma equilibrium state. In addition to direct multi-probe observation, statistical approaches are most revealing for the systematic study of the spatiotemporal dynamics in fully developed <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence.

40|$|Multi-scale {{methods are}} {{utilized}} {{within the context}} of strongly magnetized plasmas to describe the interaction of <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence with large scale flow structures. The specific contexts treated correspond to transport barrier formation, magnetic island evolution in the presence of <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence, and plasma rotation. Emphasis is placed on identifying critical feedback mechanisms via the study of simple, reduced models, rather than the detailed description of isolated components of the system. In Chapter 2 a two component self-consistent model is derived to investigate a novel mechanism of transport barrier formation. It is found that intense cellular flow, driven by modulational instability of the background turbulence provides a viable candidate mechanism for triggering transport barrier formation in regimes of weak magnetic shear. Similarly, the nonlinear modification of the <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> phase space topology by the cellular flow is investigated. The presence of a weak non- integrable perturbation in the effective Hamiltonian of the <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence, induced by the non-axisymmetric component of the cellular flow, is found to circumvent nonlinear wave trapping as a means of quenching the secondary instability drive of the large scale flow. In Chapter 3, the interaction of a tearing mode with <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence is discussed. Wave kinetics and adiabatic theory are utilized to treat the feedback of tearing mode flows on the <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence. The stresses exerted by the self-consistently evolved <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> population density on the tearing mode are calculated by mean field methods. The principal effect of the drift waves is to pump the resonant low-m mode via a negative viscosity, consistent with the classical notion of an inverse cascade in quasi 2 -D turbulence. In Chapter 4, the multi-scale methods utilized above are extended to describe the transport of parallel momentum. The primarily fluid description employed above is extended to include momentum exchange between waves and resonant particles. A quasi- linear momentum conservation theorem is proven, demonstrating that the total momentum flux can be decomposed into wave and resonant particle fluxes. Quasi- linear expressions for the radial transport of parallel momentum induced both by waves and resonant particles are derived, providing a comprehensive quasi-linear description of parallel momentum transport induced by electrostatic <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulenc...|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} the main {{observational}} characteristics of the radio emission of pulsars with well organized drifting subpulses is presented. We propose that drifting subpulses result from the modulation of the radio emission mechanism due to long-wavelength <b>drift</b> <b>waves</b> in the magnetosphere. The <b>drift</b> <b>waves</b> are generated at shorter wavelengths, and their nonlinear evolution favours accumulation in a specific azimuthal eigenmode with an integral number, $m$, of nodes encircling the magnetic pole.

For a given set of background scales, the parameter space can {{be covered by}} the plasma beta and <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> collisionality.

The underlying cause is the nonlinear vorticity advection through which the self sustained <b>drift</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence supersedes the linear instabilities, scattering them apart before they can grow, imposing its own physical character on the dynamics.
