50|$|For Holmes {{it proves}} rather an {{elementary}} case, for he {{has dealt with}} similar cases {{and this one is}} not so complex to unravel, despite the confusion it causes Dr. Watson and Inspector Lestrade. Holmes finds Hatty and the strange man from the front pew, and the dénouement takes the form of Holmes having Hatty explain herself to Lord Robert. Hatty and the mystery man, Francis H. Moulton, were husband and wife. They parted on the day of their wedding so that he could try to amass a fortune by prospecting. He was reported killed in an Apache raid on a mining camp where he was working. Hatty had given him up for dead, met Lord Robert, and decided to marry him, even though her heart still belonged to Frank. Frank had only been taken prisoner by the Apache raiders, and he escaped and tracked Hatty to London. He arrived at the church in time for the ceremony and she recognized him instantly. Rather than have her make a scene at the church, he <b>gestured</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be silent, and wrote a note which he slipped to her as he returned her bouquet. She had wanted to abscond without ever telling anybody, but Holmes had tracked them down and convinced them {{that it would be better}} to have the full truth. Lord Robert is unmoved by Hatty's apologies and feels that he has been very ill used.|$|E
30|$|When it {{was time}} to finish the activity, MI {{expressed}} discontent with the activity interruption and manifested by <b>gestures</b> <b>her</b> longing <b>to</b> continue the storytelling game with the cards.|$|R
60|$|In {{the garden}} his lordship came upon Miss Armytage alone, still seated by the table under the trellis, {{from which the}} cloth had by now been removed. She rose at his {{approach}} {{and in spite of}} <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> remain seated.|$|R
5000|$|A plump {{woman with}} her legs held apart, <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> exposed vulva.|$|R
50|$|A girl (Pearle Maaney) {{is riding}} a scooter on the road. A man (Dharmajan Bolgatty) in a bicycle selling ice cream <b>gestures</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> switch off the head {{light of the}} scooter, which she turned off without any response. She stops at the traffic signal where she see a child (Akshara Kishore) sitting on the lap of a lady (Anjali Aneesh Upasana) who {{is sitting in the}} {{backseat}} of a bike. The child smiles at her, she smile too with an enthusiasm which enlightens and reminds <b>her</b> <b>to</b> return back to the ice cream selling man to give back a thankful smile at him.|$|R
60|$|The {{disappointment}} of Faith had made <b>her</b> too impatient <b>to</b> lend a pleased {{attention to this}} tale; but, at that moment, a form appeared at her side, and by a quiet and commanding <b>gesture</b> directed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> humor the temper of the wanderer.|$|R
60|$|Curtis, {{with a few}} swift <b>gestures,</b> {{conveyed}} <b>her</b> wishes <b>to</b> Two Horns, who {{replied in}} a way which made Curtis smile.|$|R
60|$|They {{had reached}} the first slight ascent. Her {{companion}} drew out his watch, looked at it with satisfaction, and changed the position of {{his hands on the}} reins. Without being able to detect the difference, she felt they were slackening speed. She turned inquiringly towards him; he nodded his head, with a half smile and a <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> look ahead. The spires of San Jose were already faintly uplifting from the distant fringe of oaks.|$|R
60|$|A low cry greeted Duane. The {{room was}} light. He saw Ray Longstreth {{sitting on her}} bed in her dressing-gown. With a warning <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be silent he turned to close the door. It was a heavy door without bolt or bar, and when Duane had shut it he felt safe only for the moment. Then he gazed around the room. There was one window with blind closely drawn. He listened and seemed to hear {{footsteps}} retreating, dying away.|$|R
60|$|Adelheid made an imploring <b>gesture</b> for <b>her</b> father <b>to</b> forbear, {{while she}} resumed her seat from farther {{inability}} to stand. The two anxious old men followed her example, in wondering silence.|$|R
6000|$|He turned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with a <b>gesture</b> that begged <b>her</b> <b>to</b> desist. [...] "My dear lady, {{this is very}} painful. I {{must try}} to think it out calmly, and I am not able now." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{illustrates}} why {{the degree}} to which people feel able to be in control of information about themselves is so important. For Jo Spence this meant confronting the condition that may stigmatise her, and actively revealing it. This defiant <b>gesture</b> allowed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> regain control of her image and become the active subject of her own photograph- an issue central <b>to</b> <b>her</b> beliefs and photographic work.|$|R
60|$|My {{mother-in-law}} {{was sitting}} alone, near a work-table, knitting. The moment I {{appeared in the}} doorway she laid aside her work, and, rising, signed to me with a commanding <b>gesture</b> of <b>her</b> hand <b>to</b> let <b>her</b> speak first.|$|R
60|$|As the man fell forward dead, the {{two women}} {{recognized}} Tarzan simultaneously. Pan-at-lee fell upon her knees and would have bowed her head upon his feet had he not, with an impatient <b>gesture,</b> commanded <b>her</b> <b>to</b> rise. He {{had no time to}} listen to their protestations of gratitude or answer the numerous questions which he knew would soon be flowing from those two feminine tongues.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are other}} {{rooms in the}} house besides this," [...] <b>her</b> <b>gesture</b> seemed <b>to</b> say; [...] "try them. The proofs are there, 'tis for you to find them." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary, with <b>her</b> usual {{characteristic}} <b>gesture,</b> pressed <b>her</b> hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> heart, unable <b>to</b> {{speak with}} the sudden emotion which had sent the blood throbbing in her veins. The kind old Duchess, her wrinkled face expressive of the deepest sorrow and the most respectful sympathy, waited patiently until the Queen had recovered herself.|$|R
50|$|Neeru {{pretends to}} lead a happy and prosperous life. She <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> former lover during various instances, {{particularly}} when the door bell rings and she persuades Manu not to open the door. They go on talking about their past and present with multiple flashbacks.|$|R
6000|$|... "See <b>to</b> her--mark <b>her</b> little dignity {{with her}} heather and {{bluebell}} crown {{as she sits}} on the rock, as stately as jewels could make <b>her!</b> See <b>her</b> <b>gesture</b> with <b>her</b> hands, <b>to</b> mark where the standing ruff ought to be. She hath the true spirit of the Comedy--ah! and here cometh young Antony with mincing pace, with a dock-leaf for a fan, and a mantle for a farthingale! She speaks! now hark!" ...|$|R
50|$|Abby (Brittany Murphy) is an American {{girl who}} goes to Tokyo <b>to</b> be with <b>her</b> boyfriend, Ethan (Gabriel Mann). Ethan tells her {{that he has to}} go to Osaka on a {{business}} trip and may not be back for a while. Abby asks to go with him but Ethan refuses and breaks up with <b>her.</b> Abby goes <b>to</b> a ramen shop afterward, and the chef Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida) and his wife Reiko (Kimiko Yo) tell her that they are closed. Abby does not understand them as she does not speak Japanese. She starts to cry, so the chef conveys <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sit down. He brings her a bowl of ramen, and she loves it. A small distance away, she hallucinates that the lucky cat, known as the Maneki Neko, or Beckoning Cat, <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come over. She offers <b>to</b> pay for <b>her</b> meal, but the chef and his wife refuse.|$|R
60|$|Jacopo made a <b>gesture</b> for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{lead the}} way, and followed. With a beating, but still {{lightened}} heart, Gelsomina glided along the passages, carefully locking each door, as of wont, behind her, {{when she had}} passed through it. At length they reached the well known Bridge of Sighs. The anxious girl went on with a lighter step, when she found herself approaching her own abode, for she was busy in planning the means of concealing her companion in her father's rooms, should there be hazard in his passing out of the prison during the day.|$|R
60|$|Isobel Hannay was {{the first}} <b>to</b> finish, for <b>her</b> letter <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother was but a short one. As she closed it she looked up. Captain Forster was {{standing}} at {{the other side of the}} table with his eyes fixed on her, and he made a slight <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that he wished <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She hesitated a moment, and then rose and quietly left the room. A moment later he joined her outside.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{the trees}} hid him, and {{presently}} he was thrusting through them and in sight again. She could see {{there was something}} different, and then she {{saw that he was}} hurrying unusually and then that he limped. He <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and she walked towards him. His face became clearer, and she saw with infinite concern that he winced at every stride.|$|R
50|$|Rimjim is a painter, {{who looks}} after her grandfather's shop {{during the week}} and earns extra money as a street painter on weekends. It's through her {{painting}} that she meets Abith (Tanvir Khan), an cop who is chasing a criminal, but keeps Rimjim {{in the dark about}} his real work. The other man, Romeo (Shakib Khan), is an undercover police officer who found a soft spot for her and watches her from afar for some time.However, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career Romeo can only make small <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> while still staying in the shadows. Rimjim is dying to meet the man who leaves flowers on her doorstep every day, and built a bridge over a stream for her after she once fell in. Both men try <b>to</b> woo <b>her</b> from afar while still hiding their identities, as she remains alone but moved by these incredible <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> It's {{only a matter of time}} before the undercover police officer and Interpol agent cross paths and things really begin to unravel in this action-fueled romance story.|$|R
2500|$|Sam defended <b>her</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> the court: [...] "J'ai fait juste un bisou. C'est un geste d'amour, quand je l'ai embrassé, je n'ai pas réfléchi, je pensais que l'artiste, il aurait compris... Ce geste était un acte artistique provoqué par le pouvoir de l'art" [...] ("It {{was just}} a kiss, a loving gesture. I kissed it without thinking; I thought the artist would understand.... It was an artistic act {{provoked}} {{by the power of}} art").|$|R
50|$|Sakorafa stirred {{controversy}} in 2004 {{when she became}} a Palestinian citizen and applied {{a few months before}} the Olympic Games for a berth on the Palestinian Olympic team at the age of 47. She made her debut representing Palestine in Chania, Crete, on 28 June 2004 - her performance was 47.23 metres. Despite the fact that <b>her</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> participate as a Palestinian was symbolic, the IAAF ruled her ineligible for the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|R

500|$|On Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman {{suffered}} a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed {{on her right}} side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak. As one friend described it: [...] "Just to think that here was Emma, the greatest orator in America, unable to utter one word." [...] For three months she improved slightly, receiving visitors and on one occasion <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> address book <b>to</b> signal that a friend might find friendly contacts {{during a trip to}} Mexico. She {{suffered a}}nother stroke on May 8, however, and on May 14 she died in Toronto, aged 70.|$|R
60|$|She--the woman--had drawn Nola with kindly <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> The {{child was}} crying softly, {{for she was}} half-frightened at the strangeness of the place, and also she was tired after her long {{walk up and down}} the rough road. The woman, with subtle {{feminine}} comprehension, soon realised this, and also understood that the girl, reared in slavery, felt awed in the presence of so great a lord. So, putting a kindly arm round the slender form of the child, she led her gently out of the main room to the tiny cubicle beyond, where she could rest.|$|R
6000|$|Her husband made a <b>gesture</b> for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{find one}} of those brief rules of conduct, which have been {{received}} among all Christian nations as the direct mandates of the Creator, and which have been found so just, that even they, who deny their high authority, admit their wisdom. Ishmael listened with grave attention, as his companion read all those verses, which her memory suggested, and which were thought applicable {{to the situation in}} which they found themselves. He made her show him the words, which he regarded with a sort of strange reverence. A resolution once taken was usually irrevocable, in one who was moved with so much difficulty. He put his hand upon the book, and closed the pages himself, as much as to apprise his wife that he was satisfied. Esther, who so well knew his character, trembled at the action, and casting a glance at his steady eye, she said-- ...|$|R
60|$|A {{beautiful}} girl, {{with significant}} <b>gestures,</b> pressed <b>her</b> hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> heart, then {{pointed in the}} direction of the tents, and then rushed away, soon reappearing with a short thin man, inclining to middle age, but of a compact and apparently powerful frame, lithe, supple, and sinewy. His complexion was dark, but clear; his eye large, liquid, and black; but his other features small, though precisely moulded. He wore a green jacket and a pair of black velvet breeches, his legs and feet being bare, with the exception of slippers. Round his head was twisted a red handkerchief, which, perhaps, might not have looked like a turban on a countenance less oriental.|$|R
5000|$|Volkov asked a guard {{where they}} were being taken and was told they were being taken [...] "to the house of arrest." [...] Hendrikova, {{who had been in}} the washroom, asked a guard the same {{question}} when she came out. She was told they were being taken [...] "to the central prison." [...] Hendrikova asked him, [...] "and from there?" [...] The guard replied, [...] "Well! to Moscow." [...] Hendrikova repeated this conversation <b>to</b> <b>her</b> fellow prisoners and made the sign of the cross with her fingers. Volkov took <b>her</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> mean [...] "they will not shoot us." ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{rehabilitation}} institute where MI is regularly attended, the designer asked <b>her</b> <b>to</b> draw on white paper, using pencils and crayons. MI expressed herself either with <b>gestures</b> <b>her</b> mother and therapists translated or with her paper communication board.|$|R
6000|$|She brightened {{and laughed}} at the dismay in his voice. [...] "Indeed, I have been here six weeks." [...] She {{looked out over the}} shimmering moonlit waters of the Tagus and the shadowy, ghostly ships of the British fleet that rode at anchor there, and her eyes were wistful. Her fingers, with that little <b>gesture</b> {{peculiar}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in moments of constraint, were again entwining themselves in her rope of pearls. [...] "Yes," [...] she said almost musingly, [...] "I think I must be going soon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Volkov, {{who later}} escaped, {{recalled}} {{that when he}} asked a guard where they were being taken, he was told they were being taken [...] "to the house of arrest."

50|$|After {{interviews}} with possible witnesses, Sam Hall, a coach at an elementary school, stated {{he saw a}} suspicious-looking driver parked in a vehicle in an alley beside the school on September 17. Hall had been supervising {{a group of students}} at play when he noticed a suspicious vehicle. According to Hall, the driver was making strange gestures and was struggling with his stick shift. He memorized the licence plate, ran to his car to get a notepad and wrote it down. He later gave it to police after hearing Vicki went missing. A little girl said the driver made an obscene <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as he cruised by her house. Another saw the driver back into a telephone pole.|$|R
