5000|$|The name Matsumoku {{appeared}} on the <b>neck</b> <b>bolt</b> plate of some guitars they built. Early Grecos and some 1980s Aria Pro IIs have Matsumoku on the <b>neck</b> <b>bolt</b> plate. Other <b>neck</b> plates were blank or simply had the word [...] "Japan" [...] stamped on them.|$|R

50|$|However, {{because it}} mainly {{manufactured}} guitars under contract, {{the role of}} Matsumoku was largely unknown outside of Japan's guitar making circles until its name began appearing on <b>neck</b> <b>bolt</b> plates, headstocks, and sound hole labels in the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{acoustic}} guitar bolt-on neck as popularized by Taylor Guitars includes threaded inserts in {{the heel of}} the <b>neck.</b> <b>Bolts</b> inserted through the neck block of the body from inside the instrument attach the neck to the body.|$|R
50|$|The Epiphone Thunderbird IV Limited Edition, {{a budget}} {{alternative}} to the Gibson models, has a maple <b>neck</b> <b>bolted</b> onto an alder body. Alpine White finish with black hardware and assembled at the Epiphone Custom Shop in Korea. This model is currently no longer produced.|$|R

5000|$|Ring Bungee: The 'Ring Bungee' {{introduces}} a metal ring along the bungee length (in the armpit area). [...] This permits {{the use of}} a choker to connect tanks to the ring, making bungee wrapping of the cylinder valve/neck unnecessary. A popular configuration has the bolt snap connected to a ring by a quick link, with a length of bungee from the ring to another quick link which is used to connect the assembly to a D-ring {{on the back of the}} harness. The bolt snap is clipped to the shoulder D-ring and the cylinder <b>neck</b> <b>bolt</b> snap is clipped to the ring. The choker is used to minimise the distance the cylinder top can dangle away from the ring bungee.|$|R
50|$|Some {{construction}} features {{returned to}} pre-CBS specs, including the four <b>bolt</b> <b>neck</b> joint, smaller headstock, and {{removal of the}} bullet-style truss rod adjustment.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Fender {{released}} the American Vintage reissue '72 Telecaster Custom, replicating the original '72 design {{features such as}} the three <b>bolt</b> <b>neck</b> and the classic look, with improved construction and quality.|$|R

50|$|Doctor Stein gives Eddie new {{replacement}} arms using his DNA solution, and Eddie {{seems to be}} recovering well until Malcomb confesses his attraction to Winifred. Winifed tries to let him down gently, explaining that she intends to marry Eddie {{as soon as the}} surgeries are complete, and Malcomb seems to accept her statement, but he later vindictively sabotages the DNA solution used during Eddie's leg surgeries with the contaminated RNA, causing the former soldier to start to devolve into a primitive brutish state with hairy hands and a Neanderthal brow ridge. As his condition worsens and he loses the mental capacity for speech and rational thought, the stony-faced Eddie becomes a slowly shambling monster resembling an African-American version of the iconic Boris Karloff monster with a squarish afro instead of the usual scars and <b>neck</b> <b>bolts.</b> Although he lies in a near catatonic state by day, compelled by horrible cannibalistic urges the black suit and turtleneck-clad Eddie secretly leaves the house late each night in search of victims who he dismembers, disembowels and devours zombie-style, always returning in time each morning for his ongoing schedule of DNA injections with his doctors none the wiser.|$|R
5000|$|The Ventures Model [...] - [...] Also {{came as a}} {{bass and}} later on, A 12-string. Post Ventures, 1968 and 1969 it was named the [...] "Mark I". The first Ventures Models came with a set neck, bound body and a large Ventures and Mosrite logo, less than 250 of these were made before {{settling}} on the standard Ventures Model sometime in 1964, without body binding and the <b>neck</b> became <b>bolt</b> on. The Mosrite logo and Ventures model logo were slightly reduced.|$|R
50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on <b>necks.</b> Real <b>bolted</b> joints (i.e., using bolt coupled with a nut) exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external self-tapping thread — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]68 caliber Triumph {{series was}} {{launched}} in 2006 by Tippman Pneumatics; the marker is an entry level model, which departs from the Tippman standard MilSim design. The three basic models include the XL semi-automatic (with -inch basic barrel), XT semi-automatic (adding an expansion chamber, front grip assembly and 11-inch barrel), and eXT Electronic - which operates at fully automatic twelve or fifteen BPS, single-shot, or three round burst. The markers all feature a high impact composite body, double trigger, a center feed <b>neck,</b> in-line <b>bolt</b> system and a 200-round gravity feed hopper.|$|R
5000|$|Gibson started {{producing}} the S-1 in mid-1974, but released {{it on the}} market in 1975. Its production lifespan was 1974-1980. Like the Gibson Marauder, the S-1 was an attempt to break through into the single-coil guitar market. It too consisted of a flat Les Paul -like body with a maple Flying V <b>neck</b> <b>bolted</b> on. Unlike the Marauder, however, the S-1 featured three [...] "see-thru" [...] single-coil pickups designed by Bill Lawrence, with fairly elaborate circuitry to generate humbucking and single-coil pick-up sounds. Just like the Marauders, the S-1 all had Schaller made [...] "Harmonica" [...] ("tune-o-matic" [...] style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece. The S-1 had one 2 way toggle switch and a [...] "chicken head" [...] 4 position rotary switch. This 4 way rotary switch made it possible to use the pick-ups in 4 different ways: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. In the down position the 2 way toggle switch bypassed the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one straight connection to the bridge pick-up, which resulted in a sound that was pretty close to that of the Fender Esquire (Telecaster in bridge only position). The potentiometers are volume and tone. The sound was similar to that of a Fender Stratocaster or a Fender Telecaster.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} are gray to pink in color and have a body length range from 1.53 to 2.6 m. They have a dorsal ridge rather than a <b>fin.</b> Their <b>neck</b> {{vertebrae}} are unfused, allowing them to turn their heads sharply. Like other river dolphins, I. araguaiaensis has a prominent forehead and a much longer snout than those of most marine dolphins, as well as smaller eyes than marine dolphins. Because their aquatic environment is often turbid, their vision is not as well developed. River dolphins {{tend to be less}} active than marine dolphins. They feed mainly on fish, aided by echolocation.|$|R
60|$|The {{picture of}} the {{full-fledged}} Lane, who made a very poor figure in the saddle at any time, careering panic stricken across the prairie with his arms about the <b>neck</b> of a <b>bolting</b> horse appealed to me; but as {{to the possibility of}} the usurer's future discomfiture I was still in the dark, and asked for enlightenment.|$|R
5000|$|Mike Scott, {{writing for}} the New Orleans Times-Picayune, said, [...] "It's a theme Mary Shelley brought us in Frankenstein, which was first {{published}} in 1818. That was almost 200 years ago. And while Ex Machina replaces the stitches and <b>neck</b> <b>bolts</b> with gears and fiber-optics, it all feels an awful lot like the same story." [...] Jaime Perales Contreras, writing for Letras Libres, compared Ex Machina as a gothic experience similar to a modern version of Frankenstein, saying [...] "both the novel Frankenstein and the movie Ex Machina share the history of a fallible god in a continuous battle against his creation." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club criticized the way the sci-fi, near the end, veered off course from being a [...] "film of ideas" [...] by [...] "taking an arbitrary left turn into the territory of corny slasher thrillers": [...] "While Ex Machina’s ending isn’t unmotivated ..., it does fracture much of what’s special about the movie. Up until the final scenes, Garland creates and sustains a credible atmosphere of unease and scientific speculation, defined by color-coded production design ... and a tiny, capable cast." [...] Steve Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter stated, [...] "The story ends in a muddled rush, leaving many unanswered questions. Like a newly launched high-end smartphone, Ex Machina looks cool and sleek, but ultimately proves flimsy and underpowered. Still, for dystopian future-shock fans who can look beyond its basic design flaws, Garland’s feature debut functions just fine as superior pulp sci-fi." ...|$|R
25|$|The helmet {{is usually}} made of two main parts: the bonnet, which covers the diver's head, and the corselet which {{supports}} {{the weight of}} the helmet on the diver's shoulders, and is clamped to the suit to create a watertight seal. The bonnet is attached and sealed to the corselet at the <b>neck,</b> either by <b>bolts</b> or an interrupted screw-thread, with some form of locking mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|These guitars {{are made}} {{completely}} of acrylic {{and their bodies}} are transparent, making the electronics inside viewable. The original run of the acrylic models featured a standard bolt-on maple neck with wood headstock, but later models featured an acrylic headstock, matching {{the same color as}} the body and making the overall appearance of the guitar more attractive. Acrylic is more dense than most woods ( [...] specific gravity of acrylic is 1.18 g/cm3 while that of lignum vitae, probably the heaviest of woods,is approximately 1.23g/cm3) which makes the guitar heavier. In 2006 B.C. Rich introduced the IT (Invisibolt Technology) series. In this series the <b>neck</b> is <b>bolted</b> inside the body to look like a neck-through, but neck joint is still visible. This combines the elements of both bolt-on and neck-through designs.|$|R
50|$|Like the beluga, narwhals are {{medium-sized}} whales. For both sexes, {{excluding the}} male's tusk, the total body size {{can range from}} 3.95 to 5.5 m; the males are slightly larger than the females. The average weight of an adult narwhal is 800 to 1600 kg. At around 11 to 13 years old, the males become sexually mature; females become sexually mature at about 5 to 8 years old. Narwhals {{do not have a}} dorsal <b>fin,</b> and their <b>neck</b> vertebrae are jointed like those of other mammals, not fused as in dolphins and most whales.|$|R
5000|$|The newest of {{the series}} the 'Predator Plus ST' is {{available}} in six colors; Gloss Black, Candy Apple Red, Topaz Blue, Transparent Purple, Transparent Amber and Transparent Black. It's made with 2 Peavey custom USA designed humbucking pickups, with a three way switch selector. The body is made of solid basswood, with a premium AAA quilt maple top on transparent finish versions, and binding. It has a maple bolt-on <b>neck</b> with 5 <b>bolts</b> and 25.5" [...] scale length. The fret board is made from rosewood and there are 24-frets that are 2.7 mm wide × 1.1 mm tall and 4 mm white dots are inlaid on the frets.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{there are}} a large variety of models {{available}} in the Diamond range, many are 'mixed and matched' parts from different Schecter guitars. For example, all [...] "Omen", [...] "C", [...] "Hellraiser" [...] and [...] "Damien" [...] basses have the same body shape, although some have set <b>necks</b> rather than <b>bolt</b> on <b>necks,</b> different finish colors, and different woods. However, Schecter produces many different guitars from {{a smaller number of}} core parts. This mix and match culture has the benefit of allowing guitarists to find a Schecter to fit their exact requirements, but negatively gives less of a 'core product' range as shown by Gibson Guitars who only have a small range of guitars available.|$|R
60|$|But, {{too quickly}} for her, Bob whirled again, though this time, by a severe effort, she saved {{herself from the}} undignified {{position}} against his <b>neck.</b> His <b>bolt</b> was more determined, but she pulled him into a prancing walk, and turned him roughly back with her spurred heel. There was nothing feminine {{in the way she}} handled him; her method was imperative and masculine. Had this not been so, Daylight would have expected her to say she had had enough. But that little preliminary exhibition had taught him something of Dede's quality. And if it had not, a glance at her gray eyes, just perceptibly angry with herself, and at her firm-set mouth, would have told him the same thing. Daylight did not suggest anything, while he hung almost gleefully upon her actions in anticipation of what the fractious Bob was going to get. And Bob got it, on his next whirl, or attempt, rather, for he was no more than halfway around when the quirt met him smack on his tender nose. There and then, in his bewilderment, surprise, and pain, his fore feet, just skimming above the road, dropped down.|$|R
60|$|Mulcachy {{ordered an}} {{assistant}} to enter the arena with him. Since he could not compel the tiger directly {{to sit in the}} chair, he must employ other means. The rope about Ben <b>Bolt's</b> <b>neck</b> was passed up through the bars and rove through the block-and-tackle. At signal from Mulcachy, the ten men hauled away. Snarling, struggling, choking, in a fresh madness of terror at this new outrage, Ben Bolt was slowly hoisted by his neck up from the floor, until, quite clear of it, whirling, squirming, battling, suspended by his neck like a man being hanged, his wind was shut off and he began to suffocate. He coiled and twisted, the splendid muscles of his body enabling him almost to tie knots in it.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 Jerome Hershman {{a guitar}} {{distributor}} from America noticed a Levin guitar at a trade show in Germany and convinced the Levin company {{to let him}} market their guitars in America. However Hershman knew that the brandname Levin {{would be hard to}} market in America and suggested the name Goya. Inspired by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, who was well known for the guitars that he showed in his paintings. The Goya product line proved to be successful due to its high quality finish. The use of nylon strings also gave the guitar a different tone than most other guitars that used steel strings, making it popular among folk musicians. In the late 1950s, a line of steel-stringed flat-tops were launched, with adjustable trussrods and <b>bolted</b> <b>necks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The neck joint or heel is {{the point}} at which the <b>neck</b> is either <b>bolted</b> or glued to the body of the guitar. Almost all {{acoustic}} steel-string guitars, with the primary exception of Taylors, have glued (otherwise known as set) necks, while electric guitars are constructed using both types. Most classical guitars have a neck and headblock carved from one piece of wood, known as a [...] "Spanish heel." [...] Commonly used set neck joints include mortise and tenon joints (such as those used by C. F. Martin & Co.), dovetail joints (also used by C. F. Martin on the D-28 and similar models) and Spanish heel neck joints, which are named after the shoe they resemble and commonly found in classical guitars. All three types offer stability.|$|R
50|$|Fin lizard, Velusaurus bipod: a small, bipedal lizard from North America with no front {{limbs and}} a system of erectile fins and dewlaps on its neck and tail which it raises to the wind to radiate excess heat. It can travel at speeds up to 50 {{kilometers}} per hour. When cooling itself, it typically balances on one leg while keeping the other off the hot desert surface to get maximum benefit from the system, with its <b>neck</b> and tail <b>fins</b> outstretched as well. The <b>neck</b> <b>fins</b> are full of blood vessels that lie near the surface and serve to keep the animal cool. It {{is one of the}} several desert reptiles that have developed rudimentary devices for keeping themselves cool if they overheat. It is preyed upon by ground-dwelling birds such as the long-legged quail.|$|R
25|$|Ernie Ball Music Man {{improved}} their visibility in the guitar {{market with a}} succession of new guitar models, largely player-endorsed, including the Silhouette (1986), Steve Morse Signature (1987), Eddie Van Halen Signature/Axis model (1990), Albert Lee Signature (1993), Steve Lukather Signature (1993), the John Petrucci 6 & 7-string guitars (1999). They also introduced a series of new electric bass models, including the StingRay 5 (1987), the Sterling Bass (1993) and the Bongo Bass (2003) (the futuristic look of which was designed {{in conjunction with the}} BMW DesignworksUSA team). While none of these could compete against Fender or Gibson on sales figures, Music Man outpaced the competition by making 'players' guitars with quick change pickup assemblies, Teflon coated truss-rods, low noise pickup designs, piezo bridge pickups, 5 and 6 <b>bolt</b> <b>necks,</b> sculpted neck joints, graphite acrylic resin coated body cavities and most importantly, consistently high quality fit and finish.|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} bolt assemblies is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; <b>necking</b> of the <b>bolt</b> shank, and thread-stripping. While literature exists to predict failure modes at ambient temperature, there is no method for failure mode prediction for elevated temperatures where ductility is critical to avoid collapse. Galvanised M 20 structural bolt assemblies and bolt material from a single batch have been tested under tension at a range of temperatures and strain-rates typical of those experienced in fire. Turned-down bolt test data produced stress-strain curves characteristic of different microstructures at ambient temperature, despite a tempered-martensitic microstructure being specified in the standards. The failure modes of bolt assemblies {{were found to be}} dependent on the as-received microstructure at ambient temperature. At elevated temperatures, however, only thread-stripping was observed...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 the Fender Custom Shop {{released}} a limited issue of 30 '72 Telecaster Custom relics. While they {{used some of}} the original '72 design features such as the three <b>bolt</b> <b>neck</b> and the classic look, these guitars had many more differences from the originals. The body is made of ash, and features a belly cut. The neck is one piece maple with a flatter 9.5 inch radius and larger 6105 frets. The head stock has the original design [...] "Custom" [...] logo. The neck pickup is a custom wound wide range humbucker. Alnico 2 magnets were used which more closely resemble {{the sound of the}} CuNiFe magets used the original Seth Lover pickup (I have only been able to verify this with a phone call to Fenders customer service). The bridge pickup is a [...] "hot nocaster". The overwound pickup has more output which better matches the output of the neck pickup. These guitars are distinguished from production reissues by a [...] "Custom Shop Limited Edition" [...] logo {{on the back of the}} head stock and also on the neck plate.|$|R
5000|$|The Penco brand was of {{relatively}} high quality. Their acoustics were all laminates (meaning {{they had a}} laminate top, back, & sides.) Penco made Martin and Gibson [...] style acoustic guitars. Reverse engineered and built to spec, Penco produced some of the closest replica's of the Martin D-28, D-41, D-45, and D-45 12 models in existence today. Penco also made <b>bolt</b> <b>neck</b> copies of Les Paul electrics, SG guitars and basses, Rickenbacker 4001 basses, Stratocaster/Telecaster copies; and the odd mandolin and banjo.They also made 12 string acoustic guitars. The Penco brand was also put on [...] "lawsuit" [...] Korina-finished Explorer styled guitars. These were identical to the Ibanez Destroyer and the Greco Destroyer of the same period. The Ibanez line was distributed on the West coast of the U.S., the Greco was exclusively for Japan, and Penco was distributed on the East coast of the U.S.There is bit of variance between the Penco acoustic models depending on what year the guitar was manufactured. A Penco A22M {{may or may not}} have an adjustable saddle via thumbscrews. Also some of the models have book matched backs while others maybe tri-backed.|$|R
