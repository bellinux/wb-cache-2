5|$|Sand went on {{to receive}} his Master of Arts (M.A.) in physics from Rice University. At Rice, Sands took {{graduate}} courses in relativity, statistical mechanics, and thermodynamics from Harold A. Wilson, {{who was the first}} chair of the Rice physics department. He also completed experimental studies of <b>ferromagnetism.</b> At Rice, Sands met his first wife, Elizabeth, an undergraduate student there.|$|E
5|$|ZnO {{has also}} been {{considered}} for spintronics applications: if doped with 1–10% of magnetic ions (Mn, Fe, Co, V, etc.), ZnO could become ferromagnetic, even at room temperature. Such room temperature <b>ferromagnetism</b> in ZnO:Mn has been observed, {{but it is not}} clear yet whether it originates from the matrix itself or from secondary oxide phases.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate <b>ferromagnetism,</b> concluding {{that it was a}} result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate <b>ferromagnetism,</b> concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and <b>ferromagnetism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for <b>ferromagnetism</b> {{illustrated}} the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ferromagnetism</b> only {{occurs in}} a few substances; the common ones are iron, nickel, cobalt, their alloys, and some alloys of rare-earth metals.|$|E
25|$|Ferroelectricity is a {{characteristic}} of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. The term is used in analogy to <b>ferromagnetism,</b> in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. <b>Ferromagnetism</b> was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek. Thus, the prefix ferro, meaning iron, was {{used to describe the}} property despite the fact that most ferroelectric materials do not contain iron.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} the model was the phenomenon of <b>ferromagnetism.</b> Iron is magnetic; once it is magnetized it stays magnetized {{for a long time}} compared to any atomic time.|$|E
25|$|In certain {{crystalline}} materials individual magnetic moments may be {{aligned with}} each other (magnetic moment has both magnitude and direction). This gives rise to <b>ferromagnetism,</b> antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism. These are properties of the crystal as a whole, of little bearing on chemical properties.|$|E
25|$|Exchange {{interactions}} can act over infinite chains in one dimension, {{planes in}} two dimensions or over a whole crystal in three dimensions. These {{are examples of}} long-range magnetic ordering. They give rise to <b>ferromagnetism,</b> antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism, depending on the nature and relative orientations of the individual spins.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Heisenberg was {{appointed}} ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of theoretical physics {{and head of}} the department of physics at the Universität Leipzig; he gave his inaugural lecture on 1 February 1928. In his first paper published from Leipzig, Heisenberg used the Pauli exclusion principle to solve the mystery of <b>ferromagnetism.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{material}} has metallic appearance {{and is an}} electrical conductor. Its resistivity is {{higher than that of}} iron, and decreases down to a minimum at 8 GPa. Above 13 GPa the resistivity increases with pressure. The material is ferromagnetic at the lowest pressure range, but the <b>ferromagnetism</b> begins to decrease at 20 GPa and disappears at 32 GPa t.|$|E
25|$|Compounds at {{temperatures}} below the Curie temperature exhibit long-range magnetic {{order in the}} form of <b>ferromagnetism.</b> Another critical temperature is the Néel temperature, below which antiferromagnetism occurs. The hexahydrate of nickel chloride, NiCl2·6H2O, has a Néel temperature of 8.3 K. The susceptibility is a maximum at this temperature. Below the Néel temperature the susceptibility decreases and the substance becomes antiferromagnetic.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>ferromagnetism,</b> ferrimagnets {{retain their}} {{magnetization}} {{in the absence}} of a field. However, like antiferromagnets, neighboring pairs of electron spins tend to point in opposite directions. These two properties are not contradictory, because in the optimal geometrical arrangement, there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction, than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, it {{was thought}} that {{magnetic}} fields are due to currents in matter, and Ampère postulated that permanent magnets are caused by permanent atomic currents. The motion of classical charged particles could not explain permanent currents though, as shown by Larmor. In order to have <b>ferromagnetism,</b> the atoms must have permanent magnetic moments which are not due to the motion of classical charges.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{sufficient}} energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in <b>ferromagnetism</b> (permanent magnets) or antiferromagnetism, respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic materials that are above their Curie temperature, and in antiferromagnets above their Néel temperature. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.|$|E
25|$|He {{also made}} {{important}} {{contributions to the}} theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the atomic nucleus, <b>ferromagnetism,</b> cosmic rays, and subatomic particles, and he was instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe, together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957. He was a principal scientist in the Nazi German nuclear weapon project during World War II. He travelled to occupied Copenhagen where he met and discussed the German project with Niels Bohr.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} crystal structures, {{notably the}} {{perovskite}} structure, which exhibit ferroelectric behavior. This is analogous to <b>ferromagnetism,</b> in that, {{in the absence of}} an electric field during production, the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a ferrous metal).|$|E
25|$|Heisenberg set Peierls a {{research}} project on <b>ferromagnetism.</b> It was known that this {{was caused by the}} spin of the electrons in the metal aligning; but the reason for this was unknown. Heisenberg suspected that it was caused by a quantum mechanical effect, caused by the Pauli exclusion principle. Peierls was unable to develop the theory, but work on Hall effect was more productive. The anomalous Hall effect could not be explained with the classical theory of metals, and Heisenberg sensed an opportunity to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could explain it. Peierls was able to do so, resulting in his first published paper.|$|E
25|$|Magnetochemistry is {{concerned}} with the magnetic properties of chemical compounds. Magnetic properties arise from the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons contained in a compound. Compounds are diamagnetic when they contain no unpaired electrons. Molecular compounds that contain one or more unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. The magnitude of the paramagnetism is expressed as an effective magnetic moment, μeff. For first-row transition metals the magnitude of μeff is, to a first approximation, a simple function of the number of unpaired electrons, the spin-only formula. In general, spin-orbit coupling causes μeff to deviate from the spin-only formula. For the heavier transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, spin-orbit coupling cannot be ignored. Exchange interaction can occur in clusters and infinite lattices, resulting in <b>ferromagnetism,</b> antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the relative orientations of the individual spins.|$|E
500|$|Many alloys contain zinc, {{including}} brass. Other metals {{long known}} to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium, and sodium. Although neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy [...] exhibits <b>ferromagnetism</b> below 35K.|$|E
500|$|Zinc, cadmium {{and mercury}} form a large range of alloys. Among the zinc {{containing}} ones, brass is an alloy of zinc and copper. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium. While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy [...] exhibits <b>ferromagnetism</b> below 35K. Cadmium {{is used in}} many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance. It {{is also found in}} some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal. Because it is a liquid, mercury dissolves other metals and the alloys that are formed are called amalgams. For example, such amalgams are known with gold, zinc, sodium, and many other metals. Because iron is an exception, iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum, tungsten and platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam reacts with air to give aluminium oxide, small amounts of mercury corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The Ising model ( [...] ; [...] ), {{named after}} the {{physicist}} Ernst Ising, is a mathematical model of <b>ferromagnetism</b> in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be {{in one of two}} states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice, allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. The model allows the identification of phase transitions, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition.|$|E
2500|$|Superconductivity is a {{phenomenon}} of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials, called superconductors, when [...] below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April8, 1911, in Leiden. Like <b>ferromagnetism</b> and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It {{is characterized by the}} Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>ferromagnetism</b> is {{responsible}} for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, all other materials are influenced to some extent by a magnetic field, by several other types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances such as aluminum and oxygen are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; [...] diamagnetic substances such as copper and carbon are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials such as chromium and spin glasses have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. [...] The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt, and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life these substances are often described as non-magnetic.|$|E
2500|$|Since a {{bar magnet}} gets its <b>ferromagnetism</b> from {{electrons}} distributed evenly throughout the bar, when a bar magnet is cut in half, {{each of the}} resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet. Even though a magnet {{is said to have}} a north pole and a south pole, these two poles cannot be separated from each other. A monopole—if such a thing exists—would be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object. It would act as an isolated north pole, not attached to a south pole, or vice versa. Monopoles would carry [...] "magnetic charge" [...] analogous to electric charge. Despite systematic searches since 1931, , they have never been observed, and could very well not exist.|$|E
2500|$|Pauli {{looked for}} an {{explanation}} for these numbers, which were at first only empirical. At {{the same time he}} was trying to explain experimental results of the Zeeman effect in atomic spectroscopy and in <b>ferromagnetism.</b> He found an essential clue in a 1924 paper by Edmund C. Stoner, which pointed out that, for a given value of the principal quantum number (n), the number of energy levels of a single electron in the alkali metal spectra in an external magnetic field, where all degenerate energy levels are separated, is equal to the number of electrons in the closed shell of the noble gases for the same value of n. This led Pauli to realize that the complicated numbers of electrons in closed shells can be reduced to the simple rule of one electron per state, if [...] the electron states are defined using four quantum numbers. For this purpose he introduced a new two-valued quantum number, identified by Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck as electron spin.|$|E
2500|$|I.e., {{not only}} [...] and [...] must be {{substituted}} by α and β, respectively [...] (the first entity means [...] "spin up", {{the second one}} [...] "spin down"), but also the sign + by the − sign, and finally ri by the discrete values si (=±½); thereby we have [...] and [...] The [...] "singlet state", i.e. the − sign, means: the spins are [...] antiparallel, i.e. for the solid we have [...] antiferromagnetism, and for two-atomic molecules one has diamagnetism. The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: {{the formation of a}} symmetric molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results [...] through the Pauli principle automatically in an antisymmetric spin state (i.e. with the − sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency [...] that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a symmetric spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called [...] "triplet functions"). Thus, now the spins would be parallel (<b>ferromagnetism</b> in a solid, paramagnetism in two-atomic gases).|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>ferromagnetism</b> in a materials system that also superconducts spurred {{a flurry of}} research and debate, because <b>ferromagnetism</b> and superconductivity almost never coexist together. <b>Ferromagnetism</b> requires electron spins to align, while superconductivity typically requires electron spins to anti-align.|$|E
50|$|Edmund Clifton Stoner FRS (2 October 1899 - 27 December 1968) was a British {{theoretical}} physicist.

50|$|Initially Dietl et al.. {{predicted}} theoretically that room-temperature <b>ferromagnetism</b> should {{exist in}} heavily p-type doped ZnO using modified Zener model for magnetism.
