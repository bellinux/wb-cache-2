5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, <b>digital</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E

40|$|What {{constitutes}} an affect cycle in <b>digital</b> <b>networks?</b> How is it enacted {{and what are}} the conse- quences for individuals, for digital data and for the society that comprises both? Further, {{what is the relationship between}} affect and emotion, and what is their relationship with <b>digital</b> <b>networks?</b> Is it possible for an affect cycle to be established between people and <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> between peo- ple via <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> and between <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> themselves? By examining recent affect theo- ry in combination with Simondon&# 039;s theories of technical evolution and other theories of interaction and knowledge, I will define the nature of affect as it emerges through the cycle of interaction be- tween people and <b>digital</b> <b>networks.</b> I trace these cycles through and between the overdetermined, underexamined sites of interaction across <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> in order to identify who and what are participating in the capture and escape of affect. I also show how this is facilitated and what is changed during, and as a result of, these affective interactions. Using a deep understanding of the technical workings of <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> combined with receptiveness to the affective potential of emotional agency in our digital world, I situate human affective practice in the uneasy environment of algorithmic <b>digital</b> corporate <b>networks...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{study of}} {{self-replicating}} and evolving computer programs offers a tantalizing {{glimpse into the}} evolution of interactions among organisms that do not share any ancestry with biochemical life of Earth. This comes with potential caveats in translating predictions of evolving <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> to biological ones because mechanistic details differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, these <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> contain the necessary components for ongoing coevolutionary dynamics in large webs of interacting organisms. In spite {{of the differences between}} biological and digital evolution, the study of evolving <b>digital</b> ecological <b>networks</b> can lead to a more predictive understanding of natural dynamics. Because the general operational processes (e.g., Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism) do not differ, studies utilizing <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> can uncover rules operating on and within ecological networks. Together with microbial experiments, they create opportunities for furthering the understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes among interacting species.|$|R
