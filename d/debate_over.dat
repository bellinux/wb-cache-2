5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the rise of America as a world power; he expects the <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the purpose they were intended to serve.

5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited the <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the county courthouse's location and, once again, the <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen {{as the model for}} the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E

40|$|<b>Debates</b> <b>over</b> the New Perspective on Paul show a {{great deal}} of {{similarity}} to Reformation-era <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> synergism. In fact, synergism {{has become one of the}} more common charges made against the New Perspective by its critics. After documenting the charge in these modern debates, this article explores the details of synergistic controversy surrounding the Reformation. Among other things, various wings of the Reformation appear to have understood, and reacted to, synergism in quite-different ways. The article then highlights some aspects of New Perspective debates that are reminiscent of earlier theological <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> synergism and suggests ways in which greater attention to some aspects of theological interpretation might help move this part of the New Perspective debate forward...|$|R
