40|$|Genetic factors {{determining}} the pathogenesis and course of ocular toxoplasmosis are poorly understood. In this study, we explored {{the development of}} experimental ocular pathogenesis in genetically dissimilar mice infected with either the RH strain, the PLK strain, or the immunodominant surface antigen 1 (SAG 1 [P 30]) -deficient mutant of the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. At 11 days postinfection, ocular infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{with all of the}} strains of parasites resulted in severe inflammatory lesions and high numbers of parasites in eye tissue; less severe ocular lesions at earlier histopathology and prolonged survival were observed in this mouse strain infected with <b>either</b> the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen 1 -deficient SAG 1 −/− strain or the less virulent PLK strain compared with RH infection. In contrast, both BALB/c and CBA/J mice had less severe lesions and low numbers of parasites in their eye tissue, and infection developed into the chronic stage in these mice. There were significantly higher serum levels of gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha in C 57 BL/ 6 mice than in BALB/c and CBA/J mice following ocular infection. These observations confirm earlier reports on systemic immunity to these parasites that the route of Toxoplasma infection markedly influences survival of mice. Our data indicate that genetic factors of the host as well as the parasite strain are critical in determining susceptibility to experimental ocular toxoplasmosis in murine models...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} mutational {{analysis of}} the regulatory DNA sequence elements that control expression of the hepatitis B virus <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen gene was performed in the human hepatoma cell lines HepG 2. 1 and Huh 7, using transient transfection assays. Seven regions (A to G) of the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter located within 200 nucleotides of the RNA initiation site have been identified which influence the level of transcription from this promoter. The three distal regions (A to C), located between - 188 and - 68, appear to possess a level of redundancy {{in their ability to}} influence the transcriptional activity from the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter. The simultaneous deletion of regions A, B, and C resulted in an approximately fourfold reduction in transcription from the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter. Region D, located between - 67 and - 49, is an essential element of the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter. The three proximal regions (E to G) are located within 45 nucleotides of the major transcription initiation site. Region E prevents the negative influence of region F and can compensate for the effect of mutation of region G on transcription from the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter. Region G can compensate for the effect of the loss of a functional region E sequence on the transcriptional activity of the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter only {{in the absence of a}} functional region F sequence. These results imply that the level of expression of the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen gene is controlled by the complex interplay between a minimum of six transcription factors which activate and one transcription factor which represses transcription from this gene...|$|R

40|$|The DNA-binding {{proteins}} which {{recognize the}} regulatory sequence {{elements of the}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter were examined by gel retardation analysis, using nuclear extracts from the human hepatoma cell line Huh 7. Using this assay, we identified four regions (B, D, E, and F) of the promoter that interact with the same or similar transcription factor(s). In addition, the recognition sequence for the Sp 1 transcription factor bound the same or similar transcription factor(s) present in Huh 7 cell nuclear extracts, and this binding was inhibited by the four <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter elements, B, D, E, and F. Purified Sp 1 transcription factor was shown to bind to three (B, D, and F) of the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter regulatory sequence elements by DNase I footprinting. Using transient transfection assays with Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells, we found that transcription from the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter was transactivated by exogenously expressed Sp 1, whereas transcription from the other three HBV promoters was not. Deletion analysis of the <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter demonstrated that the promoter region between - 35 and + 157 was sufficient to confer Sp 1 responsiveness. This promoter region includes one of the regulatory elements footprinted by the purified Sp 1 transcription factor. The function of the B, D, E, and F promoter elements was further examined by using these binding sites cloned into a minimal promoter element. Each of these regulatory regions transactivated transcription from the minimal promoter element in response to exogenously expressed Sp 1. This finding demonstrates that the HBV <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> antigen promoter contains four functional Sp 1 binding sites which probably contribute {{to the level of}} expression from this promoter during viral infection...|$|R

40|$|The dynamics, attitude, {{and shape}} {{control of a}} large thin {{flexible}} square platform in orbit are studied. Attitude and shape control are assumed to result from actuators placed perpendicular to the main surface and one edge and their effect on the rigid body and elastic modes is modelled to first order. The equations of motion are linearized about three different nominal orientations: (1) the platform following the local vertical with its <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> perpendicular to the orbital plane; (2) the platform following the local horizontal with its <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> normal to the local vertical; and (3) the platform following the local vertical with its <b>major</b> <b>surface</b> perpendicular to the orbit normal.
