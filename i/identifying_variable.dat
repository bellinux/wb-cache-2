3000|$|..., I {{use for it}} a {{variable}} that measures the difference between respondent’s spouse occupation prestige score and the occupation prestige score of respondent’s mother (Diffspousemother). For example, according to a 1989 GSS study of occupational prestige classification (Davis et al. 1991), physicians gain the maximum prestige score while miscellanous food preparation occupations rank the lowest (See Appendix: Table 11). Predicting income with occupation prestige scores is a working approach, as demonstrated by several studies (e.g, Ermisch et al. 2006; Feigenbaum 2014; and Mazumder and Acosta 2015). Occupation prestige scores here would also be proxies for income, so their difference would proxy intergenerational income change. Correlations {{of the components of}} Diffspousemother with income mobility provide preliminary statistical justification for using Diffspousemother as a key <b>identifying</b> <b>variable</b> (See Appendix: Table 10). In what follows, I discuss how Diffspousemother would satisfy the exclusion restrictions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The case-based {{reasoning}} approach to email response consists of reusing past messages to synthesize new responses to incoming requests. This task presents various challenges {{due to the}} nature of the messages: Textual descriptions, multiple topics, heterogeneous content, variable text length and varying recurrence of the statements. In this paper, we address the problem of determining which portions of past cases are reusable. Our scheme consists of identifying parts of a past message and declaring them variable, optional or reusable. This formulation of case reuse corresponds, from an application point of view, to the dynamic creation of a response template from antecedent messages. We describe and compare two strategies for selecting the messages portions to be reused: Case grouping and condensation models. Our results indicate that the case grouping strategy is a better choice. We also describe some of our experiments for <b>identifying</b> <b>variable</b> parts, based on named entity extraction techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{ordering}} of variables {{can have a}} significant effect on the size of the reduced binary decision diagram (BDD) that represents the set of solutions to a combinatorial optimization problem. It also influences the quality of the objective function bound provided by a limited-width relaxation of the BDD. We investigate these effects for the maximum independent set problem. By <b>identifying</b> <b>variable</b> orderings for the BDD, we show that the width of an exact BDD can be given a theoretical upper bound for certain classes of graphs. In addition, we draw an interesting connection between the Fibonacci numbers and the width of exact BDDs for general graphs. We propose variable ordering heuristics inspired by these results, as well as a k-layer look-ahead heuristic applicable to any problem domain. We find experimentally that orderings that result in smaller exact BDDs have a strong tendency to produce tighter bounds in relaxation BDDs. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{in this paper}} {{the size of a}} Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF) that respects a given vtree (known as structured DNNF). This representation of propositional knowledge bases was introduced recently and shown to include OBDD as a special case (an OBDD variable ordering is a special type of vtree). We provide a lower bound on the size of any structured DNNF and discuss three particular instances of this bound, which correspond to three distinct subsets of structured DNNF (including OBDD). We show that our lower bound subsumes the influential Sieling and Wegener’s lower bound for OBDDs, which is typically used for <b>identifying</b> <b>variable</b> orderings that will cause a blowup in the OBDD size. We show that our lower bound allows for similar usage but with respect to vtrees, which provide structure for DNNFs {{in the same way that}} variable orderings provide structure for OBDDs.

40|$|Abstract Background Cohort {{studies can}} provide {{valuable}} evidence {{of cause and}} effect relationships but are subject to loss of participants over time, limiting the validity of findings. Computerised record linkage offers a passive and ongoing method of obtaining health outcomes from existing routinely collected data sources. However, the quality of record linkage is reliant upon the availability and accuracy of common <b>identifying</b> <b>variables.</b> We sought to develop and validate a method for linking a cohort study to a state-wide hospital admissions dataset with limited availability of unique <b>identifying</b> <b>variables.</b> Methods A sample of 2000 participants from a cohort study (n = 41 514) was linked to a state-wide hospitalisations dataset in Victoria, Australia using the national health insurance (Medicare) number and demographic data as <b>identifying</b> <b>variables.</b> Availability of the health insurance number was limited in both datasets; therefore linkage was undertaken both with and without use of this number and agreement tested between both algorithms. Sensitivity was calculated for a sub-sample of 101 participants with a hospital admission confirmed by medical record review. Results Of the 2000 study participants, 85 % were found to have a record in the hospitalisations dataset when the national health insurance number and sex were used as linkage variables and 92 % when demographic details only were used. When agreement between the two methods was tested the disagreement fraction was 9 %, mainly due to "false positive" links when demographic details only were used. A final algorithm that used multiple combinations of <b>identifying</b> <b>variables</b> resulted in a match proportion of 87 %. Sensitivity of this final linkage was 95 %. Conclusions High quality record linkage of cohort data with a hospitalisations dataset that has limited identifiers can be achieved using combinations of a national health insurance number and demographic data as <b>identifying</b> <b>variables.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{prior studies}} have found that large {{auditors}} charge significantly higher fees for statutory audit services, potentially resulting from higher audit quality and/or a lack of competition in the audit market. However, recent research using a Heckman two‐step procedure attributes the large auditor premium to auditor selection bias. In this paper we examine the limitations of the Heckman model and estimate the large auditor (Big Four) premium using decomposition and matching methods on a large sample of UK private companies. Our analysis suggests that Heckman two‐step estimates are highly sensitive to changes in sample and model specification, particularly the presence of a valid <b>identifying</b> <b>variable.</b> In contrast, the propensity score and portfolio matching methods we employ point to a persistent large auditor premium, consistent with the majority of previous studies. Conclusions of the premium vanishing when selection bias is controlled for therefore appear premature. Since the Heckman model is increasingly used in auditing and other areas of accounting research, our discussion and findings are likely to be of more general interest...|$|E
40|$|Background: High-throughput {{sequencing}} is a {{cost effective}} method for identifying genetic variation, {{and it is}} currently in use {{on a large scale}} across the field of biology, including ecology and population genetics. Correctly <b>identifying</b> <b>variable</b> sites and allele frequencies from sequencing data remains challenging, in large part due to artifacts and biases inherent in the sequencing process. Selecting variants that are diagnostic is commonly done using diversity statistics like FST, but these measures are not ideal for the task. Results: Here, we develop a method that directly calculates the expected amount of information gained from observing each variant site. We then develop and implement a conservative estimator that takes into account uncertainity introduced by sampling bias and sequencing error. This estimator is applied to simulated and real sequencing data, and we discuss how it performs compared to the commonly used existing methods for identifying diagnostic polymorphisms. Conclusion: The expected information content gives an easy to interpret measure for the usefulness of variant sites. The results show that we achieve a clear separation between true variants and noise, allowing us to select candidate sites {{with a high degree of}} confidence...|$|E

The effectiveness of the methods was compared in their capacity to differentiate levels of resistance/susceptibility to Verticillium wilt in olive germplasm. Genetically homogeneous clones of the olive cvs Frantoio, Coratina and Leccino, which have different degrees of resistance/susceptibility to wilt, were inoculated with one defoliating and two nondefoliating V. dahliae pathotypes. Results indicate that the three screening methods had different sensitivity in <b>identifying</b> <b>variable</b> levels of olive resistance to Verticillium wilt. Inoculation of washed roots (WRI) was the most drastic and {{may be used to}} identify higher levels of resistance (such as that of cv.

Inoculation of root balls with soil (RBI) was less destructive and allowed detection of lower resistance expression (such as that of cv. Coratina), not detected by WRI.

40|$|Abstract In Cameroon, around 18 {{percent of}} {{children}} aged between 10 - 14 years old grow up within a sibship extended to host one (or more) foster-child. This proportion is similar in other African countries and in particular West African ones. This paper aims at estimating the effect of foster-children supply on biological children education demand of host parents in Cameroon. To address the endogeneity of foster-children supply, we estimate both decisions within a recursive bivariate probit framework and use, as our <b>identifying</b> <b>variable,</b> the father’s birth order among his brothers. Indeed, in patrilineal societies as in Cameroon, kinship rules involve children to be hosted by brothers of the male kin group, and more likely by the eldest. Using data from the demographic and health survey of Cameroon (2004), a dataset uniquely suitable for our purpose since information on the father’s birth order are available, we find that children hosting school-age foster-relatives have a significant lower probability to attain their basic level of education relative {{to those who do}} not. This suggests that households hosting school-age foster-relatives due to kinship rules suffer from liquidity constraints preventing them from educating further their biological children. Through this result, we highlight the importance of the motive underlying child fostering to determine its spillover effects...|$|E
