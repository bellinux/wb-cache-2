5000|$|M42: M42 is a molybdenum-series <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>alloy</b> with an {{additional}} 8% or 10% cobalt. It is widely used in metal manufacturing industries because of its superior red-hardness as compared to more conventional high-speed steels, allowing for shorter cycle times in production environments due to higher cutting speeds or from the increase in time between tool changes. M42 is also less prone to chipping when used for interrupted cuts and costs less {{when compared to the}} same tool made of carbide. Tools made from cobalt-bearing high speed steels can often be identified by the letters HSS-Co.|$|R

The average weight losses of the specimens were measured using digital weighing balance. The {{results showed that the}} weight losses of both cast iron and low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> in both media increases with time. Corrosion rate {{of cast iron}} in cocoa liquor in-creases rapidly with time for up to 336 hours (1000 µm/yr), but in well water the rapid rate of corrosion only lasted up to 187 hours (1160 µm/yr) thereafter it continuously dropping until 264 hours (667 µm/yr) after which it remains con-stant. Low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> corroded faster in cocoa liquor up to 264 hours (200 µm/yr), whereas the initial rapid corrosion rate only lasted up to 168 hours (180 µm/yr) in well water environment.

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} processes, {{surfaces and}} their properties {{are as important}} as the bulk properties of the materials. Surface treatment is an important aspect of all manufacturing processes. It has been used to impart certain physical and mechanical properties, such as appearance, corrosion, friction, wear and fatigue resistance. Widely used methods of finishing treatment that create necessary parts with the given roughness usually do not provide optimum quality of the surface. Therefore, methods of surface plastic deformation (SPD) are used. One of the most effective representative is the diamond pressing. In this paper the effect of diamond pressing process with a different pressing force (50, 100, 150, 200, 250) N on the state of heat-treated <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces was studied and the results of the experiments are presented. Enhancements on the micro hardness of the heat treated <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces that have been processed by diamond pressing up to the following percentages compared to the ground surfaces: 32, 28, 31 and 43 % for D 2, O 1, H 13 and 3115 hardened <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces, respectively. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} there is an enhancement on the surface quality of heat-treated <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces. The best enhancement of the average surface roughness (Ra) was 16. 6, 45, 36 and 50 % for D 2, O 1, H 13 and 3115, respectively, which are heat-treated.
