50|$|The time {{alignment}} of an amplified music signal and its <b>distortion</b> <b>components</b> has {{a profound effect}} on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the <b>distortion</b> <b>components</b> are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open-loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier <b>distortion</b> <b>components.</b> The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs.|$|R
30|$|The DATK {{also has}} a tool for {{estimating}} the effect of signal aliasing in digital distorting devices. Nonlinear distortion always expands the signal spectrum by creating harmonic (and other) <b>distortion</b> <b>components.</b> This is problematic in a digital implementation, since the <b>distortion</b> <b>components</b> exceeding the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate) will alias back to the baseband, possibly resulting in an inharmonic and noisy signal. There are several techniques for avoiding aliasing within digital distortion [1], oversampling being probably the most popular.|$|R
30|$|The {{advantage}} of this measurement technique over the sine analysis (Section 2.2) is that it displays more information in a single figure by drawing the magnitude responses {{as a function of}} the (fundamental) frequency on the full audio frequency range. For analyzing the magnitude of high-order <b>distortion</b> <b>components,</b> however, the sine analysis is usually better since it displays the entire audible spectrum in one figure, while the logsweep analysis can successfully be used to track only the low-order <b>distortion</b> <b>components,</b> due to clarity reasons and the aforementioned SNR issue. Another drawback of the logsweep analysis technique is that long excitation signals can take a long time to analyze due to the relatively slow computation of long convolutions.|$|R

3000|$|Traditionally, the IMD of {{distorting}} {{systems has}} been measured by feeding a sum of two sinusoids with different frequencies {{into the system}} and plotting the resulting spectrum. Although this type of analysis gives an exact indication of the frequencies and amplitudes of the <b>distortion</b> <b>components</b> for a given pair of input signal frequencies and amplitudes, it is not very useful in determining the overall level of the IMD. It {{should be noted that}} with distorting audio effects, it is often useful to know the exact frequency and amplitude behavior of the harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>components,</b> since there are some strong opinions regarding the harmonic content and the resulting sound, such as [...] "the vacuum tube sound consists mainly of even harmonics", or that [...] "the 7 th harmonic is something to be avoided". With IMD, however, it is probably more useful to have a single number indicating the overall amount of distortion, since IMD is generally considered an undesired phenomenon, with no specific preferences on any particular IMD components. Furthermore, traditional IMD measurements ignore the dynamic behavior of the intermodulation mechanism, so that dynamic or transient intermodulation (DIM/TIM) [4] <b>distortion</b> <b>components</b> are left unnoticed.|$|R

50|$|Loudspeakers {{differ from}} most other items of audio {{equipment}} in suffering from 'colouration'. This {{refers to the}} tendency of {{various parts of the}} speaker: the cone, its surround, the cabinet, the enclosed space, to carry on moving when the signal ceases. All forms of resonance cause this, by storing energy, and resonances with high Q factor are especially audible. Much of the work that has gone into improving speakers {{in recent years has been}} about reducing colouration, and Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, measuring equipment was introduced in order to measure the delayed output from speakers and display it as a time vs. frequency waterfall plot or spectrogram plot. Initially analysis was performed using impulse response testing, but this 'spike' suffers from having very low energy content if the stimulus is to remain within the peak ability of the speaker. Later equipment uses correlation on other stimulus such as a Maximum length sequence analyser or MLSSA. Using multiple sine wave tones as a stimulus signal and analyzing the resultant output, Spectral Contamination testing provides a measure of a loudspeakers 'self-noise' <b>distortion</b> <b>component.</b> This 'picket fence' type of signal can be optimized for any frequency range, and the results correlate exceptionally well with sound quality listening tests.|$|E

30|$|The logsweep {{analysis}} {{technique is}} an ingenious device for analyzing static harmonic distortion {{as a function}} of frequency. Introduced by Farina in 2000 [2], the basic idea behind the logsweep analysis technique is to insert a logarithmic sine sweep signal with fixed amplitude to the system, and then convolve the time-reversed and amplitude weighted excitation signal with the system response. As a result, one obtains an impulse response signal, where the response of each harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>component</b> is separated in time from the linear response and each other. If the duration of the logsweep signal is long enough, the time separation between the harmonic impulse responses is clear and it is straightforward to cut the individual harmonic responses and represent them in the frequency domain. As a result, one obtains magnitude response plots for the linear response and each harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{well known}} decision-directed (DD) {{approach}} drastically limits {{the level of}} musical noise, but the estimated a priori SNR matches the previous frame rather than the current one. Plapous introduced a novel method called two-step noise reduction (TSNR) technique to refine the a priori SNR estimation of the DD approach. However, the performance of this method depends on the accurateness of the estimated speech in its second step. In this paper, we propose an improved approach for the a priori SNR estimation in DCT domain with two steps like the TSNR method. While in the second step, considering the two state components of the estimation error between speech signal and its estimation, the speech <b>distortion</b> <b>component</b> and residual noise component, we make the estimated speech subtracted by its speech distortion as a refined estimation for the clean speech signal.

Therefore, we conducted a field experiment on parameter selection of the ordinary image distortion model widely used for camera calibration. We adopted a calibration method using a set of calibration points distributed on the 2 -D plane with no ground survey. Four non-metric digital cameras were calibrated in the filed experiment. 16 rounds of camera calibration for six different parameter sets of the image distortion model were conducted.

DESIGN: Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were measured in the exposed workers and in a control group. Separation between the distortion and reflection otoacoustic components was performed by time-frequency-domain filtering. The urinary concentration of the DNA and RNA oxidation products, namely 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydroguanine (oxoGua), 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (oxodGuo), and 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydroguanosine (oxoGuo), were evaluated.

These display components present a cascaded energy attenuator to the battery of handheld device {{which is responsible for}} about half of energy drain at maximum display intensity. As such, the display components become the main focus of every effort for maximization of embedded system’s battery life-time. This paper proposes an approach for pixel transformation of the displayed image to increase the potential energy saving of the backlight scaling method. The proposed approach takes advantage of human visual system (HVS) characteristics and tries to minimize distortion between the perceived brightness values of the individual pixels in the original image and those of the backlight-scaled image. This is in contrast to previous backlight scaling approaches which simply match the luminance values of the individual pixels in the original and backlight-scaled images. Furthermore, this paper proposes a temporally-aware backlight scaling technique for video streams.
