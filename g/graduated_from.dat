30|$|Our {{analyses}} of the labour market position of <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> narrow education programmes {{compared to that of}} <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> broad programmes show that the former have a less favourable labour market position. <b>Graduates</b> <b>from</b> narrow education programmes have a higher chance of unemployment and face more difficulties finding a job in their programme’s occupational domain and at its level. They consequently have to resort more often to jobs outside their occupational domain and below their level. Once they find a job, they earn less than <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> broad education programmes, particularly when the job is outside the domain of the education programme completed and below its level. Not surprisingly, <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> narrow education programmes indicate that they have fewer career opportunities than <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> broad programmes. On the other hand, they are not less satisfied with their job, unless this job is outside the programme’s domain and below its level, which is unfortunately the case for many graduates of narrow programmes.|$|R

30|$|Gross hourly wages {{turn out}} to be {{significantly}} lower for <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> narrow education programmes than for <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> broad programmes. In this case, the chances of finding a job within the programme’s occupational domain and at the appropriate level appear to play a role. These chances have a significantly positive effect on wage levels. We find, however, that <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> narrow education programmes have lower chances of finding a job in the programme’s domain and consequently at the programme’s level. Both aspects therefore {{have a negative effect on}} the hourly wage level of <b>graduates</b> <b>from</b> narrow education programmes.|$|R
