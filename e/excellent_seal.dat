Consistent with the methodology outlined in this report, the author performed the second phase of this experimental program {{to determine the effects of}} simulant Hanford tank mixed wastes on packaging seal materials. That effort involved the comprehensive testing of five plastic liner materials in an aqueous mixed-waste simulant. The testing protocol involved exposing the materials to {approximately} 143, 286, 571, and 3, 670 krad of gamma radiation and was followed by 7 -, 14 -, 28 -, 180 -day exposures to the waste simulant at 18, 50, and 60 C. Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber samples subjected to the same protocol were then evaluated by measuring seven material properties: specific gravity, dimensional changes, mass changes, hardness, compression set, vapor transport rates, and tensile properties. The author has determined that EPDM rubber has excellent resistance to radiation, this simulant, and a combination of these factors. These results suggest that EPDM is an <b>excellent</b> <b>seal</b> material to withstand aqueous mixed wastes having similar composition to the one used in this study...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} bioactive materials {{suitable as}} dentine substitutes in tooth repair have been studied: glass-ionomer cement, particulate bioglass, and calcium-silicate cement. On 15 permanent human molars, Class V cavities were prepared {{and the bottom}} of each cavity was de-mineralized by an artificial caries gel. After the de-mineralization, the teeth were restored with: (1) Bioglass (R) 45 S 5 and ChemFil (R) Superior; (2) Biodentine (TM) and ChemFil (R) Superior; and (3) ChemFil (R) Superior for a complete repair. The teeth were stored for 6 weeks in artificial saliva, then cut in half along the longitudinal axis: the first half was imaged in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the other half was embedded in resin and analyzed by SEM using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The glass-ionomer and the bioglass underwent ion exchange with the surrounding tooth tissue, confirming their bioactivity. However, the particle size of the bioglass meant that cavity adaptation was poor. It is concluded that smaller particle size bioglasses may give more acceptable results. In contrast, both the glass-ionomer and the calcium-silicate cements performed well as dentine substitutes. The glass-ionomer showed ion exchange properties, whereas the calcium silicate gave an <b>excellent</b> <b>seal</b> resulting from its micromechanical attachment...|$|E

In contrast to the BBB, which is composed of a myriad of capillaries, the rpe can in principle be prepared as an intact planar tissue sheet without disruption of its barrier and carrier functions. Both a rapid and gentle procedure to isolate porcine rpe and a method to implement the harvested rpe in drug penetration testing are presented. Enucleated eyes were flat-mounted and the RPE/choroid tissue sheets {{with or without the}} retina were isolated. Fluorescence microscopy based on double-labeling with propidium iodide/calcein and scanning electron microscopy revealed well-preserved cell and tissue architecture. For drug evaluation, specimens were immobilized as the interface between test compartments in a dual-chamber device. Ten different test agents were added to one chamber at defined concentrations. After an incubation time of 30 min at 37 jC permeated drug levels in both compartments were quantified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry or HPLC with fluorescence detection. Sodium fluorescein used as a barrier marker indicated that the rpe model had <b>excellent</b> <b>seal</b> integrity.

40|$|Assessing the {{suitability}} of a sedimentary basin for CO 2 sequestration requires detailed geological and geophysical studies. An example is presented from the Mesozoic succession of the Petrel Sub-basin. Two stratigraphic intervals were investigated as potential Environmentally Sustainable Sites for CO 2 Injection (ESSCI) : the Plover ESSCI (Plover and Elang formations, sealed by the Frigate Formation) and the Sandpiper ESSCI (Sandpiper Sandstone, sealed by the Bathurst Island Group). The Plover ESSCI reservoirs are laterally extensive, fluvial to deltaic sand bodies {{that are likely to}} have an excellent degree of interconnectivity. The Sandpiper ESSCI reservoirs are predominantly shoreface sand bodies, in which the interconnectivity depends on the degree of shoreface attachment, but is thought to be moderate to excellent. Reservoir quality, as indicated by detailed petrology, is considered to be good. The Bathurst Island Group regional seal has good to <b>excellent</b> <b>seal</b> potential, with the capability to withhold an average CO 2 column height of 400 m. A geomechanical assessment indicates that the orientation of W-WNW, NNW-NNE and NE- trending faults near the basin margin would permit their reactivation within the inferred stress regime. However, most of these faults occur outside the potential CO 2 containment area. The potential CO 2 storage capacity is vast, in the order of several thousand Megatonnes (100 s of TCF) of CO 2.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Since their {{introduction}} in 1970, glass ionomer cements {{have been}} used {{in a wide variety of}} clinical situations in dentistry. The main advantages of glass ionomer cements are chemical bonding, fluoride release and uptake, <b>excellent</b> <b>seal</b> against microleakage, and biocompatibility. The main objective of this study was to compare the microleakage of two new paste-paste glass ionomer systems to their traditional RMGIC counterparts when conditioning the dentin with newly developed no-rinse conditioners or polyacrylic acid. Materials and methods: Standardized cavity preparations were made, centered on the cementoenamel junction of the buccal surface, on 96 extracted human molars divided in 8 groups (n = 12). G 1 Ketac Nano with Ketac Nano Primer, G 2 Ketac Nano with Ketac Conditioner, G 3 Photac Fil with Ketac Nano Primer, G 4 Photac Fil with Ketac Cavity Conditioner, G 5 Fuji Filling LC with GC Self Conditioner, G 6 Fuji Filling LC with GC Cavity Conditioner, G 7 Fuji II LC with GC Self Conditioner, G 8 Fuji II LC with GC Cavity Conditioner. The cavities were treated with either a no-rinse or polyacrylic acid conditioner and restored with a paste-paste RMGIC or traditional RMGIC from the same manufacturer (n = 12). The teeth were then sealed to within 2 mm of the restoration margins and thermocycled. The teeth were immersed in 2. 0 -percent methylene blue and stored at room temperature for 24 hours. Then, the teeth were be embedded in resin and sectioned longitudinally in a buccolingual direction making 1 section (1 mm thick) per tooth. The occlusal and gingival restoration margins of each specimen were examined with a stereomicroscope at X 10 magnification to determine the degree of microleakage. Results: Mixed-model ANOVA was used to test the fixed effect of the eight groups and cervical vs. occlusal location within each tooth sample on microleakage, with sample as the random effect. Both main effects and the interaction are significant, p < 0001 for both group and location effects, and p = 0. 0013 for the interaction of group and location. The cervical interface showed more microleakage in all groups except group 8 where microleakage was the same as at the occlusal margin. No significant difference was observed among groups for microleakage at the occlusal interface. There was significant difference among groups at the cervical interface with Fuji II LC using GC Cavity Conditioner performing best. For the occlusal interface Group 4 performed the best and Group 2 performed the worst, although the difference was not significant among the groups. For the cervical interface, Group 8 performed the best followed by Group 3, Group 4 and Group 6, although these four groups were not significantly different. For the cervical interface, group 2 performed the worst followed by group 1. Based on these results we can conclude that, overall, traditional RMGIC with polyacrylic acid conditioning performed better than the new paste-paste RMGIC systems utilizing the no-rinse conditioners...|$|E
40|$|Release of {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions to the atmosphere is a concern for global warming. Thus, practical and economic solutions are being sought to combat this problem. One possible methodology for reducing emissions is the geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO₂). The subsurface behaviour of CO₂is influenced by many variables; therefore, accurate appraisal of a potential CO₂storage site requires detailed site characterisation. In particular, potential sites need to be evaluated geologically {{in terms of their}} injectivity, containment and capacity. Detailed site characterisation was undertaken for two possible sites for geological storage of CO₂, located offshore northwest Australia in the Petrel and Barrow sub-basins. The injection targets in the Petrel Sub-basin are the Jurassic Plover and Elang formations, locally sealed by the Frigate Formation, and the overlying Cretaceous Sandpiper Sandstone, regionally sealed by the Bathurst Island Group. The Plover/Elang formations are laterally extensive, fluvio–deltaic sandstones of fair to good reservoir quality, with likely excellent lateral and vertical connectivity. The Frigate Formation may not be an effective seal up-dip, but the overlying secondary reservoir (Sandpiper Sandstone) and thick regional seal (Bathurst Island Group) will ensure continued CO₂containment. The Jurassic–Cretaceous post-rift sediments are structurally simple and dip gently up towards the basin margins with no defined structural closures. Therefore, hydrodynamic, residual and solubility trapping beneath the regional seal will be the dominant storage mechanisms. The potential storage capacity is vast (> 10, 000 Mt), highlighting why deep saline formations may provide a realistic solution to large-scale {{greenhouse gas emissions}} reduction. In the Barrow Sub-basin, the Cretaceous Flag Sandstone is the injection target, sealed by the Muderong Shale. The reservoir units are laterally extensive, amalgamated, basin floor fan sandstones with excellent reservoir quality. Hemipelagic shale drapes may locally restrict the vertical connectivity. The Muderong Shale has <b>excellent</b> <b>seal</b> capacity, with the potential to withhold a CO₂ column height of 565 – 790 m. The structural geometry is a large anticline and the trapping mechanisms are likely to a combination of stratigraphic, residual and solubility trapping along the axis of the anticline, as well as structural trapping within the anticlinal closure. A few large faults exist which could potentially be reactivated if injection pressures are not appropriately managed. The hydrodynamic flow has been altered by production induced pressure decline; however, the impact on the CO₂ migration pathway is likely to be insignificant due to the stronger buoyancy drive. The detailed geological characterisation process identified that both sites are suitable candidates for geological storage of CO₂. Geological storage of CO₂is technically feasible in a variety of different geological settings, as demonstrated by studies like these and CO₂storage projects already in operation. Key to the success of a CO₂storage project is an understanding of the stratigraphic architecture and reservoir heterogeneity. This will allow an optimal injection strategy to be devised to utilise the inherent geological characteristics of the site and maximise the benefits of injectivity, capacity and containment for efficient geological storage of CO₂.

30|$|During {{hydraulic}} fracturing operations of low-permeability reservoirs, packers {{are the key}} component to ensure the success of multistage fracturing. Packers enable sections of the wellbore to be sealed off and separately fractured by hydraulic pressure, one at a time, while {{the remainder of the}} wellbore is not affected. However, reliable sealing properties of the packer rubber are required to meet the high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions of reservoirs (such as 70  MPa and 170  °C). In this study, the structures of the packer rubber with two different materials are optimized numerically by ABAQUS and validated by experiments. The optimization process starts from the packer rubber with a conventional structure, and then, the weakest spots are identified by ABAQUS and improved by slightly varying its structure. This process is iterative, and the final optimized structure of a single rubber barrel with expanding back-up rings is achieved. For the structure of three rubber barrels with metallic protective covers, both HNBR and AFLAS fail under HPHT conditions. For the final optimized structure, the packer rubber made of AFLAS can work better under HPHT than that made of HNBR which ruptures after setting. The results show that the optimized structure of a single rubber barrel with expanding back-up rings and the material AFLAS are a good combination for the packer rubber playing an <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> performance in multistage fracturing in horizontal wells.|$|R

Seal geometry, capacity {{and integrity of}} the Demons Bluff Formation has been investigated to evaluate CO 2 containment in the basin. The study revealed good to <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> capacity for the Demons Bluff Formation and for the intraformational seals within the Eastern View Group (EVG).

Five wells encountered hydrocarbons with cumulative flow rates testing 90 mm cfg/d. The apparent discontinuity in reservoir extent resulted in project abandonment. Highly mature, organic source rocks {{in this area}} were not identified. A recent organic reinterpretation of gas condensates from the Hudson Canyon suggests a deeper Lower Jurassic source, analogous {{to that of the}} U. S. Gulf Coast’s Smackover formation, Late Jurassic in age. Reprocessed seismic data (AVO Analysis) indicates reflectors typical of widespread salt layers deposited during the Early Jurassic (60 m thick and 25 km wide) suggesting arid and restricted (anoxic) depositional climatic conditions in the Early Jurassic. Impermeable evaporites and shales, between the Lower and Upper Jurassic, may provide <b>excellent</b> <b>seals</b> explaining the lack of significant migration of hydrocarbons into porous rocks of the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous. The Gulf Coast Smackover may be an excellent analog for this area. A Baltimore Canyon Isopach map of the Triassic-Jurassic suggests that a significant area of Lower Jurassic age rocks is buried to depths of mature hydrocarbon generation (gas). Reservoirs should be in carbonates and shelf clastics.

30|$|The low {{quasi-static}} {{strength of}} less than 1  MPa has to be considered and large bonding areas should be used. The impact tests on a compact specimen design to be mounted directly in a small Charpy test machine showed the well-known ability of elastic PUR adhesives for withstanding much higher impact loads than quasi-static loads. An approach on a similar specific energy application for a larger real mass bonded on a large area of {{the walls of a}} monopole, and a small specimen with low mass and small adhesive bond area was calculated. A repetitive application of only 39 blows with a specific configuration was performed and a small number of specimens achieved the target, others failed in different ways due to the not fully optimized method. In fact, not all specimens survived the full test period and showed that larger masses should be bonded on as much bonding area as possible and users of this technology should follow the joint design recommendations of best practices given in the literature. That leads in particular to the recommendation for bonding large structures (cable duct length of up to 50  m) in separated smaller sections instead. This approach mainly avoids interfering vibrations with large mass and amplitudes. Finally, the elastic adhesive showed also an <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> function, which made the use of extra sealing material on the sensor housings obsolete.

40|$|AbstractTo {{ensure the}} {{long-term}} safety of geological CO 2 storage sites, such as saline aquifers or depleted gas- and oilfields, the overburden {{must be able}} to effectively retain in place the CO 2 (either gaseous, supercritical or in dissolved state). In this study the caprock sealing efficiency and potential petrophysical and mineralogical changes of caprock integrity due to CO 2 exposure are being investigated. Analysis techniques include XRD for mineralogy and N 2 -BET for specific surface determination, but also high-pressure CO 2 sorption and fluid flow experiments to study the sorption (retardation) and transport/capillary sealing characteristics of argillaceous caprocks. As this study is of generic nature, argillaceous samples and one marl-/limestone have been selected from different locations, covering the scope from poorly consolidated clays to highly compacted shale/siltstones. The first results indicate that, except for the very heterogeneous marl-/limestone (water permeability values of approximately (10 − 18  m 2), all samples have very good to <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> properties. Absolute water permeability values are in the nDarcy (10 − 9 Darcy) to sub-nDarcy range (kabs(water) ≤ 10 − 21  m 2) and the capillary breakthrough experiments indicate that the clay-rich samples can retain the supercritical CO 2 phase up to capillary pressures of at least 10 MPa. Even though samples are acting as effective capillary seals up to 10 MPa, a very small CO 2 flux could be detected, which is interpreted to be due to CO 2 diffusion through the rock sample. Sorption measurements indicate the maximum CO 2 sorption capacity to vary between 0. 25 and 0. 63 mmol/g. This is significant and therefore sorption in thick argillaceous caprock layers may provide an important sink for CO 2 leaking from underlying storage reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe South China, {{especially}} Guangdong Province, as {{the most}} developed area of China emitted large CO 2 from energy consumption and industrial production, actively advocates low-carbon development strategies. As an effective option to reduce CO 2 emissions, CCS is potentially an effective option to reduce CO 2 emissions to low-carbon economy development of South China, especially to Guangdong province. The CO 2 storage potential in sedimentary basins onshore South China is limited as previous indicated. So the potential of sub-seafloor CO 2 storage in offshore basins would be important. According to the assessment in this paper, large sedimentary basins offshore in the northern SCS have huge CO 2 storage potential. Miocene deltaic, coastal plain, and neritic clastic rocks in these basins contain high-porosity and high-permeability aquifers and <b>excellent</b> <b>seals.</b> The estimated effective storage capacity, which is 2. 6 % of the theoretical capacity, is ∼ 300 GtCO 2 in PRMB, ∼ 57 GtCO 2 in BBGB, ∼ 41 Gt CO 2 in QDNB and∼ 160 Gt CO 2 in YGHB. On the whole, the Tertiary sedimentary basins in northern SCS margin have large storage capacities of abut 567 Gt CO 2, which provide a promising storage option for CCS implementation in South China. As the high costs is a major obstacles for sub-seafloor CO 2 storage, the reuse of infrastructures {{for oil and gas}} development, such as platforms, wells and pipelines, would be the first choice. Although the theoretical storage capacities of the offshore oil and gas fields in the northern SCS are small, they distributed as groups and clusters and associated with sufficient quantified CO 2 storage capacity in the saline aquifers. Further assessments are needed to define the residual life (= equipment life minus the field life) of the infrastructures, their practical and matched storage capacities, as well as a proper character and site screening particularly in regard to containment and risk of leakage. All these have been done well ahead of the real abandons of the oil/gas fields, so that the fields are in “CO 2 Storage Readlines (CSR) ”...|$|R

The new glass composition showed lower bulk electrical conductivity, <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> and wetting behavior when sealing under applied load, and qualitatively superior performance when exposed to wet hydrogen for 800 hours. Traditional melting was used to prepare all of the glasses that were studied in detail.

The glass characterization included measurements of the viscosity and thermal expansion of the glasses, as well as the thermal expansion of the partly crystalline glass ceramics. In addition, the wetting and sintering behavior of all glasses has been measured, as well as the crystallization behavior. The time and temperature at which crystalline phases form from the glasses has been determined for all of the glasses. Each glass ceramic contains at least two crystalline phases, and most of the crystalline phases have been positively identified. The body of fundamental data provides a platform for future developments for high temperature sealants, and the newly-developed glass compositions appear promising for large-scale testing.

Palaces sported colorful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavor. The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower {{right corner of the}} stele with captions written underneath them. These and the <b>excellent</b> cut <b>seals</b> show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of ziggurat, with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.|$|R
40|$|Root-end resected {{teeth with}} {{persistent}} apical periodontitis are usually retreated surgically {{or a combination}} of non-surgical and surgical retreatment is employed. However, patients are sometimes unwilling to be subjected to a second surgical procedure. The apical barrier technique that is used for apical closure of immature teeth with necrotic pulps may be an alternative to non-surgically retreat a failed apicoectomy. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has become the material of choice in such cases because of its <b>excellent</b> biocompatibility, <b>sealing</b> ability and osseoinductive properties. This case report describes the non-surgical retreatment of a failed apicoectomy with no attempt at retrofilling of a maxillary central incisor. White MTA was used to induce apical closure of the wide resected apical area. Four-year follow-up examination revealed an asymptomatic, fully functional tooth with a satisfactory healing of the apical lesion. White MTA apical barrier may constitute a reliable and efficient technique to non-surgically retreat teeth with failed root-end resection. The predictability of such a treatment is of great benefit for the patient who is unwilling to be submitted to a second surgical procedure...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{a lot of}} {{attention}} is focused on the possibilities for using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process in packaging solutions. The greatest benefit of an ALD layer is the loss of weight to the packaging. This leads to cost savings during the packaging life cycle. The main target concerning packaging solutions is to create a profitable way to manufacture an ALD layer to packages. At the moment, the most applicable solution seems to be the development of Roll-to-Roll ALD (RRALD) process being faster and cheaper than the batch ALD process. In this thesis the ALD process is first explained briefly. Then the materials in the process are presented followed by comparison between different ALD processes. Finally, the benefits of using ALD in packaging technology and new ideas about possible solutions based on ALD are discussed. Results indicate, that a few nanometers thick aluminum oxide layer produced by ALD can improve water vapour and oxygen barrier significantly, when this layer is deposited onto a polymer substrate. On polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surface and in the best scenario, an Al 2 O 3 ALD layer decreased moisture and oxygen permeation through the structure to one percentage of the original value. On top of polyolefins, such as low density polyethylene and polypropylene (LDPE and PP, respectively), and polylactic acid (PLA) the Al 2 O 3 ALD layer decreased the measured moisture and oxygen permeation through the structure tens of times lower level compared to the value of polymer only. An Al 2 O 3 ALD layer no thicker than 40 – 50 nm is enough to improve the water vapor permeation of LDPE, PP and PET films less than 1 g/m 2 / 24 h in normal conditions. A film with a top Al 2 O 3 ALD layer can be further extrusion coated with an extra LDPE layer to create a structure with <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> properties. Currently RRALD process might be a slightly more expensive way to produce packaging than the conventional laminating process, but there will be savings in terms of material and transportation costs (empty packages, packaging with the product and packaging eventually as litter). Packaging in which aluminum foil is replaced by an ALD layer can also be recycled and thus avoid ending up in a landfill...|$|R
40|$|Sliding {{lip seals}} {{are used in}} {{pneumatic}} cylinders to prevent leakage past the piston and rod. Though they guarantee <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing,</b> the friction forces at contact between lip and counterpart can be relatively high. This results in energy losses and problems with wear on components in relative motion, as well as difficulties in controlling actuator positioning. Standards for compressed air cleanliness restrict the use of greases and lubricants, especially in applications such as the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. A number of studies are thus under way {{in order to find}} effective alternatives to the use of common lubricants. These studies address both seal configuration [1 - 4], and the use of innovative materials [5 - 7]. Other approaches employ systems permitting small amounts of air leakage that operate as lubricated supports, variable-profile pistons [8], or rings with special micromachined surfaces [9 - 10]. Such solutions are not always economical, both because they require precision tolerances and geometries, and because they use special seals, often produced ad hoc. This paper discusses the possibility of using commercial lip seals with a non-conventional mounting on the piston in order to obtain a simple controlled-leakage system that reduces friction forces in pneumatic cylinders economically and effectively. The non-conventional mounting consists of positioning the lip seal in the direction opposite to that used in a conventional installation, so that the contact pressure reduces as air pressure in the chamber rises. In this way, an air gap is created at the sliding interface which allows air in the pressurized chamber to escape past the seal lip, thus reducing the contact force on the barrel. The piston is provided with a hole which exhausts the leakage flow to the atmosphere. To evaluate the validity of this approach, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in [11] to measure flow rate on a type of spring-loaded lip seal consisting of graphite-filled PTFE for barrel diameters of 50 mm. In particular, the tests determined air leakage behavior for different mounting tolerances. This paper presents further tests conducted on the same samples examined in [11] and on another PTFE and graphite-filled PTFE configuration, measuring leakage flow rates and friction forces. Leakage flow rate measurements were carried out with single and double seal installations. The results obtained are discussed together with the advantages of the proposed solution compared to the conventional mountings in ordinary us...|$|R
40|$|The Torre Alfina {{geothermal}} field is located about 10 km {{north of the}} Quaternary Bolsena caldera. The reservoir is a buried structural high made of Mesozoic-Cenozoic carbonatic sequences characterised by discontinuous secondary permeability and sealed by clay-rich alloctonous syn-orogenic flysch successions and Pliocene neo-authoctonous marine clays. The reservoir is locally highly productive, water-dominated and CO 2 -rich, with T at its top of 120 degrees C. The origin of the heat source was not investigated in detail but generally attributed to some unidentified deep magmatic body. Our field structural data document fracturing and faulting that affect both the reservoir and the seal units with dominant NE-SW and a subordinate E-W as maximum extension directions. The surface pattern and kinematics indicate that fault systems {{are part of the}} Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic episode in Central Italy, where strike-slip kinematics transfers deformation between main extensional shear zones. The fault network controls intense hydrothermal manifestations and travertine deposition north of the Torre Alfina area. 230 Th/ 234 U dating allows distinguishing three different stages of hydrothermal pulses bracketed between 200 and 90 ka. To improve the current understanding of the geometry and density of subsurface fracture system we applied the Shear Wave Splitting (SWS) technique studying the waveforms from local microearthquakes recorded in the area from 2008 to 2011. The analysis of SWS provides parameters directly related to the strike of the subsurface fluid-filled fractures and their density. According to the extensive-dilatancy anisotropy hypothesis (Crampin, 1984) SWS is generated by propagation through distributions of fluid-filled cracks, microcracks, and preferentially oriented pore space aligned according to the active stress field in the area. The analysis was made using the software ANISOMAT and gives a major direction NW-SE. The results agree both with structural data and with the focal mechanism of the earthquakes collected in the area between years 1977 and 1992. From the analysis on the crack density our data gives as result a good index of fracture for the reservoir’s rocks. Based on the updated conceptual model we performed numerical simulations in TOUGH 2 code. Results indicate that deep circulation is forced by the geometry of the reservoir and by T and P gradients. We interpret the Torre Alfina field as a "blind" system, formed dominantly by lateral advection of heat and mass from the Bolsena caldera deep system driven both by high T and by the greater depth at which reservoir rocks are downthrown by the volcano-tectonic collapse. Preferential fracture fabric in the deep carbonates allows the lateral heat transfer. The cap-rocks have <b>excellent</b> <b>sealing</b> characteristics allowing the preservation of heat in correspondence with positive structural traps...|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} given insight to the {{existence}} of key petroleum system elements and hydrocarbon occurrence through detailed photo-documentation of exposed rock units and oil seeps in the Owelli Sandstone (a lateral equivalent of the Enugu Formation) outcropping at the foot of Enugu Cuesta near Ugwueme village (Fig.  9 i; Nwajide 2006, 2013). Outcrop studies indicate that these formations within the Anambra Basin consist of variable thicknesses of sediment packages. In addition, basin-wide correlation carried using well data reveals that the oldest formation (the Nkporo Formation) consists of a 300 - to 600 -m-thick sediment package while the overlying Mamu Formation consists of 600 - to 1200 -thick sediments that are in turn overlain by 400 - to 600 -thick sediment units of the Ajali Sandstone. Sediments of the overlying Nsukka Formation are 20 – 50  m thick (Onuoha and Dim 2017). These sediments (sandstones and shales) constitute the reservoir; source and seal rock packages in the basin. Processes such as migration and accumulation could have been made possible by the presence of fractures occurring in the form of faults and anastomosing joints within the shales and sandstone units of Enugu Formation and Mamu Formation. Also, columnar joints present in coal beds of Mamu Formation could a provide pathways for petroleum migration (Fig.  8 c–e). The shales of the Enugu and Mamu formations could offer <b>excellent</b> intraformational <b>seal</b> above the associated sandstones, as well as enhancing clay smearing within faults, while the shales of the Nsukka Formation are most extensive and represent regional seals (Tuttle et al. 1999; Dim et al. 2017). The Anambra Basin has the best potential within the Nigerian inland basins as it contain all the elements necessary for an active petroleum system: the marine shales of Nkporo Group and the Mamu Formation coals constitute good gas and oil source rocks; the clean sandstones of Ajali Formation and sandstones in the Mamu Formation form good reservoirs; and shales in the Nsukka Formations provide a regional seal (Obaje et al. 2004; Akande et al. 2007; Dim et al. 2017).|$|R
