These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which <b>it</b> <b>belonged.</b> The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that <b>it</b> <b>belonged</b> to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} <b>it</b> <b>belonged</b> to a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of Deinonychus is {{more similar to}} those of oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>belonged</b> to Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, {{who sold}} it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, {{founder of the}} Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin. That April, the Duveen Brothers, less {{affected}} by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually {{had to go through}} the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups: the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages– Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive– and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages– Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, <b>it</b> <b>belonged</b> to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place-name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.|$|E
