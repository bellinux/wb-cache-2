5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no {{responsibility}} for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
5|$|The Venezuelan {{government}} reacted {{negatively to}} the episode and banned Family Guy from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming. Local station Venevisión was threatened with financial sanctions for broadcasting the show, which was avoided by airing {{an episode of}} Baywatch instead and they aired public service films as an apology. Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami stated that any cable stations which refuse to stop airing the series would be fined and he also claimed that it promoted the use of cannabis. The government then displayed the clip of which featured Brian and Stewie performing the featured number and then stated that Family Guy is an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> United States supports cannabis use.|$|E

25|$|A similar figure {{known as}} Pérák, the Spring Man of Prague was {{reported}} to have been seen in Czechoslovakia around 1939–1945. As writers such as Mike Dash have shown, the elusiveness and supernatural leaping abilities attributed to Pérák bear a close resemblance to those exhibited by Spring-heeled Jack, and distinct parallels can be drawn between the two entities. The stories of Pérák provide a useful <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> traits of Spring-heeled Jack have a broad cultural resonance in urban folklore. Pérák, like Spring-heeled Jack, {{went on to become a}} folklore hero, even starring in several animated superhero cartoons, fighting the SS, the earliest of which is Jiří Trnka's 1946 film Pérák a SS or Springman and the SS.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{injuries}} {{associated with the}} knee in cricket occur when a player is bowling. In the landing stride, bowlers are constantly twisting and putting extreme force through the knee joint, this can then result in a strain or more severely a tear to the collateral ligaments. Patellar tendinopathy is a common knee injury that occurs most commonly in bowlers due to the overuse of the tendon {{which can lead to}} the tendon fibres beginning to break down. David Lawrence, an English fast bowler is one particular <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> landing stride when bowling can cause serious injuries to the knee. On 10 February 1992, his left patella shattered during a delivery.|$|E
25|$|Durham were a prime <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> lack {{of three}} men can change a team. Three months earlier, Michael Hussey, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison had been firing for the Durham lads as they beat Leicestershire by an innings and 216 runs, the highest {{margin of victory}} in the County Championship so far this season - before this match. Without these three, and only with Nathan Astle and Ashley Noffke by way of replacement, they {{collapsed}} to 167 against the bowling of Glen Chapple and Gary Keedy, before Mal Loye made a double ton and Dominic Cork an unbeaten ton to give Lancashire a 363-run lead on first innings. Then, Chapple took four for 18, as Durham rolled over yet again for 135 - {{and all of a}} sudden the league leaders were transformed into laughing stocks.|$|E

25|$|Mixed member {{systems are}} {{susceptible}} to gerrymandering for the local seats that remain a part of such systems. Under parallel voting, a semi-proportional system, there is no compensation for the effects that such gerrymandering might have. Under MMP, the use of compensatory list seats makes gerrymandering less of an issue. However, its effectiveness in this regard depends upon {{the features of the}} system, including the size of the regional districts, the relative share of list seats in the total, and opportunities for collusion that might exist. A striking <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> compensatory mechanism can be undermined {{can be seen in the}} 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election, where the leading party, Fidesz, combined gerrymandering and decoy lists, which resulted in a two-thirds parliamentary majority from a 45% vote. This illustrates how certain implementations of MMP can produce moderately proportional outcomes, similar to parallel voting.|$|E
