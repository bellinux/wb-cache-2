A more recent expansion applies the spatial-restraint model to electron density maps derived from cryoelectron microscopy studies, which provide low-resolution information that is not usually itself sufficient to generate atomic-resolution structural models. To {{address the problem of}} inaccuracies in initial target-template sequence alignment, an <b>iterative</b> <b>procedure</b> has also been introduced to refine the alignment {{on the basis of the}} initial structural fit.

The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused John Wallis to remark that he was: [...] "as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results." [...] It is possible that he used an <b>iterative</b> <b>procedure</b> to calculate these values.|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{inversion}} of [...] and [...] is only possible in very simple cases of isotropic, [...] and [...] infinitely thick films. In all other cases a layer model must be established, which considers the optical constants (refractive index or dielectric function tensor) and thickness parameters of all individual {{layers of the}} sample including the correct layer sequence. Using an <b>iterative</b> <b>procedure</b> (least-squares minimization) unknown optical constants and/or thickness parameters are varied, and [...] and [...] values are calculated using the Fresnel equations.

2500|$|Mathematically, linear {{least squares}} {{is the problem}} of {{approximately}} solving an overdetermined system of linear equations, where the best approximation is defined as that which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the data values and their corresponding modeled values. [...] The approach is called linear least squares since the assumed function is linear in the parameters to be estimated. Linear least squares problems are convex and have a closed-form solution that is unique, provided that the number of data points used for fitting equals or exceeds the number of unknown parameters, except in special degenerate situations. [...] In contrast, non-linear least squares problems generally must be solved by an <b>iterative</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the problems can be non-convex with multiple optima for the objective function. If prior distributions are available, then even an underdetermined system can be solved using the Bayesian MMSE estimator.|$|E

2500|$|All {{elements}} absorb X-rays to some extent. Each element has {{a characteristic}} absorption spectrum {{which consists of}} a [...] "saw-tooth" [...] succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the count rate [...] {{compared with the same}} concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an <b>iterative</b> <b>procedure</b> is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.|$|E
