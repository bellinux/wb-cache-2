The publisher was changed to Haage & Partner Computer on October 18, 2001. Despite the game's official release being announced for December 2001, the approval to do so could only be <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> January 7, 2002. The game was shipped without a printed manual, but had additional German and French language support. Hyperion had stated they would port over Silent Threat if the FreeSpace port sold well. To date, Silent Threat {{has yet to be}} ported over to the Amiga platform.|$|E

The second leg of shows from 12 September coincided with Snow Patrol's own headlining North American Tour. During the first leg of supporting shows, the band played a concert in Poland. Lightbody was overwhelmed by the show U2 put up, and broke down crying, only to find everyone else around him was doing the same. He later wrote a piece for U2's official website, describing his experience of the show, saying {{that it was one of}} the best nights of his life and the best reception they had <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> the support shows.|$|E

25|$|The {{project has}} not been without problems, however. The SFO {{extension}} drew 35,107 daily riders by 2008, significantly less than its opening target of 50,000 average weekday riders. The most use the new line has <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> any single day was 37,200; the SFO Station received an average of 6,781 daily passenger exits in 2015. Another significant problem of note had been the rocky relationship between BART and San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) which was {{not a part of}} the BART district, but by agreement was responsible for the extension's operating costs. Fueled by the reality that the extension was not paying for itself, the acrimony between BART and SamTrans over changes and reductions in bus and train service reached a high.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1864, the army went through other command changes: John B. Hood took command of the Second Corps, while Polk was {{transferred}} to the army in May with the Army of Mississippi, which was re-designated the Third Corps. In the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, Johnston faced the combined Northern armies of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, whose orders were to destroy the Army of Tennessee, with the capture of Atlanta as the secondary objective. Johnston, who felt the continued existence of his army was more important than protecting territory, tended to avoid battle with Sherman. During May and early June, Johnston took up several defensive positions but withdrew from each after Sherman outflanked each position. Polk was killed at Pine Mountain on June 14; he was temporarily replaced by W. W. Loring until July, when A. P. Stewart took command of the corps. Johnston's retreats caused impatience among the Confederate leadership in Richmond, particularly Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had never <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> well with Johnston, and feared that Johnston was planning to abandon Atlanta without a fight. Following Sherman's outflanking of Johnston's Line along the Chattahoochee River, forcing Johnston back on Atlanta itself, Johnston was replaced by Hood on July 9. Stephen D. Lee was reassigned from Mississippi to take command of the Second Corps. Hood launched several attacks on Sherman's forces around Atlanta, including at Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, and Ezra Church, but each attack failed. Sherman was able to cut Hood's last railroad supply line following the Battle of Jonesboro on September 1, which forced Hood to abandon the city the following day.|$|E
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E

500|$|The next {{match was}} between John Cena and Bray Wyatt. The Wyatt Family's {{entrance}} was voodoo-themed and performed live by a costumed Mark Crozer and the Rels. Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena {{to be the}} monster that he is and to finish him off; Cena refused. Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena's aggressive retaliation, but Wyatt just laughed while taking punishment. Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self, attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron, {{but it was not}} enough to beat Cena. Cena climbed to the top rope, but instead of attacking Wyatt, Cena dove onto Wyatt's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside. Cena teased becoming a 'monster' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the steel ring steps, but he could not do it and threw them away. Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing [...] "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands", so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out. At ringside, Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper's area. Back in the ring, Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission, but Wyatt reached the ropes. Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall. Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena, again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy. Cena instead attacked Rowan (who had <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> the ring apron) with the chair, so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall. Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win.|$|E

2500|$|The film is {{composed}} of multiple comedy shorts presented through an overarching segment titled [...] "The Pitch", in which Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid), a mad screenwriter, is attempting to pitch a script to film executive Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinnear). After revealing several of the stories in his script, Wessler becomes agitated when Schraeder dismisses his outrageous ideas, and he pulls a gun on him and forces him to listen to multiple other stories before making Schraeder consult his manager, Bob Mone (Common), to purchase the film. When they do so, Mone's condescending, humiliating attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film [...] "the biggest film since Howard the Duck", he confronts Mone {{in the parking lot}} with a gun and tries to make him perform fellatio on the security guard (Will Sasso) (Wessler had <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> the lot by doing the same thing) and kill him if he does not make the film. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder down with more story ideas to no avail, but Mone pulls out a gun and shoots Schraeder to death. The segment ends with it being revealed that it is being shot by a camera crew as part of the movie, leading into the final segments.|$|E

2500|$|The five {{abducted}} {{are being}} held unconscious inside pods about a Dominators ship, with their minds in a shared hallucination. In the hallucination, Oliver finds himself back at Queen Manor, having never <b>gotten</b> <b>on</b> The Queen's Gambit, where {{he is about to}} be married to Laurel Lance, both his parents are alive, and Diggle is the Hood. Oliver begins seeing flashes of his former life, as do Sara, Ray, Diggle, and Thea, making them realize what the Dominators have done to them. They decide to try and escape, but their attempt is blocked by each of their own enemy: Malcolm Merlyn, Deathstroke and one of his Mirakuru soldiers (who killed Ray's fiancée Anna Loring), Damien Darhk and his H.I.V.E. soldiers (including Andy Diggle). The adversaries are all defeated, and the captives are able to escape, resulting in them waking up inside the Dominators ship. Escaping in a shuttle, they are rescued by Nate Heywood, who pilots the time ship Waverider. Meanwhile, Felicity, Curtis Holt and Cisco try to hack into the Dominators' mainframe using a piece of their technology, recovering a necessary device with the help of Barry and Kara to locate the captives. Aboard the Waverider, Ray deduces that the Dominators were gathering information from their minds about metahumans, using the hallucination as a distraction, to help them complete a special [...] "weapon". Elsewhere, the Dominator mothership heads towards Earth.|$|E
