So far the weather has been fine and {{everything}} is hunky-dory. I hope <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> {{at the end of}} the trip. You know, I’m an old fatalist, don’t you? Sure as shooting it begins to rain like “cats and dogs” when we leave campt [sic] whereas prior to that the weather was fine. I look back into my memories and find rainy days on the following events—our wedding day; our trip to S. A., and our trip to Fort Sill 2 ̆ 6 COM School. Each experience turned out fine and I have no qualms that this one will turn out O. K. too. Our quarters are the same elegant quarters which we had hoped for. The food continues to be excellent and my moral [sic] is sky-high. The only bad feature about this trip is that I don’t have you sitting beside me in a deck chair where I can hug and kiss you at will. Last night the ocean was as calm as a mirror—the moon was round and full. The ship moved swiftly through the water. The scene ideal if I had you in my arms and my lips pressed hard against my loved one[‘]s. The man [sic] have been issued travel books such as regards practice 2 ̆ 6 customs in foreign countries. I am spending my time teaching the officers 2 ̆ 6 men foreign languages. Yesterday I was one of the fortunate men receiving 4 pieces of mail. Three letters from my darling and one letter from the folks. Naturally I boasted about my “little girl” to all the officers and got them extremely jealous. Gee, I’m mean, but I’m crazy about you and want the whole world to know it. I wonder if Mort got his leave? I hope so, sincerely! I was surprised at the folks’ letter. It was a fine letter wishing me luck and a speedy return. I hope they maintain that attitude always. It’s better for everybody concerned. At the present time some darn good musical recordings are coming over the ship’s intercommunication system. The men go for these in a big way. Precious, you don’t know how happy you make me feel when I learned that you got yourself a position with the Board of Education, that you are contemplating taking some course at night school and spending some time at USO. Perfect, darling, Perfect. To date I don’t know whether V-mail is faster or not. Off hand I would say send V-mail to supplement your ordinary air mail letters. I received your letter with the Pres. speech enclosed. The speech was a masterpiece. Thanks for the clipping. He’s my boy for the next term. I listened to Dewey’s speech Tuesday night and the only thing our hero could say was a series of platitudes—nothing specific and sling mud at Roosevelt’s associates. Bah! About the pilot—He got his just deserves [sic]. He can’t justify his actions. He was a ménage and took a life. The fact that he was young 2 ̆ 6 intelligent is a mitigating circumstance. His sentence will probably be reduced in about 5 years. You know, darling, I find sometime[s] that I can’t adequately describe my feelings for you. When I think of you (which is always) I smile to myself and say, “Gee, your [sic] a lucky guy to have a wife who loves you so intensly [sic]. Darling, I can feel your love for me and I want you to feel my complete, unreserved, total love for you. Ours is a permanent, stable union made 2 ̆ 6 sealed in heaven—I didn’t mean to get so poetic but thinking about you makes writing this way simple. Kiss Mother 2 ̆ 6 Dad for me. Oh!

For a change, I {{got a pretty}} good idea about how things stand with you. Your article from “Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes” came on the very day I had made up my mind to make an app’t to give blood even if they “puncture me full of needle holes” trying to get it. I’ll make an app’t the first free moment I have!! Thank Cap’t Shelton 2 ̆ 6 Lt. Haygood for their few words. The first chance I get I’ll write them my personal “thank you. ” Also, I’ll make it a point to write Patty Shelton again—in hopes of getting some reply. I haven’t rec’d the 80. 00 money order but I’m sure it’ll be along 2 ̆ 6 I’ll buy us a bond! As soon as I receive it I’ll let you know. The poem, “The Other Side” from Lt.

I know everything will come out “okay” but do be as careful as you can, darling 2 ̆ 6 God bless you!!! Rec’d a letter from Fred Grail 2 ̆ 6 that was all the mail today. The package you rec’d from the Workingmen’s Circle was not from the Rosens. Dad is a member—that’s how you got it—just for being Mr. S’s son-in-law. However, the Rosens did send you a package which should arrive shortly. Wonder what happened to the camera I sent you? Darling, you’re worried something may happen to me. You say, life wouldn’t be worth living—well, my sweetheart, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> about you. If something should happen to you, I will have no incentive to live—precious, you are part of me! Today, I {{became a member of the}} Council for Childhood Education of Greater Cleve. 2 ̆ 6 went to their meeting at the Bd. of Educ. Bldg. Guest speaker was Dr. Marion Edman who spoke on “Unity Thru Understanding” 2 ̆ 6 she was terrific! The [sic] “hit” the “color situation” straight in the face. Keynote of her speech was “discrepencies [sic] between Am. ideals 2 ̆ 6 Am. pratices in the Am. dilemma. ” Fault is not with the minority groups but with ourselves. She gave a short talk on “why prejudices exist” 2 ̆ 6 where can we start to do away with it” [sic]—to educate people? Her answer: [...] 1) moral reasons—sense of right 2 ̆ 6 wrong still exists; 2) must do it to have Peace—appealing to “self-interest. ” After all 2 / 3 of [the] world are [sic] colored people. Then, of course, she talked about what the teacher could do in the classroom. There were both colored 2 ̆ 6 white teachers present 2 ̆ 6 there was plenty “stirring” in the group as she talked, but hallelujah—she put her point across! Sweetheart, if there is anything I’m not doing that you’d like me to do or vice versa, please write me! Every night I write you an honest letter of my daily thoughts 2 ̆ 6 doings. Away from me, you can look at this objectively 2 ̆ 6 tell me what more I can or cannot do! I adore you, my darling! I ache for you physically 2 ̆ 6 mentally!—you’re my everything!
