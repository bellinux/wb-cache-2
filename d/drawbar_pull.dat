25|$|The Rs were {{pressed into}} {{secondary}} passenger and goods service, roles {{for which a}} Hudson with large diameter driving wheels was sometimes a less than ideal choice. There was little opportunity to exploit their high speed capability. Furthermore, their relatively low factor of adhesion (4.08) and lack of fully compensated springing, coupled with the tendency of locomotives to transfer weight to the rearmost wheels under high <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> conditions (which {{in the case of}} the R meant a weight transfer from the driving wheels to the unpowered trailing truck) caused them to slip when starting heavy goods trains.|$|E
2500|$|As {{will be seen}} in the {{following}} discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades.

50|$|A ballast tractor is a {{specially}} weighted tractor unit {{of a heavy}} hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a <b>drawbar</b> to <b>pull</b> or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> is a {{function}} of velocity, and in general decreases as the speed of the vehicle increases (due both to increasing resistance and decreasing transmission gear ratios). <b>Drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> is the difference between tractive effort available and tractive effort required to overcome resistance at a specified speed.|$|E

40|$|Farmers try {{to reduce}} steps of soil {{preparation}} by using subsoiler and then following by equipment for soil pulverization such as a rotary tiller and a power harrow which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the tilling performances of a rotary tiller and a power harrow applying after subsoiling. The results showed that both the rotary tiller and the power harrow had negative slip, indicating that they generated force to push a tractor. The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the power harrow. Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for two equipment types were significantly different. However, {{no significant differences were found}} for the forward speeds, slips, <b>drawbar</b> <b>pulls</b> and <b>drawbar</b> powers. Comparative analysis showed that two equipment types had significant difference in PTO power to working depth, drawbar power to working depth, PTO power to working area, drawbar power to working area and soil pulverization...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study possible correlations between soil compaction (and related soil cone penetrometer resistance measurements) and shear strength normal to the field plane, required to cut the soil with a subsoiler. A measurement system for sensing the soil cone penetrometer resistance was built mounting, on a frame fixed to the front part of a tractor, a rod and a penetration cone with a load cell. A load cell, mounted on the tractor <b>drawbar,</b> <b>pulling</b> a subsoiler, allowed to measure the shear strength normal to the field plane, required to cut the soil. Both load cells were connected, through a display, to a portable computer, where a software was used for acquiring the data of both parameters. The measured data was geo-referenced by using a DGPS mobile receiver, mounted on the tractor. After several reliability laboratory tests, the two systems were experimented on a field of inland Sicily. The results did not show any correlation between the two studied parameters. Therefore, further tests with different soil types and conditions need to be carried out, in order {{to find out if the}} total lack of correlation was due to the particular soil conditions encountered during the tests...|$|R
50|$|Caution {{needs to}} be {{exercised}} in the usual drilling machine or lathe situation, which provides no <b>drawbar</b> to <b>pull</b> the taper into engagement, if a tool is used requiring a high torque but providing little axial resistance. An example would be {{the use of a}} large diameter drill to slightly enlarge an existing hole. In this situation, there may be considerable rotary loading. In contrast, the cutting action will require very little thrust or feed force. Thrust helps to keep the taper seated and provides essential frictional coupling.|$|R

2500|$|Unknown to Casey, three {{separate}} trains {{were in the}} station at Vaughan: double-header freight train No. 83 (located {{to the north and}} headed south, which had been delayed due to having two <b>drawbars</b> <b>pulled</b> while at Vaughan) and long freight train No. 72 (located to the south and headed north) were both in the passing track to the east of the main line. As the combined length of the trains was ten cars longer than the length of the east passing track, some of the cars were stopped on the main line. [...] The two sections of northbound local passenger train No. 26 had arrived from Canton earlier, and required a [...] "saw by" [...] for them to get to the [...] "house track" [...] west of the main line. [...] The [...] "saw by" [...] maneuver required that No. 83 back up (onto the main line) to allow No. 72 to move northward and pull its overlapping cars off the main line and onto the east side track from the south switch, thus allowing the two sections of No. 26 {{to gain access to the}} west house track. [...] The [...] "saw by", however, left the rear cars of No. 83 overlapping above the north switch and on the main line – right in Jones' path. [...] As workers prepared a second [...] "saw by" [...] to let Jones pass, an air hose broke on No. 72, locking its brakes and leaving the last four cars of No. 83 on the main line.|$|R
5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a <b>drawbar</b> is incrementally <b>pulled</b> out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|R
5000|$|Drawbar force gauges {{are able}} to detect broken or {{weakening}} components of the drawbar clamping system, can give indications that the unit needs lubrication, detect gripper mis-adjustment, or demonstrate that the incorrect retention knob is being used for the machine. A retention knob is a device screwed into the narrow end of a tool holder, enabling the <b>drawbar</b> to <b>pull</b> the tool holder into the spindle. With a highly accurate electronic gauge, deficiencies can be noted and corrected. Many hours of expensive machine operating time can be put to use while avoiding fretting, chatter, [...] "stuck" [...] tool holders in a spindle, etc., by employing proper preventative maintenance techniques using an accurate electronic gauge and other spindle health management tools.|$|R

50|$|Drawbar {{horsepower}} (dbhp) is {{the power}} a railway locomotive has available to haul a train or an agricultural tractor to pull an implement. This is a measured figure rather than a calculated one. A special railway car called a dynamometer car coupled behind the locomotive keeps a continuous record of the <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> exerted, and the speed. From these, the power generated can be calculated. To determine the maximum power available, a controllable load is required; it is normally a second locomotive with its brakes applied, {{in addition to a}} static load.|$|E
50|$|The NMTB tool shanks had the 7 in 24 taper, {{but they}} also had a {{constant}} diameter tail (pilot) {{at the end of}} the shank that was described in the 1927 patent. Subsequent design variations dropped the tail (making the shank shorter) and put a V-groove in the flange that aided automated tool changing. Modern designs started using power <b>drawbars</b> that gripped <b>pull</b> studs (also known as retention knobs) that were screwed into the tool shank rather than screw-in drawbars. The power drawbar would grip the pull stud rather than screwing into the tool shank.|$|R
500|$|The Nord Stage Organ Section {{provides}} {{physical models}} of three electric organs – the Hammond B3, the Vox Continental, and the Farfisa Compact. Instead of physical drawbars, the Organ section features [...] "drawbuttons" [...] {{with a set}} of red LED strips to indicate the position of each drawbar from 0 (fully in) to 8 (fully out). For the Hammond and Vox organ emulations, pressing the [...] "down" [...] button illuminates more LEDs to visually emulate a <b>drawbar</b> being <b>pulled</b> out, while pressing the [...] "up" [...] button does the reverse. Since a real Farfisa organ selects sounds via rocker tabs instead of drawbars, the drawbuttons behave as tabs when the Farfisa emulation is selected on the Stage. The standard set of Percussion, Chorus and Vibrato settings as found on each of the three organs are available, and a rotary speaker emulation (similar to a Leslie speaker), including speed selection and overdrive, is also available. The Organ section is fully polyphonic.|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{vibrations}} {{in agricultural}} tractors can contribute with mechanical failures and subject the operator to discomfort. This work evaluated the vibration levels on rear and front axles of an agricultural tractor working at different forward speeds and wheel drive conditions in plowing and harrowing operations. Field tests {{were carried out}} in a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (forward travel speeds x front-wheel-assist enable or disable), with three replications. Tractor vibration was measured using two single axis accelerometers fixed above the rear and front axles. The actual forward speed of the tractor was obtained by means of ultrasonic radar and the angular velocity of the wheels was measured with magnetic transducers. The <b>drawbar</b> force to <b>pull</b> the disc harrow was obtained by a load cell.

50|$|The ZT 300 series {{tractors}} {{construction is}} based on a combination of the frameless block construction for the rear part and a half frame for the front. This makes the rear axle a rigid axle, while the front axle is a rigid swing axle. The ZT 300 has a three-point-linkage with a lifting force of 17,65 kN and a PTO as well as a hydraulic system. Starting in 1974, an optimised hydraulic system was used, that automatically increased the weight on the rear axle by slightly lifting the farm implement attached to the three-point linkage. This resulted in better traction and therefore greater <b>drawbar</b> <b>pull</b> force.|$|E
5000|$|Power for {{agricultural}} machinery was originally supplied by ox or other domesticated animals.
