He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion, and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|The last 145 {{pages of}} the book is {{addressed}} to passengers, to help them determine which airlines have good safety records and how to better ensure safe travel while flying. Schiavo discusses the average ages of certain airline fleets, reveals the accident rates of the major airline carriers, safety ratings at national airlines, bomb detection rates at U.S. airports, and provides a list of airports where power failures have affected the effectiveness of control towers. She concludes with a list of recommendations for <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> can effect change at government agencies including the FAA, and how to address concerns of conflict of interest between air safety and inspection and the airline industry.|$|E

5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

This paper describes our efforts to establish a taxonomic foundation for comparing and contrasting attack-graph approaches, and we use the taxonomy to compare several important efforts in the field. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the field}} of marketing, {{behavioural}} experiments which have dealt with managerial decision- making, and risk perception, in consumer decisions have utilised the Bayesian model, or similar models, but found {{that it may not}} be relevant quantitatively in predicting human information processing behaviour.

Therefore, “the model may have some value as a first approximation to the development of descriptive choice theory” in consumer and managerial instances.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, absurdism is a {{philosophical}} {{school of thought}} stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information {{as well as the}} vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and <b>how</b> <b>individuals,</b> once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the nests}} {{located near the}} {{periphery}} {{are more likely to}} be attacked than the ones in the center which are usually completely surrounded by other nests. This is an example of the selfish herd theory and demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> may cluster together for protection against predators, but the ones in the middle tend to be safer than those on the outside. However, each colony is more prone to attack if the colony next to it is attacked. This is an example of the attacked neighbor risk and reduces some of the benefit gained by participating in selfish herd tactics.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{including}} the Branch Davidians, Church Universal and Triumphant, the Church of Satan, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments, the Peoples Temple, Heaven's Gate, and the Unification Church {{are discussed in}} the book. Snow recounts results from a study of 353 former members of 48 cults in the United States, who recounted experiences after leaving their respective groups. After leaving the groups, 23 percent of former members stated they had attempted suicide, 63 percent had suicidal ideation, and 93 percent had experienced anxiety attacks. Snow devotes a chapter to deprogramming and advice on <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> can avoid joining these groups from the outset.|$|E
25|$|Her protagonists often {{attempt to}} uphold {{existing}} social institutions and norms {{in the service}} of the greater good while the antagonists often attempt to exploit, subvert or radically alter the predominant social order for selfish gain. She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place in society and <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined, and many of her male characters are portrayed as damaged, abused, or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|One of Dourish's most {{recognized}} contributions {{has been}} bringing sociological and phenomenological understandings {{of human activity}} {{to the design of}} technological systems. For example, his work on spatiality in virtual worlds and computer mediated communication has emphasized how people—in interaction with systems and with one another—evolve new understandings of space, media, and relationships. He also drew on Schutzian phenomenology to argue that tangible computing and social computing share an underlying emphasis on people as embodied, social actors. Emphasizing people as social and embodied points to the importance of <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> are constituted through their interactions and movements in space with other people. This model is counterposed to models of the person in Human-Computer Interaction that focus exclusively on people's cognitive capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Social views also better {{explain the}} {{ambiguity}} of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence <b>how</b> <b>individuals</b> label both themselves and others within society. Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories. The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.|$|E
