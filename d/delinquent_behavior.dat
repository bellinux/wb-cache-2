We applied models of network-behavioral dynamics (Snijders, Steglich, and Schweinberger, 2007) to a five-year longitudinal sample of Swedish youth (n = 445). Results indicate youth selectively nominated : a) friends who reciprocated their nomination; b) who were friends of those whom they nominated; c) same-sex schoolmates; and d) peer affiliates with similar levels of school involvement and engagement in <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Influence effects emerged such that youth tended {{to adopt the}} <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> of peer affiliates.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine to what extent Social Structure and Social Learning Theory (SSSL) {{explains}} <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among Turkish adolescents. While Social Structure and Social Learning (SSSL) Theory have been examined quite frequently in the criminology and sociology literature, the present study is unique as it tests the theory in Turkey, a context with a mixed Islamic and Secular cultural structure. The data originates from a survey conducted in Istanbul in 2008 by the Icelandic Centre for Social Research and Analysis (ICSRA) under the auspices of their Youth in Europe project. The sample includes 2, 445 Turkish high school students. The dependent variable includes a 13 -item delinquency scale, and the independent variables consist of differential association, costs and rewards of differential reinforcement, definitions, imitation, differential location in the social structure, and differential social location of groups. The statistical analyses were conducted using a negative binomial regression approach. Results demonstrated that differential association (peer delinquency) is positively associated with <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among Turkish adolescents. In addition, there is a significant and positive relationship between norms/beliefs that favor delinquency and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Moreover, parental reaction, a measure of differential reinforcement, has a negative impact on delinquency. Imitation variables, which include witnessing an argument and witnessing violence in the family, also appear as significant predictors for delinquency. Gender is the only social structure variable significantly related to <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Furthermore, results indicated that social learning variables mediated the relationship between social structure and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Policy implications and suggestions for further studies are also provided at the end of the dissertation...|$|R

Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish <b>delinquent</b> <b>behavior</b> to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim.

40|$|Actor-oriented {{models are}} {{described}} as a longitudinal strategy for examining the co-evolution of social networks and individual behaviors. We argue that these models provide advantages over conventional approaches due {{to their ability to}} account for inherent dependencies between individuals embedded in a social network (i. e., reciprocity, transitivity) and model interdependencies between network and behavioral dynamics. We provide a brief explanation of actor-oriented processes, followed by a description of parameter estimates, model specification, and selection procedures used by the Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analyses (SIENA) software program (Snijders, Steglich, Schweinberger, & Huisman, 2006). To illustrate the applicability of these models, we provide an empirical example investigating the co-evolution of friendship networks and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in a longitudinal sample of Swedish adolescents with the goal of simultaneously assessing selection and influence processes.

Additionally, although most of the measures of parenting have similar impacts for male and female children, there are certain practices which produce divergent results based upon the child's gender. Parental reports of monitoring are a stronger inhibitor of intentions to use illicit substances for males, while the parent's attachment is a greater inhibitor of self-reported rebellious behavior for females.

40|$|Sex {{crimes against}} {{children}} and {{child sexual abuse}} are significant social and public health problems. Only within the last twenty-five years has attention been given to children and adolescents who victimize their peers. In the United States, these sexually reactive children and adolescents comprise considerable proportions of all arrests for sexual offenses; however, research {{about the role of}} pornography in their lives is virtually nonexistent. This descriptive, exploratory study of 160 sexually reactive children and adolescents describes the characteristics of those who use pornography and those who do not. In addition, this study examines the associations between pornography use and abuse history, psychiatric symptoms, nonsexual criminal, antisocial, and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and sexually aggressive behaviors among sexually reactive children and adolescents. This secondary analysis uses data from an ongoing study that is examining children and adolescents who have been removed from abusive homes and placed elsewhere, usually in foster care. These children and adolescents are currently at risk to sexually victimize other children. Chi-square and individual odds ratio analyses were employed to examine the associations between use of pornography with abuse history, psychiatric symptoms, nonsexual criminal, antisocial, and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and sexually aggressive behaviors. Several significant positive associations were found between pornography use and psychiatric symptoms, nonsexual criminal, antisocial, and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and sexually aggressive behaviors. Treatment recommendations for nurses and mental health professionals caring for children and adolescents {{in a variety of settings}} are offered.

40|$|Residential {{mobility}} {{has been}} associated with a host of negative outcomes for children. For low-income families, the context of the move is often unrelated to significant gains; instead, mobility is driven by negative external forces. The term “residential instability” has been used to describe this type of mobility pattern, yet the concept is vague and poorly defined in extant literature. Three separate studies were conducted. Study 1 was a systematic review using The Guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies. Study 2 used the Wilsonian method to develop a definition of residential instability. Study 3 was an empirical study to examine the effect of residential mobility and housing instability on <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among at-risk sample of adolescents with prenatal exposure to cocaine and/or opiates who participated in the longitudinal Maternal Lifestyle Study (MLS). The systematic review of 23 studies supported the research aim of Study 3. The Wilsonian analysis resulted in a definition of residential instability. Secondary analysis of 736 adolescents in the MLS demonstrated an association between residential mobility and housing instability and <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among adolescents across the sample, including crimes against people, vandalism, and school delinquency. Together, these three studies present a synthesis of the science, clarification of concepts, and demonstrate that housing problems are a compelling risk factor for <b>delinquent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among youth. Findings from these studies highlight the critical contextual influences that vulnerable families routinely encounter.
