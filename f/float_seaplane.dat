50|$|The R3C-2 was a twin <b>float</b> <b>seaplane</b> {{built for}} the Schneider Trophy race. In 1925, it took place at Chesapeake Bay in Baltimore, Maryland. With 232.57 mph (374.274 km/h), pilot Jimmy Doolittle won the trophy with a Curtiss R3C-2. The other two R3C-2s, piloted by George Cuddihy and Ralph Oftsie, did not reach the finish line. The next day, with the same plane on a {{straight}} course, Doolittle reached 245.7 mph (395.4 km/h), a new world record. For the next Schneider Trophy, which took place on 13 November 1926, the R3C-2's engine was further improved, and pilot Christian Franck Schilt won second place with 231.364 mph (372.34 km/h).|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the NACA tank and in the NACA 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel on two models of {{transverse}} step floats and three models of pointed step floats considered to be suitable for use with single <b>float</b> <b>seaplanes.</b> The object of the program was the reduction of water resistance and spray of single <b>float</b> <b>seaplanes</b> without reducing the angle of dead rise believed to be necessary for the satisfactory absorption of the shock loads. The results indicated that all the models have less resistance and spray than the model of the Mark V float and that the pointed step floats are somewhat superior to the transverse step floats in these respects. Models 41 -D, 61 -A, and 73 were tested by the general method over a wide range of loads and speeds. The results are presented in the form of curves and charts for use in design calculations...|$|R

She arrived two days after this historic and bitterly contested landing had begun, and with two other tenders established a <b>floating</b> <b>seaplane</b> base from which search and rescue missions were performed.|$|R
50|$|LFG WD: Two <b>float</b> <b>seaplane</b> version first flown 29 June 1917 {{and tested}} at Warnem√ºnde in July. It was found wanting both in its flight {{characteristics}} {{and the view}} forward and downwards. The latter criticism was frequently made of the D.I and its descendants, visibility blocked by engine radiators and the lower wing.modifications were made, but further official testing in September lead to the refusal of a production order. Modified yet again, the single example ended with the seaplane single-seat fighter school. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the LFG W, though this name is also used for a LFG floatplane version of the Albatros C.Ia.|$|E

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at Langley Field is {{investigating}} the get-away characteristics of an N- 9 H, a DT- 2, and an F- 5 l, as representing, respectively, a single float, a double float, and a boat type of seaplane. This report covers the investigation conducted on the N- 9 H. The results show that a single <b>float</b> <b>seaplane</b> trims aft in taking off. Until a planing condition is reached the angle of attack is about 15 degrees and is only slightly affected by controls. When planing it seeks a lower angle, but is controllable through a widening range, until at the take-off it is possible to obtain angles of 8 degrees to 15 degrees with corresponding speeds of 53 to 41 M.

40|$|A 1 / 3. 5 {{full-size}} {{model of}} the Mark V float of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, was tested in the NACA tank both with smooth painted bottom surfaces and with roundhead rivets, plate laps, and keel plates fitted to simulate the actual bottom of a metal float. The augmentation in water resistance due to the added roughness {{was found to be}} from 10 - 12 % at the hum speed and from 12 - 14 % at high speeds. The effect of the roughness of the afterbody was found to be negligible except at high trims. The model data were extrapolated to full size by the usual method which assumes the forces to vary according to Froude's law, {{and in the case of}} the smooth model by a method of separation that takes into account the effect of scale on the frictional resistance. It was concluded that the effect of rivet heads on the takeoff performance of a relatively high-powered <b>float</b> <b>seaplane</b> is of little consequence but that it may be of greater importance in the case of more moderately powered flying boats...|$|E

25|$|In November 1940 Honningsv√•g {{was sent}} on a rescue {{mission to the}} Norwegian Arctic island of Jan Mayen to {{retrieve}} the shipwrecked crew of the Fridtjof Nansen, the latter ship having hit an uncharted underwater reef off the island's southern coast and sunk on 8 November. The crew of the Fridtjof Nansen had managed to abandon ship in lifeboats and land at the nearby Egg√∏ya peninsula on Jan Mayen, from where they were {{picked up by the}} Honningsv√•g on 12 November and brought back to Iceland. April 1941 saw Honningsv√•g return to Jan Mayen in order to re-establish the weather station on the small volcanic island. Honningsv√•g and the other vessels of the Iceland Group returned regularly to Jan Mayen with replacement crews and supplies throughout the war. During the visit the crew of Honningsv√•g spotted the remnants of two German Heinkel He 115 seaplanes that had been wrecked during a failed October 1940 attempt at establishing a <b>floating</b> <b>seaplane</b> base off the island to provide for meteorological operations.|$|R
50|$|These {{carriers}} had hangars {{for storing}} {{and maintaining the}} aircraft, but no flight deck as in a true aircraft carrier. Instead, they used cranes to lower the aircraft into the sea for takeoff and to recover them after landing. The ships were normally converted merchant vessels rather than specially constructed for the task. As aircraft improved, the problems of using seaplanes became more of a handicap. The aircraft could only be operated in a smooth sea and the ship had to stop for launching or recovery, both of which took around 20 minutes. The tender was often stationed 10 mi or so {{in front of the}} main battle fleet with the cruiser screen so that it would not fall hopelessly behind when it launched its aircraft. Seaplanes also had poorer performance than other aircraft because of the drag and weight of the <b>floats.</b> <b>Seaplane</b> tenders had largely been superseded by aircraft carriers in the battle fleet {{by the end of the}} First World War, although aircraft were still of minor importance compared to the firepower of naval artillery.|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 1915 U-12 left Zeebrugge {{transporting}} a Friedrichshafen FF.29 seaplane on its deck. Once {{beyond the}} safety of the breakwater, the captain realised that the heavy swell might swamp the aircraft and ordered the immediate launch of the seaplane. Forstmann flooded the sub's forward tanks and Arnauld <b>floated</b> the <b>seaplane</b> off the deck and took off from the sea. The German plane flew along the English coastline undetected and returned safely to Zeebrugge.|$|R

50|$|Seeking {{to avoid}} the {{aerodynamic}} drag induced by <b>floats</b> in <b>seaplanes</b> of floatplane design, Ing Giovanni Pegna of the Piaggio company designed a very unusual seaplane to represent Italy in the 1929 Schneider Trophy race. A cantilever shoulder-wing monoplane, known both as the Piaggio P.7 and the Piaggio-Pegna P.c.7, his design floated up to its wings on its long, slender, watertight fuselage with the wings resting on the water, and employed twin high-incidence hydrofoils to get itself off the water during takeoff runs.|$|R
50|$|Many British {{naval vessels}} carried <b>float</b> planes, <b>seaplanes</b> or {{amphibians}} for reconnaissance and spotting: {{two to four}} on battleships or battlecruisers and one on cruisers. The aircraft, a Fairey Seafox or later a Supermarine Walrus, were catapult-launched, and landed on the sea alongside for recovery by crane. Several submarine aircraft carriers were built by Japan, each carrying one floatplane, which did not prove effective in war. The French Navy built one large submarine, the Surcouf which also carried one floatplane, and was also not effective in war.|$|R
40|$|Large {{models of}} the Mark V and Mark VI floats used for single <b>float</b> <b>seaplanes</b> (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) models 41 -A and 41 -B, respectively) were tested in the NACA tank to provide general test data for typical single floats and a basis for {{possible}} improvements of their form. The resistance of model 41 -B was {{greater than that of}} model 41 -A, either when free to trim or at the best trim angle for each. The resistance of model 35 -B (a pointed step hull tested free to trim) was less than either of the models at the hump speed, greater at intermediate planing speeds, and less at the speeds and loads near get-away, although the spray was generally worse owing to the absence of transverse flare. The results of the fixed-trim tests of model 41 -A were cross plotted to obtain data at the angle for zero trimming moment and at the best trim angle. The trims assumed by models 41 -A and 41 -B, when tested free to trim, were found to be excessive at the hump speed. The corresponding trim of model 35 -B was found to be approximately 3 degrees lower because of the lower angle of afterbody keel used in this model, and the maximum hump resistance was 15 percent lower...|$|R
