40|$|In the {{framework}} of REACH Regulation (1907 / 2006 /EC), the assessment of health and environmental risks posed by chemical substitutes of Substances of Very High Concern requires transparent approaches, suitable to provide all stakeholders with the information needed to select safer chemicals and minimize the potential for unintended consequences. A comparative assessment for <b>diarsenic</b> <b>trioxide</b> (As 2 O 3) and proposed chemical alternatives (cerium dioxide CeO 2 and blast furnace slag) in Murano artistic glass production was performed. The assessment followed a structured, stepwise framework including {{a detailed analysis of}} production processes, development of occupational exposure scenarios and comparative assessment of occupational health risks. Several occupational exposure models were compared and the most suitable ones (MEASE, TRAw and ART models) were applied to the selected scenarios. The study concluded that, from the perspective of occupational health risks, the use of CeO 2 together with blast furnace slag represents a safer alternative to As 2 O 3 and, given the correct implementation of Personal Protection Measures, health risks will be controlled for all production phases. The study demonstrated that, due to similar physico-chemical properties of the considered substances, toxicological factors constitutes the main driver of occupational risks, {{and at the same time}} allowed to identify critical issues in the comparative assessment procedure. The proposed approach can guide the evaluation of risks of chemical alternatives with the aim of supporting the decision-making process in the transition towards safer productions...|$|E
