25|$|Section 957 {{deals with}} broker voting and relates to section 951 dealing with {{executive}} compensation.

In addition, the provisions {{in this section}} prevent brokers from voting on any major corporate governance issue {{as determined by the}} SEC including the election of board members.

Johnson received $53 million from the buyout. KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.

40|$|Two {{models that}} attempt to explain the {{adoption}} of <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> are examined. The first model views <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> as an optimal contracting response to a takeover, the other perceives them as an outgrowth of severe managerial entrenchment that results in contracts {{for the benefit of}} managers. Using a sample of 169 successful acquisitions of NYSE targets from 1981 through 1989, I document that targets that have adopted <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> experience significantly higher excess returns around the announcement of a takeover than targets without these contracts. I find similar increased excess returns for the bidder/target portfolios. In addition, bidder excess return is independent of the existence of <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> in targets. Additional results suggest that <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> do not reduce managerial resistance to takeovers. The results are consistent with the managerial entrenchment hypothesis and inconsistent with the optimal contracting hypothesis. Sensitivity tests confirm these results.

We examine the relation between <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> and investment levels in firms that have been successfully acquired. Our results support these three conclusions. First, target firms overinvest prior to an acquisition when <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> are present. Second, the acquirers of targets with <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> reduce investment subsequent to the takeover. Third, the reversal in capital investment by the combined firm is correlated with {{the magnitude of the}} target's pre-acquisition overinvestment.

500|$|Before Culverhouse's death, his wife, Joy, {{had signed}} a post-nuptial {{agreement}} to surrender her half of the estate. This was done {{on the advice of}} lawyer Fred F. Cone, Jr., who would later become one of the three trustees handling the Culverhouse estate. Joy charged that the trustees were mishandling the estate, and not paying her share. She filed a malpractice suit against Cone for advising her to give up her marital rights, and a second suit asking for accounting of the estate and removal of the trustees. She said that Hugh and Cone advised her to sign the agreement for tax reasons, and falsely claimed that Culverhouse was on the brink of bankruptcy. She charged that the three trustees, Cone, Jack Donlan, and Stephen F. Story, paid themselves $4.35 million in bonuses for arranging the Buccaneers' sale, sums far in excess of what Culverhouse himself had specified, and that they paid Story a sum that was comparable to the salary of a Fortune 500 executive for managing the estate and included a 10-year <b>golden</b> <b>parachute</b> clause. She also alleged that the value of Culverhouse's estate had been misrepresented to her at the time that she signed the agreement. The lawsuits made the details of the Culverhouse estate public. When it was discovered that the trust had paid hush money to a mistress of Hugh's, Joy's lawyer alleged that Hugh had planned to divorce Joy, and that the trust was created to deprive her of her rightful assets. Court depositions revealed three extramarital affairs, including Susan Brinkley, wife of broadcaster David Brinkley. The suits were eventually settled, with each of the three trustees being paid $3 million to remove themselves from the handling of his estate, and Joy being allowed to appoint her own trustees. Joy then said of Hugh, [...] "I'd like to pull him out of the grave and shoot him with every bullet I could get".|$|E

2500|$|Section 951 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} {{executive}} compensation. The provisions require the SEC to implement rules that require proxy statements for shareholder meetings {{to include a}} vote for shareholders to approve executive compensation by voting on [...] "say on pay" [...] and [...] "golden parachutes." [...] SEC regulations require that at least once every three years shareholders have a non-binding say-on-pay vote on executive compensation. While shareholder are required to have a say-on-pay vote at least every three years, they can also elect to vote annually, every two years, or every third year. The regulations also require that shareholders have a vote at least every six years to decide how often {{they would like to}} have say-on-pay votes. In addition, companies are required to disclose any <b>golden</b> <b>parachute</b> compensation that may be paid out to executives {{in the case of a}} merger, acquisition, or sale of major assets. Proxy statements must also give shareholders the chance to cast a non-binding vote to approve <b>golden</b> <b>parachute</b> policies. Although these votes are non-binding and do not take precedence over the decisions of the board, failure to give the results of votes due consideration can cause negative shareholder reactions. Regulations covering these requirements were implemented in January 2011 and took effect in April 2011.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes,</b> CEOs often negotiate for personal side payments {{in connection with}} the sale of their firms. Side payments differ from <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> in that they are negotiated ex post in connection with a specific acquisition proposal, whereas <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> are part of the executive’s employment agreement negotiated when she is hired. While side payments may benefit shareholders by countering managerial resistance to an efficient sale, they {{can also be used to}} redistribute merger proceeds to management. This Article highlights an overlooked distinction between pre-merger <b>golden</b> <b>parachutes</b> and merger side payments. Similar to a legislative rider attached to a popular bill, management can bundle a side payment with an acquisition that is desired by target shareholders. Thus, even if shareholders would not have approved the side payment for purposes of ex ante incentives, they may support the payment as part of a take-it-orleave-it merger vote. Because side payments are bundled into merger transactions, voting rights cannot adequately protect shareholders against rent extraction. My analysis helps explain empirical results, which show that target CEOs sometimes bargain away shareholder returns in exchange for personal side payments. I conclude with legal reforms to help unbundle side payments from the broader merger vote...|$|R
