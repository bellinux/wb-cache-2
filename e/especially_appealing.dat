The Islamic texts describes life for its immortal inhabitants as: one that is happy—without hurt, sorrow, fear or shame—where every wish is fulfilled. Traditions relate that inhabitants will be of the same age (33 years), and of the same standing. Their life is one of bliss including wearing sumptuous robes, bracelets and perfumes as they partake in exquisite banquets served in priceless vessels by immortal youths (Houri), as they recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones.|$|E
2500|$|Off Beat {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by readers. It has received praise for its unique style {{of art and}} humour, slow unraveling plot, and {{has been described as}} [...] "a wildly imaginative romantic drama, filled with all the hopes, dreams and anxiety of a teenager {{trying to make sense of}} his place in the world." [...] Readers find Off Beats setting <b>especially</b> <b>appealing,</b> feeling that Quick has effectively crafted a [...] "pure U.S. city" [...] which has lent itself to a distinct American characterization despite influences from conventional modes of Japanese manga. Conversely, a minority of critics has dismissed these aspects as disorienting when compared to other manga, but nonetheless find redeeming qualities in the story and character development.|$|E

The concept of [...] "mestizo" [...] or mixed indigenous European heritage became important to Mexico's identity by the time of Independence, but Chiapas has kept its indigenous identity to the present day. Since the 1970s, this has been supported by the Mexican government as it has shifted from cultural policies that favor a [...] "multicultural" [...] identity for the country. One major exception to the separatist, indigenous identity has been the case of the Chiapa people, from whom the state's name comes, who have mostly been assimilated and intermarried into the mestizo population.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{low point}} of 2.5 million {{passengers}} in 1990, the extensive investments in the national heavy rail infrastructure {{beginning in the early}} to mid-1990s made train travel more <b>appealing,</b> <b>especially</b> given the ever-increasing road congestion, and consequently passenger rail use began rising rapidly—by a factor of about fivefold over any given ten-year span during the 1990s and 2000s. Consequently, in the 25-year span between 1990 and 2015, heavy rail passenger traffic grew over 20-times. Moreover, with several large-scale railway infrastructure projects still underway and more planned in the future, the growth in passenger numbers is expected to continue.|$|R

40|$|Gaussian random field (GRF) {{conditional}} simulation is a {{key ingredient}} in many spatial statistics problems for computing Monte-Carlo estimators and quantifying uncertainties on non-linear functionals of GRFs conditional on data. Conditional simulations are known to often be computer intensive, <b>especially</b> when <b>appealing</b> to matrix decomposition approaches {{with a large number}} of simulation points. This work studies settings where conditioning observations are assimilated batch sequentially, with one point or a batch of points at each stage. Assuming that conditional simulations have been performed at a previous stage, the goal is to take advantage of already available sample paths and by-products to produce updated conditional simulations at mini- mal cost. Explicit formulae are provided, which allow updating an ensemble of sample paths conditioned on n ≥ 0 observations to an ensemble conditioned on n + q observations, for arbitrary q ≥ 1. Compared to direct approaches, the proposed formulae proveto substantially reduce computational complexity. Moreover, these formulae explicitly exhibit how the q new observations are updating the old sample paths. Detailed complexity calculations highlighting the benefits of this approach with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms are provided and are complemented by numerical experiments...|$|R

40|$|As Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) {{scale to}} tens or {{hundreds}} of nodes, the interconnect becomes {{a significant factor in}} cost, energy consumption and performance. Recent work has explored many de-sign tradeoffs for networks-on-chip (NoCs) with novel router archi-tectures to reduce hardware cost. In particular, recent work proposes bufferless deflection routing to eliminate router buffers. The high cost of buffers makes this choice potentially <b>appealing,</b> <b>especially</b> for low-to-medium network loads. However, current bufferless designs usually add complexity to control logic. Deflection routing introduces a sequential dependence in port allocation, yielding a slow critical path. Explicit mechanisms are required for livelock freedom due to the non-minimal nature of deflection. Finally, deflection routing can fragment packets, and the reassembly buffers require large worst-case sizing to avoid deadlock...|$|R
