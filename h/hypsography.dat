50|$|There are {{different}} processes and GIS functionalities {{that are used}} in archaeological research. Intrasite spatial analysis or distributional analysis of the information on the site helps in understanding the formation, process of change and in documentation of the site. This leads to research, analysis and conclusions. The old methods utilized for this provide limited exposure to the site and provide only a small picture of patterns over broad spaces. Predictive modeling is used through data acquisition like that of hydrography and <b>hypsography</b> to develop models along with archaeological data for better analysis. Point data in GIS is used to focus on point locations and to analyze trends in data sets or to interpolate scattered points. Density mapping is done for the analysis of location trends and interpolation is done to aid surface findings through the creation of surfaces through point data and is used to find occupied levels in a site. Aerial data is more commonly used. It focuses on the landscape and the region and helps interpret archaeological sites in their context and settings. Aerial data is analyzed through predictive modeling which is used to predict location of sites and material in a region. It is based on the available knowledge, method of prediction and on the actual results. This is used primarily in cultural resource management.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVenus is {{physically}} similar to Earth {{but with no}} oceans and a hot dense atmosphere. Its near-random distribution of impact craters led to the inferences of episodic global resurfacing and a stagnant lid regime, and imply {{that it is not}} currently able to lose proportionately as much heat as Earth. This paper shows that a CO 2 -induced asthenosphere and decoupling of the mantle lid from the crust, caused by the elevated surface temperature, enables lid rejuvenation. Global <b>hypsography</b> implies a rate of 4 · 0 ± 0 · 5 km²a− 1 and an implied heat loss rate of 32 · 8 ± 3 · 6 TW, ~ 90 % of a scaled Earth-like rate of heat loss of 36 TW. Estimates of the rate of lid rejuvenation by plume activity – 0 · 07 to 0 · 09 km²a− 1 – imply that ten times the number of observed plumes are required to equal this rate of heat loss. However, lid rejuvenation by convection allows Venus to maintain a stable tectonic regime, with subcrustal horizontal extension (half-spreading) rates of between 25 and 50 mma− 1 determined from fits to topographic profiles across the principal rift systems. While the surface is largely detached from these processes, the association of rifting and other processes does imply that Venus is geologically active at the present day...|$|E
40|$|The lithological {{homogeneous}} {{units of}} the Quaternary, which have been exposed in an excavation at Meetkerke (51 ° 13 ' 32 " N, 3 ° 09 ' 43 " E) near the limit of the coastal area, have been described in detail. The primary and secundary sedimentary structures have been carefully examined. The genetical and paleoclimatological interpretation of the lithological features and the interfaces has led to distinguish four lithostratigraphic units. These units do not always present a uniform lithotype but sometimes form a complex of syngenetical and synsedimentary facies. The chronostratigraphical interpretation is based upon paleoclimate indications, the <b>hypsography</b> of the marine deposits, and radiocarbon datings. The lowest unit, the formation of Meetkerke, is a tidal-flat deposit with sandy, loamy and clayey facies. The tabular sedimentation indicates a discontinuous transgressive trend. The aggradation has been interrupted by desiccation phases. The deposits contain zones with bivalves in living position and zones which have been intensely bioturbated. The overlying formation of Stalhille is formed by shell bearing sandy deposits of a beach barrier along a coast with a strong residual westward current. The fossils are partly penebiocoenotical, but for the largest part reworked from the underlying, even Tertiary strata. The formation of the Lage Moere is not very well developed at Meetkerke covering the preceding formation only locally. It is formed by sandy material which has been hydrocryostatically expulsed from a mollisol {{in the formation of}} Stalhille. The uppermost formation of Sint-Andries is composed of fine sands of niveoeolian and niveofluvial origin. During the Middle Holocene the Soil of Varsenare developed on its surface. The Subboreal peat of Nieuwmunster has been removed. The stratigraphic column shows an important gap between the formation of Stalhille and that of Sint-Andries. The formations of Meetkerke and Stalhille have been deposited during a period in which the sea stood at a high level. The presence of cryoturbations suggests a pre-Holocene, interstadial or interglacial, age. Since there is no sufficient evidence for an intra-Weichselian sea level that reached the present zero, the fossil content, the <b>hypsography,</b> and the paleoclimatic succession point to an Eemian age for both formations. Since this area has not been affected by tectonic movements the sea has reached the level of + 1 m Z. 0. The geochronological interpretation does not agree with some of the radiocarbon datings on marine shells in living position of these formations. In the upper part the shells indicate an age of 21000 to 17000 BP., which is probably caused by contamination. The shells of the lower part on the contrary show ages which do not contradict the preceding interpretation. The formations of the Lage Moere and Sint-Andries are Weichselian periglacial deposits. There is no direct evidence for a more detailed stratigraphical identification although same indications exist for assuming a Late Weichselian age for the formation of Sint-Andries.

In September 2007, an inert tracer gas (CF 3 SF 5) was injected at approximately 200 m depth in the Gotland Basin, and the subsequent spreading of the tracer was observed during six surveys until February 2009. These data describe the diapycnal and lateral mixing during a stagnation period without any significant deep water renewal due to inflow events. As {{one of the main}} results, vertical mixing rates were found to dramatically increase after the tracer had reached the lateral boundaries of the basin, suggesting boundary mixing as the key process for basin-scale vertical mixing. Basin-scale vertical diffusivities were of the order of 10 − 5 m 2 s− 1 (about 1 order of magnitude larger than interior diffusivities) with evidence for a seasonal and vertical variability. In contrast to tracer experiments in the open ocean, the basin geometry (<b>hypsography)</b> was found to have a crucial impact on the vertical tracer spreading. The e-folding time scale for deep water renewal due to mixing was slightly less than 2 years, the time scale for the lateral homogenization of the tracer patch was of the order of a few months.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Soil and atmospheric sciences. Land characterization and classification is central to sound natural resource management. Forest land classifications usually lack sufficient detail, are not scale-adjustable, and are limited in scope and applications for the spectrum of relevant management decisions. Two alternatives for forest land classification have been proposed: a multifactor ecological land classification system (ECS) and a soil survey approach that is more geomorphic-based, comprehensive and forestry oriented than traditional classifications. Landforms influence important site factors, are easily observable features, and are relatively stabile in the landscape, so are a logical base for land classification systems. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used with Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) to produce Digital Terrain Models (DTM's) in the Missouri Ozarks. Terrain models produced from several DEM sources were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting slope, aspect and landforms on a 3691 ha area. The DEM's created from USGS <b>hypsography</b> were most accurate. Slope classes were correctly identified in 71. 6 % and aspect classes in 84. 6 % of observations.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the ecological effects of sea-level rise on shorezone in the Neuse River estuary and western Pamlico Sound, NC. Shorezone is defined here in an ecohydrological context {{as the area}} of wetland that extends from an estuarine shoreline landward to where the hydrologic influence of sea level diminishes and terrestrial hydrology dominates. The thesis is structured into three chapters, each highlighting a particular scale of analysis (e. g., landscape, shorezone, and plant community). 	  	At the landscape scale, the first chapter investigates geomorphology, <b>hypsography,</b> wetland types, and average landscape slope of successive interstream divide units that are submerging relative to rising sea level. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to identify differences between units and translate them into a space-for-time framework consisting of four temporal stages of shorezone transgression: early - upstream migration, intermediate - non-migration, late - over-flat migration, and terminal - non-migration. The framework is intended to provide {{a better understanding of}} processes that have led to the current position of shorezones and to anticipate where effects of rising sea level will be the greatest.   	In the second chapter, species composition and abundance, soil properties and elevation were analyzed at a plant community scale. Communities were arranged into a hierarchical classification according to hydrogeomorphic wetland type (landscape scale), followed by cover type (shorezone scale), and then community type (plant community scale). A detrended correspondence analysis ordination was performed to analyze samples across an apparent salinity gradient. Analyses revealed a strong relationship between soil porewater salinity and the sequence and distance at which plant communities occur between the shoreline and the landward margin of shorezone. The results suggest that these irregularly flooded shorezones simultaneously exhibit mosaic and zonal patterns of vegetation.   	At the shorezone scale, changes in cover type over time were estimated for an interstream divide unit in the outer estuary. Cover type classes were ranked to detect the extent, direction (e. g., landward vs. seaward migration), and magnitude (e. g., differences in rank) of vegetation change between 1958 and 1998 using the GIS to analyze aerial photographs. Results show that seaward migration of cover types (517 ha) is more than twice that of landward migration (234 ha). This occurs in spite of an estimated 249 ha landward expansion of shorezone (i. e., transgression) caused by an approximate 15 cm rise in local sea level over the 40 yr study period. This information suggests that at shorter temporal scales, landward migration of shorezone vegetation is not aligned with sea-level rise.   M. S...|$|E
40|$|The {{troposphere}} {{ranges from}} ground level to about 40 km in altitude. When GPS signal transmit {{from the atmosphere}} to receiver, the signal transmission delay caused by the troposphere can be about 2. 3 m at the zenith and about 20 ~ 25 m at lower receiver-to-satellite elevation angles such as 10 degrees. So the troposphere delay {{is one of the}} major error sources in GPS /GNSS satellite navigation. For the purposed of application, the character of zenith troposphere delay(ZTD) in the region of China, the evaluate of precision about Hopfield、Saastamoinen and EGNOS tropospheric delay correction model are studied, and the local models of tropospheric delay correction of Chinese S/C tracking station is built in these thesis. The main contents of this thesis as followings: 1 In order to study the ZTD of the region of China, the data of 30 stations from 1999 to 2004 obtained from Crustal Motion Observation Network of China(CMONC) are used. The annual, seasonal, monthly, diurnal and the distribution variations are discussed. The studies show that there is a very strong annual variation, the character of which(the swing and the average) is relate to the latitude and height of stations.; seasonal variation is obviously which is max in summer and min in winter; Through the study of monthly average, the ZTD in the south is bigger than in the north and it in the east is bigger than in the west(the major reason is the <b>hypsography</b> of the west is higher than east); The system differences between the day and the night isn’t obviously. 2 We evaluate the precision about Hopfield、Saastamoinen and EGNOS tropospheric delay correction model using the data of ZTD and meteorology obtained from IGS. The results show that if there is meteorological data, the precision of Saastamoinen model is highest; The precision of EGNOS model is as well as it of Hopfield model and Saastamoinen model. But if there isn’t meteorological data (standard meteorological data), the precision of EGNOS model is better than Hopfield model and Saastamoinen model. So EGNOS model is a good choice if there isn’t real time meteorological data. We also first discovered that the problem of Hopfield model: it isn’t suitable to be used to correct the 3 Because of the need of the EC- 1,,we build a forecasting model on the basis of EGNOS model with the data obtained from COMOC. And then a real-time model is built on the basis of the forecasting model. The newly established model have been successfully tested and confirmed in ESA lunar orbit SMART- 1 VLBI observation experiments. 中性大气层是指从地面向上大约到 40 范围内的大气层，它可以分成低部的对流层和以上的平流层，有时也统称对流层。GPS卫星信号经过地球的大气层传播至地基GPS接收机时，受到中性大气折射的影响，产生时延和路径弯曲，由此造成信号的传播延迟。天顶方向的中性大气延迟约为 2. 3 ，当高度角为 10 度时，此延迟将增加至约 20 ~ 25 。中性大气延迟是高精度GPS/GNSS定位中误差源之一。本文从实际应用的角度，分析了中国地区天顶延迟变化特征，比较了目前应用较多的几个对流层延迟改正模型的精度和适用性，并由此建立中国VLBI站的单站对流层延迟改正模型。 本论文主要研究内容是： 1. 为了研究中国地区上空的对流层天顶延迟的情况，我们利用地壳运动监测网络 1999 ～ 2004 年中国 30 个GPS基准站的天顶延迟，进行了中国地区天顶延迟变化特性分析；其中包括年变化、季节变化，月变化、日变化和区域分布的统计分析。结果表明，天顶延迟变化有很强的周年性，其年变化特性(如周年变化的振幅，年均值) 与台站的纬度和高程相关。天顶延迟在不同季节之间的变化也比较明显，夏季达到最大值，冬季达最小值；通过天顶延迟月平均值的分析，发现中国天顶延迟南部大于北部，东部大于西部（其主要原因是，我国西部的地势高于东部，东部湿度大于西部）；天顶延迟白天与晚上差值无明显的系统偏差。 2. 利用IGS提供的 2003 年的天顶延迟和实测气象数据，对目前国际上用的几个天顶延迟模型进行了精度和适用程度的评估，包括气象数据的Hopfield模型和Saastamoinen模型(实测气象参数和标准气象参数两种情况) 以及不需要实测气象参数的EGNOS模型。通过比较分析，结果表明，对实测气象数据，Saastamoinen模型精度最高；EGNOS模型与Hopfield模型基本相当，它们与Saastamoinen模型差别并不显著。而在没有实测气象数据（即用标准气象数据）的情况下，EGNOS模型的精度优于Hopfield和Saastamoinen模型。在实际应用中，对没有实测气象数据，又要获得具有一定精度的对流层延迟改正的情况，采用EGNOS模型应是较好的选择。通过比较分析，发现了Hopfiled模型存在的问题：不适用于高度较高的测站高精度天顶延迟的改正。 3. 针对探月工程任务大气延迟改正的需求，利用地壳运动网多年的GPS天顶延迟值，并参照EGNOS模型建立了中国VLBI站的预报模型，并在预报模型基础上利用实测气象数据建立了实时模型。在 2006 年夏季的观测实验中，预报模型已经被用于观测任务中，满足工程任务的要求...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{of climate change}} has had widespread impacts on the climatic and ecological setup of the globe ranging from rapid melting of polar ice caps to startling changes in weather patterns around the planet. From a hydrological standpoint, climate change has had a pronounced impacts on precipitation patterns which has posed a mammoth challenge for the water dependent infrastructures such as domestic water supply systems, storm water drainage systems and the hydropower industries across the globe. This project aims to add and to strengthen the findings of previous works {{carried out in the}} fields of flood frequency analysis and hydrological regimes in a future climatic setup in central Norway. Discerning the future flood patterns in select catchments of central Norway can provide valuable information and insight for decision makers and planners to evaluate and if necessary, modify the existing design of key protective infrastructures such dams, culverts and storm water drainage systems. Furthermore, the findings of the project could help hydropower planners in designing modifications to the existing reservoir operation and power production schemes to cope with the changes imparted to the natural hydrological regime by climate change. Also, the project aims to work towards discerning possible changes to flow regimes in the region which can validate and also strengthen the findings of earlier works. The project aims at understanding the changes imparted to the natural hydrological regimes in select catchments of central Norway such as Hagabru, Krinsvatn and Svartjonbekken. The chosen catchments represent variability in size, <b>hypsography</b> and distance from the coast and these parameters greatly influence the hydrological regime features of these catchments such as precipitation pattern, snow melt features, seasonality and also influence flow response characteristics. Upon investigation of the retrieved historical observed discharge time series for these catchments, it was evident that climate change impacts on the annual natural flow regime were already observable. Further, the process of hydrological model calibration for these catchments provided an insight into the complexities in model calibration for the purpose of flood frequency analysis as the project findings showed that a hydrological model calibrated to obtain a general good fit for water balance underperformed when employed for the purpose of flood frequency analysis and vice-versa. The process of climate data downscaling was particularly challenging and initial analysis revealed that the GCM simulated temperature time series exhibited a high degree of correspondence with the observed temperature time series. But, the GCM simulated precipitation data had a poor correspondence with the observed data which necessitated implementation of a downscaling technique. A new method of precipitation downscaling was devised termed Antinoise Downscaling which helped correct systematic biases within the GCM simulated precipitation data series. Finally, the calibrated hydrological models for the various catchments were employed to simulate flow regimes in a future time period (2051 - 2099) to get an insight into the possible ramifications to the natural flow regimes in the catchments with the downscaled GCM precipitation and temperature data series as input. The results of the investigation revealed that the stream flow pattern would be strongly influenced with exponential reduction in spring flood peak magnitudes. A more evenly distributed flow volumes were observed and also, significant reduction in the amount of available snow cover was observed. A new methodology was implemented for the purpose of analysis of the changes imparted to the flow regimes termed Flow Regime Modification Indices. Flood frequency analysis was carried out over the historical observation period and also over the future simulation period. The results obtained suggested that the flood magnitudes of respective return periods would be reduced in the future simulation period in all the modeled catchments on an annual basis and also as spring floods...|$|E
