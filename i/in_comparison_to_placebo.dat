40|$|Objective. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of SagaPro, a product derived from Angelica archangelica leaf, on nocturia. Material and methods. Sixty-nine male patients 45 years or older {{with at least two}} nocturnal voids were randomized to receive SagaPro or placebo in a double-blind design for 8 weeks. Voiding diaries were assessed before and after the treatment. Results. The results indicate that SagaPro is safe. The actual number of nocturnal voids (ANV), nocturnal polyuria index (NPi) and nocturnal bladder capacity index (NBC index) decreased in the test population, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the treatment groups. Subsequent subgroup analysis showed that SagaPro significantly reduced the NBC index and nocturnal voids per sleeping hour <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> the <b>placebo</b> <b>in</b> participants with baseline NBC index above 1. 3.

NSAIDs, such as meloxicam, have gastrointestinal side effects, which are due to prostaglandins depletion and topical damage. Seven adult beagle dogs were included in the study.

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} effect of {{estrogen}} on the cognitive function of postmenopausal women through psychometric tests. Methods: Seventy-four postmenopausal women {{were divided into two}} groups: (G 1) estrogen group (n = 34), treated with 2 mg 17 beta-estradiol; (G 2) placebo group (n = 31), treated with inactive substance. All the participants were submitted, before and after treatment, to psychometric tests, Greene's Scale of Climacteric Symptoms and the Hamilton Scale for depression. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t-test. in order to evaluate the degree of improvement of symptoms or depression after estrogen treatment, Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated. Results: A few psychometric tests (immediate and late recall of story, Trailmaking A and B, FAS, Stroop, Bells tests) showed post-intervention improvement, but these were not significant when compared <b>to</b> the <b>placebo</b> group's data. the estrogen group's climacteric symptoms were mitigated <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>placebo's,</b> but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups on the Hamilton Scale.

The FORISCA-UltraRice+NutriRice study was a double-blind, cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Sixteen schools participating in WFP-SMP {{were randomly assigned to}} receive extrusion-fortified rice (UltraRice Original, UltraRice New (URN), or NutriRice) or unfortified rice (placebo) six days a week for six months. Four additional schools not participating in WFP-SMP were randomly selected as controls. A total of 2440 schoolchildren (6 – 16 years old) participated in the biochemical study. Hemoglobin, iron status, estimated using inflammation-adjusted ferritin and transferrin receptors concentrations, and VA status, assessed using inflammation-adjusted retinol-binding protein concentration, were measured at the baseline, as well as at three and six months. Baseline prevalence of anemia, depleted iron stores, tissue iron deficiency, marginal VA status and VA deficiency were 15. 6 %, 1. 4 %, 51. 0 %, 7. 9 %, and 0. 7 %, respectively. The strongest risk factors for anemia were hemoglobinopathy, VA deficiency, and depleted iron stores (all p < 0. 01). After six months, children receiving NutriRice and URN had 4 and 5 times less risk of low VA status, respectively, <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> the <b>placebo</b> group.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to perform an economic evaluation analyzing the treatment with atorvastatin and simvastatin <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>placebo</b> treatment, within the Brazilian Public Healthcare System (SUS) scenario, for patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease; analyzing if the additional cost related to statin treatment is justified by the clinical benefits expected, in terms of cardiovascular event and mortality reduction. MethodsCardiovascular event risk and mortality risk were used as outcomes. Statin efficacy at LDL-c and cardiovascular events levels lowering data was obtained from a systematic review of literature. A decision analytic model was developed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing atorvastatin 10 mg/day and simvastatin 40 mg/day to placebo treatment in patients with dyslipidemia in Brazil. The target population of this study was a hypothetic cohort of men and women with a mean age of 50 years old and high risk of cardiovascular disease. The model includes only direct costs obtained from Ambulatory and Hospital Information System and Price Database of Brazilian Ministry of Health. The comparative cost-effectiveness analysis itself was done through Excel spreadsheets covering a 5 -years time horizon. ResultsThe result shows that atorvastatin 10 mg/day <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>placebo</b> has higher cost with higher effectiveness in the time horizon of 5 years (Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio of R$ 433. 065, 05 per life year gained). In this scenario atorvastatin is not cost effective <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>placebo.</b> The simvastatin 40 mg/day appears to be a strategy with lower cost and higher effectiveness <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>placebo,</b> in the time horizon analyzed (5 years).

ConclusionsThis study is an important tool for public decision makers. The study can be used in the decision process of increasing cardiovascular disease treatment access with budgetary sustainability for Ministry of Health. <b>In</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>placebo,</b> the results show that sinvastatin is a cost saving strategy while atorvastatin is not cost effective...|$|E

These patients were recruited by the use of advertisements placed in the Chiropractic Day Clinic on the Doornfontein Campus and by word of mouth. Any patient volunteering for the study had to meet the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria required the patients to present with asymptomatic cervical facet joint dysfunction at the atlanto-occipital joint complex. They were also to be between the ages of eighteen and thirty five years of age, have 20 / 20 vision as determined by the Near Snellen Chart and have no contra-indication to the chiropractic adjustment.

40|$|In {{addition}} to headache, migraine {{is characterized by}} a series of symptoms that negatively affects {{the quality of life of}} patients. Generally, these are represented by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and osmophobia, with a cumulative percentage of the onset in about 90 % of the patients. From this point of view, menstrually related migraine—a particularly difficult-to-treat form of primary headache—is no different from other forms of migraine. Symptomatic treatment should therefore be evaluated not only in terms of headache relief, but also by considering its effect on these migraine-associated symptoms (MAS). Starting from the data collected in a recently completed multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with almotriptan in menstrually related migraine, an analysis of the effect of this drug on the evolution of MAS was performed.
