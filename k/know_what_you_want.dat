500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, [...] "Ah, I think I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{influenced}} the 1975 disco classic [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] by singer Donna Summer and producer Giorgio Moroder; they duetted [...] "Je t'aime" [...] in a 15-minute version {{for the film}} Thank God It's Friday in 1978. UK jazz rap group Blown released a trip hop version of the song as a single in 1994. In 1998, Sam Taylor-Wood recorded a cover with the Pet Shop Boys for the compilation CD/book [...] "futique" [...] entitled Ambassadors – We Love You, a concept designed to promote collaboration between visual and musical artists. This track was a bonus on the [...] "I Don't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> But I Can't Give It Any More" [...] CD single.|$|E

6000|$|... "There," [...] thought Lodloe, [...] "it is {{just the}} same with a baby as with a horse. Be firm, be decided; it <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> and it will do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do {{you call}} it difficult? It might have been easy, if you had allowed it. You would n't let me be natural. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to make of me. Mr. Brand was the worst." ...|$|R
2500|$|The GayFest pride parade {{closed the}} festival, {{taking place on}} Saturday, 23 May at 17:00. Around 200 to 300 {{participants}} took part. The parade received substantial police protection, and no anti-gay violence was reported. It was more festive than in previous years, with pop music, balloons and giant rainbow flags. Several European officials attended, including MEPs Michael Cashman, Michel Teychenné and Helene Goudin, the Ambassadors of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Sweden, {{the directors of the}} Polish Institute and Goethe Institute in Bucharest, and Boris Dittrich, the LGBT rights director at Human Rights Watch. During the parade, British Ambassador Robin Barnett announced that the United Kingdom supported the gay rights struggle and was pleased at the [...] "fantastic celebration" [...] for diversity taking place in Bucharest. The Dutch Ambassador, Jaap Louis Werner, also held a speech, stating, [...] "We are here to show our solidarity. We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> You want to be treated like normal people with the same protections before the law". Letters of support were received from the French Ambassador to Romania, as well as three openly-LGBT officials from the United Kingdom: Angela Eagle, Ben Bradshaw and Chris Bryant.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Pet Shop Boys {{began to}} work with playwright Jonathan Harvey on a stage musical project. In 1999, many of the tracks {{recorded}} {{ended up on the}} duo's seventh studio album, Nightlife, which included the Top 20 singles [...] "I Don't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> But I Can't Give It Any More" [...] and [...] "New York City Boy", the Top 10 hit [...] "You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk", [...] "Closer to Heaven"—which would later become the title of Pet Shop Boys' musical—as well a duet with Kylie Minogue, [...] "In Denial", about a father coming out to his daughter. Minogue later performed the track live, during her 2005 [...] tour, singing to a pre-recorded Neil Tennant. This {{is not the first time}} that Pet Shop Boys have worked with Minogue: in 1994, they indeed wrote a song for inclusion on her eponymous Kylie Minogue album, called [...] "Falling", which was based on an unreleased remix of [...] "Go West" [...] with new lyrics by Tennant; however, Minogue and her record company did not like the production sound of Pet Shop Boys' demo and asked Farley & Heller to finally produce the track.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} poor old Rivers {{would say to}} <b>you,</b> if he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to do with his}} daughter! Brought up as she has been--to expose her to the {{roughness}} of a colonial life, such as I should hesitate about for your sisters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another mystery revealed!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Now I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> {{with those}} {{gold and silver}} plates that came to you from London.

6000|$|... "He's a plumb buzzard," [...] said Buck. [...] "He won't work, and he's the low- downest passel of inhumanity I ever see. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> {{done with}} him, Ranse, so I {{just let him}} set. That seems to suit him. He's been {{condemned}} to death by the boys a dozen times, but I told 'em maybe you was savin' him for the torture." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{suppose you}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do, {{but it seems}} to me unnecessary. Say, is {{anything}} wrong with you? You seem shaken, somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|James {{grew more}} and more alarmed: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{mentioning}} my name for," [...] he muttered; [...] "you'd better leave the tree alone. It's not your tree!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'How do I {{know who}} you are?' she asked him, carelessly. 'How do I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know my story for? Perhaps you're only trying to get {{something}} out of me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to say, Mamma, {{just as well}} {{as though}} the words were out of your mouth. You want to make me to {{understand}} that George is a black sheep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why do {{you give}} {{yourself}} so much trouble for nought, when you might <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know for the asking? Alone you will never discover the path that leads to your wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say!" [...] he demanded. [...] "Who are <b>you</b> anyway, and <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> think you're doing here? That's what I'd like to <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{with the}} name of the owner of this place? What {{business}} is it of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, boy," [...] {{she said}} sharply, [...] "don't add {{impertinence}} to your wickedness, {{but let me}} <b>know</b> at once <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's an argument," [...] {{admitted}} Dan. [...] "The less {{work you}} can get along with the better, in my opinion. No, Felicity, you needn't say it. I <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to say, so save your breath to cool your porridge. I {{agree with you that}} I never work if I can find anything else to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to say," [...] she answered. And {{she was on}} {{the point}} of adding, [...] "And I know just how you will say it;" [...] but these words she kept back.|$|E

6000|$|Suspicion {{crept into}} the {{protruding}} eyes of the rent collector. He waxed wroth. [...] "Say!" [...] he demanded.

But imagine for one moment that there are no employers, no firms to send your CV to, no interviews to be had – <b>what</b> would <b>you</b> do? How would you forge your own path after graduation?
