40|$|Sub-monolayer {{films of}} layered {{semiconductor}} <b>InSe</b> were grown on MoS 2 substrates by molecular beam epitaxy, {{and the change}} in their growth features with Se/In flux ratio was investigated using scanning tunneling microscope in vacuum. It was found that <b>InSe</b> domains grown at 340 °C have a hexagonal shape when the Se/In ratio is about 17. Detailed images of the hexagonal <b>InSe</b> domains have revealed that adjacent sides of the hexagon have different structures; one is a straight edge {{and the other is}} a disordered edge. When the Se/In ratio was decreased, the disordered edges became predominant, the straight edges disappeared, and the <b>InSe</b> domain became triangular. Contrary, when the Se/In ratio was increased, <b>InSe</b> domains became triangular ones consisting of only straight edges. The growth mechanism of <b>InSe</b> domains is discussed by considering the crystal structure of <b>InSe</b> and the reactivity of each side with incoming atoms. It is suggested that the balance of incorporation rate of In and Se atoms determines the structure of <b>InSe</b> domains...|$|R

It is predicted that the single Se and In vacancies exhibit significantly enhanced chemical activity toward the adsorbates compared with the perfect <b>InSe</b> lattice site, and the Se vacancies have a much higher chemical activity than the In vacancies.

The doping of the various <b>InSe</b> monolayers is discussed by the physisorbed H 2 O. The vacancies show a much higher chemical activity toward O 2 than H 2 O. Although O 2 molecules are still physisorbed on the pristine <b>InSe</b> monolayer, they will be chemisorbed on the defective <b>InSe</b> monolayers.

30|$|Recently, a new member, the <b>InSe</b> monolayer, {{has been}} added to the 2 D materials. Bulk <b>InSe</b> belongs to the family of layered metal chalcogenide {{semiconductors}} and has been intensively studied in the last decades [18 – 22]. Each of its quadruple layers has a hexagonal lattice that effectively consists of four covalently bonded Se–In–In–Se atomic planes. The quadruple layers are stacked together by van der Waals interactions at an interlayer distance around 0.8  nm. The stacking style defines its polytypes such as β, γ, and ε, among which the β and γ ones have direct band gaps. Nevertheless, the single quadruple <b>InSe</b> layer was successfully fabricated only in the last years by the mechanical exfoliation method [23, 24]. Since then, the observed extraordinary high electron mobility and special physical properties of <b>InSe</b> monolayers have triggered extensive study on their possible applications in optoelectronic devices [24 – 26] and electronic devices [27, 28]. For the sake of exploring novel functional properties, theoretical study can also be an efficient approach. Numerical simulations of structural, electric, and magnetic properties of <b>InSe</b> monolayers and their modulation by doping, defect, and, adsorption have been carried out [29 – 38]. The band structures of mono- and few-layer <b>InSe</b> have been carefully studied by density functional theory [29]. The dominant intrinsic defects in <b>InSe</b> monolayer have been figured out [30], and the properties of native defects and substitutional impurities in monolayer <b>InSe</b> have been estimated by calculation of formation and ionization energies [31]. In addition, it has been predicted that substitutional doping of As atoms can transfer <b>InSe</b> monolayer from nonmagnetic semiconductor to magnetic semiconductor/metal or half-semimetal [32]. The thermal conductivity of <b>InSe</b> monolayers can be greatly modulated by their size [33]. However, to our best knowledge, there are few studies on electronic properties of one-dimensional nanoribbons of <b>InSe</b> monolayer up to now.|$|R

50|$|Rikard {{acquired}} his {{elementary and}} high school education in Zagreb. At the same time he received his musical training at the school of the Croatian Music Institute in Zagreb, where he studied violin in the class of Vàclav Huml, piano in the class of Ernest Krauth and theory with Franjo Dugan and Fran Lhotka. Just before matriculation, he started composing, and wrote his first pieces, devoted to the piano: Little Prelude (April 20, 1916) and Andante (August 18, 1916). In the same year, inspired by the verses of the Croatian poet Dragutin Domjanić, Rikard Schwarz composed two solo songs entitled In the Mystic Night and Dead Lake. His early composing activity was brought to a sudden stop by the war and his mobilisation. At that time, Schwarz composed All in Vain (June 17, 1917), another solo song, for soprano and piano, to verses of Vladimir Nazor. On his return from the army in 1918, at his father’s wish, he started a course of chemistry at the Engineering Faculty in Zagreb (1918/1919), soon transferring to the Technical High School in Vienna. The rich musical life of Vienna and the firm belief that he had a musical vocation headed him in the direction of art, however, and in 1919 he enrolled as a full-time student at the Staatsakademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Vienna. In Vienna Rikard attended the lectures of Arnold Schönberg, Alban Berg and Joseph Marx and studied piano with Franz Joseph Moser, as well as conducting at Ludwig Kaiser’s. In the bosom of the then contemporary school of Arnold Schönberg, and tutored by Alban Berg, in his Viennese period, Schwarz composed eight pieces: Sonata for Violin and Piano in C Minor, Variationen und Fugato über ein Menuetto von Mozart für Klavier 2hdg, Fünf Lieder nach Gedichten aus “Arabischen Nächten” von Hans Bethge, String Quartet in B Flat Major, the solo songs Sometimes Happens from a cycle by Rainer Maria Rilke Die frühen Gedichte (1919), Prelude for piano (1921), two choral pieces for Yiddish texts <b>Inser</b> rebenju and Kinder kimt and the orchestral ballad Under the Deck (for baritone and orchestra) after Nazor’s miniature cycle of Galley Slaves. Also {{to be found in the}} Schwarz papers is a fragment of a Lullaby for violin and orchestra, or perhaps piano and the score of a Romantic Symphony composed in Novi Sad in 1938.|$|E

40|$|The two {{dimensional}} atomically layered materials are drawing intense attention in recent years, {{because of their}} special physical properties. Graphene, as a layered material with large charge carrier mobility, has been studied for years. Besides, graphene, large amounts of materials exhibit unique electronic and optical properties. GaSe (Gallium Selenide) and <b>InSe</b> (Indium Selenide) are van der Waals type layered crystal and widely applied {{in the area of}} photo-sensing, photo-voltage, non-linear optics, etc. The atomically layered GaSe and <b>InSe</b> may exhibit unique optical and electrical properties. In this study, GaSe single atomically layered crystal was grown by vapor phase transport method, <b>InSe</b> atomically layered flakes were prepared by mechanical exfoliation method. TEM and SEM were applied to characterize the quality of the crystals. Raman studies revealed the changes of vibration modes as the number of layers varied.

40|$|Indium Selenide (<b>InSe)</b> {{is one of}} atomically layered 2 D {{materials}} attracting broad interests recently, {{because of}} its good optoelectronic properties. Based on the challenges of 2 D optoelectronics, several topics will be covered in this defense, such as trap states and low absorption rate. <b>InSe</b> is selected as a platform to study these topics. The localized states and trap states in <b>InSe</b> system was characterized through low temperature photocurrent measurement to reveal the evolution of band structure and origin of the localized states in few layered <b>InSe.</b> It is found the surface electron orbitals contribute to the localized states.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{properties}} of monolayer indium selenide (<b>InSe)</b> are investigated by using Boltzman transport theory and first-principles calculations {{as a function}} of Fermi energy and crystal orientation. We find that the maximum power factor of p-type (n-type) monolayer <b>InSe</b> can be as large as 0. 049 (0. 043) W/K$^ 2 $m at 300 K in the armchair direction. The excellent thermoelectric performance of monolayer <b>InSe</b> is attributed to both of its Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. The large Seebeck coefficient originates from the moderate (about 2 eV) band gap of monolayer <b>InSe</b> as an indirect gap semiconductor, while its large electrical conductivity is due to its unique two-dimensional density of states (DOS), which consists of an almost constant DOS near the conduction band bottom and a sharp peak near the valence band top.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the properties of III-VI metal chalcogenide semiconductor nanosheets and demonstrates their capability to enhance graphene-based optoelectronics. Strong quantization effects and tunable near-infrared-to-visible (NIR-to-VIS) photoluminescence emission are reported in mechanically exfoliated crystals of gamma-rhombohedral semiconducting <b>InSe</b> at room temperature. The optical properties of <b>InSe</b> nanosheets differ qualitatively from those reported for transition metal dichalcogenides and indicate a crossover from a direct-to-indirect band gap semiconductor when the <b>InSe</b> nanosheet thickness, L, is reduced to a few nanometres, corresponding to the emergence of a ‘Mexican hat’ energy dispersion for the valence band. At low temperature, radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers bound at native donors and acceptors in nominally undoped <b>InSe</b> nanosheets is observed. A two-dimensional hydrogenic model for impurities is used to describe the increase in binding energy with decreasing L and reveals a strong sensitivity of the binding energy on the position of the impurities within the nanolayer. The application of a magnetic field, B, perpendicular to the plane of <b>InSe</b> nanosheets induces a marked change of the observed optical spectrum. A transfer of intensity from a low-to-high energy component at high B corresponds to an indirect-to-direct band gap crossover, which arises from the Landau quantisation of the in-plane carrier motion and crossover between hole cyclotron orbits centred on closed edges of the valence band. High broad-band (NIR-to-VIS) photoresponsivity is achieved in mechanically formed InSe–graphene van der Waals heterostructures, which exploit the broad-band transparency of graphene, the direct bandgap of <b>InSe,</b> and the favourable band line up of n-InSe with graphene.
