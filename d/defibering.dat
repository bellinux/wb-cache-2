40|$|In a {{conventional}} dry grind process, corn is processed to produce ethanol {{and a low}} valued animal food coproduct called distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Approximately 33 % of corn in dry grind ethanol plant becomes DDGS. Due to its high fiber content DDGS has traditionally being sold as ruminant foodstuffs. New fractionation technologies are being implemented to recovery valuable coproducts, reduce amount of DDGS produced and improve fermentation efficiency in conventional dry grind ethanol plants. These technologies include corn fractionation as well as DDGS fractionation. Corn fractionation can be broadly classified as wet and dry technologies. Wet fractionation involves a short soaking of corn followed by milling to recover germ, pericarp fiber and/or endosperm fiber in an aqueous medium prior to fermentation of degermed <b>defibered</b> slurry. In dry fractionation, a dry degerm <b>defiber</b> process is used to separate germ and pericarp fiber prior to fermentation of the endosperm fraction. Both wet and dry processes reduce {{the total amount of}} DDGS produced, increase it protein content and reduce its fiber content. Depending upon the modified process used, the amount of DDGS produced can be reduced by 70 % and its protein content can be increased to 58 %. DDGS fractionation involves sieving and elutriation (aspiration) to separate fiber from DDGS. This process recovers fiber as a coproduct, increases protein and fat content of residual DDGS and reduces the fiber content of residual DDGS. Depending upon the parameters used this process increased protein and fat contents of residual DDGS from 28 to 41 % and 12 to 14 %, respectively. A reduction in fiber content and increase in protein content of DDGS could allow increased use of DDGS as nonruminant foodstuffs...|$|R

40|$|Mimivirus was {{investigated}} by {{atomic force microscopy}} in its native state following serial degradation by lysozyme and bromelain. The 750 -nm diameter virus is coated with a forest of glycosylated protein fibers of lengths about 140. nm with diameters 1. 4. nm. Fibers are capped with distinctive ellipsoidal protein heads of estimated Mr= 25. kDa. The surface fibers {{are attached to the}} particle through a layer of protein covering the capsid, which is in turn composed of the major capsid protein (MCP). The latter is organized as an open network of hexagonal rings with central depressions separated by 14. nm. The virion exhibits an elaborate apparatus at a unique vertex, visible as a star shaped depression on native particles, but on <b>defibered</b> virions as five arms of 50. nm width and 250. nm length rising above the capsid by 20. nm. The apparatus is integrated into the capsid and not applied atop the icosahedral lattice. Prior to DNA release, the arms of the star disengage from the virion and it opens by folding back five adjacent triangular faces. A membrane sac containing the DNA emerges from the capsid in preparation for fusion with a membrane of the host cell. Also observed from disrupted virions were masses of distinctive fibers of diameter about 1. nm, and having a 7 -nm periodicity. These are probably contained within the capsid along with the DNA bearing sac. The fibers were occasionally observed associated with toroidal protein clusters interpreted as processive enzymes modifying the fibers. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Interest in hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is {{increasing}} {{due to the}} development of a new range of industrial applications based on bast fibers. However the variability of bast fiber yield and quality represents an important barrier to further exploitation. Primary and secondary fiber content was examined in two commercial hemp varieties (Fedora 17, Santhica 27) grown under contrasted sowing density and irrigation conditions. Both growing conditions and hemp varieties impact stem tissue architecture with a large effect on the proportion of secondary fibers but not primary fibers. Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy allowed the discrimination of manually-isolated native primary fibers and secondary fibers but did not reveal any clustering according to growing conditions and variety. Infrared data were confirmed by wet chemistry analyses that revealed slight but significant differences between primary and secondary fiber cell wall composition. Infrared spectroscopy of technical fibers obtained after mechanical <b>defibering</b> revealed differences with native primary, but not secondary fibers and also discriminated samples obtained from plants grown under different conditions. Altogether the results suggested that the observed variability of hemp technical fibers could be partially explained by i) differences in secondary fiber production and ii) differential behavior during mechanical <b>defibering</b> resulting in unequal separation of primary and secondary fibers...|$|E

40|$|In {{this quarter}} we {{completed}} low consistency laboratory pulping trials. Pulping results were analyzed {{in terms of}} <b>defibering</b> index or yield and the concentration of free wax. The objective of these trials is to identify pulping conditions that will give higher yield and higher concentration of free wax. The yields from low consistency pulping trials ranged from 90 to 99 % based on 6 -cut laboratory screen rejects. In general, high temperatures (140 - 150 {degree}F) and high pH (9. 5 - 10) conditions resulted in higher yield and the generation of free wax. Factors such as rotor speed and the gap (between the rotor and grate) were not significant in affecting <b>defibering.</b> Generally, the turbidities of filtrates from wax-contaminated pulps increased with increase in temperature and/or pH. The filtrate turbidity indicated the relative concentration of finely dispersed wax that could be removed from pulp dewatered on a 30 {micro}m filter paper. Preliminary experiments were conducted to study flotation conditions necessary for effective removal of wax from pulp. Factors which are important for effective flotation include flotation time, volume of air, surfactant concentration and type, and low temperature. Future plans include additional flotation trials to better optimize conditions. Other contaminant types include pressure sensitive adhesives and hot melts will also be examined.

40|$|The {{disintegration}} of recovered paper {{is the first}} operation {{in the preparation of}} recycled pulp. It is known that the <b>defibering</b> process follows a first order kinetics from which it is possible to obtain the disintegration kinetic constant (KD) by means of different ways. The disintegration constant can be obtained from the Somerville index results (%ISV) and from the dissipated energy per volume unit (SS). The %ISV is related to the quantity of non-defibrated paper, as a measure of the non-disintegrated fiber residual (percentage of flakes), which is expressed in disintegration time units. In this work, disintegration kinetics from recycled coated paper has been evaluated, working at 20 rev/s rotor speed and for different fiber consistency (6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 %). The results showed that the values of experimental disintegration kinetic constant, KD, through the analysis of Somerville index, as function of time, increased with the disintegration consistency. Therefore, as consistency increased, the disintegration time was drastically reduced. The calculation of the disintegration kinetic constant (modeled KD), extracted from the Rayleigh’s dissipation function, showed a good correlation with the experimental values using the evolution of the Somerville index or with the dissipated energy...|$|E

Reducing the particle size from 1. 0 − 5. 0 to 1. 05 − 1. 27 μ increases the degree of filler retention in the paper structure and, therefore, increases the ash content of the paper and decreases twice the content of suspended solids in the water sub grid. It is possible to explain by the filling process in the geteroadagulation mode. The preferred pulp composition is set to obtain paper with high indices (ash content, brightness, absorbency at unilat-eral wetting, breaking length). The pulp should be obtained in the following manner. For maximum preservation of the mechanical strength of the fibers it is advisable to sequentially introduce into the fibrous pulp slurry barium hydroxide at <b>defibering</b> stage (dispersion process), and sodium sulfite at the grinding stage (the process of internal and external fibrillation).

Study level/applicability This case is suitable {{to be used}} in advanced undergraduate, and MBA/MSc. Case overview This case illustrates the challenges related to commercializing an innovative product, the coconut dehusking machine in the Malaysian market. It revolves around the issues pertaining to the pre and post-lunch activities and bottleneck of the coconut dehusking and <b>defibering</b> (CDD) machine which was developed by Md Akhir in July 2003. Md Akhir, the senior research officer at Mechanization and Automation Research Centre, Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI), believed that it was the first coconut dehusker in Malaysia. During 2000, farmers used to dehusk coconut manually, as there was no readily available machine to help them. Thus, Md Akhir felt the necessity to innovate such a machine that could help the farmers to dehusk efficiently in comparatively less effort and time. From 2003 to 2005, he presented his innovation in several national and international exhibitions and received accolades for such innovative product. In 2005, MARDI signed the memorandum of agreement of five years to license the CDD with Phytofolia Sendirian Berhad without having Md Akhir’s consent. Phytofolia was a comparatively new company owned by two entrepreneurs – Azmin Samin and Abd Hamid. During 2007, Phytofolia changed the specification of the CDD without informing to Md Akhir. Furthermore, two machines were sold to a company in Papua New Guinea, but no feedback was sought about the performance of the modified CDD. The price of CDD was set very high and thus the local farmers refused to buy it. In 2009, Hamid left Phytofolia due to disagreement with his business partner. He collaborated with Mr Sigiarno a venture capitalist from Indonesia and offer MARDI RM 200, 000 up-front to buy the IP of the CDD. At the end of the contract, Phytofolia failed to pay the royalty to MARDI and the contract ended in 2010. By seeing the fall of memorandum of agreement, MARDI asked Md Akhir to decide the next step whether to sign new agreement with Phytofolia, to sign agreement with Hamid’s newly formed company Kelapa Gading, to giving up commercialization and provide this machine to the farmers free of cost or to create a start-up company, fabricate and market the CDD.

40|$|The {{amount of}} water {{available}} is usually restricted, {{which leads to a}} situation where a complete understanding of the process, including water circulations and the influence of water components, is essential. The main aim of this thesis was to clarify the possibilities for the efficient use of residual peroxide by means of water circulation rearrangements. Rearranging water circulations and the reduction of water usage may cause new problems, such as metal induced peroxide decomposition that needs to be addressed. This thesis introduces theoretical methods of water circulations to combine two variables; effective utilization of residual peroxide and avoiding manganese in the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. Results are mainly based on laboratory and mill site experiments concerning the utilization of residual peroxide. A simulation model (BALAS) was used to evaluate the manganese contents and residual peroxide doses. It was shown that with optimum recirculation of residual peroxide the brightness can be improved or chemical costs can be decreased. From the scientific perspective, it was also very important to discover that recycled peroxide was more effective pre-bleaching agent compared to fresh peroxide. This can be due to the organic acids i. e. per acetic acid in wash press filtrate that have been formed in alkaline bleaching stage. Even short retention time was adequate and the activation of residual peroxide using sodium hydroxide was not necessary. There are several possibilities for using residual peroxide in practice regarding bleaching. A typical modern mechanical pulping process line consist of <b>defibering,</b> screening, a disc filter, a bleach press, high consistency (HC) peroxide bleaching and a wash press. Furthermore there usually is not a particular medium consistency (MC) pre-bleaching stage that includes additional thickening equipment. The most advisable way to utilize residual peroxide in this kind of process is to recycle the wash press filtrate to the dilution of disc filter pulp (low MC pre-bleaching stage). An arrangement such as this would be beneficial in terms of the reduced convection of manganese to the alkaline bleaching stage. Manganese originates from wood material and will be removed to the water phase already {{in the early stages of}} the process. Recycling residual peroxide prior to the disc filter is not recommended because of low consistencies. Regarding water circulations, the novel point of view is that, it would be beneficial to divide water circulations into two sections and the critical location for the division is the disc filter. Both of these two sections have their own priority. Section one before the disc filter: manganese removal. Section two after the disc filter: brightening of pulp. This division can be carried out if the disc filter pulp is diluted only by wash press filtrate before the MC storage tower. The situation is even better if there is an additional press after the disc filter, which will improve the consistency of the pulp. This has a significant effect on the peroxide concentration in the MC pre-bleaching stage. In terms of manganese content, it is essential to avoid the use of disc filter filtrate in the bleach press and wash press showers. An additional cut-off press would also be beneficial for manganese removal. As a combination of higher initial brightness and lower manganese content, the typical brightness increase varies between approximately 0. 5 and 1 % ISO units after the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. This improvement does not seem to be remarkable, but as it is generally known, the final brightness unit is the most expensive and difficult to achieve. The estimation of cost savings is not unambiguous. For example in GW/TMP mill case 0. 6 % ISO units higher final brightness gave 10 % savings in the costs of bleaching chemicals. With an hypothetical 200 000 ton annual production, this means that the mill could save in the costs of bleaching chemicals more than 400 000 euros per year. In general, it can be said that there were no differences between the behavior of different types of processes (GW, PGW, TMP and BCTMP). The enhancement of recycling gave a similar response in all cases. However, we have to remember that the utilization of residual peroxide in older mills depends a great deal on the process equipment, the {{amount of water}} available and existing pipeline connections. In summary, it can be said that processes are individual and the same solutions cannot be applied to all cases...|$|E
