5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trash,</b> and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

500|$|Other figures {{associated}} with The Simpsons have publicly criticized the episode. In an April 2001 interview, Harry Shearer, {{the voice of}} Principal Skinner, recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trash</b> can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters.

500|$|In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh {{conceived}} the series Phineas and Ferb, {{based on their}} similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. [...] Povenmire spent 14–16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing [...] "It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on." [...] Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: [...] "Usually that means they throw <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trash</b> later," [...] Povenmire recalled. [...] Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, {{on the condition that}} he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now." [...] Shearer has also been vocal about [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] (season nine, 1997) {{one of the most controversial}} episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Principal Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong.

It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience." [...] Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in The Simpsons Ride, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on The Howard Stern Show, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.|$|E
2500|$|Povenmire persisted {{and later}} pitched the series to Nickelodeon, {{where it was}} {{considered}} by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated. Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually [...] "means they throw <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trash</b> later." [...] Disney then surprised him by accepting. Said Povenmire, [...] "Disney {{was the first to}} say, 'Let's see {{if you can do it}} in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can do it for 26 episodes.|$|E
