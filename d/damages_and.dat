5|$|This season had 21 {{tropical}} depressions, 16 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, i.e. {{those that}} rank as Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Fabian, Hurricane Isabel, and Hurricane Juan had their names retired due to the impact caused in Bermuda, the eastern United States, and Nova Scotia respectively. Both Fabian and Juan were the worst hurricanes to hit their respective areas, causing $450 million in <b>damages</b> <b>and</b> 16 fatalities. Hurricane Isabel was the strongest, deadliest, and costliest storm of the season. Isabel peaked as a Category 5 hurricane over the open waters of the Atlantic; however, it weakened to a Category 2 before impacting {{the east coast of}} the United States, causing $3.6 billion in <b>damages</b> <b>and</b> 51 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's close {{proximity}} to the United States resulted in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach.

5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome <b>damages,</b> <b>and</b> that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E

40|$|Renal <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> {{hemolysis}} {{induced by}} malaria {{are associated with}} mortality in adult patients. It has been speculated that oxidative stress condition induced by malaria infection is involved in its pathology. Thus, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of Tinospora crispa stem extract on renal <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> hemolysis during Plasmodium berghei infection. T. crispa stem extract was prepared using hot water method and used for oral treatment in mice. Groups of ICR mice were infected with 1 × 107 parasitized erythrocytes of P. berghei ANKA by intraperitoneal injection and given the extracts (500, 1000, and 2000 [*]mg/kg) twice a day for 4 consecutive days. To assess renal <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> hemolysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and hematocrit (%Hct) levels were then evaluated, respectively. Malaria infection resulted in renal <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> hemolysis as indicated by increasing of BUN and creatinine and decreasing of %Hct, respectively. However, protective effects on renal <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> hemolysis were observed in infected mice treated with these extracts at doses of 1000 and 2000 [*]mg/kg. In conclusion, T. crispa stem extract exerted protective effects on renal <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> hemolysis induced by malaria infection.
