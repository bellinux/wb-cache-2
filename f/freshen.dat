Graham Rix went to Caen on a free transfer.

Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E

40|$|The WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) and {{repeated}} hydrographic data {{were used to}} document overall property changes of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the Australian-Antarctic Basin between the 1990 s and 2000 s. Strong cooling and <b>freshening</b> is observed on isopycnals for layers denser than &gamma;n = 28. 30. Changes in average salinity and potential temperature below this isopycnal correspond to basin-wide warming of 1300 &pm; 200 TW and <b>freshening</b> of 24 &pm; 3 Gt yr− 1 . While <b>freshening</b> {{can be explained by}} <b>freshening</b> of major source waters, i. e., the High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) of the Ross Sea and the dense shelf water formed in the Adélie and George V Land (AGVL) region, extensive warming of the AABW cannot be explained by warming of the source waters. A possible cause of warming of the AABW is a decrease in supply of the Ross Sea Bottom Water (RSBW). Hydrographic profiles between the Drygalski Trough of the Western Ross Sea and 150 &deg; E were analyzed {{in the context of a}} simple advective-diffusive model to assess the causes of the observed changes. The RSBW has also warmed by a larger amount than its source water (the HSSW). The model suggests that the warming of the RSBW observed between the 1970 s and 2000 s can be explained by a 21 &pm; 23 % reduction in transport of the RSBW and an enhancement of the vertical diffusion of heat as a result of a 30 &pm; 7 % weakening of the abyssal stratification. <b>Freshening</b> of the HSSW reduced the salinity and density stratification between the bottom water layer and overlying ambient water. Hence, <b>freshening</b> of the HSSW both directly <b>freshened</b> and indirectly warmed the RSBW by enhancing the vertical mixing. A simple box model suggest that changes in property and volume transport (decrease of 6. 7 % is assumed between the year 1995 and 2005) of the RSBW can explain 51 &pm; 6 % of the warming and 84 &pm; 10 % of the <b>freshening</b> observed in the AABW.

40|$|Both the {{observed}} and simulated time {{series of the}} Labrador Sea surface salinities show a major <b>freshening</b> event since the middles.

This recent event is associated with a large reduction in the overturning rate between the early and latter part of the 1990 s.

25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources <b>freshen</b> the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there must be some other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E

40|$|The Labrador Sea {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), due to the seasonal occurrence of deep convection in this region. Heat loss during mixing is balanced by heat import from the boundaries, while the seasonal <b>freshening</b> {{plays an important}} role in the restratification of the water column. Recent increases in freshwater input to high latitudes through accelerated rates of pack ice and glacial melt, has the potential to affect the convection in the Labrador Sea and therefore the global ocean circulation. It is more important than ever to understand the influence these changes have on the dynamics in the Labrador Sea. Understanding pathways of freshwater fluxes into the region of deep convection and the impact of storms on the mixing in the Labrador Sea will help to predict potential changes in the MOC. To analyse recent changes in freshwater water in the Labrador Sea, an ARGO-based heat and freshwater budget of the Labrador Sea is calculated for 2002 – 2011. Over this time period a <b>freshening</b> of the surface waters (0 – 100 m) is observed. Between the first and second 5 -year period, observations indicate a gain of 40 cm of freshwater to the surface. The surface <b>freshening</b> is comparable to past <b>freshening</b> periods associated with a reduction of deep convection (e. g. the Great Salinity Anomaly). However, the observed surface <b>freshening</b> is offset by subsurface warming and enhanced salinities (100 – 2000 m), distinguishing it from the past <b>freshening</b> periods. To investigate pathways of freshwater fluxes a particle tracking tool is used in a NEMO 1 / 12 o ocean model. Seasonally, two peaks of <b>freshening</b> are observed (in spring and fall), consistent with observations. The <b>freshening</b> is due to the freshwater content of the coastal water along the coast of Greenland and the rate of advection of West Greenland Water. The large year-to-year variability in advection can mainly be attributed to changes in Ekman transport.

The relationship of convection to air-sea fluxes and the character of observed mixed layers in the Labrador Sea are explored by using wintertime hydrographic data from February – March 1997. The greatest number of storms occurred in December 1996 but the strongest winds and highest heat fluxes were observed in February 1997. Analysing storm tracks showed that storms in February 1997 followed more organized tracks extending from the Gulf Stream region to the Irminger Sea where they slowed and deepened. Investigation of the small scale variability within the mixed layers reveals that temperature and salinity intrusions are more common at the base of the mixes layers. During storms there were more non-density compensating intrusions present compared to the periods between storms, and the small scale variability was enhanced near the top of the mixed layers. This study underlines the importance of understanding the mechanisms through which water can reach the basin and potential implications of changes in the storm frequency and tracks under a changing climate...|$|R

We found that the strong <b>freshening</b> observed in the Canada Basin had a negative impact on primary producers {{as a result of the}} deepening of the nitracline and the establishment of a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). In contrast, regions with lower <b>freshening,</b> such as the Chukchi shelf and the marginal ice zone (MIZ) over the Chukchi Borderland, exhibited a shallower nitracline sustaining relatively high primary production and biomass. Our results imply that the predicted increase <b>freshening</b> in future years will likely cause the Arctic deep basin to become more oligotrophic because of weaker surface nutrient renewal from the subsurface ocean, despite higher light penetration...|$|R
500|$|With the {{transfer}} window reopening in January, Danny Wilson's first signing was {{the return of}} former loan player Marcus Williams who agreed a {{two and a half}} year deal. [...] The New Year started disappointingly as the Blades crashed to their first defeat since the beginning of November as they were beaten 3–2 at Carlisle United. Following Danny Wilson being awarded 'League One Manager of the Month' for December, United soon got back to winning ways when they returned to home soil. [...] The team saw off Salisbury City 3–1 in the third round of the FA Cup, the first meeting ever between the two clubs, and then outclassed Yeovil Town a few days later, hitting four without reply including a brace from Lee Williamson and a first ever club goal from captain Michael Doyle. With Danny Wilson looking to <b>freshen</b> up his squad United rewarded four of its younger players with contract extensions, with Erik Tønne and David McAllister set to remain with the club until the summer of 2014, and youth team players Jordan Chapell and Jack Adams agreeing new deals {{until the end of the}} season. In a busy day the club saw the departure of Elian Parrino as his short term deal came to an end, and then allowed McAllister to join League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a months loan, with manager Danny Wilson bemoaning a lack of reserve games under the current system. [...] The following week Wilson continued to overhaul the squad with reserve keeper Mihkel Aksalu leaving the club on mutual terms, but was boosted by 'fans favourite' James Beattie agreeing a deal to remain at Bramall Lane until the end of the season. Meanwhile, back in the league the Blades then continued their fine run of form, completing their second league double of the week, as they hit three without reply away at Bury, but that form deserted them for a top-of-the-table trip to Charlton Athletic where a bad tempered match resulted in both teams being reduced to ten men and a 1–0 loss for United. [...] Seven days later United suffered their first back-to-back defeats of the season as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of Birmingham City. With {{the transfer}} window about to close Bramall Lane was relatively quite on deadline day; Danny Philliskirk was handed an extended deal, and striker Will Hoskins signed on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion until the end of the season, whilst youngster Erik Tønne was allowed to join Yorkshire neighbours York City, also until the end of the season. The club also gave a trial to experienced Scottish defender David Weir with a view to a potential short term contract.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{supplements}} released for the Second edition {{fall into}} a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to <b>freshen</b> up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities. While they undoubtedly did so, giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space, play in a post-apocalyptic Computerless Alpha Complex, or play in a post-post-apocalyptic Alpha Complex in which the Computer battled for control with other factions, many fans felt these new settings ran counter {{to the spirit of}} the game. In particular, many felt the removal of the Computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game, which required that player characters had little freedom, had to appease the demands of the Computer, and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of Alpha Complex society. Second edition supplements can generally be divided into four eras: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to <b>freshen</b> up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players {{spent a lot of time}} last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E
40|$|Using oceanographic {{observations}} and an eddy-resolving ice–ocean coupled model simulation from 1955 to 2004, {{the effects of}} the wind-driven ocean circulation change that occurred in the late 1970 s during multidecadal-scale <b>freshening</b> of the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) at salinity minimum density (; 26. 8 su) were investigated. An analysis of the observations revealed that salinity decreased significantly at the density range of 26. 6 – 26. 8 su in the western subtropical gyre, including the mixed water region (MWR). The temporal variability of the salinity is dominated by the marked change in the late 1970 s. With results similar to the observations, the model, selectively forced by the interannual variability of the wind-driven ocean circulation, simulated significant <b>freshening</b> of the intermediate layer over the subtropical gyre. The significant <b>freshening</b> is related to the increase in southward transport of the Oyashio associated with the intensification of the Aleutian low. Accompanying these changes, the intrusion of fresh and low potential vorticity water, originating in the Okhotsk Sea, to the MWRincreased, and the <b>freshening</b> signal propagated farther southward in the western subtropical gyre during the subsequent 6 yr, crossing the Kuroshio Extension. These results indicate that the multidecadal-scale <b>freshening</b> of the NPIW is partly caused by intensification of the wind-driven cross-gyre transport of the subarctic water to the subtropical gyre...|$|R
