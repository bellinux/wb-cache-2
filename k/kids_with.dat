Tom Mason's (Noah Wyle) son, Matt, tells Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) that his mother died during the attacks and his older brother, Ben, was kidnapped. He then shows her {{a picture of his}} father and oldest brother, Hal (Drew Roy). Matt informs Anne that they are fighting.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Poe {{leaves them}} with their Aunt Josephine, a kindly woman who is {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the <b>kids</b> <b>with</b> him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
5000|$|Home <b>with</b> <b>Kids</b> ( [...] ; pinyin: Jiā yǒu érnǚ), is a sitcom/drama from Mainland China. There are 4 {{series of}} Home <b>with</b> <b>Kids,</b> i.e. Home <b>with</b> <b>Kids</b> 1, Home <b>with</b> <b>Kids</b> 2, Home <b>with</b> <b>Kids</b> 3 and Home <b>with</b> <b>Kids</b> 4, which were {{released}} respectively in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. It {{is considered to}} be an equivalent to Growing Pains, a US sitcom. Unlike most Chinese multi-camera sitcoms, Home <b>With</b> <b>Kids</b> prominently uses child actors as main roles. The series also reunites Song Dandan and Wen Xingyu, who both starred in China's first multi-camera sitcom, I Love My Family.|$|R

Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his <b>kids</b> <b>with</b> Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Word Books, Inc.

These were sold through Christian bookstores and related outlets. Each issue contained several inspirational renderings by Hank Ketcham himself.|$|E

The studio created the design and drew the lines on the tiles, but children painted the tiles in between the lines. The studio made the design rather abstract: the design consists of random shapes on different-colored backgrounds. A ceremony inaugurating the design was held in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 1% of Emergency Department visits for {{children}} are for headache. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. The {{most common type}} of headache seen in pediatric Emergency Rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5%). Other headaches diagnosed in the Emergency Department include post-traumatic headache (20%), headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (a device put into the brain to remove excess CSF and reduce pressure in the brain) (11.5%) and migraine (8.5%). The most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma), brain abscesses, meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. Only 4–6.9% of <b>kids</b> <b>with</b> a headache have a serious cause.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thought that}} the Whiz <b>Kids,</b> <b>with</b> a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come. However, {{it was not to}} be, as the team {{finished}} with a 73–81 record in 1951, and (except for 2nd-place tie in 1964) did not finish higher than third place again until 1975. Their lack of success was partly blamed on Carpenter's unwillingness to integrate his team after winning a pennant with an all-white team. The Phillies were the last National League team to sign a black player, a full 10 years after Jackie Robinson made his debut for the Dodgers. Their competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900.|$|E

500|$|Like many {{of their}} 1970s contemporaries {{including}} Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper, the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery. Drug consumption was rampant; the recording sessions for 1976's Rocks and 1977's Draw the Line were especially noted for their substance indulgence, including heroin. In the words of Bebe Buell, [...] "They [...] were like a gang of <b>kids</b> <b>with</b> their own planes, Porsches, millions of dollars, limitless resources. [...] Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page had control, but these boys did not care. They won the prize, hands down, for the rowdiest rock 'n' roll band in that era. No question." ...|$|E
500|$|Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, [...] "Most of {{the kids}} who come to my shows seem like really imaginative <b>kids</b> <b>with</b> a lot of {{creative}} energy they don't know what to do with" [...] and that metal is [...] "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place". Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as [...] "poseurs" [...] "who pretended {{to be part of the}} subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".|$|E

500|$|Later, in his autobiography, Matlock would {{describe}} the primary impetus for his departure as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten, {{which he described}} as being exacerbated by the rampant inflation of Rotten's ego [...] "once he'd had {{his name in the}} papers" [...] and instigated by McLaren. Lydon would later claim that [...] "God Save the Queen," [...] the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band's second single, had been the final straw: [...] " [...] couldn't handle those kinds of lyrics. He said it declared us fascists." [...] Though the singer could hardly see how anti-royal-ism equated with fascism, he claimed, [...] "Just to get rid of him, I didn't deny it." [...] (The claim was denied by Matlock.) Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out in an effort to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren. Matlock almost immediately formed his own band, Rich <b>Kids,</b> <b>with</b> Midge Ure, Steve New, and Rusty Egan.|$|E
500|$|In August, {{journalist}} Al Aronowitz {{arranged for}} the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were [...] "perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds": Dylan's audience of [...] "college <b>kids</b> <b>with</b> artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style" [...] contrasted with their fans, [...] "veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally {{wrapped up in the}} commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists." [...] Within six months of the meeting, Gould writes, [...] "Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona". Within a year, [...] "the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [...] audience... showing signs of growing up." ...|$|E
500|$|Ludwick {{was drawn}} away in 1997 from Big Bag {{to act in}} the role of Kate in Annie, the 20th Anniversary, the Broadway musical on tour revival of the 1977 Broadway theatre {{production}} of Annie. The Annie, the 20th Anniversary tour spanned the United States and Canada from October 1997 through June 1998, during which time Ludwick gave eight performances per week. The Buffalo News noted that her November 1997 performance as the orphan girl Kate at Buffalo, New York's Shea's Performing Arts Center crafted a personality for the character whose [...] "naturalness [...] that of the original Broadway cast." [...] Characterized at that time as [...] "bright, bubbly and [...] a sparkle wherever she goes," [...] Ludwick additionally made the honor roll in Hillsborough County's program for gifted students in 1998. A year later, Ludwick became a spokesperson for <b>Kids</b> <b>with</b> a Cause, a youth organization based in California dedicated to improving {{the quality of life of}} children who suffer from poverty, lack of education, or health-related issues.|$|E
