Feral cattle were found to represent an ecotype adapted to desert conditions. In comparison with domestic cattle, feral animals lived in small group sizes (1 - 20 animals), had larger home range sizes (<b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of (x) equal to 47 vs. 14 sqkm), traveled longer distances hourly (<b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of (x) equal to 1 vs. 0. 3 km/h) and <b>daily</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of (x) equal to 20 vs. 7 km/day) and used more kinds of habitats than domestic cattle.

A power functional relationships between PM 10 and visibility was found among various regions generally with a good corre-lation (r 2 = 0. 90), especially in Asian SDS source regions. In addition, three SDS occurrence centers, i. e. western China, Mongolia and northern China, were identified with the Mon-golia source contributing more dust to the downwind areas including Korea and Japan than other two sources.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{previous}} studies have documented seasonal variation in suicides globally. We re-assessed the seasonal variation of suicides in Finland and tried to relate it to the seasonal variation in daylength and ambient temperature and in the discrepancy between local time and solar time. Methods The daily data of all suicides from 1969 to 2003 in Finland (N = 43, 393) were available. The calendar year was divided into twelve periods {{according to the length}} of daylight and the routinely changing time difference between sun time and official time. The <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> of suicide mortality was calculated for each of these periods and the 95 % confidence intervals of the <b>daily</b> <b>means</b> were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the <b>means.</b> In addition, <b>daily</b> changes in sunshine hours and mean temperature were compared to the <b>daily</b> <b>means</b> of suicide mortality in two locations during these afore mentioned periods. Results A significant peak of the <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> of suicide mortality occurred in Finland between May 15 th and July 25 th, a period that lies symmetrically around the solstice. Concerning the suicide mortality among men in the northern location (Oulu), the peak was postponed as compared with the southern location (Helsinki). The daily variation in temperature or in sunshine did not have significant association with suicide mortality in these two locations. Conclusions The period with the longest length of the day associated with the increased suicide mortality. Furthermore, since the peak of suicide mortality seems to manifest later during the year in the north, some other physical or biological signals, besides the variation in daylight, may be involved. In order to have novel means for suicide prevention, the assessment of susceptibility to the circadian misalignment might help. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) {{recorded}} continuous seismic data {{over the}} Midcontinent Rift from April 2011 through October 2013. Analysis of {{power spectral density}} (PSD) estimates shows that horizontal noise levels at periods > 20 s vary seasonally and diurnally. During winter, horizontal noise power at many SPREE stations is within 5 dB of nearby Transportable Array (TA) stations. As the ground thaws, SPREE stations in fine-grained material such as silt or clay become noisier due {{to changes in the}} mechanical properties of the soil. During summer, the <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> PSD <b>value</b> of stations in fine-grained material is approximately 10 – 20 dB higher than in the winter, and daytime noise levels are 20 – 30 dB higher than nights. Stations in sandy material also show diurnal variations of 20 – 30 dB during summer, but the <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> PSD <b>value</b> varies no more than 5 – 10 dB during the year. Most neighboring TA stations have relatively constant <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> PSDs, and their horizontal components show summer diurnal variations of 10 – 15 dB. Some very quiet TA stations, such as SPMN, show a 5 – 10 dB increase in horizontal noise power during winter. The timing and amplitude of horizontal noise power variations between 20 and 800 s correlate with variations in atmospheric pressure PSDs. We propose that the grain size and pore water content of the material surrounding a shallow seismic station influences the local response to atmospheric pressure. Stations that must be placed in soft sediments should be installed in sandy, well-drained material to minimize long-period noise generated by atmospheric pressure variations...|$|R

The implications arising from sampling and uncertainties in the observations, the modeled values and their comparison are discussed.

40|$|Estimates of {{temperature}} values {{at a specific}} time of day, from daytime and daily profiles, are needed {{for a number of}} environmental, ecological, agricultural and technical applications, ranging from natural hazards assessments, crop growth forecasting to design of solar energy systems. The initial scope of this research is to investigate the efficiency of data mining techniques in estimating <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> temperature <b>values.</b> For this reason, a number of experiments have been conducted with well-known regression algorithms using temperature data from the city of Patras in Greece. The performance of these algorithms has been evaluated using standard statistical indicators, such as Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Squared Error, etc. Finally, a hybrid data mining technique is proposed {{that can be used to}} predict more accurately the <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> temperature <b>values...</b>|$|R
40|$|Solar energy {{applications}} need global aerosol {{optical depth}} (AOD) information to derive historic surface solar irradiance databases from geostationary meteorological satellites reaching {{back to the}} 1980 ’s. This paper validates the MATCH/DLR model originating in the climate community against AERONET ground measurements. Hourly or <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> AOD model output is evaluated individually for all stations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East – an area highly interesting for solar energy applications being partly dominated by high aerosol loads. Overall, a bias of 0. 02 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0. 23 are found for <b>daily</b> <b>mean</b> AOD <b>values,</b> while the RMSE increases to 0. 28 for hourly <b>mean</b> AOD <b>values.</b> Large differences between various regions and stations are found providing a feedback loop for the aerosol modelling community. The difference in using <b>daily</b> <b>means</b> versus hourly resolved modelling with respect to hourly resolved observations is evaluated. Nowadays stateof- the-art in solar resource assessment relies on monthly turbidity or AOD climatologies while at least hourly resolved irradiance time series are needed by the solar sector. Therefore, the contribution of higher temporally modelled AOD is evaluated...|$|R
