25|$|In its {{edition of}} January 8, 2006, the Swiss {{newspaper}} Sonntagsblick published a document intercepted on November 10 by the Swiss Onyx interception system (similar to the UKUSA's <b>ECHELON</b> <b>system).</b> Purportedly {{sent by the}} Egyptian embassy in London to foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the document states that 23 Iraqi and Afghan citizens were interrogated at Mihail Kogălniceanu base near Constanţa, Romania. According to the same document, similar interrogation centers exist in Bulgaria, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine.|$|E

In particular, Hager documented the US-coordinated <b>ECHELON</b> <b>system,</b> through which the five agencies intercept and process huge volumes of international e-mail, fax and telephone communications. Hager was one of the earliest to write about the secretive ECHELON worldwide electronic spy network. As a result of his book, in 2001 he testified before the European Parliament on his research into the network.|$|E
40|$|Research on lot sizing {{has mostly}} assumed single <b>echelon</b> <b>systems.</b> Even when {{multiple}} <b>echelon</b> <b>systems</b> have been used, capacity constraints are seldom considered. However, in manufacturing capacity constraints {{can lead to}} significant queuing effects. Commonly used lot sizing policies like Lot-For-Lot (LFL) and Period Order Quantity (POQ) do not take these effects into account. This research compares these policies with a Fixed Order Quantity (FOQ) policy, within which lot sizes are based on minimizing estimated lot flowtimes at capacity-constrained machines. Simulation is used to study a small production and distribution network using time-phased planning. Results show that the FOQ policy performs better than both LFL and POQ when inventory levels and delivery performance are of concern...|$|R

2500|$|By the 1990s the <b>ECHELON</b> <b>system</b> could {{intercept}} satellite transmissions, public switched {{telephone network}} (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave.

While some member governments denied the existence of ECHELON, a report by a committee of the European Parliament in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects. The European Parliament stated in its report that the term [...] "ECHELON" [...] occurred in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals-intelligence collection system capable of interception and content-inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data-traffic globally.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Shukla et al (2012) {{proposed}} a signature and index {{to detect and}} measure rogue seasonality in supply chains, but which however, were not effectively validated. The authors have sought to investigate rogue seasonality using control theory and realistic multi <b>echelon</b> <b>systems</b> and rigorously validate these measures, so as to enable their application in practice. Design/methodology/approach – Frequency domain analysis of single echelon and simulated four <b>echelon</b> Beer game <b>system</b> outputs {{are used in the}} investigation, with the simulation incorporating realistic features such as non-linearities from backlogs and batching, hybrid make to order-make to stock ordering system and the shipment variable. Lead time, demand process parameters, ordering parameters and batch size are varied in the simulation to rigorously assess the validity of the index. Findings –The signature based on the cluster profiles of variables, specifically whether the variables cluster together with or away from exogenous demand, was validated. However, a threshold for the proportion of variables that could be clustered with exogenous demand and the system still being classified as exhibiting rogue seasonality, would require to be specified. The index, which is derived by quantifying the cluster profile relationships, was found to be a valid and robust indicator of the intensity of rogue seasonality, and which did not need any adjustments of the kind discussed for the signature. The greater effectiveness of the frequency domain in comparison to time for deriving the signature and index was demonstrated. Practical implications – This work enables speedy assessment of rogue seasonality in supply chains which in turn ensures appropriate and timely action to minimize its adverse consequences. Originality/value – Detailed and specific investigation on rogue seasonality using control theory and Beer game simulation and rigorous validation of the signature and index using these methods...|$|R
