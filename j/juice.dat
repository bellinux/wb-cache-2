5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape <b>juice</b> by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape <b>juice</b> allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape <b>juice</b> producers such as Welch Grape <b>Juice</b> Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape <b>juice</b> nor fruit from the grape.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon <b>juice</b> being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon <b>juice</b> in the plastic containers, using <b>juice</b> from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon <b>juice.</b> Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon <b>juice</b> was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the lemon <b>juice</b> business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon <b>juice</b> in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E
5|$|A lemon drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared {{with the addition of}} lemon <b>juice,</b> triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon <b>juice</b> that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon <b>juice.</b> Some versions are prepared using the <b>juice</b> from Meyer lemons.|$|E

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot <b>juice,</b> while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon <b>juice</b> or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle <b>juice,</b> sauerkraut <b>juice,</b> or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Jif's product launch in 1956, it was marketed with the tagline 'Real lemon <b>juice</b> in a Jif'.

5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon <b>juice.</b> Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon <b>juice.</b> Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the <b>juice</b> was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax <b>juice</b> and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon <b>juice</b> dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E
40|$|Fruit <b>juices</b> {{are popular}} {{worldwide}} with {{children of all}} ages as they are sweet and perceived to be healthful. This in vitro study was sought to measure pH of 10 different fruit <b>juices,</b> to find out possible erosive effects on human dental enamel of 40 extracted sound premolars and also to measure fluoride and trace elements of these <b>juices.</b> The estimation of pH of fruit <b>juices</b> was done by using Systronic upH 362 pH meter. The erosive effects of fruit <b>juices</b> were tested by using polarized light microscope. Orion electrode was used to measure fluoride. The trace elements were estimated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer No. 6501 F. The pH values in different <b>juices</b> were observed at different levels, and pH values of these <b>juices</b> were more acidic than baseline after 24 hours. As the time increased, the erosion effect became more in pineapple; grape and sugarcane <b>juices,</b> and they had more cariogenic trace elements like selenium, iron and manganese. So, these <b>juices</b> were found to be cariogenic. To conclude, orange, mousambi, mango, pomegranate, apple, chikku and watermelon <b>juices</b> had no erosive effect on the human enamel, with the presence of highest amount of trace elements like fluoride and phosphorous which are considered as strongly cariostatic...|$|R

5000|$|Acidic {{drinks and}} foods lower the pH {{level of the}} mouth so {{consuming}} them causes the teeth to demineralise. Drinks low in pH levels that cause dental erosion include fruit <b>juices,</b> sports drinks, wine, beer and carbonated drinks [...] Orange and apple <b>juices</b> are common culprits among fruit <b>juices.</b> Carbonated drinks such as colas, lemonades are also very acidic, as are fruit-flavoured drinks and dilutables.

40|$|Antioxidants are enzymes, non-enzymatic proteins, {{minerals}} micronutrients, vitamins, phenolic compounds, pigments and others. Polyphenols {{have the}} ability to reduce or prevent damage caused by free radicals promoting positive effects on human health due to their antioxidant capacity. In this study we evaluated the content of polyphenols from several commercial biological (n = 6) and conventional <b>juices</b> (n = 6) (orange, blackcurrant, apple, grapes, tomato, carrot, pomegranate, lemon, grapefruit <b>juices)</b> and we determined the antioxidant effect by inhibition of the superoxide anion production measured by chemiluminescence technology. Conventional <b>juices</b> (orange, apple, tomato, pomegranate, lemon, grapefruit <b>juices)</b> showed more total polyphenolics (+ 32 %), more flavan- 3 -ols (+ 67 %) and more flavonols (+ 42 %) than the same biological <b>juices.</b> The presence of anthocyanins was reported in <b>juices</b> made with blackcurrant, pomegranate and grapes only, with values above 50 µg/mL, regardless of their nature. Surprisingly, chemiluminescence results showed an inhibition in superoxide anion production by 51 % for biological <b>juices</b> vs 23 % in conventional ones. The correlation between total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of all the <b>juices</b> was r = 0. 83 (r 2 = 0. 7).
