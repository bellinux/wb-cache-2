40|$|BACKGROUND: Though forced expiratory {{volume in}} the first second (FEV 1) is the primary {{indicator}} of airway obstruction, curvilinearity in the expiratory <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curve</b> is used to support the quantitative assessment of obstruction via FEV 1. Currently there is no available index to quantify a pathological contour of curvilinearity. STUDY PURPOSE: We propose a “curvature” index (kmax) and compare FEV 1 values to the index with a sequential sample of spirometry data. METHODS: The hyperbolic function b 0 ˙Q b 1 ˙QV b 2 V 1 (in which ˙Q flow rate, V volume, and b 0, b 1, and b 2 are estimated from the patient’s flow-volume data) is fit to a fixed segment of the descending phase of the expiratory <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curve.</b> A previously developed biomechanical interpretation of this relationship associates the coefficient b 1 with the rate of airway-resistance-increase as exhaled volume increases. A global curvature index kmax b 1 / 2 (b 0 b 2 b 1) is defined to quantify the curvilinearity phenomenon. We used statistics software to determine the kmax of spirometry data from 67 sequential patients, and to determine the relationship of kmax to FEV 1. RESULTS: Individual kmax estimates appeared to correspond well with the degree of curvilinearity observed and were related in an exponential manner to FEV 1. CONCLUSIONS: We defined a curvature index to quantify the curvilinearity phenomenon observed in the expiratory limb of flow-volume loops from patients with obstructive lung disease. This index uses data from a major segment of the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curve,</b> and our preliminary data indicate an exponential relationship with FEV 1. This new index allows the putative association between curvilinearity and obstructive lung disease to be examined quantitatively in clinical practice and future studies.

Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow, maximal expiratory flow at 50 % and maximal static mouth pressures were significantly below normal values.

Hence {{there is a need}} for a simple and reliable clinical tool to assist in the differentiation of treatment responses. We hypothesized that abnormalities of <b>flow–volume</b> <b>curves,</b> together with other clinical variables, may have clinical utility in the prediction of MAS treatment outcome. Methods: Fifty-four patients with known OSA underwent MAS treatment. Expiratory and inspiratory <b>flow–volume</b> <b>curves</b> were measured in the erect and supine positions to derive midinspiratory flow (MIF₅₀) and the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory flow at 50 % of vital capacity (MEF₅₀:MIF₅₀). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify additional significant clinical variables in the prediction of treatment outcome. Results: The mean (± SD) apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) in 35 responders was significantly reduced from 28. 9 ± 13. 7 to 6. 7 ± 5. 8 /hour (p < 0. 001). In 19 nonresponders there was no significant change in AHI. MIF 50 was lower (6. 04 ± 1. 80 vs. 6. 88 ± 1. 08 L/second; p = 0. 035) and the MEF₅₀:MIF₅₀ ratio was higher (0. 82 ± 0. 23 vs. 0. 61 ± 0. 15; p = 0. 001) in responders than nonresponders. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the MEF₅₀:MIF₅₀ ratio was the most important predictive factor for MAS treatment outcome, but that body mass index, age, and baseline AHI were also contributory.

40|$|Surgery {{patients}} in Japan undergo routine spirometry testing prior to general anesthesia. The {{use of a}} flow sensor during general anesthesia has recently become common. However, it is not certain whether the information derived from <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves</b> is being adequately used for mechanical ventilation management during general anesthesia. So far, {{there have been no}} attempts to calculate airway resistance using <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves.</b> Therefore, we performed a prospective, observational study to investigate the relationship between pre-anesthetic and intra-anesthetic airway resistance in patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia.

We also calculated endotracheal tube resistance to correct the intra-anesthetic airway resistance values calculated. A total of 526 patients were included in the study, and 98 patients had a forced expiratory volume in the first second/forced vital capacity ratio of < 70 %. Pre-anesthetic airway resistance was significantly higher in patients with airflow obstruction than in those without airflow obstruction (p < 0. 001), whereas no significant difference in intra-anesthetic airway resistance was found between patients with and without airflow obstruction during mechanical ventilation (p = 0. 48). Pre-anesthetic and intra-anesthetic airway resistance values were closer to each other in patients without airflow obstruction, with a mean difference < 1. 0 cmH 2 O L- 1 s- 1, than in those with airflow obstruction, although these respiratory parameters were significantly different (p < 0. 001). Intra-anesthetic airway resistance was not related to the FEV 1 /FVC ratio, regardless {{of the degree to which}} the FEV 1 /FVC ratio reflected pre-anesthetic airway resistance.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{model of}} breathing mechanics, {{in which the}} tracheobronchial airways are considered in three serial segments, is presented to obtain insights into the mechanisms underlying expiratory flow limitation (EFL) in mechanically ventilated patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and normal conditions were simulated and EFL was detected by application of negative expiratory pressure at the mouth or resistance reduction of the expiratory circuit. Simulation results confirm that both techniques reveal remarkable differences in the <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves</b> between normal subjects and COPD patients, the former showing absence of EFL and the latter exhibiting EFL {{over most of the}} expiration. To interpret the role of different nonlinear mechanisms in producing EFL, different <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves</b> obtained by changing model parameter values were analyzed. An increase in lower-airway resistance did not give rise to EFL, whereas a change in the pressure-volume characteristic of the intermediate-airway segment, towards increased resistance and easier collapse, significantly modified system behavior. In particular, EFL was observed when this intermediate-segment change was combined with an increase in lower-airway resistance. This evidence suggests that modifications, producing loss of radial traction and consequent narrowing of the airways in the peribronchial region, may play a leading role in EFL in COPD patients...|$|R

The higher differences were observed in the SAO group. In the group with severe COPD, high FVC differences and low flow differences were observed; on the contrary, in the restrictive group, low FVC differences and high flow differences were present.

Maximal expiratory complete <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves</b> and FEV 1 were also obtained along with the partial curves. Flows were measured at 40 % of control vital capacity using the complete (V 40 c) and the partial (V 40 p) curves.

The level of the plateau was the highest for the V 40 p (mean +/- SD = 65 +/- 19 % of baseline), intermediate for V 40 c (45 +/- 22 %), and the lowest for FEV 1 (16 +/- 11 %). There was more than a 100 -fold range in responsiveness expressed as the provocative concentration to cause a 40 % fall of baseline in V 40 p (PC 40); the lower the PC 40, the higher the level of the plateau. All the results were reproducible between the 2 days. We also investigated whether the plateau may have been due to a tachyphylactic effect of cumulative doses of methacholine. The maximal response after increasing concentrations of methacholine up to 256 mg/ml was not different from the response obtained after a single dose of 256 mg/ml.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} intermediate alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency in predisposing to abnormalities of lung distensibility and airway function in 20 heterozygotes (Pi MZ) who were individually matched with a control Pi M subject of similar age, height, and smoking habits drawn from the same male, working population. There {{were no significant differences}} between the heterozygotes and their controls in the results of spirometry, maximum expiratory <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves</b> (breathing air), single breath nitrogen test, arterialised capillary blood oxygen pressure, or single breath carbon monoxide transfer. Additional studies were made in 12 of the pairs of Pi MZ and Pi M subjects. Comparison of maximum expiratory <b>flow-volume</b> <b>curves</b> breathing air and 80 % helium- 20 % oxygen showed no differences between the Pi MZ and Pi M subjects. Although airway function was similar in the two groups, four of 12 Pi MZ subjects showed abnormalities of the pressure-volume curve of the lung (reduction in lung recoil pressure, abnormal shape factor, increase in functional residual capacity). Abnormalities of washout of a helium-sulphur hexafluoride gas mixture, of a type previously described as characteristic of emphysema, were found in two of the men with abnormal pressure-volume curves. The results suggest that Pi MZ subjects have an increased susceptibility to alveolar abnormalities without increased abnormalities of airway function; this may explain the increased frequency of emphysema at necropsy despite many studies showing no predisposition to abnormal airway function in life. The functional changes we observed would be unlikely to cause symptoms. The risk of disablement from chronic lung disease appears to be only slightly enhanced by intermediate alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency...|$|R
