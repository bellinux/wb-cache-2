2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E

30|$|Fixed {{fluidized}} bed reactor {{is a kind}} of {{fluidized bed}} that has no external circulating particles. It usually has only one reactor, by setting a simple filter or cyclone to trap the particles. Fixed fluidized bed reactor has many advantages, such as low cost, high thermal efficiency, isothermal bed temperature and low operation and maintenance cost [1]. Therefore, the fixed fluidized bed reactor is widely used in laboratory studies for operating parameter optimization and catalyst evaluation [2, 3], as well as developing kinetic models [4, 5], especially for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process.

The choice of the process parameters had a large effect on the amount of pellets that were subtracted from the coating process due to the buildup of electrostatic charges on the pellets. Using not too high fluidizing air flows, pellets of larger size, a smaller pellets load and humidified air to fluidize the pellets resulted in more uniform coatings and, consequently, in more favorable release profiles that did not present or presented a reduced initial burst release...|$|R

With {{the patient in}} the right lateral position, lumbar puncture was performed at L 3 - 4 inter-space with a 25 -gauge Quincke needle via a midline approach. Although the click of dural puncture was felt, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could not be tapped in two repeated attempts. The spinal needle was checked for deformation or obstruction by tissue and blood clots, but none were observed. A subsequent was made with a 23 -gauge needle at L 2 - 3 interspace. After removal of the stylet, backflow of CSF was not detected even after aspiration using a 2.0  ml syringe. After discussion, the anesthesiologist decided to proceed with general anesthesia instead, to which the patient also agreed. Subsequent, anesthesia and surgery proceeded uneventfully. On postoperative day one, the patient complained of moderate intensity headache mainly located in the occipital region, and aggravated by sitting posture.

40|$|We {{present some}} {{developments}} {{in the formulation of}} the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) for analysis of complex coupled problems on fluid and solid mechanics in engineering accounting for fluid-structure interaction and coupled thermal effects, material degradation and surface wear. The PFEM uses an updated Lagrangian description to model the motion of nodes (particles) in both the fluid and the structure domains. Nodes are viewed as material points which can freely move and even separate from the main analysis domain representing, for instance, the effect of water drops. A mesh connects the nodes defining the discretized domain where the governing equations are solved, as in the standard FEM. The necessary stabilization for dealing with the incompressibility of the fluid is introduced via the finite calculus (FIC) method. An incremental iterative scheme for the solution of the non linear transient coupled fluid-structure problem is described. The procedure for modelling frictional contact conditions at fluid-solid and solid-solid interfaces via mesh generation are described.

40|$|Low density {{polyethylene}} and polypropylene {{are produced}} at large scale via the Unipol process. In this process catalyst particles are fluidized with monomer gas which reacts with the catalyst particles to form polymeric particles up to a size of 1 mm. The process is typically operated at pressures of 20 to 25 bar. Pressure impacts the hydrodynamics of the fluidized bed as it influences the bubble behaviour, particle mixing and heat transfer characteristics. Despite {{decades of research}} on <b>fluid</b> <b>beds</b> these effects are not completely understood. In order to gain more insight in the effects of operating pressure on the fluidization behaviour we have performed full 3 D discrete particle simulations. We use a state-of-the art discrete particle model (DPM) to simulate fluidization behaviour at different pressures. In our model the gas phase is described by the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, whereas the particles are described by the Newtonian equations of motion. The DPM accurately accounts for the gas-particle interaction, which is necessary for capturing the pressure effect. The simulation results were analysed with spectral analysis of the pressure drop fluctuations {{and analysis of the}} porosity field. In order to study the bubble behaviour, a sophisticated bubble detection algorithm was developed. From this algorithm, gas bubble characteristics, such as bubble velocity and bubble size are obtained. The simulation results show increasing emulsion porosity and decreasing bubble porosity with increasing pressure. In other words, the bubble-emulsion structure becomes less distinct. The determined bubble velocity is very well in accordance with empirical correlations for low pressures, and decreases at elevated pressures...|$|R
40|$|Thermal storage {{improves}} the dispatchability and marketability of parabolic trough power plants {{allowing them to}} produce electricity on demand independent of solar collection. One such thermal storage system, a thermocline, uses a single tank containing a fluid with a thermal gradient running vertically through the tank, where hotter fluid (lower density) {{is at the top}} of the tank and colder fluid is at the base of the tank. The thermal gradient separates the two temperature potentials. A lowcost filler material provides the bulk of the thermal capacitance of the thermal storage, prevents convective mixing, and reduces the amount of fluid required. In this paper, development of a thermocline system that uses molten-nitrate salt as the heat transfer fluid is described and compared to a two-tank molten salt system.
