40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} data-centric wireless sensor network applications. We examine the benefits and costs of caching data for such applications. We propose and evaluate several approaches to querying for, and then caching data in a sensor field data server. We show that for some application requirements (i. e., when delay drives data quality), policies that emulate cache hits by computing and returning approximate values for sensor data yield a simultaneous quality improvement and cost savings. This win-win is because when system delay is sufficiently important, the benefit to both query cost and data quality achieved by using approximate values outweighs the negative impact on quality due to the approximation. In contrast, when data accuracy drives quality, a linear trade-off between query cost and data quality emerges. We also identify caching and lookup policies for which the sensor <b>field</b> <b>query</b> rate is bounded when servicing an arbitrary workload of user queries. This upper bound is achieved by having multiple user queries share {{the cost of a}} sensor <b>field</b> <b>query.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that our results are robust to {{the manner in which the}} environment being monitored changes using two different sensor field models.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{explosive}} growth of sensors and instruments, data-driven stream applications are {{emerging as a}} new <b>field.</b> <b>Query</b> optimization for such high performance stream applications has not been extensively studied, especially its core component, the cost model. We observe that the cost model for stream query processing should consider two aspects: output rate and computation cost. However, most existing work on evaluating stream queries uses only one or the other. In this paper, we propose a multi-model based optimization framework by leveraging both aspects. Further, we extend it from the centralized environment to the distributed environment by introducing distributed metrics and an algorithm for query plan decomposition...|$|E
40|$|Challenging {{issues of}} scale for {{networked}} servers {{arise from the}} number of clients that access each server. This thesis describes techniques for scaling data delivery from a shared-memory multiprocessor networked server to a large number of clients. We implement and explore connection-level parallelism for network protocols running on the server. We show that different implementations are appropriate for sending streaming media when compared with sending conventional data, such as web content. Matching the number of threads to the number of processors in the system yields the best overall performance when sending continuous media. Delivering the desired rate to each connection is accomplished by having threads directly measure their own performance and feed this information to the scheduler. For conventional data, matching the number of threads to the number of connections in the system yields the best aggregate throughput. ^ In wireless sensor networks, challenging issues of scale arise from needing to satisfy a variable and potentially large number of concurrent queries for sensor data. In the second part of this thesis, we examine the benefits and costs of caching data for sensor network-based applications. We propose and evaluate several approaches to querying for, and then caching data in a sensor field data server. We show that for some application requirements (i. e., when delay drives quality-of-service), policies that emulate cache hits by computing and returning approximate values for sensor data yield a simultaneous quality improvement and cost savings. This win-win is because when system delay is sufficiently important, the benefit to both cost and quality achieved by using approximate values outweighs the negative impact on quality due to the approximation.

40|$|This {{review is}} a {{critical}} analysis regarding the study and utilization of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS II) {{as a basis for}} establishing specific criteria for evaluating relevant international scientific literature. The WHODAS II is an instrument developed by the World Health Organisation in order to assess behavioural limitations and restrictions related to an individual’s participation, independent from a medical diagnosis. This instrument was developed by the WHO’s Assessment, Classification and Epidemiology Group {{within the framework of the}} WHO/NIH Joint Project on Assessment and Classification of Disablements. To ascertain the international dissemination level of for WHODAS II’s utilization and, at the same time, analyse the studies regarding the psychometric validation of the WHODAS II translation and adaptation in other languages and geographical contests. Particularly, our goal is to highlight which psychometric features have been investigated, focusing on the factorial structure, the reliability, and the validity of this instrument. International literature was researched through the main data bases of indexed scientific production: the Cambridge Scientific Abstracts – CSA, PubMed, and Google Scholar, from 1990 through to December 2008. The following search terms were used:“whodas”, in the <b>field</b> <b>query,</b> plus “title” and “abstract”. The WHODAS II has been used in 54 studies, of which 51 articles are published in international journals, 2 conference abstracts, and one dissertation abstract. Nevertheless, only 7 articles are published in journals and conference proceedings regarding disability and rehabilitation. Others have been published in medical and psychiatric journals, with the aim of indentifying comorbidity correlations in clinical diagnosis concerning patients with mental illness. Just 8 out of 51 articles have studied the psychometric properties of the WHODAS II. The instruments have been translated into 11 languages and administered to a total of 88, 844 subjects. Finally, the WHODAS II is prevalently used in the medical field, with major emphasis in the specialities of psychiatry, general medicine, and rehabilitation. All studies point out that WHODAS II as an effective and reliable instrument in order to assess the disability, individual functioning and participation levels. Furthermore, they often suggest administering the WHODAS II along with quality of life measures. Finally, the studies about the psychometric properties of the instrument agree in considering the WHODAS II a reliable and valid tool for disability assessment...|$|E

This study proposes to construct and evaluate an interactive IR (IIR) system which incorporates different IR support techniques to adaptively support multiple ISSs. Based on an information-seeking episode model (Belkin, 1996), and a multi-faceted classification scheme of information behaviors (Cool & Belkin, 2002), it was conducted in a series of three consecutive steps. Firstly, four experimental systems were designed and implemented with each tailored to one of the following IR support techniques: database summary, clustered retrieval results, table of contents navigation, and <b>fielded</b> <b>query.</b> A within-subjects experiment was conducted to compare each experimental system to its respective generic baseline system, which was constructed by following the iii current standard model with a specific query input and a ranked list of search results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{assume a}} {{database}} consists of records {{of individuals with}} private or sensitive <b>fields.</b> <b>Queries</b> {{on the distribution of}} a sensitive field within a selected population in the database can be submitted to the data center. The answers to the queries leak private information of individuals though no identification information is provided. Inspired by decision theory, we present a quantitative model for the privacy protection problem in such a database query or linkage environment in this paper. In the model, the value of information is estimated from the viewpoint of the querier. To estimate the value, we define the information state of the data user by a class of probability distributions on the set of possible confidential values. We further define the usefulness of information based on how easy the data user can locate individuals that fit the description given in the queries. These states and the usefulness of information can be modified and refined by the user’s knowledge acquisition actions. The value of information is then defined as the expected gain of the privacy receiver and the privacy is protected by imposing costs on the answers of the queries for balancing the gain...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{assume that}} a {{database}} of personal information comprises records of individuals that contain confidential or sensitive <b>fields.</b> <b>Queries</b> about the distribution of a sensitive field within a selected population in the database can be submitted to the data center. However, {{the answers to the}} queries may leak confidential information about some individuals, even though no identification information is provided. Inspired by decision theory, we present two quantitative models for privacy protection in such a database query or linkage environment. One models the value of information from the viewpoint of the querier, while the other models the damage caused by and compensation for privacy leakage. In both models, we define the information state by a class of probability distributions on a set of possible confidential values. These states can be modified and refined by the user’s knowledge acquisition behavior. In the first model, the value of information is defined as the expected gain of the querier, and privacy is protected by imposing costs on the answers to the queries to balance any potential gain. In the second model, the safety of information is guaranteed by ensuring that anyone misusing private information must pay more compensation than the value of the possible gain...|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} a flurry {{of research in the}} <b>field</b> of <b>query</b> processing for networks of sensors and actuators. It is widely accepted that query processing is the method of choice for acquiring data from a sensor <b>field.</b> Although <b>query</b> processing offers a very good computational model for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring, it is a poor match for application scenarios where a timely response to an event is required by the system. With this in mind, we propose a mature database technology, namely active rules, that provides a natural computational paradigm for sensor network applications that require reactive behavior, such as rapid forest fire response and security management. For the remainder of this paper we will outline the implications of active rules for sensor networks and contrast these against query processing. We will then proceed to discuss work in progress carried out by project Asene (Active SEnsor NEtworks) that aims to address these implications. We conclude by introducing our architecture for a decentralised event broker based on the publish/subscribe paradigm and our early design of an Event-Condition-Action (ECA) language for sensor networks.
