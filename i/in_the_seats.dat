5|$|In the election, {{which took}} place on 1 May 1997, the Referendum Party polled 811,827 votes. This {{represented}} 2.6% of the national total, and the party averaged 3.1% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> which it contested. 42 of the party's candidates gained over 5% of the vote and thus saw the return of their deposits, which were then priced at £500 each; 505 deposits were lost.|$|E
5|$|In late June 2007, reports {{circulated}} {{that the}} park was testing the new Gerstlauer trains. Eyewitnesses reported red and blue trains running on the track with test dummies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> On July 4, 2007, Son of Beast reopened {{for the first time}} since the accident the year before. Despite the lack of the vertical loop, the coaster continued to hold the record as tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world.|$|E

25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> belt {{pre-tensioner}} system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> lower house, Dr Richard Di Natale {{needed a}} 2.4 percent swing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Melbourne to unseat Labor's cabinet {{minister}} Bronwyn Pike, but wasn't successful <b>in</b> taking <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> from her, although he came quite close.

5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E
5|$|When Labor Council Secretary Robert King {{organised}} {{a conference}} of dissident left-wing unions on 1 August 1936, which was attended by Heffron and three other caucus members, Lang summoned a special party conference on 22 August which expelled Heffron, King {{and all the other}} leaders who attended the conference. As a result, Heffron, along with his colleague Carlo Lazzarini and others, formed the Industrial Labor Party (ILP), which was also known as the 'Heffron Labor Party'. Despite their expulsion, Heffron and the new ILP did increasingly well against Lang and the Labor Party, winning two subsequent by-elections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> of Hurstville (won by Clive Evatt) and Waverley (won by Clarrie Martin). In June 1939, three other MPs, Frank Burke (Newtown), Mat Davidson (Cobar) and Ted Horsington (Sturt), unhappy with Lang's leadership joined the ILP. As a result of its success, John Curtin and the federal executive of the ALP pressured the NSW ALP to readmit Heffron and his party at a unity conference at the Majestic Theatre in Newtown on 26 August 1939. Heffron then combined forces with William McKell to depose Lang on 5 September 1939, with McKell becoming the new leader of the party, although he declined to stand for the position of deputy leader.|$|E
25|$|The Transbay Tube {{was closed}} from January 17 to April 4, 1979, after a train caught {{fire in the}} tube, {{injuring}} dozens, killing a fireman, and damaging equipment. Most of the injuries were caused by inhalation of toxic smoke from the burning polyurethane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> leading to a $118,000 replacement program which was completed in November 1980.|$|E

25|$|Pierce {{went on to}} {{help the}} team to the playoffs that season, with nearly 200 more fans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> per game on average in {{comparison}} to the two years prior. With a record of 22-26-2-0, Pierce and the Centennials knew the rebuild would take some time but it was something the organization knew patience would pay off for. The 2010-11 season would bring similar fortunes to Merritt, with a record of 22-31-6-1, but the upswing was clearly underway with a flock of young players on that seasons roster.|$|E

25|$|Twenty-one Canadians and two Americans died. Many of {{the bodies}} were burned beyond recognition. Almost all {{of the victims were}} in the forward half of the {{aircraft}} between the wings and the cockpit. Some bodies were in the aisles, and some bodies were still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> Two victims were {{in the back of the}} aircraft, even though the passengers were moved forward after the fire had been detected; the disoriented passengers moved beyond the overwing exits and succumbed. The blood samples from the bodies revealed high levels of cyanide, fluoride, and carbon monoxide, chemicals produced by the burning plane.|$|E
25|$|The bomb's orientation, {{positioned}} front-to-back and upward angled from horizontal, {{caused the}} blast to expand vertically and lengthwise. This configuration meant that Ikegami's body absorbed {{most of the}} blast force and the plane's outer structure was spared. The lower half of his body fell into the cargo hold and ten passengers sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in front of and behind Ikegami were also injured; one needed urgent medical care. Additionally, the 38-minute delay in takeoff from Cebu meant the plane was not as far out to sea as anticipated, which contributed to the captain's options available for an emergency landing.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, certain traditions {{stated that}} popes {{throughout}} the medieval period {{were required to}} undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special chair {{with a hole in}} the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.|$|E

500|$|Field Marshal Viscount Wavell succeeded Linlithgow as Viceroy in 1943. In June 1945, {{following}} {{the release of}} the Congress leaders, Wavell called for a conference, and invited the leading figures from the various communities to meet with him at Simla. [...] He proposed a temporary government along the lines which Liaquat and Desai had agreed. [...] However, Wavell was unwilling to guarantee that only the League's candidates would be placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> reserved for Muslims. All other invited groups submitted lists of candidates to the Viceroy. Wavell cut the conference short in mid-July without further seeking an agreement; with a British general election imminent, Churchill's government did not feel it could proceed.|$|E
500|$|Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth {{asserted}} that Wilson {{should have been}} credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well. [...] "He hit one in Cincinnati one day", he said, [...] "way up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> hit it so hard that it bounced right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. I {{was sitting in the}} Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren't going to say anything. But Hack really hit 57 that year." [...] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare pulsed wave (PW) Doppler {{velocity}} measurements obtained from duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries with subjects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> and supine positions in an attempt to determine if this would influence the velocity criteria used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classification of the severity of internal carotid artery disease. Methods: Carotid duplex ultrasound examinations were performed on 42 volunteers with measurement of peak systolic velocities (PSV) and end diastolic velocities (EDV) using a Doppler angle of 60 u. The measurements were obtained from both the right and left extracranial carotid vessels <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> and supine positions. t-tests were used to compare the mean velocities obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> versus supine positions. Results: PSV and EDV measurements obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> position were lower than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supine position. Statistical analysis comparing <b>the</b> means <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> versus <b>the</b> supine position showed statistical significance at the p 50. 05 level for all measurements except the PSV of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Conclusions: Duplex ultrasound PW Doppler derived velocity criteria are used to classify the severity of stenosis, which in turn impacts on patient treatment options. The carotid duplex scan can be adequately performed on patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> position but velocities measured will be reduced and modification to the existing velocity criteria may be needed.

Analysis determined that the many wire fragments that were found embedded in Frank's body, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> on the right-hand side, and in the carpeting, were low-carbon steel wire, [...] in diameter. One of the dismembered fingers recovered from the wreckage had embedded in it the face plate of a travel alarm clock. A life jacket from Kure Beach, found with parts of a flight bag embedded in it, tested positive for nitrate residue. A black [...] "crusty" [...] residue on Frank's right hand {{was found to be}} manganese dioxide, a substance found in dry cell batteries.|$|E
500|$|The {{dismissal}} raises tension at the Simpson household, with Homer and Marge {{siding with}} Lisa and Bart, respectively. Homer believes that Lisa {{needs to do}} what is good to the team, while Marge thinks she should reconsider, since the family comes first. Under Lisa's leadership, the team advances to the championship against Capital City. On the day of the game, Marge takes Bart to an amusement park; while they ride the roller coaster, Lisa calls Bart to beg for his help, but he brushes her off. Mike Scioscia, manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, pops up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> behind Marge and Bart and tells him that the best players listen to their managers, pointing out his three World Series wins [...] two as player, one as manager. Marge takes Bart to the game, which is now in its last inning with the Isotots down 11-10. Bart puts aside his differences with Lisa and offers to pinch-run from first base, then ignores her signs and steals both second and third. As he begins to steal home, Lisa realizes the odds are vastly against him, then decides to ignore the numbers and cheer him on anyway. He is tagged out at the plate, costing the Isotots their championship bid, but Lisa thanks him for helping her learn to love baseball as a game, and the team cheers them for resolving their differences.|$|E
