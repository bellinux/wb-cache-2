25|$|A {{dry suit}} {{provides}} thermal insulation to the wearer while immersed in water, and normally protects {{the whole body}} except the head, hands, and sometimes the feet. In some configurations, these are also covered. Dry suits are usually used where the water temperature is below 15°C (60°F) or for extended immersion in water above 15°C (60°F), where a wet suit user would get cold, and with an <b>integral</b> <b>helmet,</b> boots, and gloves for personal protection when diving in contaminated water.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} method for a {{comprehensive}} assessment {{of the effect of}} integral motorcycle helmets on physiological and cognitive responses of motorcyclists. To verify the reliability of commonly used tests, we conducted experiments with 5 motorcyclists. We recorded changes in physiological parameters (heart rate, local skin temperature, core temperature, air temperature, relative humidity in the space between the helmet and the surface of the head, and the concentration of O 2 and CO 2 under the helmet) and in psychological parameters (motorcyclists ’ reflexes, fatigue, perceptiveness and mood). We also studied changes in the motor-cyclists ’ subjective sensation of thermal comfort. The results made it possible to identify reliable parameters for assessing the effect of integral helmets on performance, i. e., physiological factors (head skin temperature, internal temperature and concentration of O 2 and CO 2 under the helmet) and on psychomotor factors (reac-tion time, attention and vigilance, work performance, concentration and a subjective feeling of mood and fatigue). <b>integral</b> <b>helmet</b> motorcyclist thermophysiology motorcyclist cognitive functions physiological response 1...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{volunteer}} subjects underwent psychomotor testing when {{wearing an}} <b>integral</b> crash <b>helmet</b> {{in a variety}} of conditions which lead to rebreathing. There was a wide individual variation in the extent of rebreathing. In the worst conditions the minimum inspired carbon dioxide tension (PICO 2) increased to 2. 6 kPa. The psychomotor test was a tracking test based on a microcomputer. There was a significant deterioration in the ability to perform the test when the helmet was worn with the visor down and restricted airflow into the helmet (P = less than 0. 05). In those tests when the minimum PICO 2 exceeded 0. 5 kPa the decrease in performance was more highly statistically significant (p = less than 0. 005). Rebreathing wearing <b>integral</b> crash <b>helmets</b> results in a variable impairment in the subjects' ability to perform a tracking test. We recommend that the maximum level of CO 2 retention inside <b>integral</b> crash <b>helmets</b> should not exceed 0. 5 kPa minimum PICO 2...|$|R

The <b>helmet</b> is an <b>integral</b> SPECTRA <b>helmet</b> fitted with real-time positioning and information system, and with light amplifiers for night vision.Power sources will be made of two rechargeable Li-ion batteries.|$|R
40|$|The respired {{air of a}} {{volunteer}} was analysed while {{he was wearing a}} variety of <b>integral</b> crash <b>helmets.</b> Observations were made with and without a protective balaclava, bib or scarf, or both. Rebreathing occurred and the peak inspired oxygen tension fell as low as 16. 0 kPa (120 mm Hg) with a minimum inspired carbon dioxide of 2. 1 KPa (16. 0 mm Hg). Accessories worn or attached to the helmet which restrict airflow into the helmet should not be used. Attention should be paid to the "air conditioning" of helmets when worn with flameproof balaclavas and bibs...|$|R

2500|$|British frogmen of World War II and {{for some}} time {{afterwards}} used a similar one or two piece rubberized knit fabric suit by Siebe Gorman. They produced the one-piece front-entry Sladen suit with <b>integral</b> rubber <b>helmet,</b> developed by the British Admiralty for use with manned torpedoes, and in the late 1950s also the Essjee two-piece swim suit, based on the Sladen suit. The Essjee suit consisted of a jacket with rubber hood and lightweight wrist cuffs, and trousers shod with moulded rubber soles. The two parts were sealed by rolling the overlapped rubber skirts of the jacket and trousers together and these were {{held in place by}} a separate rubber cummerbund. Soft sponge-rubber pads inside the hood covered the ears and allowed them to be equalised. There was space under the suit for plenty of [...] woollen underclothes. The suit was available in proofed gabardine or rubberised stockinette, with the cloth on the outside and the rubber inside, to protect the rubber from sunlight while in use.|$|R
50|$|At the 2010 Games, Williams won {{the gold}} medal in the women's skeleton, {{breaking}} the track record twice along the way and winning by more than a half a second. At {{the end of the first}} day, on which Williams had established a 0.3s advantage over second placed Kerstin Szymkowiak, two protests were filed by other nations over the aerodynamics of Williams' helmet. The protests claimed that the helmet's spoilers were illegal and gave her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. The manufacturer claimed that they were <b>integral</b> to the <b>helmet's</b> design. Both protests were rejected by the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation, which had passed the helmet—with ridges—days earlier.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Non-invasive {{ventilation}} {{is largely}} {{used to treat}} acute and chronic respiratory failure. This ventilation encounters a non-negligible rate of failure related to the used interface/mask, but {{the reasons for this}} failure remain unclear. In order to shed light on this issue and to better understand the effects of the geometrical design of interfaces, we aimed to quantify flow, pressure and gas composition in terms of CO(2) and O(2) at the passage through different types of interface (oronasal mask, <b>integral</b> mask and <b>helmet).</b> In particular, we postulated that due to specific gas flow passing throughout the interface, the effective dead space added by the interface is not always related to the whole gas volume included in the interface. METHODS: Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics, were used to describe pressure, flow and gas composition during ventilation with the different interfaces. RESULTS: Between the different interfaces the effective dead spaces differed only modestly (110 - 370 ml), whereas their internal volumes were markedly different (110 - 10, 000 ml). Effective dead space was limited to half the tidal volume for the most voluminous interface, whereas it was close to the interface gas volume for the less voluminous interfaces. Pressure variations induced by the flow ventilation throughout the interface were negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Effective dead space is not related to the internal gas volume included in the interface, suggesting that this internal volume should not be considered as a limiting factor for their efficacy during non-invasive ventilation. Patient's comfort and synchrony have also to be taken into account...|$|R
