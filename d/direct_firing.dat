50|$|The Artillery Battalion {{was created}} on 16 January 1918. On 21 November 1918 the Estonian Minister of War named the captain Hugo Kauler to the {{commander}} of the 1st Artillery Battalion. The unit fought during the Estonian War of Independence mainly on the Narva, Tartu and Viljandi fronts. The unit also participated in the Landeswehr war in Northern Latvia (Cēsis).

50|$|Where {{composite}} firing is used, {{there are}} several possible arrangements for the heating gases. Most use a double-pass tube arrangement where another dry back combustion chamber routes the gases from one tube bank to return through the other.

50|$|In <b>direct</b> <b>firing,</b> {{the fuel}} is fed at a {{controlled}} rate to the fuel mill, {{and the fine}} product is immediately blown into the kiln. The advantage of this system {{is that it is}} not necessary to store the hazardous ground fuel: it is used as soon as it is made. For this reason it was the system of choice for older kilns. A disadvantage is that the fuel mill has to run all the time: if it breaks down, the kiln has to stop if no backup system is available.|$|E

50|$|The M40 {{recoilless}} rifle is a lightweight, portable, crew-served 105 mm weapon intended primarily as an anti-tank weapon {{made in the}} United States. The weapon is commonly described as being 106 mm, {{but it is in}} fact 105 mm; the 106 mm designation was intended to prevent confusion with the incompatible 105 mm ammunition from the failed M27.It could also be employed in an antipersonnel role {{with the use of the}} antipersonnel-tracer flechette round. It can be fired primarily from a wheeled ground mount. The air-cooled, breech-loaded, single-shot rifle fired fixed ammunition. It was designed for <b>direct</b> <b>firing</b> only, and sighting equipment for this purpose was furnished with each weapon.|$|E

50|$|With new {{environmental}} regulation in the United States, {{coal-fired power plants}} are becoming obsolete. As many as three-fourths of coal-fired power plants are being shut down.needed Short-term options include retiring the plant or quick conversion to <b>direct</b> <b>firing</b> of the boiler with natural gas. Repowering these old coal burning power plants into gas burning boilers. It's estimated {{that as much as}} 30 gigawatts (GW) of existing U.S. power generation capacity could be lost through plant closings due to new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. There could be a saving of 20 percent of the capital cost instead of building brand new power plants founded by EPRI studied.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{differences}} between the SU-152G and the ISU-152 {{as well as its}} variants, and that between it and 2S3 made it {{what appeared to be a}} middle ground between these two self-propelled guns. The ISU-152 was intended to be a heavy assault gun from the beginning, which required capability of <b>direct</b> <b>firing,</b> and a weak transition towards firing from closed positions began. In addition, the crew of the vehicles were often poisoned by the exhaust gases after firing in closed combat compartments. Despite the overt advantage of the SU-152G over the ISU-152 in terms of firing from closed positions, serial production of the SU-152G was never put in effect. All the work on Soviet self-propelled guns were put into a halt in the 1960s and only resumed when the First secretary of the TsK KPSS was removed from position. As a result, the 2S3 [...] "Acacia" [...] was made, favorably different from its predecessor with further increased vertical traverse angles, a closed combat compartment, CBRN protection, a turret capable of circular fire and an increased angle.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal energy {{applications}} for switchgrass {{appear to be}} closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications. For example, switchgrass can be pressed into fuel pellets that are subsequently burned in pellet stoves used to heat homes (which typically burn corn or wood pellets). Switchgrass has been widely tested as a substitute for coal in power generation. The most widely studied project to date has been the Chariton Valley Project in Iowa. [...] The Show-Me-Energy Cooperative (SMEC) in Missouri is using switchgrass and other warm-season grasses, along with wood residues, as feedstocks for pellets used for the firing of a coal-fired power plant. In Eastern Canada, switchgrass is being used on a pilot scale as a feedstock for commercial heating applications. Combustion studies have been undertaken and it appears to be well-suited as a commercial boiler fuel. Research is also being undertaken to develop switchgrass as a pellet fuel because of lack of surplus wood residues in eastern Canada, as a slowdown in the forest products industry in 2009 is now resulting in wood pellet shortages throughout Eastern North America. Generally speaking, the <b>direct</b> <b>firing</b> of switchgrass for thermal applications can provide the highest net energy gain and energy output-to-input ratio of all switchgrass bioconversion processes. Research has found switchgrass, when pelletized and used as a solid biofuel, is a good candidate for displacing fossil fuels. Switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6:1 energy output-to-input ratio, which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland. [...] As a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6-13 tonnes per hectare of CO2. In contrast, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, respectively.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we present the surface {{passivation}} properties of pre-oxidized Si(100) surfaces compared to H-terminated Si(100) after {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) of Al 2 O 3 thin films. Additionally the differences in surface passivation for n- and p-type silicon were investigated. The pre-oxidation {{was carried out in}} three different wet chemical solutions: (a) nitric acid (HNO 3), (b) hydrochloric acid mixed with hydrogen peroxide (HCl/H 2 O 2) and (c) a sulphuric acid with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2). The surface passivation quality was determined directly after deposition, after anneal at 400 °C in N 2 atmosphere for 10 min and after <b>direct</b> <b>firing</b> at 850 °C in ambient for several seconds. Directly after deposition we find significantly higher passivation quality for the Al 2 O 3 passivated samples with pre-oxidized surfaces than for H-terminated surfaces. After anneal and after directly firing the passivation quality for Al 2 O 3 on H-terminated surfaces is slightly better, nevertheless the surface recombination velocity for Al 2 O 3 on pre-oxidized silicon surfaces is still< 15 cm/s for n-type Fz silicon and< 70 cm/s for p-type Cz. A high quality surface passivation can therefore be achieved for silicon pre-oxidized with wet chemistries. The field-effect passivation for HF-last ALD Al 2 O 3 exceeds the level of pre-oxidized samples after anneal as well as after <b>direct</b> <b>firing...</b>|$|E
