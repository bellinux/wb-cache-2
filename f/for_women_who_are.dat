25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{are used}} to prevent HPV infection and therefore cervical cancer. They are recommended <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> 9 to 25 years old {{who have not been}} exposed to HPV. However, since it is unlikely that a woman will have already contracted all four viruses, and because HPV is primarily sexually transmitted, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended vaccination for women up to 26 years of age.|$|E

Signs and symptoms in pregnant mothers tend to improve during the second and third trimesters. Complete remission can occur in some mothers. Immunosuppressive therapy should be maintained throughout pregnancy, as this reduces the chance of neonatal muscle weakness, and controls the mother's myasthenia.|$|E

X-linked diseases occur {{at a rate}} of 5 in 10,000 live births. The most commonly published sex-linked diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia. Ultrasonography is unreliable during the first trimester of pregnancy, as the genitalia are not fully developed. Other methods for sex determination before the use of cffDNA are invasive and performed at 11 weeks of gestation. There is a small risk of miscarriage. The main method is to target the SRY gene on the Y chromosome and DYS14 sequence.|$|E
25|$|Cheek kissing in Turkey is also widely {{accepted}} in greetings.

Cheek kissing between women is also very common, but it is also very rare <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> introduced for the first time. A man and a woman could cheek kiss each other for greeting without sexual connotations only if they are good friends or depending on the circle, the setting, and the location like in big cities.|$|E
40|$|Married {{adults are}} {{generally}} healthier than unmarried adults. It has been hypothesized {{that marriage is}} associated with good health because marriage has beneficial effects on health (marriage protection effects) and/or because healthier individuals {{are more likely to}} marry and to stay married (marriage selection effects). To investigate these hypotheses, this study analyzes prospective panel data for a large national sample of women in the U. S. (the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women). The women were aged 24 - 34 yr at the beginning of two successive five-year follow-up intervals. Analyses of the prospective data indicate that there were significant marriage protection effects, but only among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not employed. Specifically, <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not employed, married women had better health trends than unmarried women in each follow-up interval. It appears that marriage had beneficial effects on health <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not have a job which could provide an alternative source of financial resources and social support. In addition, analyses of the prospective data provide limited evidence for marriage selection effects. Specifically, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had better health initially were more likely to marry and less likely to experience marital dissolution, but only <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not employed full-time and only during the first follow-up interval. Thus, the prospective evidence suggests that, <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not employed, both marriage protection and marriage selection effects contributed to the marital status differential in health observed in cross-sectional data. In contrast, neither marriage protection nor marriage selection effects <b>were</b> observed <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> employed full-time. As would be expected, the cross-sectional data show that marital status differentials in health were large and highly significant <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not employed, whereas marital status differentials in health were much smaller and often not significant <b>for</b> employed <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> neither married nor employed had particularly poor health. Additional evidence indicates that the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> neither married nor employed suffered from multiple interacting disadvantages, including poor health, low incomes, and sociodemographic characteristics which contributed to difficulty in obtaining employment. marriage health selection effects women...|$|R

In his review of No Boys Allowed, Matthew Horton of BBC Music remarked that the slower songs [...] "house some of the nicer touches".

500|$|Sex Trade 101 {{calls itself}} [...] "Toronto's only sex trade {{survivors}} and abolitionist organization" [...] and {{is composed of}} 12 women who had escaped forced prostitution and who offer training for police in order to change perceptions about {{people involved in the}} sex trade. The organization is also involved in prevention work in high schools. The organization offers mentorship and peer support groups <b>for</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> currently or were formerly in prostitution. It also partners with other organizations including the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary and Sheatre, an Owen Sound-based interactive theatre company. In 2012, Falle and Bridget Perrier represented Sex Trade 101 in Owen Sound where they launched ReStart, a mentorship program to aid women and youth who are at risk of sexual victimization, to help people exit the sex trade, and to provide support once they have exited. At the workshop that launched this program, Falle said that some people in the sex industry engage in survival sextrading sex for food, a place to sleep, alcohol, drugs, or the feeling that they are loved. She said that rural communities are common places for women and children to be groomed into prostitution. She identified Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound as particularly vulnerable because of the substance abuse in the area. By 2013, Sex Trade 101 had served more than 1,000 women. In May 2012, Falle spoke about human trafficking at high schools in Vancouver primarily because of the influence of a parent concerned about human trafficking in the area and its dangers to children.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{a law in}} 2004 made honor killings {{illegal in}} Pakistan, honor killings still occur in Pakistan {{largely because of the}} lack of strict {{enforcement}} and the tendency of the legal system following the religious law. By creating laws that aligned legal laws with Islamic law, the Hudood Ordinance of Pakistan, enacted in 1979, created obstacles for women victimized of gender-based crimes. Women were required to provide four male witnesses, but if they were unable to do so, the case is not prosecuted. <b>For</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> married, they face the punishment for having sex outside of marriage, which range from stoning to public lashing, and some families will commit honor killings [...] due to the dishonor she has brought upon the family. A bill removed the four male witnesses requirement of the Hudood Ordinances in 2006, but there are allegations that the police force and other law enforcing officials are not necessarily enforcing the law and bill. Women rights advocacy groups have pressured the Pakistani government to respond to the deficiencies, but in March 2005, a bill that sought to strengthen the law against the practice of honor killing was rejected by the Pakistani parliament after being declared as un-Islamic by a majority vote.|$|E
