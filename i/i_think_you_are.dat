Harkins stated that he ordered Wilson to report to Lodge. Harkins then reported that he was undertaking [...] "a field trip", believed to {{be an attempt to}} lobby Saigon-based forces to join the coup. Harkins was later reported to have said in response to Khánh's asking whether he objected to a coup, [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a very fine general." [...] Afterwards, when asked why he had not tipped off the junta, Harkins said that the ruling officers [...] "weren't getting along anyway, so maybe it was a change for the better. I thought it was." ...|$|E
500|$|.....that I {{consider}} {{you to be}} {{the best}} qualified person I know of who is likely to undertake such a situation— I state this not on the supposition of yr. being a finished Naturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, observing, & noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History. Peacock has the appointment at his disposal & if he can not find a man willing to take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost— Capt. F. wants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector & would not take any one however good a Naturalist who was not recommended to him likewise as a gentleman. ... there never was a finer chance for a man of zeal & spirit... Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your disqualifications for I assure you <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the very man they are in search of.|$|E

And frankly <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do; and {{you will}} pardon me if I say {{improperly}} so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> wrong in suffering Jane {{to go with him}} this afternoon." ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 27, 2007, Malakar sang No Doubt's [...] "Bathwater" [...] {{wearing a}} fauxhawk made from {{multiple}} ponytails. The style {{was called the}} [...] "ponyhawk" [...] by host Ryan Seacrest. While singing, Malakar hesitated {{with some of the}} words to the song. Simon Cowell remarked, [...] "Sanjaya, I don't think it matters anymore what we say ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in your own universe and if people like you, good luck." [...] The following night, host Seacrest walked out on stage wearing a wig with the same hairstyle, parodying Malakar.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving at Barmouth on {{the evening}} of 23 August, Charles met up with a [...] "reading party" [...] of Cambridge friends for a time before he left on the morning of 29 August, to go back to Shrewsbury and on to {{partridge}} shooting with his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall. He was grieved to have received a message that Ramsay had died. This upset Darwin's plans for a visit in the following year to Tenerife. He arrived home at The Mount, Shrewsbury, on 29 August, and found a letter from Henslow. The Cambridge Fellow George Peacock had heard from Francis Beaufort of plans for the second survey voyage of HMS Beagle, and had written to Henslow proposing Leonard Jenyns as [...] "a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition", or if he was unavailable seeking recommendations for an alternative to take up this [...] "glorious opportunity". When Jenyns decided not to leave his parish, he and Henslow thought of Darwin. Henslow's letter, read by Peacock and forwarded to Darwin, expected him to eagerly catch at the likely offer of a two-year trip to Terra del Fuego & home by the East Indies, not as [...] "a finished Naturalist", but as a gentleman [...] "amply qualified for collecting, observing, & noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History". The appointment was more as a companion to Captain Robert FitzRoy, than as a mere collector. Henslow wrote [...] "I assure you <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the very man they are in search of".|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, Mr. Graham. I must say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right there. Under all the {{circumstances}} of the case <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> right to wish to leave us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won't {{even take}} cold, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so {{sensible}} in covering and getting her home quickly," [...] replied her mother cheerfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "As for the scalps, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> right enough, my worthy friend; {{but as for}} the {{armament}} and the stores, {{they would}} have been condemned by any prize-court in Christendom." ...|$|R
60|$|Brain. What, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in a dream}} too, brother Limberham.|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. [Drawing back in awe.] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> growing taller as you speak.|$|E
60|$|Captain. If {{you will}} pardon the interruption, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{describing}} a pretty woman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> rather unfairly {{treated by}} the PRESENT, I {{certainly}} do. Writing a heavy review like that upon an elegant trifle like the COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE was absurd.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} of them. In former days, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> told that my father's will {{provided}} {{for my mother}} and for me. You {{know that we have}} enough to live on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No indeed; <b>you</b> used to <b>be</b> out there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{the only}} one—and I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> still. That’s why I {{recognised}} you the other night—I might have cut you, you know.” ...|$|R
60|$|SYBIL [talking too much]. Mrs. Shand, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{very kind}} to take it so reasonably.|$|E
60|$|B.--Yes, sir, I {{believe you}} do, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in the right}} of it--am fully satisfied.|$|E
60|$|Chr. Indeed, gentleman, my {{old lady}} is married already: Cry you mercy, forsooth, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a knight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, in a non-committal fashion, [...] "we {{certainly}} won the match, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{wrong to}} slip away. One would almost fancy that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> unduly sensitive now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had not {{the least}} idea <b>you</b> <b>were</b> such an {{energetic}} person," [...] remarked Mrs. Easterfield, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> entirely too rash. But how about Mr. Lancaster? Do you {{know if he was}} listening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> quite {{right to make}} the observation. Facts are always valuable, and I am sure Lord Trowbridge <b>was</b> obliged to <b>you.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a little wrong as to another statement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate you! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} pigheaded, obstinate, self-satisfied, ignorant {{creature}} who ever ruined a great cause." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! {{because he}} doesn't think of such {{nonsensical}} things. I declare, Miss Katie, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in love with}} Master Charley.' ...|$|E
60|$|GLORIA (no longer scornful). You {{need not}} be afraid. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sentimental, and a little foolish; but I like you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Months! Mr. Sidney Wilton said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{the first}} runaway. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> quite right. Your new life now will <b>be</b> fresh to <b>you.</b> If you had remained, {{it would only}} have been {{associated}} with defeat and discomfiture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll be {{more popular}} now that he's {{the heir to}} Tretton. I don't know any fellow that I can get along better with than Scarborough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a little hard upon him about his father, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|NORA. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} <b>be</b> ashamed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a gentleman, and me alone {{with you in}} this place at night, you would die rather than do such a thing.|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. Indeed, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> monstrous fine. (Innocently.) It quite awes me to {{remember}} {{that we used to}} whip him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wise. Fifty per cent, of truth--it's a large {{average in}} compliments. What {{are you going}} to wear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment, smiling. [...] "It {{seems to me}} that your {{question}} is a little impertinent. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were harsh," [...] assented Gertrude. [...] "I {{have begun}} to realize it since we came to Canada--one sees things {{differently}} here. But, in a sense, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not to <b>be</b> blamed; <b>you</b> acted {{in the belief that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll not quarrel about that, <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> sure, Colligan," [...] {{continued}} Barry; [...] "and as I said fifty {{acres at}} first--it <b>was</b> fifty acres <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> saying <b>you</b> wished for--I'll not baulk you, {{and go back}} from my own word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{the bravest}} of the lot. I 'd {{like to have}} seen you flourishing round there with your hatchet," [...] added Tom, admiringly, and the old lady looked as much pleased with the {{compliment}} {{as if she had}} been a girl.|$|R
