25|$|Tunis {{exported}} grain, dates, olive oil, {{wool and}} leather, wax, coral, salt fish, cloth, carpets, arms, and also perhaps black slaves. Imports included cabinet work, arms, hunting birds, wine, perfumes, spices, medical plants, <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> silk, cotton, {{many types of}} cloth, glass ware, metals, hardware, and jewels.|$|E
25|$|The kimono and obi are {{traditionally}} made of <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as rinzu). Modern kimonos {{are widely available}} in less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton sateen, cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers. Silk is still considered the ideal fabric.|$|E
25|$|Woven wraps are {{pieces of}} woven fabric of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton {{being the most}} common, but <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are {{homespun}} or handwoven fabrics with simple over-under weaves, twills and jacquards. Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally.|$|E
50|$|Ground birch bark, {{fermented}} in sea water, is {{used for}} seasoning the woolen, <b>hemp</b> or <b>linen</b> sails and <b>hemp</b> rope of traditional Norwegian boats.|$|R
50|$|Early {{seat belts}} and {{military}} webbing of every sort during World War II {{were made of}} grosgrain <b>hemp,</b> jute and <b>linen.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Canvas Support: The {{material}} {{of the support}} is soft to the touch (almost silken: MC; something like cotton: G) but to the eye it suggested a coarse weave of palm threads called [...] "pita" [...] or the rough fiber called [...] "cotense" [...] (MC), or a <b>hemp</b> and <b>linen</b> mixture (R). It was traditionally held to be made from ixtle, an agave fiber.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{industrialisation}} of {{the paper}} production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen</b> and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It {{was not until the}} introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.|$|E
25|$|Vegans may avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials, such as cork, piña(from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E

50|$|Agriculture {{was still}} the main pursuit in the First Iron Age and {{supplied}} food for the communities. Finding charred seeds indicates the cultivation of wheat, barley, rye, millet, as well <b>hemp</b> for <b>linen,</b> while the large size pots and the storage pits indicate how the harvests were preserved. The emergence of the first iron farming implements, scythes and grubbing hoes, indicate notable progress in the agricultural practice.|$|R
50|$|Sailcloth {{encompasses}} {{a wide variety}} of materials that span those from natural fibers, such as flax (<b>linen),</b> <b>hemp</b> or cotton in various forms including canvas, to synthetic fibers, including nylon, polyester, aramids, and carbon fibers.|$|R
50|$|The strings for a {{crossbow}} {{are typically}} made of strong fibres {{that would not}} tend to fray. Whipcord was very common; however <b>linen,</b> <b>hemp,</b> and sinew were used as well. In wet conditions, twisted mulberry root was occasionally used.|$|R
50|$|Fedoras {{can be made}} of wool, cashmere, rabbit or beaver felt. These felts {{can also}} be blended to each other with mink or {{chinchilla}} and rarely with vicuña, guanaco, cervelt, or mohair. They can also be made of straw, cotton, waxed or oiled cotton, <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen</b> or leather.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of the paper machine in 1799 the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, hence the name rag paper. The rags were from <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen</b> and cotton. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was independent of recycled materials.|$|E
50|$|In general, the {{designer}} favored simple but noble materials like wool, <b>linen,</b> <b>hemp,</b> and cotton, {{often with a}} textured or nubby surface. Even when she used silk, it was usually in heavy woven patterns, which Vera Borea had made in Italy.|$|R
50|$|Up {{until the}} fifteenth century kimonos were made of <b>hemp</b> or <b>linen,</b> and they were made with {{multiple}} layers of materials. Today, authentic kimonos are made of silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as rinzu). Modern kimonos that are made with less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton sateen, cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers, are more widely worn today in Japan. However, silk is still considered the ideal fabric for kimonos.|$|R
5000|$|Papermaking using pulp {{made from}} <b>hemp</b> and <b>linen</b> fibers from tattered clothing, fishing nets and fabric bags spread to Europe in the 13th century, with an ever {{increasing}} use of rags being central to the manufacture and affordability of rag paper, {{a factor in the}} development of printing. [...] By the 1800s, demand often exceeding the available supply of rags, and also the manual labor of papermaking resulted in paper being still a relatively pricey product.|$|R
50|$|Lomba Grande also {{received}} the first German immigrants who {{settled in the}} <b>Hemp</b> <b>Linen</b> factory, then owned by the municipality of Sao Leopoldo. Today provides {{one of the main}} points of visiting the city, where the natural attractions of the neighborhood next to developments designed for leisure and tourism attracts many tourists.|$|E
50|$|Right {{from the}} start, Goyardine {{was made with}} cloth, {{although}} its appearance {{is very similar to}} leather. Goyard uses three plant fibres: <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen</b> and cotton. Hemp is particularly sought after for its hydrophobic qualities, linen is a fine thermal regulator, and the softness of linen probably caught the attention of the trunk maker.|$|E

50|$|The land in {{the area}} is {{especially}} good for growing crops. Since the 19th century, things such as <b>linen,</b> <b>hemp</b> and wheat have been grown locally. In more recent times, with the advancement of agriculture, the land has started {{to be used for}} potato growing.|$|R
50|$|Thai {{fishermen}} do {{in reality}} wear {{this style of}} pants. They are also increasingly common among many {{men and women of}} all nationalities. This style of trousers is usually made of cotton or rayon but is also now widely available in a variety of styles and fabrics, such as <b>hemp,</b> bamboo, or <b>linen.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{major factor}} in {{permitting}} the elaboration of parish closes was the relative prosperity of Finistère in the 16th century. This {{was built on the}} maritime competition and constant warfare that plagued much of Western Europe in this period. A group of parishes, just inland, benefited hugely from supplying the ports with the <b>hemp</b> and <b>linen</b> needed to rig ships, as well as food, clothing, and other supplies. This allowed them to engage in friendly civic competition with each other, constructing and embellishing closes that were displayed most effectively during the periodic pardons, which attracted pilgrims from all over Brittany and beyond.|$|R
50|$|In Palencia large {{protected}} {{areas such as}} the Natural Park of Fuentes Carrionas and Fuente Cobre-Montaña Palencia are located. The term historical region in Palencia, refers to those regions created in the fourteenth century, under the name merindades. Cantabrian Mountains are located in the northerns parts of the province. The 8,268 feet (2,520 metres) high Curavacas peak is located in the province. The major commercial products produced in the province are barley, wheat, sugar beets, <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen</b> and woolen clothes, porcelain, leather, paper, and rugs. Food processing and metallurgy are major industries. The province has three judicial districts-one each in Palencia, Carrión de los Condes and Cervera de Pisuerga.|$|E
5000|$|Due to salt being a {{necessary}} item in human life, hundreds of workers {{were used to}} obtain the salt, including numerous slaves. Some of these workers began settling on 150 acre of James F. Moore's land, causing the charter in 1794 for the new town of Newtown. It was sold under numerous brands, most prominently Little Sandy Salt. The salt was considered excellent quality, prized by merchants, and was sold {{as far away as}} Lexington, Kentucky. In 1808 it was sold for $2-2.25 a bushel, although it was often traded for such goods as <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> and tobacco. [...] At its height the salt works was operated 24 hours a day.|$|E
50|$|Ethical vegans avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cows' and calves' skins, but the skin of sheep, goats, horses and pigs is also used. Less common skins include those from kangaroos, elephants, zebras, seals, crocodile and deer. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Ethical vegans wear shoes, belts, jackets, handbags and other clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Ethical silk alternatives include bamboo and viscose. Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E
50|$|Common {{natural fibres}} for rope are manila <b>hemp,</b> <b>hemp,</b> feathers, <b>linen,</b> cotton, coir, jute, straw, and sisal. Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include polypropylene, nylon, polyesters (e.g. PET, LCP, Vectran), {{polyethylene}} (e.g. Dyneema and Spectra), Aramids (e.g. Twaron, Technora and Kevlar) and acrylics (e.g. Dralon). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. Wire rope {{is made of}} steel or other metal alloys. Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as silk, wool, and hair, but such ropes are not generally available. Rayon is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.|$|R
5000|$|Direct {{trade between}} Russia and the colonies began {{as early as}} 1763. Such trade was a {{violation}} of Britain’s Navigation Acts, which only allowed the colonies to trade with Britain. Russian products such as <b>hemp,</b> sail <b>linen</b> and iron started arriving in colonial ports years before the Revolutionary War began and did not stop once the war started. [...] The colonists and Russia saw each other as excellent trading partners, particularly because both parties had ample resources to offer. Continued trade with Russia during the Revolution provided the colonies with markets for their products as well as funds and supplies necessary to survive.|$|R
5000|$|Jute {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{affordable}} natural fibers and it is second only to cotton in amount produced and variety of uses of vegetable fibers. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials cellulose and lignin. It falls into the bast fiber category (fiber collected from bast, the phloem of the plant, sometimes called the [...] "skin") along with kenaf, industrial <b>hemp,</b> flax (<b>linen),</b> ramie, etc. The industrial term for jute fiber is raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) long. Jute is also called the golden fiber for its color and high cash value.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.Woven wraps are pieces of woven fabric of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton being the most common, but <b>hemp,</b> <b>linen,</b> silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are homespun or handwoven fabrics with simple over-under weaves, twills and jacquards. Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally.|$|E
5000|$|In March and April 1921, {{a number}} of Soviet Decrees {{introduced}} a natural tax on bread, potato, oilseeds, eggs, dairy products, wool, hides, flax and <b>hemp</b> <b>linen,</b> tobacco etc. The collection of agricultural goods in excess of prodnalog, if necessary, {{was intended to be}} made on a barter basis by giving peasants manufactured goods. In order to accelerate the expansion of commodity circulation, create necessary conditions for developing farming and industry and speed up the productive forces of the country, the government encouraged small-scale production all over Soviet Union. The introduction of prodnalog revived the trade and created a different kind of relations between the city and the village. [...] By the decision of the 12th Congress of the RCP(b) (April 1923), prodnalog and other taxes in the rural areas were exchanged for a universal direct agricultural tax (decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom on May 10, 1923). The latter would be collected in monetary form starting in 1924, with the establishment of hard currency in the USSR.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme for}} this chapter is {{clothing}} and fashion. Topics discussed include Ötzi the Iceman; {{the history of}} <b>linen,</b> <b>hemp,</b> wool, and silk; sumptuary laws; English medieval clothing; wigs in Europe from the mid-17th century to about 1800; cosmetics; Beau Brummell; history of cotton; James Hargreaves' spinning jenny; Richard Arkwright; Edmund Cartwright; Eli Whitney; corsets; and Victorian fashion.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{materials}} include <b>linen,</b> <b>hemp,</b> other vegetable fibers, sinew, silk, and rawhide. Almost any fiber {{may be used}} in emergency. Natural fibers {{would be}} very unusual on a modern recurve bow or compound bow, but are still effective and still used on traditional wooden or composite bows. Sinew and hide strings may be seriously affected by water.|$|R
50|$|Traditional Japanese bondage {{techniques}} use natural {{vegetable fiber}} rope (<b>hemp,</b> jute, or <b>linen)</b> exclusively, though contemporary Japanese Masters {{have been working}} with a range of rope materials. The natural fibers easily lock to each other which means the bondage can be held together by the friction of twists and turns or very simple knots. Traditionally, multiple 6-8 meter lengths are used.|$|R
40|$|Objective of {{the joint}} project is to create scientific-technological {{fundamentals}} {{for the application of}} the low temperature plasma treatment in the field of pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing of textiles made from cellulose fibres. In this part of the project investigations into the hydrophilizing of fabrics from cotton, viscose, <b>hemp</b> and <b>linen</b> with mass per unit area between 75 and 325 g/m" 2 and different fabric constructions were carried out. Pilot plants with reactor volumes of 40 l and 600 l and the industrial-related pilot plant MPCH 180 (working width of 1700 mm) were available for the plasma treatments at the partner FZM Floeha. Oxygen were used preferably as process gas. The wettability of fabrics from cotton, <b>hemp</b> and <b>linen</b> can be improved visibly by the treatments with oxygen plasma. Furthermore, an evenness of the absorbency over the width and length of fabrics as well as an optimal degree of wetting can be achieved. Optimisation of pre-treatment processes, for instance the reduction of the number of process steps and a minimisation of chemicals used, become possible. Dyeing processes can be carried out with more safety. Production speeds can be increased by an improved liquor uptake in padding processes. The plasma treatments did not damage the fibres of the cellulose fabrics and no negative effects or the relevant textile-physical properties and the dye fastness could be observed. (orig.)
