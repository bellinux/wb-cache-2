5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone <b>is</b> <b>was</b> shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.|$|E

25|$|Produced as {{a direct}} {{competitor}} to the luxury sports sedans of the leading European luxury marques, the XE10 series Toyota Altezza and Lexus <b>IS</b> <b>was</b> designed with a greater performance emphasis than typically seen on prior Japanese luxury vehicles.

Design work by Tomoyasu Nishi was frozen in 1996 and filed under patent number 1030135 on December 5, 1996, at the Japan Patent Office. At its introduction to Japan, it was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Toyota Netz Store, until Lexus was introduced to Japan in 2006. The Japan-sold AS200 Altezza sedan and AS300 Altezza Gita formed the basis for the Lexus IS 200 and IS 300 models respectively, sold in markets outside Japan, primarily North America, Australia, and Europe. The Altezza Gita was a hatchback-station wagon version sold in Japan and was known in the US and Europe as the Lexus IS SportCross. The AS300 Altezza Gita was the only Altezza with the 2JZ-GE engine, while in export markets, this engine was available in the sedan models as well, as the Lexus IS300 Sedan.|$|E
