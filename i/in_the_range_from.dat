5|$|A {{study from}} June 15, 1945, by the Joint War Plans Committee, who {{provided}} planning {{information to the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Olympic would result in between 130,000 and 220,000 U.S. casualties, of which U.S. dead would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army George Marshall, and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.|$|E
5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E

5|$|The Lassell ring, {{also known}} as the plateau, is the {{broadest}} ring in the Neptunian system. It is the namesake of William Lassell, the English astronomer who discovered Neptune's largest moon, Triton. This ring is a faint sheet of material occupying the space between the Le Verrier ring at about 53,200km and the Arago ring at 57,200km. Its average normal optical depth is around 10−4, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.4km. The ring's dust fraction is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 20% to 40%.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of chromospheric activity, strong {{magnetic}} field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star. Most estimates {{of the age of}} Epsilon Eridani place it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's convection zone.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{mendelevium}} isotopes (245Md to 247Md) {{are mostly}} produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions, while slightly heavier ones (248Md to 253Md) {{are produced by}} bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen. The most important and most stable isotopes are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 254Md to 258Md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. 259Md is produced as a daughter of 259No, and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium-254 and oxygen-18. Typically, {{the most commonly used}} isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer. Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium, femtogram quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  3, {{the process}} of thermal {{destruction}} of immobilized polymer {{can be divided into}} four stages: stage I is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperature <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 100 to 250  °C, and the mass loss is 2.35 %, the largest part of which is lost at 199.2  °C; stage II is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperature <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 250 to 420  °C, where weight loss is 4.84 %, most of which is lost at 397.2  °C; stage III is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperature <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 420 to 480  °C, where weight loss is 1.3 %; stage IV is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperature <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 480 to 600  °C, with a loss of 6.2 % by weight, most of which occurs at 530  °C.|$|R

25|$|A {{source of}} free {{radicals}} and a stabilizer, such as ammonium persulfate and TEMED {{are added to}} initiate polymerization. The polymerization reaction creates a gel because of the added bisacrylamide, which can form cross-links between two acrylamide molecules. The ratio of bisacrylamide to acrylamide can be varied for special purposes, but is generally about 1 part in 35. The acrylamide concentration of the gel can also be varied, generally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 5% to 25%. Lower percentage gels are better for resolving very high molecular weight molecules, while much higher percentages of acrylamide are needed to resolve smaller proteins.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} than 352 {{thermochemical}} cycles {{which can be used}} for water splitting, around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle, cerium(IV) oxide-cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle, sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity. These processes can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis, typical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 35% - 49% LHV efficiency. Thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Since these {{locomotives}} {{would be}} some 48% larger and more powerful than any locomotive previously employed on the SAR and up to twice the track gauge in width, the initial order was for two prototype locomotives only, with more to follow should they prove successful. They were delivered in September 1929 and were erected in the Durban shops, numbered 2350 and 2351, and placed in service in October. They proved to be so successful that the remaining six locomotives were quickly ordered for delivery in 1930. These six entered service in July 1930, numbered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 2352 to 2357.|$|E
50|$|After the {{cessation}} of hostilities on 1 June 1902, the IMR was transferred to civil control on 1 July 1902 and renamed the Central South African Railways (CSAR).

25|$|Carrier {{argues in}} his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt that there is {{insufficient}} Bayesian probability, that is evidence, {{to believe in the}} existence of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.|$|E
25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|E

25|$|Having {{exhausted}} the I-series plates, in November 1977, reflective green-on-white {{plates were}} introduced, beginning at AAA-000 and running to FZZ-999, and then skipping to a brief run of RAA-000 to RBZ-999 in 1994, bearing the slogan Victoria – Garden State {{at the bottom}} of the plate initiated by the then premier Rupert Hamer. In the early 1990s, it was discovered that the reflective properties of many registration plates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> AAA-000 to EZZ-999, and the principally the C-series, were defective and this had coincided with the rapid introduction of traffic enforcement cameras in Victoria. Due to the number of plates which were unidentifiable in photographs, all defective plates were recalled and new plates issued free of charge. This caused the rapid consumption of the plate stocks especially late in the F-series and some plates (those starting with FVA-000 to FVZ-999 and FYA-000 to FYZ-999) were produced in Queensland to meet demand. These plates are identifiable by their different embossed dies and vertical diamond separator (as opposed to Victoria's horizontal diamond). It is a popular myth that the defective paint was caused by prisoners manufacturing the plates urinating in the paint mixture.|$|E
25|$|After the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo {{was assigned to}} Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins. An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian. It is not disputed that between 1941 and 1945 {{tens of thousands of}} Serbs, mostly recent colonists, fled from Kosovo. Estimates range from 30,000 to 100,000. There had been large-scale Albanian immigration from Albania to Kosovo which is by some scholars estimated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 72,000 to 260,000 people (with a tendency to escalate, the last figure being in a petition of 1985). Some historians and contemporary references emphasize that a large-scale migration of Albanians from Albania to Kosovo is not recorded in Axis documents.|$|E
25|$|Tait's {{motivation}} {{for studying the}} ménage problem came from {{trying to find a}} complete listing of mathematical knots with a given number of crossings, say n. In Dowker notation for knot diagrams, an early form of which was used by Tait, the 2n points where a knot crosses itself, in consecutive order along the knot, are labeled with the 2n numbers from 1 to 2n. In a reduced diagram, the two labels at a crossing cannot be consecutive, so the set of pairs of labels at each crossing, used in Dowker notation to represent the knot, can be interpreted as a perfect matching in a graph that has a vertex for every number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 1 to 2n and an edge between every pair of numbers that has different parity and are non-consecutive modulo 2n. This graph is formed by removing a Hamiltonian cycle (connecting consecutive numbers) from a complete bipartite graph (connecting all pairs of numbers with different parity), and so it has a number of matchings equal to a ménage number. For alternating knots, this matching is enough to describe the knot diagram itself; for other knots, an additional positive or negative sign needs to be specified for each crossing pair to determine which of the two strands of the crossing lies above the other strand.|$|E
