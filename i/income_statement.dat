25|$|Despite the {{reported}} profit of €69.9 {{million in the}} year to December 2008, the Group's shareholders equity fell by over €220 million in the year, partly due to a €200 million distribution and other recognized losses that were not applied to the <b>Income</b> <b>Statement</b> but appeared directly in shareholders equity. Over the 3-year period to December 2008, the Group revalued upward its assets and investments by a net cumulative €306 million, which positively impacted shareholders equity. Over the same period it took a charge to equity of a net cumulative €312 million due to adverse exchange rate movements.|$|E

25|$|The bank, {{which had}} {{established}} a number of foreign subsidiary companies {{in the years after}} 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported total net income rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (single-sided) of the parent bank alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished {{in the second half of}} the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest-differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of the <b>income</b> <b>statement.</b> In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of client assets under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group’s foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non-CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} and rewarding {{research on the}} approach to measuring prices of financial services. 1 The {{purpose of this paper}} is to advance that work by showing how price measurement concepts can be clarified, and measurement facilitated through the integration of balance sheets with <b>income</b> <b>statements.</b> The primary reason balance sheet availability is useful is that intertemporal gains and losses [...] e. g., from holding financial instruments or an unforeseeable, yet insured disaster [...] can more correctly be assigned to both <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> and balance sheets. Once nominal output is defined, the characteristics of many financial services can be more clearly defined for purposes of price index construction. The major reasons for integrating <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> and balance sheets have been widely discussed. They range from the desirability of including financial working capital in production and consumption function estimation to the recognition that assets and liabilities can be ascribed only to enterprises, not establishments, the primary unit of observation in measuring output.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the availability of}} statistical data for international trade in banking services. Such data are required for WTO negotiations and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Following a discussion of areas of work for which data on international trade in banking services are required and of the outcome so far of international initiatives directed at the development of statistics for international trade in services, the availability of statistics relevant to the different GATS Modes of Supply of banking services of the GATS is reviewed. None of the currently available statistics under these headings provides a satisfactory measure of trade in banking services under Modes of Delivery 1 and 3 of the GATS. Thus the paper focuses on two other more promising categories of information, namely the <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> of banks, which depend on data already generated by private-sector entities, and data on trading in financial markets. In particular, the paper shows how information in the <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> can be approximately matched to the activities specified {{in the definition of}} financial services in the Annex on Financial Services of the GATS, exemplifying the argument with recent <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> of Jordanian banks. ...|$|R

2500|$|Cash {{dividends}} are {{the most}} common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50. [...] Dividends paid are not classified as an expense, but rather a deduction of retained earnings. [...] Dividends paid does not show up on an <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> but does appear on the balance sheet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accounting}} treatment of CDS used for hedging may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. [...] For example, GAAP generally require that CDS be {{reported on a}} mark to market basis. [...] In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try {{to account for the}} CDS as a hedge under FASB 133 but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.|$|E

2500|$|Off balance sheet: Derivative (finance) of {{many types}} {{have in the}} past been {{referred}} to as [...] "off-balance-sheet." [...] This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities. Certain credit derivatives products, particularly Credit Default Swaps, now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation. In the case of Credit Default Swaps, this documentation has been formulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets.|$|E
