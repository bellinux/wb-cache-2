30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} a methodology of estimating the relative permeability curve from <b>drainage</b> <b>tests</b> data using our developed multiphase fluid flow simulation model and an inversion technique. The multiphase fluid flow model is formulated {{based on the}} three governing forces, gravity viscous, and capillary forces. The flow process in porous fractured rock is simulated using finite element technique under poroelastic frame work. The model is validated against first, the analytical solution by Buckley–Leverett, simulating the oil <b>drainage</b> <b>test</b> in a glass bead model by Fahad (2013). From the validation, {{it was observed that}} the simulation results are in a good agreement with that at each stage of validation.|$|R

Condensate retention data were collected in both real-time and at steady-state to quantitatively determine how condensate load up on a coil surface. Sensible Colburn j factors and friction factors were calculated from the experimental data, and the relative performance of different coils was discussed. A dynamic <b>drainage</b> <b>test</b> was developed to study the nature of water draining out of a heat exchanger.

40|$|The {{stability}} of air bubbles in fresh concrete {{can have a}} profound influence of the potential durability of the system, because excessive losses during placement and consolidation can compromise {{the ability of the}} mixture to resist freezing and thawing. The {{stability of}} air void systems developed by some air entraining admixtures (AEAs) could be affected by the presence of some polycarboxylate-based water reducing admixtures (WRAs). The foam <b>drainage</b> <b>test</b> provides a means of measuring the potential stability of air bubbles in a paste. A barrier to acceptance of the test was that there was little investigation of the correlation with field performance. The work reported here was a limited exercise seeking to observe the stability of a range of currently available AEA/WRA combinations in the foam drainage test; then, to take the best and the worst and observe their stabilities on concrete mixtures in the lab.

40|$|A patterned, partially-treed, fen in the mid-boreal {{region of}} central Saskatchewan {{was the site}} of renewed {{hydrological}} research from 2002 to 2004. Hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storativity were determined through use of a surface loading test, pumping tests, and an enclosed field <b>drainage</b> <b>test.</b> None of these field tests have been previously described in the literature as having been used in peat environments. The combined results of field and laboratory <b>drainage</b> <b>tests</b> were used to obtain a general storativity with water table depth relationship in the upper peat layer. The hydraulic conductivity, measured with slug tests, the loading test, and pumping tests, is high near the surface, declining greatly with depth. These previously untested field methods have the advantage of representing volumes of peat from tenths of a meter to cubic meters. Characterization of the hydrology of the peatland involved year round observations of water table, piezometric head, peat surface elevations, frost depth and peat temperatures. Fluctuations of the water table, and soil moisture changes produce changes in effective stress that lead to volume change in the highly compressible peat. This is particularly important for sites with thick peat deposits. Independent compressibility estimates were as high as 10 - 5 N/m 2 in the upper peat. At three fen sites, changes in peat thickness were estimated from monthly estimates of effective stress change, using year round hydrological observations, and compared to measured annual peat thickness changes. Water table changes causing soil moisture changes, and freeze-thaw processes, explained the majority of peat surface movements...|$|R
40|$|Binder {{drainage}} {{occurs with}} mixes of small aggregate surface area particularly porous asphalt. The binder <b>drainage</b> <b>test,</b> {{developed by the}} Transport Research Laboratory, UK, is commonly used to set an upper limit on the acceptable binder content for a porous mix. This paper {{presents the results of}} a laboratory investigation {{to determine the effects of}} different binder types on the binder drainage characteristics of porous mix made of various maximum aggregate sizes 20, 14 and 10 mm. Two types of binder were used, conventional 60 / 70 pen bitumen, and styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) modified bitumen. The amount of binder lost through drainage after three hours at the maximum mixing temperature were measured in duplicate for mixes of different maximum sizes and binder contents. The maximum mixing temperature adopted depends on the types of binder used. The retained binder is plotted against the initial mixed binder content, together with the line of equality where the retained binder equals the mixed binder content. The results indicate the significant contribution of using SBS modified bitumen to increase the target bitumen binder content. Their significance is discussed in terms of target binder content, the critical binder content, the maximum mixed binder content and the maximum retained binder content values obtained from the binder <b>drainage</b> <b>test.</b> It was concluded that increasing maximum aggregate sizes decrease the maximum retained binder content, critical binder content, target binder content, maximum mixed binder content, and mixed content for both binders, but however for all mixtures, SBS is the highest...|$|R

30|$|Most {{carbonate}} reservoirs in Middle East {{are characterized}} as porous fractured reservoirs. Estimation of relative permeability of these highly heterogeneous reservoirs is challenging {{due to the}} existence of discontinuity in the fluid flow fractured porous media. Although relative permeability is an essential data for simulation of flow in fractured media, few attempts have so far been made to estimate the relative permeability curves. Most notable are the studies by Akin (J Pet Sci Eng 30 (1) 1 – 14, 2001), Al-sumaiti and Kazemi (2012), and Fahad (2013). This paper presents an integrated approach to history matching the oil <b>drainage</b> <b>tests,</b> which were carried out by unsteady state, on glass bed models with a single fracture at different orientations and to estimate the relative permeability curve. The integrated approach includes an inversion algorithm coupled with forward numerical modeling of fluid flow. The history matching of the displacement test data was obtained by using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to minimize the error between the simulated and experimental data. In this algorithm, Corey-type power law is used to create relative permeability curves during the optimization procedures. The forward modeling is a 3 D multiphase fluid simulator for flow through discrete fractures. Numerical results of fluid flow profiles and the optimized relative permeability curves for single fracture with different orientations and experimental validation with oil <b>drainage</b> <b>tests</b> are presented. The results of the optimized relative permeability data for single fracture are in a good agreement with the data derived by the correlation of Fahad (2013). These results prove that the presented approach can be used to upscale the relative permeability curve from laboratory scale to reservoir grid scale. The work on the upscaling of the estimated relative permeability curve of fractured porous media is under preparation and will be published soon.|$|R
