40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{research}} project has been a joint analysis of Ginga LAC and Einstein SSS X-ray spectra of the hot gas in galaxy clusters with cooling flows is reported. We studied four clusters (A 496, A 1795, A 2142 & A 2199) and found their central temperatures to be cooler than in the exterior, which is expected from their having cooling flows. More interestingly, we found central metal abundance enhancements {{in two of the}} clusters, A 496 and A 2142. We have been assessing whether the abundance gradients (or lack thereof) in intracluster gas is correlated with galaxy morphological gradients in the host clusters. In rich, dense galaxy clusters, elliptical and SO galaxies are generally found in the cluster cores, while spiral galaxies are found in the outskirts. If the metals observed in clusters came from proto-ellipticals and proto-S 0 <b>s</b> <b>blowing</b> winds, then the metal distribution in intracluster gas may still reflect the distribution of their former host galaxies. In a research project which was inspired by the success of the Ginga LAC/Einstein SSS work, we analyzed X-ray spectra from the HEAO-A 2 MED and the Einstein SSS to look for temperature gradients in cluster gas. The HEAO-A 2 MED was also a non-imaging detector with a large field of view compared to the SSS, so we used the differing fields of view of the two instruments to extract spatial information. We found some evidence of cool gas in the outskirts of clusters, which may indicate that the nominally isothermal mass density distributions in these clusters are steepening in the outer parts of these clusters...|$|R

The walls consist of an inner calcareous lamella, covered by the primary pseudochitinous lamella, succeeded by a second calcareous lamella in which eventually spines can be detected, and then a third thicker calcareous lamella is added, as in Globigerina rubra (Hofker, 1971, Pl. VI). The difference with Sphaeroidinella is that dorsal secondary apertures are lacking. But young specimens of S. dehiscens from Basal Pleistocene in a JOIDES sample lack these openings also, whereas the chambers following the embryonic ones all show the third thickening lamella. In these pleistocene individuals remmants of the spines {{are found in the}} form of fine open canals which do not pierce the chitinous lamella nor the primary calcitic one. Last formed embryonic chambers may show traces of these spines at their outsides. Young specimens of the Recent form, <b>S.</b> excavata <b>Blow,</b> are built as the Miocene ancestor.

The forming of secondary apertures in the later larger forms of this gens is also found in many other planktonic genes increasing their size during time, as is the forming of bullae. There is no reason to split off the genus Sphaeroidinellopsis from Sphaeroidinella as the young specimens of the latter genus should in that case be put in Sphaerodinellopsis.

40|$|Abstract. We give an {{explicit}} construction, for a flat map X → S of algebraic spaces, {{of an ideal}} in the n’th symmetric product of X over <b>S.</b> <b>Blowing</b> up this ideal is then shown to be isomorphic to the schematic closure in the Hilbert scheme of length n subschemes of the locus of n distinct points. This generalises Haiman’s corresponding result ([13]) for the affine complex plane. However, our construction of the ideal {{is very different from}} that of Haiman, using the formalism of divided powers rather than representation theory. In the non-flat case we obtain a similar result by replacing the n’th symmetric product by the n’th divided power product. The Hilbert scheme, Hilb n X/S, of length n subschemes of a scheme X over some S is in general not smooth even if X → S itself is smooth. Even worse, it may not even be (relatively) irreducible. In the case of the affine plane over the complex numbers (where the Hilbert scheme is smooth and irreducible) Haiman (cf., [13]) realised the Hilbert scheme as the blow-up of a very specific ideal of the n’th symmetric product of the affine plane. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to generalise Haiman’s construction. As the Hilbert scheme in general is not irreducible while the symmetric product is (for a smooth geometrically irreducible scheme over a field say) it does not seem reasonable to hope to obtain a Haiman like description of all of Hilb n X/S and indeed we will only get a description of the schematic closure of the open subscheme of n distinct points. With this modification we get a general result which seems very close to that of Haiman. The main difference from the arguments of Haiman is that we need to define the ideal that we want to blow up in a general situation and Haiman’s construction seems to be too closely tied to the 2 -dimensional affine space in characteristic zero. As a bonus we get that our constructions work very generally. We have thus tried to present our results in a generality that should cover reasonable applications (encouragement from the referee has made us make it more general than we did in a previous version of this article). There are some rather immediate consequences of this generality. The first one is that we have to work with algebraic spaces instea...|$|R

Before Booth introduced his version of the vacuum cleaner, cleaning machines blew or brushed dirt away, instead of sucking it up. As Booth recalled decades later, in 1901 he attended [...] "a demonstration of an American machine by its inventor" [...] at the Empire Music Hall in London. The inventor is not named, but Booth's description of the machine conforms fairly closely to American inventor John <b>S.</b> Thurman <b>blown</b> air design. Booth watched a demonstration of the device, which blew dust off the chairs, and thought that [...] "...if the system could be reversed, and a filter inserted between the suction apparatus and the outside air, whereby the dust would be retained in a receptacle, the real solution of the hygienic removal of dust would be obtained." [...] He tested the idea by laying a handkerchief on the seat of a restaurant chair, putting his mouth to the handkerchief, and then trying to suck up as much dust as he could onto the handkerchief.

40|$|Ozone (O 3) is the air {{pollutant}} that currently {{represents one of}} the greatest environmental concerns, with particles and nitrogen oxides. Ground le vels of O 3 have increased continuously {{over the past three decades}} at a rate of 0. 5 - 2 % per year (Vingarzan, 2004). O 3 in the troposphere is res ponsible for negative effects on crop production. However the responses to O 3 vary between plant speci es due to variab le stomatal conductances and differences in the ab ility to detoxify O 3 -derived reactive oxygen species. Regarding their sensitivity to O 3, crop species are usually di vided into three groups: O 3 sensitive crops; moderately sensitive crops and O 3 resistant crops (Mills et al., 2007). Maize (Zea mays L.) is generally considered a moderately sensitive crop, even though information on the sensitivity of this species in the field is scarce. Here, we present the re sults of a field ozone fumigation experiment on maize. Fumigation systems, such as open top chambers (OTC) or field fumigation rings (FACE), were developed to obtain experimental data on crop yield losses. In the present experiment, we used a linear fumigation device derived from FACE systems. It consists in two linear stainless fumigation cylinders orient ed North-South. Under daylight conditions, when dominant wind <b>s</b> <b>blew</b> (westward), the syst em continuousl y generated O 3 and the prevailing winds acted as natural dispersi on vectors, without disturbing the other environmental and ag ricultural conditions. The generator was automatic ally turned off during the night and when the wind direction was different from that pr evailing wind. The O 3 concentrations were slightly higher than natural levels n ear the fumigation source and decreased regularly with the distance to the source. Plants were exposed to O 3 enriched air daily for 65 days (30 / 06 to 3 / 09 2011). O 3 exposure at different distances from the fumigation source (2 m, 3. 5 m and 5 m down wind of the source compared to control plants located 15 m upwind of the source) was calculat ed (i) as an hourly average concentrations and (ii) as the cumulative concentratio n over a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT 40). The yiel d was obtained through destructive measurements of biomass.

This relati onship was not sign ificantly different from previous data (Mills et al., 2007). These results confirmed that maize is less sensitive than wheat to ozone (Mills et al., 2011).

40|$|The {{development}} of a global model for oxygen steelmaking and its validation against industrial data was reported in Part 1 of this paper. This paper focused on the {{development of}} one sub-model on the decarburization reaction in the emulsion zone incorporating the bloated droplet theory. This paper also critically evaluated the current knowledge on the kinetics of decarburization reaction in the emulsion phase and discussed the repercussions of the new model for industrial practices. The decarburization model, in conjunction with the industrial data, indicates that the decarburization rates in the emulsion phase reaches up to approximately 60 % of the overall decarburization rate during the main blow. It was found that the residence time of droplets as well as decarburization reaction rate via emulsified droplets was strong function of bloating behavior of metal droplets in the emulsion phase. The estimated residence times of the metal droplets in the emulsion were between 0. 4 to 45 <b>s</b> throughout the <b>blow.</b> The influence of variations in droplet size and ejection angle on residence time and decarburization rates via emulsified droplets was also investigated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the influence of atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatment on the microtensile dentin bond strength of two self-etching adhesive systems after one year of water storage as well as observe the contact angle changes of dentin treated with plasma and the micromorphology of resin/dentin interfaces using SEM. Materials and Methods: For contact angle measurements, 6 human molars were sectioned to remove the occlusal enamel surface, embedded in PMMA resin, and ground to expose a flat dentin surface. Teeth were divided into two groups: 1) argon APP treatment for 30 <b>s,</b> and 2) <b>blown</b> air (control). For the microtensile test, 28 human third molars were used and prepared similarly to contact angle measurements. Teeth were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 7) according to two self-etching adhesives and APP treatment (with/without). After making the composite resin buildup, teeth were sectioned perpendicular to the bonded interface to obtain beam specimens. The specimens were tested after 24 h and one year of water storage until failure. Bond strength data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (a = 0. 05 %). Three beam specimens per group that were not used in the bond strength test were prepared for interfacial SEM analysis. Results: APP application decreased the contact angle, but increased the bond strength only for one adhesive tested. SEM evaluation found signs of degradation within interfacial structures following 1 -year aging in water. APP increased the dentin surface energy, but the effects of APP and 1 -year water storage on dentin bond strength were product dependent. Conclusion: APP increased the dentin surface energy.

40|$|MDPV (3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone) is a {{synthetic}} cathinone illegally marketed as “bath salts” or “plant food” and consumed for its psychostimulant effects {{similar to those}} produced by cocaine, amphetamines and MDMA. Clinical reports indicate that MDPV produce euphoria, increase alertness and at high doses it causes agitation, psychosis, tachycardia and even death (1). In particular, the second {{leading cause of death}} induced by MDPV and other cathinones is associated with self-harm, risky and violent behavior (2, 3). Anecdotal reports suggests that MDPV increases violent aggressive behavior in men similar to that reported for alcohol and cocaine consumption (4). In rodents, MDPV reproduces the typical physiological effects of psychostimulant drugs, showing a greater potency compared to cocaine (5). Nevertheless, its role on aggressive behavior is still unknowns. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of MDPV on aggressive behavior in mice and to compare its action with that induced by cocaine. The Resident-Intruder paradigm in isolated mice (6) was undertaken to investigate the effect of MDPV and cocaine on aggressive behavior. Saline administration causes an increase in aggressive behavior in 7 % of total mice (n= 50) with an increase of bite frequency of + 52 ± 1 % respect to control baseline. Systemic MDPV administration (i. p.) at 0. 1 and 10 mg/Kg causes an increased aggressive behavior in 46 % and 55 % of total mice (n= 50 for each treatment) with an increased frequency of bites of + 134 ± 22 % and + 155 ± 18 % respectively. Similarly, cocaine administration (i. p.) at 0. 1 and 10 mg/Kg causes an increased aggressive behavior in 13 % and 27 % of total mice (n= 50 for each treatment) with an increased frequency of bites of + 82 ± 8 % and + 132 ± 11 % respectively, proving to be less potent than MDPV in inducing aggressive behavior in mice. The aggressive effect caused by MDPV is consistent with the positive modulation on catecholamine release (5) and its powerful action may reflect its stronger ability to inhibit dopamine and norepinephrine uptake respect to cocaine (5). These results show for the first time that MDPV enhance aggressive behavior in mice with grater potency compared to cocaine. This aspect should be carefully investigated for the prevention of interpersonal violence in human induced by novel psychoactive drug consumption. (1) 	Prosser J. M. and Nelson L. S.

40|$|IntroductionDriving {{accidents}} and casualties are the second {{leading cause of}} death in Iran after heart disease. Also, after Sierra Leone, Iran has the highest number of road deaths and injuries among 190 countries of the world. Every 19 minutes one individual is killed in Iran due to road accidents. Every year about 800, 000 accidents occur in Iran on average, as a result of which 23, 000 individuals are killed and 280, 000 are injured and/or disabled (RezaZadeh, 2012). Analyses show that in causing these accidents human factors account for the highest portion (Niat Sadeghi et al. 2005) {{in the sense that it}} is responsible for 60 to 70 % of these accidents (Aminian, 2005). According to research from American Transportation Safety Administration, about 80 % of accidents are due to human errors (Lgr, 1994). By official statistics, 400000 ‬ professional drivers are involved in Iran’s transportation system (Niat Sadeghi et al. 2005). According to the findings of Evans’s (1991) research, there is a strong link between personality characteristics and probability of getting involved in an accident. Amado, et al (2004) showed that personality traits affect driving style and accident rates. Research findings of Naby and colleagues (2005) show that certain personality types are more at risk in driving, because they are reluctant to follow traffic rules. Allport defines personality as “a dynamic organization of physical- psychic systems within the individual which determines his specific thoughts and behaviors" (Allport, 1967, p 28). Likewise, Allport and Odbert define trait as” specific and comprehensive capabilities, entailing a durable condition of adaptation with environment" (Allport and Odbert, 1936, p 26). According to MacCra and Casta (1987) the big 5 personality trains include: 1. Conscientiousness (being reliable, responsible, industrious, and meticulous, which leads to better role performance and control of impulses or disorders in one’s activities) (Peabody and De Raad, 2002). It is also correlated with job performance (Barrick, 2001). 2. Agreeableness (tolerance, patience, peacefulness. It is related with conscientiousness (Ashton et al. 2004). Low score in this train means aggressive behavior (Clark and Robertson, 2005) 3. Extraversion (sociability and energetic participation in group activities) (Zarota, 1995). 4. Neurosis (including antisocial attitudes, criminal behavior, rule violations and disregard for the rights of others, with a negative impact on job performance (Clark and Robertson, 2005) 5. Openness (experimentalism), (creativity, wisdom, philosophical thinking and scientific attitude (Ashton et al, 2004). Many studies have shown that there is a meaningful relationship between personality traits and and road traffic accidents (Ismail, 2010). Gharaei and colleagues (2007) have shown that the mean scores of problems such as paranoid, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, and depression, is higher among professional drivers. These problems may lead to accidents. Likewise, Farahani and Kasirlo’s (2006) indicated in a research that there is a significant difference in big 5 personality traits of rule-breaking drivers and law-abiding drivers. Several studies have also shown that there is a link between the quality of sleeping as a human factor and road accidents. A high percentage of accidents on highways or during work are believed to be the result of drowsiness, and other problems associated with insufficient sleep. It is becoming evident that sleep problems may lead to decrease in production rate at work and weakening of individual and community mental health (Paffenbger et al, 1999 Gillin & Byerle, 1992). As Carter and colleagues (2003) have found it seems sleepiness is more common among professional drivers. Therefore, lack of sleep can cause drowsiness and then increase occupational hazards. Hulbert (1972) has showed that prior to the final stage of falling into sleep while driving, people may: 1. Delay in response to changes in road conditions, 2. Delay in controlling the steering wheel, 3. Reduce electrical skin response to traffic changes and 4. Move more often than the usual (for example, rubbing the eye, closing it, stretching and bending) Also, irritability, aggressive behavior and less social interaction with others are much more common among people who suffer from sleep deprivation (Kelman, 1999; Garbarino et al, 2008). Variables affecting the quality and quantity of sleep include: 1. Age (Morin & Gramling, 1999), 2. Gender (Montgomery, 1998), 3. Types of exercise (aerobic and anaerobic) (Baekeland & Lasky, 1996, Davis, 1998; Shapiro et al, 1995), 4. Type of diet (Johnson et al, 1990), 5 Body mass index (BMI) (Bjorvatn et al, 2007 and McNamara et al, 1993), 6. Type of medication (Mark et al, 1998;). People with chronic insomnia are likely to get involved in road accidents 2. 5 times more than those who sleep sufficiently. Frequent disturbances during sleep may also cause depression, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life and increased health care costs (Bankowski, 2006). Given the importance of what was said so far, the purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between personality traits with road {{accidents and}} sleep quality among Drivers in Isfahan city. Material & MethodsResearch method in this study is descriptive correlation. Research population included all road drivers in Isfahan city in the year 2012, of whom 140 truck drivers, 110 bus drivers, and 50 taxi drivers were randomly selected. Research tools included: 1) Demographic Characteristics Questionnaire. 2) the Big Five Personality Traits Questionnaire (NEO-FFI) : Costa & McCrae's (1990) with 60 questions (MCCrae and Costa, 1987). This questionnaire’s reliability is confirmed by a coefficient from 68 % to 83 %. Cronbach's alpha for each of the dimensions, including, extroversion, openness (quality of experience), Agreeableness, and conscientiousness (work ethics), were respectively, 86 %, 73 %, 56 %, 68 %, and 87 %. 3) Pittsburgh’s Sleep Quality Inventory, with questions which measure poor quality of sleep and sleep disorders. Finally, research hypotheses were examined by correlation measures and stepwise regression analysis. Discussion of Results & ConclusionsThe results of regression analysis showed that variables of neuroticism (P < 0. 01), and acceptance of and compliance to law (P < 0. 05) were able to predict sleep quality in a significant way. Overall, these variables could predict nearly 12 % of sleep disorders. Also, the results of the regression analysis for prediction of road accidents via Com-step character revealed that only neuroticism (P < 0. 05) could predict 3 % of road accidents. Likewise, reduced adaptation leads to inflexibility, reluctance in anger control and lack of relaxation (Ashton et al. 2004). These traits are all associated with increased sleep disturbances and poor quality of life of every individual. Results of Evan’s (1991) study also suggest that there is a link between personality traits and accident involvement. Tsvang and Fleming (1985) concluded that low tolerance in handling stress, immaturity and paranoid conditions, which can be seen in neuroticism, increase the risk of getting involved in accident. The results of similar studies in Iran, including those of Gharaei and colleagues (2007), Shakerinia Mohammad Pour Shateri (2010) and Farahani and Kasirlo (2010) and Mohajer (2003) are consistent with the above finding. Based on the results of this study, we offer three practical suggestions including, 1) providing psychological counseling services in communities where drivers get together (e. g. transportation terminals) with an emphasis on group counseling. 2) performing psychological tests which measure personality traits both randomly and or a regular basis when transportation companies want to hire a driver and during work. 3) Checking travel documents and license confirmations can prevent drivers from turning around such requirements.
