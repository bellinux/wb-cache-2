40|$|Purpose. Classification of {{different}} machining strategies underlying the known methods for <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> with disc-shaped milling tools {{as well as}} preliminary determination of their advantages and disadvantages before profound studies by simulations and experiments. Design/methodology/approach. This paper {{is concerned with the}} analysis of the different methods for <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> with disc-shaped milling tools in order to determine their advantages or disadvantages in terms of flexibility, productivity and machining quality as well as to make a classification of the machining strategies underlying these methods. Findings. By analyzing the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> methods, it was found that they differ in strategies for material removal, tool movement and tool engagement. These strategies define advantages or disadvantages of the machining methods as well as their optimal application areas. Further, it was shown that some of the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> methods are based on similar or even the same machining strategies. Originality/value. The results of the analysis show that none of the known methods for <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> with disc-shaped milling tools is universally applicable. Some of them provide a higher productivity and flexibility, and the others ? a better machining quality. It means that, in order to select a perfectly suitable machining method with the optimal process parameters for each individual manufacturing task and thereby to increase the efficiency of the gear manufacturing, the profound knowledge about achievable productivity, flexibility and quality parameters are required. The proposed classification of the machining strategies underlying the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> methods creates a basis for further theoretical and experimental studies of the mentioned parameters. ?????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????? ????????? ??????? ? ????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ????????, ?????????????????? ? ???????? ?????????. ????? ????, ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????????, ??????? ????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ???? ???????????????? ? ???? ?? ???????...|$|R

So we use the hypoid gear as the gear to obtain high reduction. Then, the spiral angie of the pinion increases and the shape becomes like small tapered crossed helical gears.

The principles are the basis for informational support new level CAD hobs. The theory of shaping the spur gears surface by worm mills has been developed, {{which is based on}} a real kinematic model of the process. The new approaches to the greater accuracy hobs designing, due to the choice of rational parameters of the initial contour milling, have been outlined {{on the basis of the}} developed theory of the spur gears surface shaping by worm mills. In terms of the regrinding surfaces and indexable cutters selection and analysis, we have schemed out the recommendations on the improvement of tool shaping surfaces accuracy fabrication and also on the enhancing of technological fabrication efficacy and the operation cost reduction. The theory of the <b>cutting</b> <b>hobs</b> geometric parameters determination in static and kinematic systems has been refined. The theory resides in the registration of all cutter and wheel movements in the processing and determination of the main movement of cutting mills, which is a cutter and a wheel co-rotation.

On the basis of the research we have worked out a general algorithm and recommendations on the hobs designing, which implement the task of hobs designing in terms of the issue multivariance and the choice of the most appropriate option that would meet the tool?s given conditions of operation. The new advanced milling design and spur gears processing techniques by worm mills have been schemed out, the experimental verification of the proposed cutter designing has been performed and the gears accuracy enhancement by this tool and the tool technological fabrication effectiveness have been evidenced. ? ??????????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ?????? ?????????????? ????????? ????, ??????? ???????? ??????? ??????????????? ??????????? ???? ????????? ???? ?????? ??????. ???????? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????, ? ?????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????. ?? ???? ????????????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????? ????? ?????????? ??????? ???? ??????? ????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ???? ?????????? ????????. ?? ???? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ???? ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ?? ???? ????????????????? ?????? ?? ???????, ??? ???????? ? ???????????? ?? ???????? ? ????? ? ? ??????? ????. ???????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?????? ???????????? ??????????? ???? ????????? ????, ?????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ???? ????? ?? ???? ?? ?????. ?? ?????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????? ? ???????????????? ???????????? ???? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ????? ??????????? ? ????? ?? ????????? ??????????????? ?? ???????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?? ????????????. ????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ?? ???????? ??????????? ???? ????? ? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ?? ??????????????? ?? ???? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????. ??????????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ??????????? ??? ???????????????? ?????????????-?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ????? ? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ???????. ?????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ???? ? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?? ????????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????. ???????? ?????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ???? ? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ???????, ??????? ??????????? ? ????? ???? ???????? ????? ? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????. ?? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????? ????????????? ????? ?????????????? ????????, ??????? ???? ?????????? ???????? ????? ? ??????. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ???? ? ?????, ????????? ? ??????? ???? ? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ????? ??? ?????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ? ?????? ????????? ?????????. ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ????? ????????? ???? ??? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ?? ????? ????????? ??????? ????? ???? ????? ? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ???????????. ?? ???? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ? ????????????, ? ?????????????? ????????? ????, ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ????????? ???? ?? ?????? ????????????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ? ????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????, ??????? ????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ????? ???????????. ??????????? ????? ????????????? ??????????? ???? ? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????, ????????? ????????????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????? ???? ? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????? ????? ???????????? ? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????. ? ??????, ???????????? ??????????? ????? ? ?????????????????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ???? ????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ??????? ????? ???????? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ???????????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????? ?? ???? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?? ???? ?????? ?????? ?????. ???????????? ??????????? ????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ????? ?? ???? ???????? ???????????? ?????? ????? ?? ?????????????? ??????? ?????? ???? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???? ?????. ???????? ?????, ??? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ?????? ????? ????????? ???????. ? ?????????? ???? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ????????? ???????...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of spiral bevel <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with {{spiral bevel gear}} NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed spiral bevel gear NC milling machine to control the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the control of NC machining for the spiral bevel gear...|$|R
