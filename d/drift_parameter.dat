The remarkable features of the proposed algorithm are that it needs no additional data exchanges, slightly increased memory space and computational load comparable to the standard consensus-based Kalman filter.

30|$|In case of {{diffusion}} type processes {{driven by}} fractional Brownian motions, {{the most important}} methods are either maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or least square estimation (LSE). Substantial {{progress has been made}} in this direction. The problem of parameter estimation in a simple linear model driven by a fractional Brownian motion was studied in [3] in the continuous case. For the case of discrete data, the problem of parameter estimation was studied in [4, 5]. Hu and Nualart [6] studied a least squares estimator for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by fractional Brownian motion and derived the asymptotic normality of by using Malliavin calculus. The MLE of the <b>drift</b> <b>parameter</b> has also been extensively studied. Kleptsyna and Le Breton [7] considered one-dimensional homogeneous linear stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion in place of the usual Brownian motion. The asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>drift</b> <b>parameter</b> was analyzed. Tudor and Viens [8] applied the techniques of stochastic integration with respect to fractional Brownian motion and the theory of regularity and supremum estimation for stochastic processes to study the MLE for the <b>drift</b> <b>parameter</b> of stochastic processes satisfying stochastic equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion with any level of Hölder-regularity (any Hurst parameter). Moreover, in recent years, there has been increased interest in studying the asymptotic properties of the MLE for the <b>drift</b> <b>parameter</b> in some fractional diffusion systems (see [9 – 11]). However, MLE has some shortcomings; its expressions of likelihood function are not explicitly computable.
