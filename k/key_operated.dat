5000|$|There {{have been}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} the keyboard to address technical and musical issues. The earliest designs of keyboards were based heavily on the notes used in Gregorian chant (the seven diatonic notes plus B-flat) and as such would often include B and B both as diatonic [...] "white notes," [...] with the B at the leftmost side of the keyboard and the B at the rightmost. Thus, an octave would have eight [...] "white keys" [...] and only four [...] "black keys." [...] The emphasis on these eight notes would continue for a few centuries after the [...] "seven and five" [...] system was adopted, in the form of the short octave: the eight aforementioned notes were arranged at the leftmost side of the keyboard, compressed in the keys between E and C (at the time, accidentals that low were very uncommon and thus not needed). During the sixteenth century, when instruments were often tuned in meantone temperament, some harpsichords were constructed with the G and E keys split into two. One portion of the G <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> a string tuned to G and the other operated a string tuned to A, similarly one portion of the E <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> a string tuned to E, the other portion operating a string tuned to D. This type of keyboard layout, known as the enharmonic keyboard, extended the flexibility of the harpsichord, enabling composers to write keyboard music calling for harmonies containing the so-called wolf fifth (G-sharp to E-flat), but without producing aural discomfort in the listeners (see: Split sharp). The [...] "broken octave," [...] a variation of the aforementioned short octave, similarly used split keys to add accidentals left out of the short octave. Other examples of variations in keyboard design include the Jankó keyboard and the chromatic keyboard systems on the chromatic button accordion and bandoneón.|$|E
50|$|A thumb-shift {{keyboard}} is {{an alternative}} design, popular among professional Japanese typists. Like a standard Japanese keyboard, it has hiragana characters marked in addition to Latin letters, but the layout is completely different. Most letter keys have two kana characters associated with them, which allows all the characters to fit in three rows, like in Western layouts. In {{the place of the}} space bar key on a conventional keyboard, there are two additional modifier keys, operated with thumbs - one of them is used to enter the alternate character marked, and the other is used for voiced sounds. The semi-voiced sounds are entered using either the conventional shift <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> by the little finger, or take place of the voiced sound for characters not having a voiced variant.|$|E

The control key enables a user, who has very little skill, to remove from the core, with a specific combination, {{and replace it with}} a core that has a different combination. In Small Format Interchangeable Cores locks(SFIC), similar to those developed by Frank Best of the Best Lock Corporation, the <b>key</b> <b>operates</b> a separate shear line that is located above the <b>operating</b> <b>key</b> shear line. In Large Format Removable Cores (LFRC), the <b>key</b> may <b>operate</b> a separate shear line or the key may work like a master <b>key</b> along the <b>operating</b> shear line and also contact a separate locking pin that holds the core in the cylinder. SFIC's are transferable from one brand's housing to another, while LFRC's are not.|$|R

50|$|Work {{began at}} Morrison Knudsen in January 1983, with the cars {{receiving}} several upgrades for compatibility with the Arrow IIIs. Almost every part was rebuilt or upgraded, including brakes, couplers, motors, gearboxes, and electrical gear. Among {{some of the}} noticeable changes, the 2-2 seats were replaced with 3-2 seats, increasing {{the capacity of the}} A-car from 100 to 119, and the B car from 96 to 113. In addition, the B-car featured a fold up handicap seat. The toilets were also rebuilt. The sliding doors were rebuilt to be compatible with Arrow III circuitry, and to be sensitive to objects they encounter when closing. The window glass was replaced with polycarbonate glazing. End strobes, new marker lights and a new pilot were installed on the cab ends, and the <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> locks were all standardized to match the Erie Lackawanna coach keys as used on the Arrow III. Finally, the main transformers were cleaned of PCBs and replaced with an EPA approved substitute.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, 1965 saw {{the release}} of the {{redesigned}} Australian Morris Mini Deluxe. The new model featured redesigned doors with conventional interior handles and wind up windows (with quarter vents), hydrolastic suspension, <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> starter, a remote gearshift mechanism (like the Cooper) and the engine was upgraded to the 998 cc version. Production of the Australian Morris Mini Deluxe continued until 1969 when it was replaced with another Australian only model, the Mini K the [...] "K" [...] stands for Kangaroo. The K received the more powerful 1098 cc engine (from the Morris 1100) as well as 4-speed synchromesh transmission and upgraded instruments. It was claimed that the Mini K was produced with 80% local content. Both of the Australia only round-nosed minis were based on the UK Mark I Mini with the production changes from the Mark II Mini never being used in Australia. Production of the round-nosed mini in Australia halted in 1970 with {{the release of}} the new Mini Clubman. The Australian Mini Clubman utilised the same locally designed wind up windows and exterior door hinges as the Morris Mini Deluxe. The Australian Mini had wind up windows many years before their British counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{left thumb}} alone {{operates}} nine keys. B1, B1, C1, D1, D4, C4 (also B4), two keys when combined create A4, and the whisper key. Additional notes {{can be created}} with these keys. The D1 and bottom key above whisper key on the tenor joint creates both C2 and C3. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering setup on the instrument, to create E4 and F4. D4 and C4 together create C4. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A4 are used with slightly altered fingering on the boot joint, B4 is created. The whisper key is used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound. The right thumb operates four keys. The top lever, which is very thin, is used to produce B2 and B3, and is used in B4, C4, D4, F4, and E4. The large, circular key (otherwise known as the [...] "pancake key"), is used in mostly the bass register. From B1 to E1, it is held constantly. It is also used, like the whisper key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in Ravel's [...] "Boléro", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G4. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G4, but with the E1 key (pancake key). The next <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> by the right thumb {{is known as the}} [...] "spatula key". Its primary use is to produce F1 and F2. The bottom key is used the least often. With the combination of the backmost key of the right hand little finger it produces A1 and A2. This is most advantageous in pieces like Dukas's [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". The four fingers of the left hand can each be used in at least two different positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4. The four fingers of the right hand have at least one assignment each. The index finger stays over one hole, except when E4 is played. A side key at the top of the boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it. The ring, with other pads, are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hands pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used in place of the top thumb key on the front of the boot joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F1 is played. F2 is created with this key, as well as G4, B4, B4, and C4. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A1 and 2, but can be used E4, and F4. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the boot joint to create A1 and A2.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} determined whether pigeons minimize {{number of}} key pecks per food delivery and maintain their baseline intake of food while key pecking on a three-component chain schedule. Pigeons at either 80 % or 100 % body weight obtained all their food during baseline and contingency sessions. During baseline sessions, pecks {{on the left and}} center keys had no consequences; each peck on the right key activated the feeder. During contingency sessions, pigeons key pecked on a three-component chain schedule simulating components of a foraging chain. In the search component either 3, 9 or 15 key pecks (varied parametrically across blocks of sessions) on the left key produced a stimulus on the middle key, indicating an encounter with either the low-cost prey (3 key pecks) or an equally probable high-cost prey (21 key pecks). In the procurement component the pigeon pecked either: (a) the left key once, thus returning to the search component, or (b) the middle key either 3 or 21 times, which activated the right response key. In the handling component one peck on the right <b>key</b> <b>operated</b> the feeder. The pigeons always procured the low-cost prey and minimized the {{number of key}} pecks per hopper by procuring the high-cost prey when the search-cost ratio was high (15 key pecks) but not when it was low (3 key pecks). All pigeons maintained their baselines of eating during contingency sessions by key pecking more frequently and eating more efficiently. The 80 % body-weight birds produced higher overall rates of key pecking and eating. These results have implications for ecological theories of optimal foraging and for psychological theories of learned performance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs an {{industry}} matures, company valuations {{shift from a}} revenue driven valuation to a profitability driven valuation. Despite operating in a relatively mature industry, companies in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software segment are still influenced by revenue driven valuations. The nature of the industry, with low delivery costs and high personnel costs, and the on-going switch from packaged software revenues towards “as a service” revenues protect the importance of revenues in this segment. With {{the development of the}} sector, the valuation drivers (<b>key</b> <b>operating</b> performance indicators) shift from revenue growth to profitability. In the ERP software segment top line growth remains the key driver especially with emergence of the Internet of Things and the concept of “Industry 4. 0 ”, where an increasing number of devices are interconnected and can communicate with each other. The article analyses through regression analysis the current revenue and operating profitability based valuation levels of thirteen publicly listed in the ERM software segments against several <b>key</b> <b>operating</b> performance indicators. The results of our research show that future expected revenue growth remains the most important <b>key</b> <b>operating</b> performance indicator and both revenue and profitability driven valuations remain relevant.
