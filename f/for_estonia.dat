25|$|Estonian {{military}} units within the Red Army {{began to be}} formed in January 1942, from among ethnic Estonians living in the USSR. A Soviet source suggests that in May 1942 there were nearly 20,000 Estonians in the national units. The 8th Estonian Rifle Corps, as these units {{came to be called}} after September 1942, reached the front in Velikie Luki in December 1942 and suffered heavy losses in battle as well as the defection of about 1,000 men to the German side. After Velikie Luki the Rifle Corps was replaced with other nationalities from the USSR. The corps' major activity {{in the latter part of}} the war was participation in the battles <b>for</b> <b>Estonia.</b>|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{there was}} tension over the Soviets' moves in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, {{which were in}} the Soviet sphere of influence. All three were given {{no choice but to}} sign a {{so-called}} Pact of defence and mutual assistance which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them. Nazi Germany advised them to accept the conditions. The Baltic states acceded to the Soviet demands and signed mutual assistance treaties on September 28, October 5, and October 10, 1939, respectively (for ten years <b>for</b> <b>Estonia</b> and Latvia and fifteen years for Lithuania). The tension included the internment of a submarine crew in the Orzeł incident. On October 18, October 29, and November 3, 1939, the first Soviet troops entered Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania under the Pact.|$|E
25|$|Another theory suggests, that Päts {{knew of the}} outbreaking {{war between}} Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and was only {{looking for a way}} <b>for</b> <b>Estonia</b> to survive the short period in between. It is {{suggested}} that Päts knew of the difficulty of the situation and tried to keep Estonians as safe as possible by avoiding war with the Soviets and buying time. While trying not to give the Soviet Union a chance to punish the Estonians, he also continuously postponed the mobilization, which eventually never even took place, unlike in Latvia and Lithuania in 1939–1940. Under international law a war would have invalidated the Tartu Peace Treaty. As a lawyer, he also had to understand that his decisions were not valid when forced by an occupying power.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} {{history of the}} Soviet Union began {{in the days following}} the 1917 October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power. In 1918 the new government formed the Red Army, which then defeated its various internal enemies in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22. The years 1918–21 saw defeats for the Red Army in the Polish–Soviet War (1919–21) and in independence wars <b>for</b> <b>Estonia</b> (1918–20), Latvia (1918–20) and Lithuania (1918–19). The Red Army invaded Finland (November 1939); fought the Battles of Khalkhin Gol of May-September 1939 (together with its ally Mongolia) against Japan and its client state Manchukuo; it was deployed when the Soviet Union, in agreement with Nazi Germany, took part in the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and occupied the Baltic States (June 1940), Bessarabia (June–July 1940) and Northern Bukovina (June–July 1940) (from Romania). In World War II the Red Army became a major military force in the defeat of Nazi Germany and conquered Manchuria. After the war, it occupied East Germany and many nations in central and eastern Europe, which became satellite states in the Soviet bloc.|$|E
500|$|After the {{announcement}} of the 2009 extension of the tour, tickets were sold-out immediately.

The Oslo (July 30), Tallinn (August 4), Helsinki (August 6) and Gothenburg (August 9) concerts all sold out on the same day tickets went on sale. In Helsinki, the August 6 performance was the biggest show by one artist ever organized in Finland. In Oslo, all 40,000 tickets available for the July 30 concert were sold in 34 minutes, prompting Live Nation to announce an extra concert on July 29. In Tallinn, all 70,300 tickets available for Madonna's concert at the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds were purchased in just over 24 hours, a record <b>for</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The record previously belonged to Metallica, who sold all of the tickets available for their concert at the same venue in three days. In Tel Aviv, all 50,000 tickets available for the first date were sold out in a few days, causing Live Nation to add a second and final date to wrap up the tour. As expected, after the final show, Sticky & Sweet became the highest grossing tour by a solo artist, earning US $408million ($ in [...] dollars) from 85 shows in 52 countries, with an attendance of 3.5 million. It is the second highest grossing tour of all time, behind The Rolling Stones' 2005–07 A Bigger Bang Tour which earned $558 million ($ in [...] dollars). At the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards, the Sticky & Sweet Tour won the Top Tour and Top Draw prizes, which acknowledge the highest-grossing and highest-attended tours of the year, respectively.
