5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E

A related entity, Templegate Finance Pty Ltd, would also lend finance to investors.|$|E

At the heart of the disputes is the legal concept of the implied covenant of good faith and fair <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> regards to long-term franchise agreements.|$|E

5|$|The tablets were {{produced}} in periods 2 and 3 (c.AD92–103), {{with the majority}} written before AD102. They were used for official notes about the Vindolanda camp business and personal affairs of the officers and households. The largest group is correspondence of Flavius Cerialis, prefect of the ninth cohort of Batavians {{and that of his}} wife, Sulpicia Lepidina. Some correspondence may relate to civilian traders and contractors; for example Octavian, the writer of Tablet 343, is an entrepreneur <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> wheat, hides and sinews, but this does not prove him to be a civilian.|$|E
5|$|Writings {{in various}} {{literary}} genres such as romance, fiction, erotica, folk songs and musical compositions were popular.

5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> a variety of commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and {{their relationship with the}} court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Kimball and Joseph W. Greenhalgh, a Latter-day Saint {{businessman}} {{who served as}} a bishop in one of the local wards, began a small securities business making and purchasing loans from local businesses and individuals. By 1927, the business became independent, and after investing $150 of his own money in the business, Kimball began running it full-time in Safford, Arizona, as the KimballGreenhalgh Agency, <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> local insurance, real estate, debt collection, and bonds. The business suffered greatly during the Great Depression and lost much of its capital between 1930 and 1933. Through continued work and re-investment of profits, it survived the Great Depression and became increasingly successful during the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1943, Kimball's initial $150 investment in the agency was worth nearly $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The Portishead line again saw {{a rise in}} {{use during}} the Second World War, as Bristolians {{evacuated}} to the more rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work, many alighting at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains {{by members of the}} Women's Land Army. Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> herbal medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{major change}} in {{international}} trade was {{the rapid expansion of}} the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather goods. Initially relying on hired ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged as the focus of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.|$|E

5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1899, {{construction}} {{had started}} on shoplots, a pier and government buildings. This new administrative centre was renamed Jesselton after Sir Charles Jessel, who was the then Vice-Chairman of BNBC. Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, <b>dealing</b> <b>in</b> rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The North Borneo Railway was used to transport goods to the Jesselton harbour. The Malay and Bajau uprisings during those times were not uncommon, and BNBC worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region. Jesselton suffered a large-scale destruction when it was razed by the British in their retreat from the Japanese and suffered more destruction when the Allies bombed it in 1945. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Several rebellions against the Japanese military administration took place in Api. One major rebellion in the town occurred on 10 October 1943 by a group called Kinabalu Guerrillas in the Jesselton Revolt consisting of local inhabitants. Japanese forces quelled the rebellion after its leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, {{what remained of the}} town was destroyed again by Allied bombings day and night for over six months as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on 10 September 1945.|$|E
