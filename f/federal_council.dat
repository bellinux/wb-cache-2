5|$|The <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> {{released}} a public statement on 11 July 1958 stating that although {{a world without}} nuclear weapons was in Switzerland's interest, its neighboring countries adopting nuclear weapons would force it to do likewise. On 23 December 1958 the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> instructed the Military Department to study the logistics and execution of attaining nuclear arms. However, efforts remained focused on study and planning rather than implementation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council.</b> In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{teaching}} and professional duties, Laybourne Smith {{was a member}} of the South Australian Institute of Architects, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> of the Australian Institute of Architects, and the Australian Institute of Architects, as well as being on numerous committees and advising the State Government in the formation of both the State Building Act of 1923 and the 1939 Architects Act.|$|E
5|$|The EU's {{institutional}} set up is also {{somewhat similar}} {{to the government of}} Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> rotates between its members each year, in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.|$|E

5|$|The federal Ministry of External Relations and {{its local}} all-union {{affiliates}} would regularly convene at the <b>federal</b> <b>Council</b> of Ministers and its Union Republics branches {{to discuss the}} policy, duties and responsibilities of the MER. This joint gathering led to more participation from the union republics on foreign policy implementation, elaboration and coordination.

5|$|A {{commission}} {{run by the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> of Churches in America sought {{issuance of}} a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and the bill passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions {{under the supervision of}} Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mainline}} Protestant churches, the Presbyterian Church in the USA was {{a founding member}} of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> of Churches (a predecessor to the National Council of Churches) in 1908. During World War I, the PCUSA was a leading contributor to the work of the Federal Council's General War–Time Commission, which coordinated chaplaincy and supported the war effort. From 1918 to 1920, the church participated in a short-lived international ecumenical organization called the Interchurch World Movement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the member}} states of the European Union, if the {{parliament}} has only one chamber, it is wholly directly elected in all cases. If there are two chambers, the lower house is directly elected in all cases, while the upper house can be directly elected (e.g. the Senate of Poland); or indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures (e.g. the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> of Austria); or non-elected, but representing certain interest groups (e.g. the National Council of Slovenia); or non-elected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom).|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens {{to put a}} constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland was {{the last}} Western {{republic}} to grant women the right to vote. Some Swiss cantons approved this in 1959, while {{at the federal level}} it was achieved in 1971 and, after resistance, in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden (one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven member <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> executive being Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984–1989, and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Constitution {{adopted in}} 1848 {{is the legal}} {{foundation}} of the modern federal state. It is among the oldest constitutions in the world. A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level: the bicameral parliament (legislative), the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> {{constitutes}} the federal government, directs the federal administration {{and serves as}} collective Head of State. It is a collegial body of seven members, elected for a four-year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises oversight over the Council. The President of the Confederation is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term; the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions. However, the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers, and remains {{the head of a}} department within the administration.|$|E

5|$|The chancellor, Angela Merkel (22 November 2005–present), is {{the head}} of {{government}} and exercises executive power, similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (<b>Federal</b> <b>Council),</b> which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections, by proportional representation (mixed-member). The members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.|$|E

He also called for the creation of local assemblies in Africa so that Africans could learn how to be autonomous.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a popular}} {{initiative}} {{that sought to}} stop the procurement of the 34 F/A-18 Hornets (chosen by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Council</b> in 1988) to replace the Mirages was defeated {{by a majority of}} 57%. Two versions, a twin-seat D-model and a single-seat C, were built in the United States and flight-tested in 1996, delivered in December 1996and 1998respectively. Thirty-two production kits were shipped to Switzerland for assembly, with the first in service in January 1997and the final aircraft delivered in December 1999. One crashed during workups, leaving 28C's and 5Ds assigned to three squadrons. Seven instructor pilots were trained at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, and the United States Navy also provided two instructors on exchange to train Hornet pilots.|$|E
