40|$|Nine {{members of}} the tetra−n−alkanoyloxy ellagic acid series, ranging from the octanoyl to hexadecanoyl were {{synthesized}} and studied by calorimetry and optical microscopy.

Of these the five members with the longest side chains exhibit in addition a monotropic optically isotropic, and consequently, a cubic mesophase. From miscibility studies it appears that this cubic phase, which we name CD, is different from other cubic mesophases previously identified in non−chiral thermotropic mesogens. This monotropic CD mesophase can be maintained at room temperature in a metastable state <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>week...</b>|$|R
