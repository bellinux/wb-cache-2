The modern <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> {{design has}} {{experienced}} a transition from the industrial society to information society, expanding the scope of design, every time the media and changes in technology have given the new connotation. Interesting interactive new media art experience to inject vitality into the <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design, interactive <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design make the works as a starting point, to guide the audience participation, and interpret new information, {{which led to the}} integrity of the information communication. New media art is the "one " and media art, between art and technology, with the development of science and technology continue to spread content and form their own. The interactive nature of the interesting experience and high-tech magic of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design works blur the media art and <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design limits, expand and deepen the field of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design...|$|R
40|$|Social {{movement}} in Ciliwung river area is an informal group activity specifically focuses {{on environmental issues}} about Ciliwung river, Jakarta, by implementing or rejecting and campaigning the movement. <b>Visual</b> <b>communication</b> design of social movement is very important because good <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design will acquire proper <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> and specific message to support the success of social movement. Exploration of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> for environmental social movement campaign {{to the point of}} finding the right communication media will train the sense of environmental problems, enrich knowledge and insight, strengthen the theory and expert opinion, as well as a reference in <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design. Appropriate message of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> will make it easier to apply the message on the media. The number of visual communications media requires careful thought to decide the use of media in social movement. Ambient mascot creation and election of new media as the media are important in the selection of environmental social movement media. Ethnography was used as method in the study and design then through library research. Field work for approximately one {{and a half years in}} the Ciliwung river environmental activist and community Betawi culture become a fundamental tool for understanding the issues arise in the environment. Research is based on participant observation that strengthens the results which can be applied in the design of <b>visual</b> <b>communication.</b> Mascot is an important finding in this design. Figure which can be a spokesperson or spokespersons for social {{movement in}} the Ciliwung river is the central figure applied in any visual message in the <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design. Mascot also strengthens ambient media as new media in social movement of <b>visual</b> <b>communication.</b> This <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design contributes to <b>Visual</b> <b>Communication</b> Design in its patterns of thinking design phase from starting stages of concept, idea, and reference data exploration, ethnography to visualization stage.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Several {{schools of}} thought {{regarding}} media criticism, derived from diverse disciplines and literary sources, have emerged during the last decade. To examine their application to the <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> media arts such as film and television, this paper: (1) reviews the literature of media criticism; (2) discusses various approaches to <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> media criticism; and (3) provides examples of the application of existing <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> approaches to criticism. Discussion includes parameters of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> media arts, critical approach versus critical method, and selection of criteria {{for the evaluation of}} <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> media arts. The following critical approaches and their applications are examined: journalistic; historical; sociological; rhetorical; narrative; cultural; semiological; psychological; ideological; genre; producer's; and visual literacy. It is suggested that the development of visual media criticism is directly related to and depends upon the development of verified theories of the various <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> media arts.

40|$|The role of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design {{continues}} to increase in importance around the world. In Bahrain, organisations are increasingly considering <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design {{as a means of}} accomplishing organisational goals. The research aims to understand the process by which design managers in organisations in Bahrain manage and evaluate <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> designs to gain strategic advantage. Even though the management of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design has not yet been recognised as a separate category of design management in Bahrain, its processes and approaches may differ from other management applications. This research opens with a contextual overview of the <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design management field, before presenting an understanding of how <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design can be utilised as an innovative approach to the strategic structuring organisational thinking. Methods have been developed for investigating how Bahraini client design managers manage <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design projects. Observational studies and interviews with client design managers and creative directors have been conducted to obtain an understanding of the <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design process, together with evaluation procedures in the Bahraini context. These empirical investigations have {{led to the development of}} a conceptual framework that describes the <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> design management process and the evaluation procedure that is carried out by client design managers in Bahrain. The remainder of this thesis explains the outcomes of each phase of the research. The unique contributions of this study are embodied in a discussion of the findings together with reflections and recommendations for those involved and interested in design management in Bahrain...|$|R
50|$|Because lizards {{that use}} <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> rely on {{being able to}} see other lizards, <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> is common among species that live at {{relatively}} high population densities and frequently come into close contact. <b>Visual</b> <b>communication</b> is well suited for use in many different habitats and can be modified by lizards to accommodate changing habitat conditions e.g.,, so long as individuals come into contact frequently enough.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{similarities}} and differences of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> practices and conventions in the composition and biological sciences disciplines. Although scholars and instructors in Writing across the Curriculum (WAC) and composition have examined disciplinary differences in written communication, little is known about disciplinary differences of <b>visual</b> <b>communication.</b> While writing has been the central focus of composition classes, visuals are often key components of the composing process for individuals working in natural sciences fields like the biological sciences. This dissertation reports the results from a two-part qualitative analysis research project: 1) an examination of how composition and general science-writing textbooks discuss <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> conventions and 2) an evaluation of interviews with six instructors, three from composition and three from the biological sciences, who discuss their professional use of visuals. Specifically, the terms used to describe visuals, the pedagogical topics covered when teaching <b>visual</b> <b>communication,</b> and the participants’ processes for composing and reading visuals were examined. The results indicate that some <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> practices and conventions appear similarly in both the biological sciences and composition disciplines. These similarities center on instructional goals, practices, and concerns. For instance, the participants recognized the importance of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> to effective communication in the disciplines, even though they found gaps in their own instruction, and also observe students struggling with visuals and textbooks lacking strong <b>visuals</b> and <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> instruction. Meanwhile, differences between and within these two disciplines do appear, which center on reading and composing processes and the instruction of those practices. Because these disciplinary distinctions exist, instruction of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> practices also differs across these two disciplines. Notably, though, visuals are crucial components of communication in both disciplines, yet participants in composition and the biological sciences agree that they find a lack of effective <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> instruction. This examination suggests that as WAC and composition instructors clarify their understanding of the use of visuals in a variety of academic writing contexts, they might enhance students’ awareness of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> conventions in composition and potentially aid their transfer of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> skills from composition courses to those in the biological sciences and other disciplines...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} {{study was to explore}} the management intended and subsequent acknowledged meaning of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> found in organisations, specifically those used in shop-floor contexts. In doing so the intention was to generate new insights into the concept and use of <b>visual</b> <b>communication.</b> In organisations, <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> is said, for example, to contribute to and sustain continuous improvement (Jaca et al. 2015), but how can this be known unless it can be measured in some way? To date, due to the fragmented understanding and lack of holistic approaches to investigating <b>visual</b> <b>communication,</b> this remains a subject that is empirically under-theorised and detached from real world professionals and contexts. To access the intended and perceived meaning, the Shannon & Weaver (1949) Communication model has provided the necessary conceptual framework. Although originally created to depict telegraphic communication, it is said to be representative of all forms of communication and was used successfully to theoretically underpin {{this research}}. This structure, through a neo-positivist case study design, has enabled the exploration of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> in a manufacturing environment. Using a number of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, based on the Repertory Grid Analysis design (George Kelly), enabled the themes that are motivating <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> to be operationalised. These methods have put at centre stage the motivation of those involved in the acts of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> by empowering their voices. This has been done whilst retaining a strong focus throughout on practice based issues to ensure the utility in future for researchers and managers {{to make sense of the}} usefulness of real world <b>visual</b> <b>communication.</b> This research has demonstrated how individual managers are bound by the overall imperatives for mass production environments, using <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> to affect control of issues such as capacity, inventory and customer demand. However, what has also been demonstrated is their further orientation towards specific requirements based on the contingency of their sub-environments, i. e. safety, profitability, supply chain issues, etc. The findings of this thesis, in relation to enabling the measurement of <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> meaning within its situated context, contributes to both organisational and management theory. The ability to measure what individuals interpret from different <b>visual</b> <b>communication</b> in comparison to the intended meaning, is a first step to focusing a scientific light on its use and usefulness. Doing this using a direct form of analysis for evaluation, without recourse to specialist statistical analysis, also lends itself to being practised by managers in the future...|$|R
