40|$|The use {{of highly}} charged ions {{increases}} the precision and resolving power, in particular for short-lived species produced at on-line radio-isotope beam facilities, achievable with Penning trap mass spectrometers. This increase in resolving power provides {{a new and}} unique access to resolving low-lying long-lived (T_ 1 / 2 > 50 ms) nuclear isomers. Recently, the 111. 19 (22) keV (determined from γ-ray spectroscopy) isomeric state in ^ 78 Rb has been resolved from the ground state, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of q= 8 + with the TITAN Penning trap at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility.

The measurements were carried out using photoionization mass spectrometry in combination with synchrotron radiation. Absolute partial cross sections &# 963; abs (z+) (z = 1 - 3) for the formation of the ions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> z from C 60 were evaluated by considering the absolute detection efficiencies of photoions in different charge states. Then the absolute total photoionization cross section (&# 963; abs,I) was obtained by summing up all of the &# 963; abs (z+) and compared with available experimental data in the literature. For instance, the, &# 963; abs,I obtained from his study takes the value of 401 Mb at hν = 25. 5 eV. This value is a little smaller than &# 963; abs,A determined by Jaensch and Kamke using the gas chamber technique [R. Jaensch and W. Kamke, Mol. Mater. 13 (2000) 143] (～ 450 ± 213 Mb at 25. 5 eV). Moreover, the &# 963; abs,I curve obtained from his study was combined with the photoabsorption cross section curves of C 60 at hv = 3. 5 - 26 eV in the literature (specifically, the data of Jaensch and Kamke at hv = 11. 4 - 25 eV, and of Yasumatsu et al. at hv = 3. 5 - 11. 4 eV [J. Chem. Phys. 104 (1996) 899] were used), after appropriate alterations of the vapor pressure are taken into account. The oscillator strengths are computed from the composite curve to be 178. 5 and 230. 5 for the hv ranges from 3. 5 to 40. 8 eV and from 3. 5 to 119 eV, respectively. These oscillator strengths agree well with those expected from the Thomas-Kuhn- Reiche sum rule and 60 times the photoabsorption cross section of a carbon atom. Moreover, the &# 963; abs,I curve obtained from his study behaves similarly to the relative photoionization cross section curve reported by Reinköster et al. [J. Phys. B, 37 (2004) 2135]. 　　When a fullerene, in particular C 60 molecule, absorbs a photon of energy ～ 41 eV or above, a highly excited ion of C 60 is produced and then dissociates into smaller ionic and neutral fragments. In his doctoral thesis, description is also made on a design of a new version of photofragment imaging spectrometer, which will be applied to observe the momentum distributions of ionic fragments from large molecules, clusters, and fullerenes. The apparatus consists of several components: circular electrodes, a time-of-flight drift tube, a potential-switcheable mass gate, ion reflector, and a position sensitive detector (PSD). The velocity focusing lens system of Eppink- Parker type [Eppink and Parker, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 68, 3477 (1997) ] realizes high resolution of the photofragment images. Moreover, the mass gate is incorporated inside the tube in order to separate fragment ions with a particular cluster size (e. g. C 58 +) from those with other sizes (e. g. C 60 +, and C 56 +). 　　The optimum arrangement and dimensions of the components are determined from the results of ion trajectories of C 56 +,C 58 + and C 60 + simulated by using the SIMION software. The calculated images of C 58 + ions show that kinetic-energy resolution of 10 meV is achievable. Moreover, a linear dependence between (quasi-linear relation) the y-component of the momentum (Py) and that of the displacement on PSD (Δy) is obtained. This observation allows one to transform the displacement of ionic fragment on PSD to obtain velocity and spatial distribution of a desired fragment. 　　The present momentum imaging spectrometer has been constructed and installed in the end station of beam line 2 B in the UVSOR facility. The preliminary experimental results on Kr sample at room temperature (Kr + and Kr 2 + were focused on to the PSD) obtained using this spectrometer show that ions produced in the ionization region can be focused at the center of the PSD (within 2 mm), if image defocusing due to thermal energy of the molecule is omitted. These experimentally observed results guides us that one of the objectives of the present design is fulfilled. Thus, present momentum imaging spectrometer can be utilized to obtain reliable velocity distributions of the fullerene fragments. From the close analysis of photofragment images, one will be able to decide on which mechanism dominates the fragmentation of fullerene ions between sequential loss of C 2 unit (C 60 - 2 n+ 2 z+ → C 60 - 2 n + + C 2) and single-step two-fragment fission (C 60 + → C 60 - 2 n + +C 2 n) of the parent C 60 + ions. Because three- dimensional velocity distributions are expected to considerably differ for different mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to measure Mn dissolution from a thin porous spinel LiMn{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } electrode by rotating ring-disk collection experiments. The amount of Mn dissolution from the spinel LiMn{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } electrode under various conditions was detected by potential step chronoamperometry. The concentration of dissolved Mn was found to increase with increasing cycle numbers and elevated temperature. The dissolved Mn was not dependent on disk rotation speed, which indicated that the Mn dissolution from the disk was under reaction control. The in situ monitoring of Mn dissolution from the spinel was carried out under various conditions. The ring currents exhibited maxima corresponding to the end-of-charge (EOC) and end-of-discharge (EOD), with the largest peak at EOC.

40|$|The osmotic effect arising {{across a}} porous {{membrane}} separating {{the solution of}} an electrolyte from water (or a more dilute solution) is ordinarily due to both normal osmosis, as it occurs also with non-electrolytes, and to "anomalous" osmosis. It is shown that the normal osmotic component cannot be measured quantitatively by the conventional comparison with a non-electrolytic reference solute. Anomalous osmosis does not occur with electroneutral membranes. Accordingly, with membranes which can be charged and discharged reversibly (without changes in geometrical structure), such as many proteinized membranes, the osmotic effects caused by an electrolyte can be measured both when only normal osmosis arises (with the membrane in the electroneutral state) and when normal as well as anomalous osmosis occurs (with the membrane <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state).</b> The {{difference between these two}} effects is the true anomalous osmosis.

25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a thin target is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. <b>In</b> this technique, <b>a</b> thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state.</b> The recoils are stopped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gas cell and then exit through <b>a</b> small hole <b>in</b> {{the side of the}} cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator.

On {{the basis of the}} three-dimensional structures of PL 1 A [Mayans, Scott, Connerton, Gravesen, Benen, Visser, Pickersgill and Jenkins (1997) Structure 5, 677 - 689] and the modelled enzyme-substrate complex of PL 1 B [Herron, Benen, Scavetta, Visser and Jurnak (2000) Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 8762 - 8769], Asp(154), Arg(176), Arg(236) and Lys(239) were mutagenized. Substituting Arg(236) with alanine or lysine rendered the enzyme completely inactive, and mutagenesis of Arg(176) and Lys(239) severely affected catalysis. The Asp(154) [...] > Arg and Asp(154) [...] > Glu mutant enzymes were only moderately impaired in respect of catalysis. The results strongly indicate that Arg(236), which is sandwiched between Arg(176) and Lys(239), would initiate the reaction upon enzyme-substrate interaction, through the abstraction of the proton at C- 5 of the galacturonopyranose ring. The positively charged residues Arg(176) and Lys(239) are responsible for lowering the pK(a) of Arg(236). Arg(176) and Lys(239) are maintained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>charged</b> <b>state</b> by interacting with Asp(154) or bulk solvent respectively. The deprotonation of the Asp(186) -Asp(221) pair was proposed to be responsible for a pH-driven conformational change of PL 1 A [Mayans, Scott, Connerton, Gravesen, Benen, Visser, Pickersgill and Jenkins (1997) Structure 5, 677 - 689]. Substitution of Asp(186) and Asp(221) by Asn(186) and Asti(221) was expected to stabilize the enzyme. However, the Asp(186) [...] > Asn/Asp(221) [...] > Asn enzyme appeared less stable than the wild-type enzyme, even at pH 6. 0, as evidenced by fluorescence studies. This demonstrates that the pH-dependent conformational change is not driven by deprotonation of the Asp(186) [...] > Asp(221) pair...|$|R

In this paper we explore the nature of excitonic phases induced in Weyl semimetals by long range Coulomb repulsion. Its has been previously shown that short range repulsion leads to a ferromagnetic insulator while short range attraction results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> density wave <b>state.</b> Here we show the the charge density wave is the energetically favored state {{in the presence of}} long range repulsion.

In this Diploma thesis, ions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> were photoionized by using synchrotron radiation for the rst time. This experiment was performed with an electron beam ion trap and an apparatus {{for the analysis of}} photoions, which was designed {{in the course of the}} doctoral thesis of M. C. Simon. Additionally, within this Diploma thesis, the ion-optic of this apparatus was improved by inserting an electrostatic steering einzel lens. By the new method the photoionization of N 3 +, Ar 8 +; 10 +; 12 + and Fe 12 +; 14 + was realized. In this thesis the data regarding Ar 8 + are evaluated and compared with theory. For the rst time an ionization threshold of <b>a</b> highly <b>charged</b> ion was determined by the use of photons. High accuracy was achieved, which allows for the testing of relativistic energy contributions...|$|R
