50|$|Cynosurus is a genus of Eurasian and North African {{plants in}} the grass family. Plants in this genus are known {{generally}} as <b>dogstail</b> grass. They are native to the Mediterranean Basin and neighboring regions, but some have been introduced into Australia as well as North and South America.|$|E
50|$|Unimproved, herb-dominated neutral {{grassland}} consisting of: crested <b>dogstail</b> (Cynosurus cristatus), {{common knapweed}} (Centaurea nigra), red fescue (Festuca rubra), yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens), quaking grass (Briza media), spring-sedge (Carex caryophyllea), glaucous sedge (Carex flacca), red clover (Trifolium pratense), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), common bird-foot-trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). Less frequent species are lady's-mantle (Alchemilla vulgaris), dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), corky-fruited water-dropwort (Oenanthe pimpinelloides) and adders-tongue (Ophioglossum vulgatum).|$|E
50|$|Cynosurus echinatus is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names bristly <b>dogstail</b> grass, rough dog's-tail and {{hedgehog}} dogtail. It is native to southern Europe, and it is known in the Americas and Australia as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed. An herbicide-resistant strain can be found growing as a weed in canola and wheat fields in Chile. This is an annual grass growing 10 to 50 centimeters tall. The inflorescence is a rounded or oval cluster or series of clusters of spikelets. The fertile spikelet has an awn up to a centimeter long. The awns clumped closely together into a tuft gives the inflorescence its bristly, hairy appearance.|$|E

(2) A preliminary evaluation of various lines of different origin which may be of value in aiding future mass selection. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{commercial}} lines of seed of Crested <b>Dogstail</b> often exhibit marked differences in colour, some samples in bulk being canary yellow while others are almost black. There is often great variation within a line in the colour of the individual seeds which may vary from greenish yellow through various shades of yellow, orange, and brown to almost a black colour. In some samples, however, the range in colour is more restricted, such samples naturally exhibiting a more uniform appearance. It is important to understand at the outset the commercial attitude towards the colour of a sample. Until recently the great demand by farmers was for seed of a bright yellow colour, which, although of a lower bushel weight than darker seed, was nevertheless more attractive in appearance. As a general rule the germination was good so that as far as utilisation in New Zealand was concerned this type was satisfactory. General observations have shown that there are distinct differences between plants in regard to the colour of the seeds at comparable stages in growth. It was considered that any data which could throw light on colour development and further facts on its probable utility would be useful. The investigations recorded in Part 1. were carried out with the object of attempting to ascertain whether the darkness in colour of Crested <b>Dogstail</b> seed is due to maturity alone, or whether there are other factors concerned...|$|E
