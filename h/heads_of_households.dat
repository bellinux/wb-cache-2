All HouseGuests, excluding the <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> and nominees, would later vote to determine which of the two nominees should be evicted, and the nominated HouseGuest who received the most votes was evicted during Thursday's live episode.

5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified.

Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E

The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members (only <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> were considered members at that time).

The rabbis of Beth Elohim and Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi.

25|$|Women outnumbered men {{in every}} age group besides 15 and under; the {{imbalance}} was most severe in the 25-39 age group, with only 71 men for every 100 women.

Although many <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> qualified for New Zealand immigration due to their professional qualifications, they find only unskilled work is available to them due to their poor English skills.

Endurance competitions are often held after game changing announcements, such as when a previously evicted HouseGuest returns. Various endurance competitions may have punished or reward contestants who either fall off first or last. Skill based competitions also appear frequently throughout the season, some of which may last for numerous hours. Skill competitions are sometimes finished during the live eviction broadcast. The final <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> competition <b>of</b> each season features three rounds; the first is endurance, the second is skill, and the final is question based.

These changing attitudes may partly explain the witch hunts that occurred after the Reformation and in which women were the largest group of victims.|$|E

A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population.

500|$|Winthrop gave {{a speech}} to the General Court in July 1645, stating that {{there are two kinds of}} liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, [...] "evil as well as good," [...] a liberty that he {{believed}} should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was [...] "the proper end and object of authority", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare. He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds. Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson. He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.|$|E
