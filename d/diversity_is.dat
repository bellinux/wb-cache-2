Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure. The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization.|$|E

5|$|Fish species <b>diversity</b> <b>is</b> roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and {{freshwater}} ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific {{constitute the}} center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Most nuthatches {{breed in}} the {{temperate}} or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two species {{have adapted to}} rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest <b>diversity</b> <b>is</b> in Southern Asia, and similarities between the species have {{made it difficult to}} identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.|$|E
5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that {{are not easy to}} classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist <b>diversity</b> <b>is</b> high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E

40|$|Very little {{information}} {{is available on the}} diversity and structure of microbial communities in marine subtidal sediments, especially for micro-eukaryotes. In the framework of the Belgian MICROMET project, we investigated spatial and seasonal (February vs July) variation patterns in the molecular diversity of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic communities in 9 subtidal stations in the Belgian Continental Plate (BCP) in relation to sediment granulometry, geochemistry and metal contamination. Microbial <b>diversity</b> <b>was</b> determined using DGGE and clone libraries based on the SSU rDNA gene; metals were determined using DET/DGT. Sediments ranged from sandy and well oxygenated to muddy, anoxic and heavily metal contaminated. Eukaryotic <b>diversity</b> <b>was</b> surprisingly high (20 - 50 phylotypes per station) and was dominated by Stramenopila (mainly diatoms), Metazoa and Fungi, and to a lesser degree by Protozoa (Alveolata, Cercozoa, Foraminifera). While no clear trends in eukaryotic diversity between stations or seasons were found, community composition showed pronounced differences between sandy and muddy stations; seasonal differences were less marked. Archaeal <b>diversity</b> <b>was</b> very low to non-detectable in all stations.

5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put new perspectives and priorities into its conservation biology.

5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing.
