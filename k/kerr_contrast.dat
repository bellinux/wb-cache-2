40|$|A {{different}} domain {{observation technique}} by modulation of a polarizing plane {{has been developed}} for Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets. A liquid crystal element inserted in a longitudinal Kerr microscope is used as an optical modulator to acquire a reference image needed to enhance <b>Kerr</b> <b>contrast</b> by image processing. Domain images of the Nd-Fe-B magnet can be clearly observed by this technique in a high magnetic field up to 4. 4 kOe. It was found that polishing of the sintered magnet reduced its coercive force.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of {{the movement of the}} two domain walls that make up the onion state in 5 &# 956;m Permalloy rings have been studied under rotation using longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect. Resistance to the domain wall motion was added by making rings with a cleaved edge known as D-rings. The longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect signal contrast was selectively enhanced for different parts of the rings by layers of ZnS optical coating. The contrast enhancement was used to get more information from the captured signal. The micromagnetic rings were fabricated using electron beam lithography and physical vapor deposition. To support the experimental results simulations of the magnetization dynamics were performed and a model predicting the captured signal curves for different setups was developed. The onion state was rotated using an external magnetic field. Together with quarter-coating of the ring this showed two distinct domain walls moving around the ring. When the strength of the external driving field was decreased below a certain threshold there was a sudden change in <b>Kerr</b> <b>contrast</b> consistent with a transition to the vortex state. D-rings with increasing amounts of cutoff showed an increasing resistance to the movement of the domain walls through increased pinning. This also increased the field strength for which the onion state could no longer be rotated without collapsing into the vortex state. </p...|$|E
40|$|Time-resolved {{scanning}} Kerr microscopy (TRSKM) is {{a powerful}} technique for the investigation of picosecond magnetization dynamics at sub-micron length scales {{by means of the}} magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). The spatial resolution of conventional (focused) Kerr microscopy using a microscope objective lens is determined by the optical diffraction limit so that the nanoscale character of the magnetization dynamics is lost. Here we present a platform to overcome this limitation by means of a near-field TRSKM that incorporates an atomic force microscope (AFM) with optical access to a metallic AFM probe with a nanoscale aperture at its tip. We demonstrate the near-field capability of the instrument through the comparison of time-resolved polar Kerr images of magnetization dynamics within a microscale NiFe rectangle acquired using both near-field and focused TRSKM techniques at a wavelength of 800 nm. The flux-closure domain state of the in-plane equilibrium magnetization provided the maximum possible dynamic polar <b>Kerr</b> <b>contrast</b> across the central domain wall, and enabled an assessment of the magneto-optical spatial resolution of each technique. Line profiles extracted from the Kerr images demonstrate that the near-field spatial resolution was enhanced with respect to that of the focused Kerr images. Furthermore, the near-field polar Kerr signal (~ 1 mdeg) was more than half that of the focused Kerr signal, despite the potential loss of probe light due to internal reflections within the AFM tip. We have confirmed the near-field operation by exploring the influence of the tip-sample separation, and have determined the spatial resolution to be ~ 550 nm for an aperture with a sub-wavelength diameter of 400 nm. The spatial resolution of the near-field TRSKM was in good agreement with finite element modelling of the aperture [...] .

40|$|Combined field- and current-induced {{domain wall}} (DW) motion in Permalloy microwires is studied using fast {{magneto-optical}} Kerr-microscopy. On increasing the current density, {{we find a}} decrease of <b>Kerr</b> signal <b>contrast,</b> corresponding {{to a reduction in}} the magnetization, which is attributed to Joule heating of the sample. Resistance measurements on samples with varying substrates confirm that the Curie temperature is reached when the magneto-optical contrast vanishes and reveal the importance of the heat flow into the substrate. By tuning the laser power, DWs can be pinned in the laser spot, which can thus act as a flexible pinning site for DW devices...|$|R

Time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy (TRSKM) is a powerful technique for the investigation of picosecond magnetization dynamics at sub-micron length scales {{by means of the}} magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). The spatial resolution of conventional (focused) Kerr microscopy using a microscope objective lens is determined by the optical diffraction limit so that the nanoscale character of the magnetization dynamics is lost. Here we present a platform to overcome this limitation by means of a near-field TRSKM that incorporates an atomic force microscope (AFM) with optical access to a metallic AFM probe with a nanoscale aperture at its tip. We demonstrate the near-field capability of the instrument through the comparison of time-resolved polar Kerr images of magnetization dynamics within a microscale NiFe rectangle acquired using both near-field and focused TRSKM techniques at a wavelength of 800 nm. The flux-closure domain state of the in-plane equilibrium magnetization provided the maximum possible dynamic polar <b>Kerr</b> <b>contrast</b> across the central domain wall and enabled an assessment of the magneto-optical spatial resolution of each technique. Line profiles extracted from the Kerr images demonstrate that the near-field spatial resolution was enhanced with respect to that of the focused Kerr images. Furthermore, the near-field polar Kerr signal (∼ 1 mdeg) was more than half that of the focused Kerr signal, despite the potential loss of probe light due to internal reflections within the AFM tip. We have confirmed the near-field operation by exploring the influence of the tip-sample separation and have determined the spatial resolution to be ∼ 550 nm for an aperture with a sub-wavelength diameter of 400 nm. The spatial resolution of the near-field TRSKM was in good agreement with finite element modeling of the aperture. Large amplitude electric field along regions of the modeled aperture that lie perpendicular to the incident polarization indicate that the aperture can support plasmonic excitations. The comparable near-field and focused polar Kerr signals suggest that such plasmonic excitations may lead to an enhanced near-field MOKE. This work demonstrates that near-field TRSKM can be performed without significant diminution of the polar Kerr signal in relatively large, sub-wavelength diameter apertures, while development of a near-field AFM probe utilizing plasmonic antennas specifically designed for measurements deeper into the nanoscale is discussed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the THz-field induced orientation of molecules in {{the liquid state}} {{by means of the}} <b>Kerr</b> effect. In <b>contrast</b> to an optical or near-infrared excitation, THz photons have frequencies below the intramolecular vibrations and therefore leave the internal structure of the molecule mostly unaffected. We find experimental evidence for a THz-induced optical birefringence, which provides evidence for molecular orientation. Experimental data on anethole and water reveal the potential application for molecular re-orientation during ultrafast chemical reactions...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{enhanced}} longitudinal magnetooptic <b>Kerr</b> effect signal <b>contrast</b> in thin-film nanomagnetic disks with in-plane magnetization {{when combined with}} dielectric layers that provide impedance matching to the structure and the underlying substrate. Kerr signals can increase {{by a factor of}} three, while substrate reflectance is almost completely suppressed. This leads to an increase in Kerr ellipticity relative to the background intensity and a subsequent improvement in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. Measurements using a beam focused on opaque 400 -nm Ni disks yield contrast improvements of a factor of 8. Arrays of nanodisks demonstrate more complex behavior due to diffraction effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} of null geodesics in the STU {{family of}} rotating black hole solutions of supergravity theory, {{which may be}} considered as deformations of the vacuum Kerr metric, are completely integrable. We propose that they {{be used as a}} foil to test, for example, with what precision the gravitational field external to the black hole at the centre of our galaxy is given by the <b>Kerr</b> metric. By <b>contrast</b> with some metrics proposed in the literature, the STU metrics satisfy by construction the dominant and strong energy conditions. Our considerations may be extended to include the effects of a cosmological term. We show that these metrics permit a straightforward calculation of the properties of black hole shadows.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to detect {{optically}} the influence of the orientation of magnetization vector on the electronic structure of a ferromagnetic metal which appears {{as a result of the}} spin-orbit interaction. A new magneto-optical effect named orientation effect δor was discovered at the geometry of the equatorial <b>Kerr</b> effect. In <b>contrast</b> to the usual magneto-optical effects it is characterized by the quadratic dependence on the magnetization, extremely great anisotropy and a peculiar dependence on the wavelength of the light. Two methods of classical description of δor by means of introducing an additional anisotropic term into the diagonal or nondiagonal component of the dielectrical permeability tensor are suggested. A method of experimental determination of the validity of one of these descriptions is given. Different possibilities of using δor for the identification of the interband transitions in ferromagnetic metals and alloys are considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} optical {{coatings}} on the longitudinal magneto-optic Kerr effect response from 10 nm thin films of permalloy (Ni 84 Fe 16) has been studied. Enhancement of the magneto-optic <b>Kerr</b> effect signal <b>contrast</b> {{of a factor}} 1. 76 has been observed for P- polarized incident light on a trilayer configuration of aluminium, magnesium fluoride, and permalloy. A quadrilayer structure where the trilayer is overcoated with zinc sulphide enhances the signal contrast by a factor 4. 05 for P-polarized light. The enhancement is also observed for S-polarized light, and is shown to be reproducible using nickel as the magnetic material and gold instead of aluminium. The experimental data are compared to a simplified theoretical model where the electric field components are calculated using a 4 x 4 matrix algorithm. The model {{is found to be}} inadequate in predicting the longitudinal magneto-optic Kerr effect response from complex multilayer structures. This is believed to be due to a simplification in the model disregarding the phase factors of the different components reflected off the multilayered samples...|$|R
