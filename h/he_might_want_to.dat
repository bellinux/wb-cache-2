5|$|During his loan spell at Millwall, Doyle had {{suggested}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{stay with the}} club on a permanent basis, despite the offer of a new contract from his parent club. However, {{at the end of}} the season he signed a two-year deal with Birmingham. Because Vaesen's contract had expired, there was an expectation that Doyle would step up to second-choice goalkeeper behind Maik Taylor. Doyle played his first competitive match for Birmingham in their League Cup first-round match against Shrewsbury Town on 22 August 2006, in which he kept a clean sheet as his club won 1–0. With Taylor injured, Doyle made his first league appearance for Birmingham four days later in a 2–0 defeat away to Cardiff City. Doyle played in the second and third rounds of the League Cup, against Wrexham and Sheffield United, before losing his place in the cup team to Taylor for the quarter-final defeat to Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|The Kenzeiki further {{states that}} he found no answer to his {{question}} at Mount Hiei, {{and that he was}} disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of Onjō-ji Temple (園城寺), asking him this same question. Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> consider studying Chán in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist Myōan Eisai, Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (建仁寺), under Eisai's successor, Myōzen (明全).|$|E

A domain expert (or business analyst) might want to specify what should happen when someone is setting up a starting configuration of the game grid.

2500|$|When {{he first}} saw Look Back in Anger, Laurence Olivier was dismissive, viewing the play as unpatriotic and bad theatre, [...] "a travesty on England". At the time, Olivier was making a film of Rattigan's The Prince and the Showgirl co-starring Marilyn Monroe, and she was {{accompanied}} to London by her then-husband Arthur Miller. Olivier asked the American dramatist what plays <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see in London. Based on its title, Miller suggested Osborne's work; Olivier tried to dissuade him, but the playwright was insistent {{and the two of}} them saw it together.|$|E
2500|$|Without a band, Smith {{was left}} [...] "wondering {{what to do}} next," [...] before he [...] "literally bumped into Steve [...] and Dave," [...] who asked if <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> reconsider joining. After a {{successful}} audition, Smith debuted with the band on a German TV show, before setting out on a UK tour and recording the Killers album, released in 1981. Smith's first song-writing contributions appeared on The Number of the Beast, co-penning [...] "Gangland" [...] and [...] "The Prisoner", {{as well as the}} previously mentioned [...] "22 Acacia Avenue", after which he began co-writing many songs with singer Bruce Dickinson, on the following Piece of Mind album.|$|E
2500|$|Save Rock and Roll was {{recorded}} primarily at Rubyred Recordings in Santa Monica, California from October 2012 to March 2013. The band's main {{goal was to}} reinvent {{the sound of the}} group from scratch, creating what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band", which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without their difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not be made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown". When the band members learned that Elton John was a fan of their music, they jokingly suggested that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> record with them. John complied, and Stump flew to Atlanta late in production, halting the mixing process, to record with him. He was very positive regarding the album's direction: [...] "He actually spoke up for the album's title. He came in and was like, 'Love the album title. Love where this is going. This is great, said Stump.|$|E

All the same, she was glad he had been cheated and the reward for his {{wrongdoing}} had gone. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep it, and her refusal to share it might have separated them. Still she would not think about this yet. She must break down his stern calm and much depended on the line she took.|$|R
2500|$|Sohail {{played a}} big role in Pakistan's World-Cup triumph in 1992, famously telling Ian Botham that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> send his {{mother-in-law}} in to bat, referring to Botham's statement that he wouldn't send even his mother-in-law to Pakistan, after Botham was controversially given out for nought in the final. [...] Sohail's most infamous moment on the cricket field, however, was in the 1996 World Cup Quarter Final against arch rival India in Bangalore. [...] Sohail was captaining the side in pursuit of a relatively large target of 287 in 49 overs. [...] With opening partner Saeed Anwar, he got Pakistan off to a flying start. [...] With the score at 109 for one, and Saeed Anwar (48) back in the pavilion, Sohail smashed a delivery from Indian seamer Venkatesh Prasad through the covers for four. [...] Both players exchanged words, and Sohail unnecessarily pointed his finger aggressively at Prasad. [...] The next delivery clean-bowled him and triggered a batting collapse which ultimately lost the game and eliminated Pakistan from the competition.|$|E
2500|$|After several delays, {{director}} Oliver Stone finally started {{production on}} the film The Doors, based on the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do with the story because Kilmer didn't believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, that {{were not part of}} the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told [...] "a thousand different ways" [...] and didn't want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed. Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Jim Morrison's songs prior to his audition, and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but Paul Rothchild (the original producer of The Doors) said [...] "I was shaken by it" [...] and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.|$|E

5000|$|Wilson {{has responded}} to {{criticism}} by observing that uranium was not actually discussed at the 1999 meeting. On Meet the Press, for example, Wilson stated: At that meeting, uranium was not discussed. It would be a tragedy {{to think that we}} went to war over a conversation in which uranium was not discussed because the Niger official was sufficiently sophisticated to think that perhaps <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> discuss uranium at some later date.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Whitesnake {{released}} {{their first}} studio album {{in more than}} a decade, Good to Be Bad. The album was well-received, and charted in several countries. Whitesnake guitarist Doug Aldrich revealed that he had started coming up with song ideas for a followup in 2009, a year after Good to be Bad was released. Aldrich also noted that [...] "David Whitesnake frontman had said that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>wanted</b> sic <b>to</b> make a record and maybe it could be more acoustic-based." ...|$|R

50|$|Concerning the Four {{sights and}} how they {{impacted}} the Buddha: 26. Q: Why should these sights, so familiar to everybody, have caused him {{to go into the}} jungle? A. We often see such signs. He had not; and they made a deep impression on his mind. 27. Q: Why had he not also seen them? A: The astrologers had foretold at his birth that he would one day resign his kingdom and become a Buddha. The King, his father, not wishing to lose his son, had carefully prevented his seeing any sights that might suggest to him human misery and death. No one was allowed even to speak of such things to the Prince. He was almost like a prisoner in his lovely palaces and flower gardens. They were surrounded with high walls; and inside everything was made as beautiful as possible, so that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go and see the sorrow and distress that are in the world. 28. Q: Was he so kind-hearted that his father feared <b>he</b> <b>might</b> really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice himself for the world’s sake? A: Yes; he seems to have felt for all being so strong a pity and love as that.|$|R
50|$|Speculators {{perform a}} risk bearing role {{that can be}} {{beneficial}} to society. For example, a farmer might be considering planting corn on some unused farmland. However, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do so because he is concerned that the price might fall too far by harvest time. By selling his crop in advance at a fixed price to a speculator, he is now able to hedge the price risk and so he can plant the corn. Thus, speculators can actually increase production through their willingness to take on risk (not {{at the loss of}} profit).|$|R

50|$|At {{the very}} beginning, {{one of the}} doubts that arise from reading the work is why the author chose the Catalan {{language}} instead of an other, like French or Spanish. Although Villalonga mocked those who used it and didn't have a great faith {{in the future of}} the language, it is worth noting that, before writing this novel, he had already written several works in Catalan. A possible answer to this question could be that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give the work more plasticity, in other words, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> face the Majorcan society more easily.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{thought of}} the bears that he {{expected}} to see on the mountain, and ran to tell Jonas. Jonas was glad to go. So he went and gave Old Trumpeter some oats, and got the saddle and bridle ready. He also got {{out a pair of}} saddle-bags that he always used on such occasions, and put into them a hatchet, a dipper, a box of matches, and some rope. On second thoughts, he concluded {{it would be best to}} put these things into the chaise-box, and to put the saddle-bags on his horse empty, as <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> bring something home in.|$|R

"That {{will be very}} simple, Mr. Atherton, as I {{have already}} spoken to them," [...] and she at once got up and moved across to two girls of about {{thirteen}} and seventeen respectively, who were standing together watching the passing ships, and entered into conversation with them.

60|$|As Peter had prophesied, Ben-Ahmed {{did indeed}} leave no stone unturned to recover Hester Sommers, {{but there was}} one {{consideration}} which checked him a good deal, and prevented his undertaking the search as openly as he wished, and that was the fear that the Dey himself might get wind of what he was about, and so become inquisitive as to the cause of the stir which so noted a man was making about a runaway slave.

There was evidence in his past that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> [...] "start again". He was from a well-to-do family and never needed money. Later on, he tried various get-rich-quick schemes that failed. He flunked his first semester at the University of Akron because he concentrated more on his hamburger stand than his studies. As an adult, he barely made enough money to maintain the lifestyle he was used to, and got into trouble with the IRS, trying to save money by not paying taxes.|$|R
