5|$|The {{album was}} {{critically}} well received {{but was not}} a chart success, which led to frustration within the band and David Sinclair's departure. Nevertheless, it has remained in print and sold steadily, and been recommended by critics as a good introduction to the Canterbury Scene genre. The band look back favourably on the album and several of <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> have remained fixtures in Caravan's live repertoire. It has been reissued several times, including a comprehensive 40th anniversary remix package by British musician and producer Steven Wilson in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The title marked Codemasters' {{debut in}} {{developing}} a mobile game internally. The goal {{of the project was}} to create a core, rally racing experience for mobile devices.

Original vehicle models were reused however aspects of the game's graphics were enhanced to provide the higher visual quality expected by modern standards. Numerous sound assets were replaced with samples from other Codemasters driving games.|$|E
5|$|There {{was still}} enough mining {{to keep the}} railroads busy, but not for long. In 1897 the Midland went bankrupt. It {{continued}} operating, and a new company formed under the same name to take over. In 1919 Smuggler Mine, the city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. <b>Its</b> <b>tracks</b> and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

5|$|Lloyd {{negotiated}} with Curb {{to distribute the}} group's fifth and final album on Forward Records. Released in 1970, Markley insisted the album, originally self-titled, should be released under the name Markley, A Group. The album benefited from the full involvement and production experience of Lloyd, who sang {{the majority of the}} lead vocals, provided keyboards, and organized the orchestral arrangements. Danny Harris was a key influence on the album, writing half of <b>its</b> <b>tracks.</b> However, although the album is generally considered an improvement over Where's My Daddy?, the group could no longer cope with Markley's erratic behavior, and disbanded soon after the album's release.|$|E

5|$|Marysville was {{formally}} platted on February 25, 1885, {{filed by the}} town physician J. D. Morris and dedicated by the Comefords. More settlers began to arrive {{after the completion of}} the town's first sawmill in 1887, joined by three others {{by the end of the}} decade. Marysville was officially incorporated as a fourth-class city on March 20, 1891, with a population of approximately 400 residents and Mark Swinnerton serving as the city's first mayor. The Great Northern Railway also completed construction of <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> through Marysville in 1891, building a drawbridge over Ebey Slough and serving the city's sawmills. A newspaper named the Marysville Globe was established by Thomas P. Hopp in 1892 and continues to be published for the city.|$|E

Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had gone into effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project in <b>its</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Red Line is {{the only}} line in the system that does not share <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> with another Metrorail line.

Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route when traveling the Capitol Limited route between Washington and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the Silver Spring and Rockville stations between Washington and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville between Washington and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|The line {{continued}} to serve local passenger and freight trains for decades, but flooding in August 1955 destroyed the critical bridge work in Putnam {{and lead to}} its closure in the 1960s. Several years after its abandonment the railroad was sold to Connecticut's Department of Transportation. By 1983, the abandoned railroad bridge had its span sealed off and <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> lifted. The bridge is in the Salmon River State Forest and {{is a part of}} the Air Line State Park Trail. A new wooden bridge allows transportation over the Blackledge River. Constructed prior to 2007, the new wooden bridge decks the railroad bridge. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection was assisted by the Coast Guard Academy and the 192nd Engineering Battalion of the Connecticut National Guard.|$|E
5|$|While XXXVI Corps was {{struggling}} against the Soviets, III Corps' situation {{was not much}} better, despite reinforcements arriving from the transfers of XXXVI Corps to the south. Group F's new drive on Ukhta was immediately stopped in <b>its</b> <b>tracks</b> by recent reinforcements of the 88th Rifle Division. The Soviets now launched a heavy counterattack. The Finns, who were still reorganising with the recently arrived German units for a revived push to the east, were forced to retire. To counter the new threat AOK Norwegen now threw in everything it had available to bolster the Finnish front. New assignments included another regiment from XXXVI Corps as well as parts of the 14th Finnish Infantry Regiment pulled from Operation Platinum Fox, the German front in the far north. The new reinforcements helped to stabilise the front.|$|E
5|$|A second {{column of}} 25 T-34 tanks {{approached}} the Task Force within an hour. This second T-34 formation advanced singly or by twos, and threes, close together {{with no apparent}} formal organization. The howitzer battery hit another tank from this column in <b>its</b> <b>tracks,</b> disabling it, and damaged three more. The North Korean tanks had destroyed the forward howitzer (number six) and wounded one of its crew members, had killed or wounded an estimated twenty infantrymen, and had destroyed all the parked vehicles behind the infantry line. At the main battery position {{one of the five}} remaining 105mm guns had been slightly damaged by a near-hit. Several {{of the men in the}} artillery battery began deserting their positions but Perry managed to convince most of them to return. Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age, the ineffectiveness of the 2.36-inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor. Because of peacetime defense cutbacks the 24th Infantry Division had never received improved U.S. M20 3.5-inch bazookas with M28A2 HEAT antitank ammunition, capable of defeating Soviet tanks. After the last tanks passed their lines, no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour.|$|E

5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above <b>its</b> <b>tracks,</b> which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. <b>Its</b> <b>tracks</b> are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E

The Florida East Coast Railway Station in Hallandale Beach was nearly destroyed. Windows and roofs were damaged in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, but damage was minor overall. At the latter, the storm also downed power lines, telephone wires, and trees, and destroyed car garages. The hurricane caused two fatalities in the city. In Pompano Beach, the recently constructed Pompano Theater was severely damaged. The Kester Building, a drug store, and {{a grocery store}} also suffered impact. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed.
