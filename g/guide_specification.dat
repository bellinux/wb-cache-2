40|$|The Bolu viaduct is a 2. 3 km long seismically {{isolated}} structure whose {{construction was}} nearly complete {{when it was}} struck by the 1999 Duzce earthquake in Turkey. It suffered complete failure of the seismic isolation system and narrowly avoided total collapse due to excessive superstructure movement. This paper presents an evaluation of the design of the viaducts seismic isolation system and an assessment of its performance in the Duzce earthquake. The evaluation revealed that the seismic isolation system did not meet the requirements of the AASHTO <b>Guide</b> <b>Specifications</b> for Seismic Isolation Design. Analysis of the viaduct with motions scaled in accordance to the AASHTO <b>Guide</b> <b>Specifications</b> resulted in a displacement demand equal to 820 mm, which is far more than the 210 mm displacement capacity of the existing isolation system. Analysis of the viaduct for a simulated near-fault ground motion with characteristics consistent with the site conditions resulted in an isolation system displacement demand equal to 1400 mm. This indicates that even if the isolation system had been designed in compliance with the AASHTO <b>Guide</b> <b>Specifications</b> it would have still suffered damage in the earthquake...|$|R

50|$|Standardizing the {{presentation}} of such information improves communication among all parties involved in construction projects. That helps the project team deliver structures to owners according to their requirements, timelines, and budgets. An indication of the widespread acceptance of MasterFormat is that the ASTM standard for sustainability assessment of building products relies on MasterFormat to organize the data. MasterFormat is an integral component of the SpecsIntact system. SpecsIntact (Specifications Kept Intact), is an automated specification processing system for preparing certain government facility construction projects using standard master specifications, called Master Text or Masters, supplied by each of three government agencies. SpecsIntact {{was developed by the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and designed for use by engineers, architects, interior designers, specification writers, project managers and construction managers. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) and the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has also adopted SpecsIntact as their standard specifications system, greatly facilitating the effort to standardize construction specifications throughout these agencies. These services utilize MasterFormat from UFGS (United Facilities <b>Guide</b> <b>Specification)</b> sections found on the Whole Building Design Guide website.|$|E
40|$|Property {{modification}} {{factors have}} been introduced into the AASHTO <b>Guide</b> <b>Specification</b> for Seismic Isolation Design to account for likely variations in isolation bearing properties {{over the life of}} a seismically isolated bridge. The design of an isolated bridge in the United States must now account for variations in temperature, ageing, velocity (strain rate), travel, contamination, and scragging. In the absence of elastomer compound test data, the <b>Guide</b> <b>Specification</b> provides de facto values for likely variations in temperature, ageing, and scragging for use in design. Experimental data from tests of high-damping and lead-rubber bearings were analyzed to assess the de facto values listed in the Specification. The AASHTO values for the scragging factor should be increased from 1. 2 to between 1. 5 and 2. 0 for HDR-A elastomeric bearings and left unchanged for lead-rubber bearings. Full recovery of virgin (unscragged) properties following scragging should be assumed. No change in the AASHTO ageing factors for high-damping and lead-rubber bearings are recommended at this time. The data support the listing of a velocity (strain rate) factor in the <b>Guide</b> <b>Specification</b> with a value equal to 1. 2 for high-damping elastomer compounds...|$|E

40|$|Recycling of {{construction}} materials is growing {{along with the}} demand for recycled materials. However, this growth is often constrained by specifiers` insufficient knowledge of material performance, low awareness of benefits, and perceived risks. Until recently, in Australia, the use of crushed concrete derived from building demolition has been restricted to granular subbase layers in road pavement construction and drainage, or excavation fill applications. However, improved crusher technologies, rubble screening and aggregate washing, and tighter regulation of the recycling industry, have contributed to significant improvements {{in the quality of}} recycled concrete products. Consumer acceptability of recycled materials, however, largely depends on products being technically suitable, cost competitive and meeting environmental impact requirements. This paper discusses the proposed <b>Guide</b> <b>specification</b> document which will cover existing technical information and potential uses of recycled concrete and masonry waste into a structured format, required for specification guidelines. This includes information on recycled material properties and performance, and examines technical and market considerations {{of construction}} and demolition (C a.

40|$|Constant {{returns to}} scale is a central {{construct}} of neoclassical theory. Previous studies argued that one must adopt a specification of the production function with substantial unobserved service variation to reconcile constant returns with the data.

In this paper we show that the stochastic version of the neoclassical growth model delivers an orthogonality condition which can be used to estimate returns to scale. Rather than the standard finding of increasing returns, we show that standard theory and conventional measures of output and inputs yield estimates of constant returns to scale at the aggregate level. Our estimates also suggest that factor service variation is not an important determinant of output fluctuations. Production (Economic theory) ...|$|E
