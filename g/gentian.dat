5|$|Mackinac Island {{contains}} over 600 {{species of}} vascular plants. Flowering plants and wildflowers are abundant, including trillium, lady slippers, forget-me-nots, violets, trout lily, spring beauty, hepatica, buttercups, and hawkweeds {{in the forests}} and orchids, fringed <b>gentian,</b> butter-and-eggs, and jack-in-the-pulpit along the shoreline. The island's forests are home to many varieties of trees, such as maple, birch, elm, cedar, pine, and spruce.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn <b>gentian,</b> which are uncommon in England.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>gentians</b> are {{difficult}} to grow outside their wild habitat, but several species are available in cultivation. <b>Gentians</b> are fully hardy and can grow in full sun or partial shade. They grow in well-drained, neutral to acid soils rich in humus. They are popular in rock gardens.|$|R

5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, <b>gentian</b> and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
25|$|East {{of there}} are heaths and conifer or mixed forests. In some dune slacks, peat bogs {{can be found}} which {{occasionally}} host the carnivorous plant common sundew. The once abundant marsh <b>gentian</b> vanished during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The botanical {{ingredients}} used {{in preparing}} bitters have historically consisted of aromatic herbs, bark, roots, and/or fruit for their flavour and medicinal properties. Some {{of the more}} common ingredients are cascarilla, cassia, <b>gentian,</b> orange peel, and cinchona bark.|$|E

25|$|For generations, {{the disease}} was treated with an {{application}} of the antiseptic <b>gentian</b> violet. Today, topical or oral antibiotics are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with bactericidal ointment, such as mupirocin. In 95% of cases, a single antibiotic course results in resolution in children. It has been advocated that topical disinfectants {{are not nearly as}} efficient as antibiotics, and therefore should be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Aim. Investigation of intraspecies and somaclonal {{variability}} of G. acaulis, G. cruciata and G. punctata. Methods. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR), gel-electrophoresis. Results. It was established a species specificity for indicators of <b>gentians</b> genetic heterogeneity – {{the proportion of}} polymorphic amplicons and genetic distances. A level of intraspecies variation decreased {{in the direction of}} G. acaulis > G. punctata >G. cruciata. Changes in <b>gentians</b> tissue culture by the proportion of polymorphic amplicons were shown to vary within the range of 10 – 15 % and failed to extend beyond the intraspecies variation. Conclusions. Genome variation of G. acaulis, G. cruciata and G. punctata was studied through the use of RAPD-PCR. The <b>gentians</b> were found to be characterized by different variability in both nature and culture in vitro. In the tissue culture there were discovered considerably smaller number changes as compared to intraspecies variation...|$|R

25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2000 season Croatia appointed former player Velemir Crljen as the successor to Pilaš. Crljen additions to the roster included several former USL A-League veterans Paul Moore, Chris Handsor, Tony Preci, Ervin Ryta, <b>Gentian</b> Buzali, and Roman Harapyn. Though Toronto failed in repeating their previous season performance they still managed to clinch a postseason berth by finishing third in the standings with the second best offensive and defensive records in the league. In the Canada Cup tournament Croatia won their group, and advanced to the semifinals where they faced the Olympians, where once more Croatia suffered a 3-2 defeat in a penalty shootout to the Scarborough side. Their playoff run began with a 3-1 victory over St. Catharines with Josip Draganic, Leo Marasovic, and Denny Draganic tallying the goals. The victory advanced the team to the CPSL Championship final, where history would repeat itself with their opponents being the Toronto Olympians. This time Croatia avenged their previous defeat with the Draganic brothers producing the necessary goals in a 2-1 conquest of the championship to prevent the Olympians from acquiring their second straight treble.|$|E
