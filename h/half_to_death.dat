Some {{fighter pilots}} {{did not last}} long because they were too kind to their aircraft; others were {{successful}} because they caned it <b>half</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> And their victories were accompanied by burst engines, popping rivets, stretched wire, wrinkled wings. But Pat was a sensitive pilot, who considered his machine, but, somehow he got more from it than anyone else, and possibly more than it had to give." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody <b>half</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in 1975 Los Angeles, {{young and}} trustful science fiction writer Thaddeus Mobley {{receives}} {{an award for}} his novel The Planet Wyh, and is approached by film producer Howard Zimmerman to adapt his book into a film. Under {{the influence of the}} producer and the actress and femme fatale Vivian Lord, Mobley is tricked into giving large amounts of money to Zimmerman, supposedly to finance the film. When he finally discovers the deception, he is infuriated, and beats Zimmerman <b>half</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Before fleeing L.A. in fear of the consequences, he sees the name of the manufacturer of his motel room's toilet, Dennis Stussy and Sons, (with the faded [...] "D" [...] implying that it is how he chose his future name of Ennis Stussy, Gloria Burgle's stepfather).|$|E

60|$|Foster Portney {{had heard}} about Guardley, and had also heard that some Canadian mounted police, who had arrived at Dawson City, were on Tom Roland's trail.

6000|$|The Genie {{turned to}} {{the captain of the}} troop and said some words to him in a strange tongue, and then in a moment was gone. The captain gave the order to march, and away they all rode with Abdallah in the midst. [...] "Who would have thought," [...] said he, looking around him, with the heart within him {{swelling}} with pride as though it would burst--"who would have thought that only this morning I was a poor fagot-maker, lost in the woods and <b>half</b> starved <b>to</b> <b>death?</b> Surely there is nothing left for me to wish for in this world!" ...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{admitted}} to a 30 bedded acute geriatric medical ward in 1993 were followed up to discharge. The admission rate on weekend days was half that for weekdays. Six percent of ward discharges occurred at weekends, over <b>half</b> being due <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous systems disorders were the commonest reasons for admission (56 %) and death (73 %). Greater emphasis {{should be placed on}} discharging patients at weekends...|$|R
60|$|Any other mortal man, {{except the}} very one whom Antaeus had now encountered, {{would have been}} <b>half</b> frightened <b>to</b> <b>death</b> by the Giant's ferocious aspect and terrible voice. But the {{stranger}} did not seem at all disturbed. He carelessly lifted his club, and balanced it in his hand, measuring Antaeus with his eye, from head to foot, not as if wonder-smitten at his stature, but {{as if he had}} seen a great many Giants before, and this was by no means the biggest of them. In fact, if the Giant had been no bigger than the Pygmies (who stood pricking up their ears, and looking and listening to what was going forward), the stranger could not have been less afraid of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt of}} it, Roger. Of course, it's {{easy enough to}} blame her, and I suppose {{a great many of}} their neighbors do.

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know what}} they'll do," [...] moaned Codfish.

60|$|Those {{two faces}} {{looking out of}} the forest of long hair, moustache, and whisker--those two cold yet bold, trustless yet presumptuous visages--were the same faces, the very same that, {{projected}} in full gaslight from behind the pillars of a portico, had <b>half</b> frightened me <b>to</b> <b>death</b> on the night of my desolate arrival in Villette. These, I felt morally certain, were the very heroes who had driven a friendless foreigner beyond her reckoning and her strength, chased her breathless over a whole quarter of the town.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Call it {{what you}} like,' said Ralph, irritably, 'but attend to me.

Is that so, Mr Squeers?' ...|$|R
6000|$|This Homer K. M., {{from what}} leaked {{out of his}} {{libretto}} through Idaho, {{seemed to me to}} be a kind of a dog who looked at life like it was a tin can tied to his tail.

60|$|A {{step on the}} {{tin roof}} outside frightened me stiff. I had noticed a porch, or shed, under my window. Some one must have climbed upon it. I stopped {{breathing}} to listen.

40|$|Malaria is {{widespread}} in tropical and subtropical regions, in-cluding {{parts of the}} Americas, Asia and Africa. An estimated three billion people were {{at the risk of}} malaria and <b>half</b> <b>to</b> one million <b>deaths</b> were reported in 2010 [1]. Most deaths by malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, one of the five species of human infectious malaria parasites, and malaria is related to the distribution of Anopheles mosqui-toes [2]. Unfortunately, the increasing resistance of malaria parasites to available drugs has being reported [3, 4]. There-fore, {{there is a need to}} develop new anti-malarial drugs.

60|$|But {{the people}} on the boats saw him, and did object very much; and the {{consequence}} was, that, not long after he reached his mother's house, a small boat from one of the vessels came to shore. A party of men went to {{the front door of the}} house in which they had seen the boy enter, and began loudly to knock upon it. Poor Mrs. Morris was <b>half</b> frightened <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> and she made as much delay as possible in order to compose her features and act as if she had never heard of a refugee who wished to hide himself from his pursuers. In the mild manner in which Quaker women are always supposed to speak, she asked them what they wanted. They quickly told her that they had heard that there was a refugee, to whom they applied some very strong language, who was hiding somewhere about here, and that they had seen him spying at them with a glass from behind a tree, and afterwards watched him as he entered this house.|$|R
