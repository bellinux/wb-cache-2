25|$|In the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary,</b> clutch size {{is highly}} {{important}} as larval survival depends on groups size. Thus, understanding the different {{factors that contribute}} to clutch size is important in developing an understanding of population dynamics and life cycle.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that this butterfly only mates one time in June or July and lays its eggs. [...] It does not provide any protection to these eggs or care for the offspring. [...] As adults, the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillaries</b> are short lived; they {{spend most of their}} lives as caterpillars. As caterpillars, <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillaries</b> enter a stage of diapause, which is a period of suspended development, during the winter time.|$|R

25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillaries.</b> <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillaries</b> will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is something to keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Melitaea cinxia) is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It {{is named for}} the naturalist who discovered it and the checkerboard pattern on its wings. These butterflies live mostly in Europe, especially Finland, and across temperate Asia.|$|E
25|$|Historic UK records {{suggest a}} {{distribution}} which {{went as far}} north as Lincolnshire. However, {{by the middle of the}} 19th century the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> was known only from the Isle of Wight and the coast of Kent between Folkestone and Sandwich.

25|$|After hatching, <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{caterpillars}} {{will feed}} on their host plant, either Plantoago lanceolata (ribwort plantain) or Veronica spicata (spiked speedwell). Interestingly, adult females prefer one plant {{over the other}} when choosing where to lay their eggs, but the larvae {{do not have a}} feeding preference for either plant when they are born.|$|E
25|$|Adult <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillaries</b> take flight, mate, and {{lay their}} eggs from June to early July. During this time {{it has been found}} that females only mate once. Females also tend to mate in their natal groups before {{dispersing}} with a mate to {{lay their eggs}} in a different population. This dispersal helps induce genetic flow between populations on the fragmented meadows of the Åland Islands.|$|R
25|$|The {{parasitoid}} C. melitaearum can {{be extremely}} detrimental to <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> populations if {{it is able to}} become well established. This species is able to increase its own parasitism if the fritillary population is also increasing in size and age, but will decrease if said population becomes isolated. Thus, in well established fritillary populations there is a risk of local extinction by the C. melitaearum parasitoid.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> females vary {{in their}} PGI, a glycolytic enzyme, {{genotype}}. The genotype of the female influences {{the time of day}} that she is active, which also influence her ability to lay larger clutches. Heterozygote females are able to operate earlier in the day compared to all other genotypes. Further, females with a Pgi-f allele are able to begin oviposition earlier in the day and are also able to lay larger clutch sizes. The Pgi-f allele contributes to a higher metabolic rate and the ability for females {{to take advantage of the}} climate of the early day - both of which factors allow for increased clutch size.|$|E
2500|$|A female <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{will lay}} {{as many as}} 10 {{clutches}} of eggs in her lifetime.

After hatching, the caterpillars feed on their host plants until the end of the summer where they spin a [...] "winter nest" [...] to diapause. When winter is over they emerge from their nest to feed again before pupating around the beginning of May. A month later, the adult fritillaries emerge and go about their adult lives of feeding, mating, and laying eggs.|$|E

50|$|As delimited here, Melitaea {{includes}} the genus Mellicta, making the subtribe Melitaeina monotypic (but see below).

This was in error, however; the type species of Mellicta is actually the heath fritillary (M. athalia), making the two taxa junior subjective synonyms and thus eligible to be separated again. However, several other taxa are in fact objective synonyms (or at least have type specimens belonging to the same biological species) of Melitaea and Mellicta - Schoenis and the preoccupied Lucina and Melinaea for the former, Athaliaeformia for the latter.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} climate change are rapidly {{converting}} natural habitats and thereby increasing the significance of dispersal capacity for vulnerable species. Flight is necessary for dispersal in many insects, and differences in dispersal capacity may reflect dissimilarities in flight muscle aerobic capacity. In a large metapopulation of the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly in the Åland Islands in Finland, adults disperse frequently between small local populations. Individuals found in newly established populations have higher flight metabolic rates and field-measured dispersal distances than butterflies in old populations. To assess possible differences in flight muscle aerobic capacity among <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> populations, enzyme activities and tissue concentrations of the mitochondrial protein Cytochrome-c Oxidase (CytOx) were measured and compared with four other species of Nymphalid butterflies. Flight muscle structure and mitochondrial density were also examined in the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> and a long-distance migrant, the red admiral. Glanville fritillaries from new populations had significantly higher aerobic capacities than individuals from old populations. Comparing the different species, strong-flying butterfly species had higher flight muscle CytOx content and enzymatic activity than short-distance fliers, and mitochondria were larger and more numerous in the flight muscle of the red admiral than the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary.</b> These results suggest that superior dispersal capacity of butterflies in new populations of the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{is due in part}} to greater aerobic capacity, though this species has a low aerobic capacity in general when compared with known strong fliers.

40|$|The <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{is one of}} Britain’s rarest {{breeding}} butterflies, and {{is predominantly}} restricted to the south coast of the Isle of Wight. Populations have been monitored annually at {{a high proportion of}} known sites by counting the number of larval ‘webs’ during spring since 1996. In this paper, we present population time series for eight core sites. Populations have been observed to fluctuate considerably over the last 18 years, {{with a high degree of}} synchrony between sites. Recently, numbers of larval webs have shown a severe decline, with simultaneous extinctions occurring across many former strongholds. We combine our web count data with counts of adult butterflies from five sites of the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. Together, these data suggest that the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> is threatened by extinction on the Isle of Wight, and that the total area used for breeding is likely no more than a few km 2. The results flag up the need for a national census of remaining populations and further research to understand causes of decline, so that a conservation recovery plan can be developed...|$|E
40|$|Spatially {{structured}} {{populations in}} patchy habitats show much variation in migration rate, from patchy populations {{in which individuals}} move repeatedly among habitat patches to classic metapopulations with infrequent migration among discrete populations. To establish a common framework for population dynamics in patchy habitats, we describe an individual-based model (IBM) involving a diffusion approximation of correlated random walk of individual movements. As an example, we apply the model to the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a highly fragmented landscape. We derive stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) approximations for the IBMs assuming pure demographic stochasticity, uncorrelated environmental stochasticity, or completely correlated environmental stochasticity in local dynamics. Using realistic parameter values for the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary,</b> we show that the SPOMs mimic {{the behavior of the}} IBMs well. The SPOMs derived from IBMs have parameters that relate directly to the life history and behavior of individuals, which is an advantage for model interpretation and parameter estimation.

40|$|The <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{butterfly}} (Melitaea cinxia) {{has been}} studied in the Aland Islands in Finland since 1991, where it occurs as a classic metapopulation in a large network of 4000 dry meadows. Much ecological work has been conducted on this species, but population genetic studies have been hampered by paucity of suitable genetic markers. Here, using single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites developed for the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary,</b> we examine the correspondence between the demographic and genetic spatial structures. Given the dynamic nature of the metapopulation, the current genetic spatial structure may bear a signal of past changes in population sizes and past patterns of gene flow rather than reflect the current demographic structure or landscape structure. We analyse this question with demographic data for 10 years, using the Rand index to assess the similarity between the genetic, demographic, and landscape spatial structures. Our {{results show that the}} current genetic spatial structure is better explained by the past rather than by the current demographic spatial structure or by the spatial configuration of the habitat in the landscape. Furthermore, current genetic diversity is significantly explained by past metapopulation sizes. The time lag between major demographic events and change in the genetic spatial structure and diversity has implications for the study of spatial dynamics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{butterfly}} (Melitaea cinxia) in Finland {{feeds on}} the plants Plantago lanceolata and Veronica spicata. These two plant species are distributed heterogeneously and both vary spatially and temporally in iridoid glycoside concentrations. We investigated the associations of plant species and iridoid glycoside (aucubin and catalpol) concentrations with weight, development rate and survival of larvae of the <b>Glanville</b> <b>fritillary</b> under laboratory conditions. In one experiment {{we compared the}} performance of split brood groups of larvae feeding on the two plant species collected from natural populations. In the second experiment larvae were fed P. lanceolata lines laboratory selected for high and low aucubin and catalpol concentrations. Larvae fed V. spicata performed better in terms of survival, weight and growth rate than those feeding on P. lanceolata, regardless of iridoid glycoside concentration. However, in the second experiment iridoid glycoside concentration in P. lanceolata was positively associated with larval performance. High iridoid glycoside concentrations retarded development rate of the first instar larvae, whereas later on the development was accelerated by higher concentrations of these compounds.
