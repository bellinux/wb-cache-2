40|$|The {{article is}} the {{research}} result {{dealing with the}} bearing process and interior visual structure of <b>internal</b> <b>house</b> (dalem) {{in the house of}} the Laweyan Batik merchant in Surakarta-Central Java at the early of 20 th century. In this time, the interior of <b>internal</b> <b>house</b> (dalem) for Laweyan society is a status symbol and social identity because {{they are part of the}} marginal society in social life. The success in managing the business of printing batik does not move up their social class from lowerclass to upper class (priyayi). Their profession as seller places them in lower-class (kawula). The <b>internal</b> <b>house</b> (dalem) context as part of heritage building in order to get social status and identity is toughened by historical and cultural approaches. Those approaches able to explain how the cultural system forms a social system, then, it actualizes in the form of culture: artefact of <b>internal</b> <b>house</b> (dalem) in the house of batik’s merchant. The conclusion of the research is the Laweyan Batik merchants have experienced metamorphosis from the lawe market society into an exclusive Batik Village. The sharing system of social class which has done by Dutch government, empire, or urban development based on the ethnicity has a role in parallelizing the Laweyan Batik merchant with priyayi belonging to upper class. The merchants place the <b>internal</b> <b>house</b> (dalem) as sacred area as the form of their fighting in creating the self identity. The transformation is influenced by a blueprint measurement which refers to loji building design. The sacredness of the area is kept even though it is without mancapat pattern. The function displacement happens because of need adjustment of places of the merchants. The interior design of <b>internal</b> <b>house</b> (dalem) supported by symbolism in Javanese culture and modern Europe style, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco is as the form of acculturation of visual design giving solution in shaping the social identity of the merchants.

40|$|Non-cage housing {{systems for}} laying hens such as aviaries provide greater freedom to perform species-specific {{behavior}} {{and thus are}} thought to improve welfare of the birds; however, aviaries {{are associated with a}} high prevalence of keel bone damage (fractures and deviations), which is a major welfare problem in commercial laying hens. Potential causes of keel bone damage are falls and collisions with <b>internal</b> <b>housing</b> structures that occur as birds move between tiers or perches in the aviary. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the scope for reducing keel bone damage by reducing falls and collisions through modifications of aviary design. Birds were kept in 20 pens in a laying hen house (225 hens per pen) that were assigned to four different treatments (n = 5 pens per treatment group) including (1) control pens and pens modified by the addition of (2) perches, (3) platforms and (4) ramps. Video recordings at 19, 22, 29, 36 and 43 weeks of age were used to analyze controlled movements and falls (including details on occurrence of collision, cause of fall, height of fall and behavior after fall) during the transitional dusk and subsequent dark phase. Palpation assessments (focusing on fractures and deviations) using 20 focal hens per pen were conducted at 18, 20, 23, 30, 37, 44, 52 and 60 weeks of age. In comparison to the control group, we found 44 % more controlled movements in the ramp (P = 0. 003) and 47 % more controlled movements in the platform treatments (P = 0. 014) as well as 45 % fewer falls (P = 0. 006) and 59 % fewer collisions (P < 0. 001) in the ramp treatment. There were no significant differences between the control and perch treatments. Also, at 60 weeks of age, 23 % fewer fractured keel bones were found in the ramp compared with the control treatment (P = 0. 0053). After slaughter at 66 weeks of age, no difference in keel bone damage was found between treatment groups and the prevalence of fractures increased to an average of 86 %. As a potential mechanism to explain the differences in locomotion, we suggest that ramps facilitated movement in the vertical plane by providing a continuous path between the tiers and thus supported more natural behavior (i. e. walking and running) of the birds. As a consequence of reducing events that potentially damage keel bones, the installation of ramps may have reduced the prevalence of keel fractures for a major portion of the flock cycle. We conclude that aviary design and installation of specific <b>internal</b> <b>housing</b> structures (i. e. ramps and platforms) have considerable potential to reduce keel bone damage of laying hens in aviary systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} study {{has shown that}} a dump/fill type torque converter has excellent potential for the convertible fan/shaft engine. The torque converter space requirement permits <b>internal</b> <b>housing</b> within the normal flow path of a turbofan engine at acceptable engine weight. The unit permits operating the engine in the turboshaft mode by decoupling the fan. To convert to turbofan mode, the torque converter overdrive capability bring the fan speed up to the power turbine speed to permit engagement of a mechanical lockup device when the shaft speed are synchronized. The conversion to turbofan mode can be made without drop of power turbine speed in less than 10 sec. Total thrust delivered to the aircraft by the proprotor, fan, and engine during tansient can be controlled to prevent loss of air speed or altitude. Heat rejection to the oil is low, and additional oil cooling capacity is not required. The turbofan engine aerodynamic design is basically uncompromised by convertibility and allows proper fan design for quiet and efficient cruise operation. Although {{the results of the}} {{feasibility study}} are exceedingly encouraging, {{it must be noted that}} they are based on extrapolation of limited existing data on torque converters.

40|$|Fractures of {{the keel}} bone, a bone {{extending}} ventrally from the sternum, are a serious {{health and welfare}} problem in free range laying hens. Recent findings suggest that {{a major cause of}} keel damage within extensive systems is collisions with <b>internal</b> <b>housing</b> structures, though investigative efforts have been hindered by difficulties in examining mechanisms and likely influencing factors at the moment of fracture. The objectives of this study were to develop an ex vivo impact protocol to model bone fracture in hens caused by collision, to assess impact and bird-related factors influencing fracture occurrence and severity, and to identify correlations of mechanical and structural properties between different skeletal sites. We induced keel bone fractures in euthanized hens using a drop-weight impact tester able to generate a range of impact energies, producing fractures that replicate those commonly found in commercial settings. The results demonstrated that impact energies of a similar order to those expected in normal housing were able to produce fractures, and that greater collision energies resulted in an increased likelihood of fractures and of greater severity. Relationships were also seen with keel's lateral surface bone mineral density, and the peak reactive force (strength) {{at the base of the}} manubrial spine. Correlations were also identified between the keel and long bones with respect to both strength and bone mineral density. This is the first study able to relate impact and bone characteristics with keel bone fracture at the moment of collision. Greater understanding of these relationships will provide means to reduce levels of breakage and severity in commercial systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{reports on}} a study comparing the regulation of <b>internal</b> <b>housing</b> space in Italy – since the introduction of broad, generic standards in 1975 – and in England, {{where there are no}} universal rules governing internal space. After tracing the evolution of standards in both countries from public health legislation in the late 19 th century to specific building and urban codes in Italy today, and a range of standards applied to some social housing in England, it outlines the space characteristics of homes in the two countries, before drawing on a series on interviews with key built environment professionals in the cities of Turin and Manchester, to unpack the ‘conditions’ of space standard regulation in both countries. The purpose of the study has been to explore the politics, practicalities, acceptability and impact of internal space regulation in Italy and England, and to ask why regulatory standards in Italy seem more palatable than they are in England and Wales: the only remaining part of the EU where legal minimum space standard for residential development remain absent. Discussion also centres on how regulatory approaches to delivering housing quality compare with approaches based on local negotiation through planning, and how these are situated in the context of different market drivers, lending and planning cultures. Moving to a regulatory approach in England (with fixed space standards) may be problematic given that such a move would not address the market fundamentals – speculative production and investment consumption – that, alongside land supply constraints, determine the amount of space in homes. In this context, a more effective strategy might be to expose home buyers to more information on internal space, thus influencing market behaviour and thereafter, the types of homes built to supply future demand...|$|E
