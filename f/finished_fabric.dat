30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine whether various selected finishing treatments which may be applied to plain and twill weave fabrics used for chefs’ jackets can offer the potential for protection against scald injuries, as well as examining the impact of layering fabrics. Results showed that the Teflon® <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics</b> which offer combined water and stain repellency had the longest time to predicted skin burn injury and lowest absorbed energy compared with all other <b>fabric</b> <b>finishes.</b> Increasing the numbers of layers of the Teflon® <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics</b> has the greatest potential for providing good protection against scald injuries as much of the water in a hot-water splash runs off the repellent fabric surface. None of the Teflon® treated fabric systems reached the predicted third-degree burn criterion, even as a single layered system, whereas, all other fabric/finishes met the third-degree burn criterion as a single and sometimes double-layered system. Conflicting results were evident for the soil-release finish, which lowered the protective performance in twill weave fabrics, but increased protection in the plain weave fabrics (compared to regular <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics).</b> With the exception of soil-release finishes, the heavier weight twill weave fabric offered longer times to predicted second-degree burn and lower absorbed energy, than the lighter weight plain weave fabrics. Furthermore, the addition of another layer to the fabric system tended to increase the potential protective performance of the fabric systems for most <b>fabric</b> <b>finishes,</b> although decreasing the air permeability. There is clear evidence in this research of the benefit of applying a Teflon® finish to chef’s clothing, not only to improve repellency against oil and water-borne stains, but also as a means to improve protection against hot water splash. The Teflon® finish maintains a level of thermal comfort which is currently accepted in chef’s clothing. Further work to determine whether Teflon® would also increase protection against hot oils and steam is recommended, as well as the durability of the treatment to repeated laundering.|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the issue}} {{related to the}} influence of <b>finishing</b> on <b>fabrics,</b> made of yarn of different raw material, by research of mechanical and end-use properties. The issue is relevant to textile companies that manufacture fabrics from various natural fibres and its blends. During the manufacturing process, it has been noticed that finishing has a negative effect on end-use properties, such as abrasion resistance and pilling. Moreover, finishing has an impact on mechanical properties of fibres, such as breaking force and elongation at break. Therefore, this work analyses the abovementioned mechanical (breaking force and elongation at break) properties of yarn and fabrics made of it and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of grey <b>fabrics</b> and <b>finished</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It has been determined that the strength and tension rates of used yarn have an impact on fabrics and its breaking force and elongation at break. The <b>fabric</b> <b>finishing</b> affects the properties of the mentioned fabrics, i. e. breaking force decreases after finishing, while the elongation at break increases. During <b>finishing,</b> <b>fabrics</b> undergo various chemical and mechanical impacts which might decrease the quality of fabrics. On the other hand, fabrics become denser, its threads crimp, and thus fabrics become more tensile. <b>Finishing</b> affects end-use <b>fabric</b> properties as well (resistance to abrasion and pilling). These properties of fabrics worsen. Dependencies are described by linear equations. During the abrasion resistance analysis, almost all of the dependencies were strong. Abrasion resistance of grey fabrics was higher than those after finishing. Pilling resistance of grey fabrics is also better than of <b>fabrics</b> after <b>finishing.</b> Pilling resistance dependencies on the number of abrasion cycles were mostly of medium strength. It might be concluded that finishing and the raw material of used yarn influences the mechanical (breaking force, elongation at break) and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of fabrics...|$|R

50|$|Hems of {{different}} depths (which includes the seam allowance) {{may have a}} particular style to achieve, which requires more or less fabric depending upon the style.

At the same time, with development of an interest in coloured shirts, cambric was also woven in colours, such as the pink fabric used by Charvet for a corsage, reducing the difference between cambric and chambray.
