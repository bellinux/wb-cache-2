5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and TAURUS KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.|$|E

Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E

5|$|Farm to Market Road1938 (FM1938) is a Farm to Market Road in the US {{state of}} Texas. The highway runs from State Highway26 (SH26) to FM1709, in Tarrant County. While located in Westlake, FM1938 is named Precinct Line Road. While located in Southlake, from the {{northern}} border of Southlake to its junction with FM1709, FM1938 is named Randol Mill Avenue, and from the FM1709 intersection to its southern terminus, the highway is named Davis Boulevard. FM1938 was designated in 1952, in Hockley County, but was cancelled and redesignated in 1955, at its modern location in Tarrant County. In 1995, the entire route of FM 1938 was redesignated as Urban Road 1938 (UR 1938) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). FM 1938 passes through central North Richland Hills and Southlake, providing access to several businesses.

Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland {{is removed from the}} care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> {{of being}} electrified.

This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services {{will continue to be}} provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.|$|E
