5|$|Shark fin soup is {{a status}} symbol in Asian countries, and is {{considered}} healthy and full of nutrients. Sharks are also killed for meat. European diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. However, the U.S. FDA lists sharks as one of four fish (with swordfish, <b>king</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and tilefish) whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, <b>king</b> <b>mackerel,</b> bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{spanish and}} <b>king</b> <b>mackerels</b> (Scomberomous maculates and S. cavalla) {{and the blue}} runner (Caranx fusus) are {{important}} pelagic fish resources along the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico. Interdependences between them have been studied through simple multispecies yield models. Simulated changes in fishing effort suggest S. cavalla and C. fusus populations are more stable than S. maculates. The ecosystem model, previously obtained with ECOPATH II, was used to simulate gradual changes in biomass. Ecosystem response tends to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium by adjusting the biomass/energy flows. The predator/prey and competence interdependences show impacts of different magnitude, depending on how species are using the ecosystem resources. However, the main variations occurred through respiration and flows into detritus. Spanish and <b>king</b> <b>mackerels</b> share some resources like anchovies, herrings and shrimp; however, the Spanish mackerel has a wider trophic spectrum. The blue runner shares some food resources with the above species, but it also uses some others. The specific biomass flows in the prey/predator relationships, the specific foraging index, the niche overlap and the relative population abundance explain the higher variability of the Spanish mackerel population...|$|R
25|$|Overfishing of <b>king</b> and Spanish <b>mackerel</b> {{occurred}} in the 1980s. Regulations were introduced to restrict the size, amount of catch, fishing locations and bag limits for recreational fishers as well as commercial fishers. Gillnets were banned in waters off Florida. By 2001, the mackerel stocks had bounced back.|$|R
40|$|Utilization {{of fishing}} area in Banten Bay by various {{activities}} may cause multi sectors conflicts related to {{management of the}} bay. The integrated zone system in that area has not been established yet; therefore it is needed to be studied. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) determine fishing season and fishing ground; 2) determine indicators and criteria of fishing zone; 3) establish fishing zone. The study was conducted in four fish landing centers which are located in Karangantu, Terate, Wadas, and Kepuh from January to April 2010. Data were collected by surveying analyzed using the fishing season index analysis, relationship analysis between sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and fish abundance, and GIS analysis. Based on the results, it were revealed that 1) peak fishing season of pelagic fish was from November to January and demersal fish was from November to December; 2) the catches from fishing grounds surrounding Panjang island were anchovies, trevallies, squids, Indian mackerels, pony fishes, Fringescale sardinella; surrounding Pamujan besar island were threadfin bream, shrimps; and surrounding Tunda island were eastern little tuna, narrow barred <b>king</b> <b>mackerels,</b> black pomfret, red snapper, great trevally, scads, mullets, squids; 3) development indicators of fishing zone were (i) feasibility of fishing ground, (ii) compatibility of fishing gears with fishing grounds, (iii) possibility of conflicts, (iv) infrastructure, (v) carrying capacity of environment; 4) Banten bay water was divided into three fishing zones, they were (i) passive zone, (ii) passive and outboard motor zone, (iii) active and inboard motor zone...|$|R

25|$|Another {{study found}} that {{pregnant}} women who consumed 340grams of low-mercury containing fish with fatty acids per week have benefits that outweigh the risks for mercury poisoning. They {{were less likely to}} have children with low verbal IQ, motor coordination and behavioral problems. However, foods containing high amounts of mercury, such as shark, swordfish, <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> and tilefish, might cause mental retardation.|$|E

Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, <b>king</b> <b>mackerel,</b> albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others.

Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

500|$|Using an {{unofficial}} nickname of [...] "The River City", Jacksonville has a culture {{centered on the}} St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri).

Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.|$|E

Everglades keys that foster mangroves also support nurseries for wading birds such as the Great blue heron (Ardea herodias), which was almost wiped out in the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 (only 146 were counted afterward). After recovering to number more than 2,000, they were further endangered by Hurricane Donna in 1960, which decreased their numbers by 35 to 40percent.|$|E

2500|$|The AT Greater Jacksonville Kingfish Tournament (GJKT) is {{a contest}} fishing for <b>King</b> <b>mackerel</b> that spans six days every July in Jacksonville, Florida.

2500|$|Methylmercury is {{the major}} source of organic mercury for all individuals. Due to {{bioaccumulation}} it works its way up through the food web and thus biomagnifies, resulting in high concentrations among populations of some species. Top predatory fish, such as tuna or swordfish, are usually of greater concern than smaller species. The US FDA and the EPA advise women of child-bearing age, nursing mothers, and young children to completely avoid swordfish, shark, <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, and to limit consumption of albacore ("white") tuna to no more than [...] per week, and of all other fish and shellfish to no more than [...] per week. A 2006 review of the risks and benefits of fish consumption found, for adults, the benefits of one to two servings of fish per week outweigh the risks, even (except for a few fish species) for women of childbearing age, and that avoidance of fish consumption could result in significant excess coronary heart disease deaths and suboptimal neural development in children.|$|E
