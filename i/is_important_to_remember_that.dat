For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a real gas equation of state rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.|$|E

25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the {{builders}} were not {{working on a}} clean site but {{would have had to}} clear back the rubble and surviving parts of the old church as they built the new. Nevertheless, work progressed rapidly. The south porch with most of its sculpture was installed by 1210, and by 1215 the north porch had been completed and the western rose installed. The nave high vaults were erected in the 1220s, the canons moved into their new stalls in 1221 under a temporary roof {{at the level of the}} clerestory, and the transept roses were erected over the subsequent two decades. The high vaults over the choir were not built until the last years of the 1250s, as was rediscovered in the first decade of the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} {{involved}} in various campaigns of russification, and, as a consequence, it was accused of participating in anti-Jewish pogroms. In the case of anti-semitism and the anti-Jewish pogroms, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church; it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> many Russian Orthodox clerics, including senior hierarchs, openly defended persecuted Jews, at least starting with {{the second half of}} the 19th century. Also, the Church has no official position on Judaism as such. In modern times, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has been accused of antisemitism for his book Two Hundred Years Together, where he alleges Jewish participation in the political repression of the Soviet regime (see also Hebrew and Byzantine relations). Solzhenitsyn's book Two Hundred Years Together is a historical study of the relationship between Russian Orthodox Christians and Jews in Russia from 1772 to modern times.|$|E

40|$|Why do we {{remember}} some events and not others, {{and how does}} this change in old age? Although {{there are a variety}} of ways to address this question, the present perspective emphasizes how value can have a profound eVect on how we use our memory <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> certain information. The ability to select and prioritize what information <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> relative <b>to</b> less salient or peripheral information, is an essential skill for the eYcient use of memory. For example, university students seek to memorize information they think <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for a later test, while grandparents may focus on being able <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> information about children and grandchildren, as well as important life events. In both cases, value is used to direct resources toward information that <b>is</b> deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> The role that value plays in memory performance is critical to develop a comprehensive understanding of how memory is used across the adult life span. The present summary focuses on how older adults use evaluative processing (a critical process that will be defined and discussed throughout this chapter) to guide encoding and retrieval operations, and how older adults then use value to make decisions about what information <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> In light of the many memory impairments that typicall...|$|R

25|$|The human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is the most}} common STI in the United States. There are more than 40 different strands of HPV and many do not cause any health problems. In 90% of cases the body’s immune system clears the infection naturally within 2 years. Some cases may not be cleared and can lead to genital warts (bumps around the genitals that can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like cauliflower) or cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers. Symptoms might not show up until advanced stages. It is important for women to get pap smears in order to check for and treat cancers. There are also two vaccines available for women (Cervarix and Gardasil) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer. HPV can be passed through genital-to-genital contact as well as during oral sex. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the infected partner might not have any symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Triangles are sturdy; while a {{rectangle}} can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure {{to one of}} its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. A triangle will not change shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, {{each of the three}} sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. Some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. It is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). Tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.|$|E
25|$|His ecumenical gifts were {{widespread}} and often exuberant. Commonly held land was given, along with {{exemption from taxes}} as well as relics. Christ Church was probably given rights at the important port of Sandwich as well as tax exemption, with confirmation in the placement of their charters on the altar, while it got the relics of St Ælfheah, at the displeasure {{of the people of}} London. Another see in the king's favour was Winchester, second only to the Canterbury see in terms of wealth. New Minster's Liber Vitae records Cnut as a benefactor of the monastery, and the Winchester Cross, with 500 marks of silver and 30 marks of gold, as well as relics of various saints was given to it. Old Minster was the recipient of a shrine for the relics of St Birinus and the probable confirmation of its privileges. The monastery at Evesham, with its Abbot Ælfweard purportedly a relative of the king through Ælfgifu the Lady (probably Ælfgifu of Northampton, rather than Queen Emma, also known as Ælfgifu), got the relics of St Wigstan. Such generosity towards his subjects, which his skalds called destroying treasure, was of course popular with the English. Yet it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> not all Englishmen were in his favour, and the burden of taxation was widely felt.

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{argument}} that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises {{that they should not}} be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the [...] "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" [...] is a [...] "leitmotif" [...] of the Rights of Woman. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to [...] "calmly let passion subside into friendship" [...] in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when [...] "two virtuous young people marry [...] [...] [...] if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, [...] "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, [...] "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." [...] If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with [...] "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the Rights of Woman eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it [...] "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" [...] {{while at the same time}} [...] "exaggerat the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [...] fatally linked [...] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality." ...|$|E
