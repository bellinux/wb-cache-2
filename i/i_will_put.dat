500|$|As a senator, Palpatine is [...] "unassuming, yet ambitious". In Cloak of Deception, James Luceno {{writes that}} Palpatine {{carefully}} guards his privacy and [...] "others found his reclusiveness intriguing, {{as if he}} led a secret life". Despite this, he has many allies in the government. Luceno writes, [...] "What Palpatine lacked in charisma, he made up for in candor, {{and it was that}} directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate. ... For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms, with a clear sense of right and wrong." [...] In Terry Brooks' , Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles. He tells Queen Amidala, [...] "I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected , I will restore democracy to the Republic. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> an end to the corruption that has plagued the Senate." [...] A Visual Dictionary states that he is a self-proclaimed savior.|$|E
500|$|Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, {{had promised}} Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay {{action on the}} {{election}} bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders that sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. [...] Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. [...] Bringing troops into the chamber, he {{put an end to}} the debate, saying [...] "You are no Parliament. [...] I say you are no Parliament. [...] <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> an end to your sitting." [...] Vane protested, [...] "This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty", to which Cromwell shouted in response, [...] "O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!" [...] This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. [...] Vane, [...] "daily missed and courted for his assistance", was invited to sit on Cromwell's council, but refused.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E

On November 22, 2008, one day after the theatrical release of Twilight, Summit confirmed that they would begin working on New Moon. [...] "I don't think any other author has had a more positive experience with the makers of her movie adaptation than I have had with Summit Entertainment," [...] said Meyer. In early December 2008, it was {{announced that}} Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke would not be returning to direct the sequel. Hardwicke cited time restrictions as the reason behind her leaving the project. On December 13, 2008, it was announced that Chris Weitz, director of The Golden Compass and co-director of About a Boy, had been hired to direct New Moon. Weitz released a statement shortly after the announcement, assuring Twilight fans that he would [...] "protect on their behalf the characters, [...] themes and story they love."

2500|$|In {{the view}} of many Christians, the devil's first {{appearance}} in the Old Testament is as the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The serpent tempts Adam and Eve into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which God had forbidden them to eat, thus causing their expulsion from the Garden and indirectly causing sin to enter the world. In God's rebuke to the serpent, he tells it [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel."

2500|$|In Hebrew, {{the word}} נָבִיא (nāvî), [...] "spokesperson", {{traditionally}} translates as [...] "prophet". The second subdivision of the Hebrew Bible, TaNaKh (for [...] "Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim"), {{is devoted to}} the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of navi is perhaps described in Deuteronomy 18:18, where God said, [...] "...and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." [...] Thus, the navi was thought to be the [...] "mouth" [...] of God. The root nun-bet-alef ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself [...] "open". Cf. Rashbam's comment to Genesis 20:7.|$|E

Lincoln announced that he also wanted to see African Americans given the right to vote. [...] Booth and Powell stood on the White House lawn listening to the speech. [...] Booth seethed at the idea of giving blacks political power, and told Powell, [...] "That means nigger citizenship. [...] Now, by God, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> him through.

2500|$|The Gemara deduced from [...] that Torah study keeps away painful sufferings.

[...] Rather one should say that God visits those who have the opportunity to study the Torah and do not do so with ugly and painful sufferings which stir them up. For [...] says, [...] "I was dumb with silence, I kept silence from the good thing, and my pain was stirred up."

2500|$|From {{the middle}} of 1649 until 1651 Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to engage in infighting. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and {{to put in place}} a broad-brush, {{tolerant}} national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, in April 1653 Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government of 40 members (drawn both from the Rump and the army) and then abdicate. However, the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government. Cromwell was so angered by this that on 20 April 1653, supported by about forty musketeers, he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force. Several accounts exist of this incident: in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said [...] "you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> an end to your sitting". At least two accounts agree that Cromwell snatched up the mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the [...] "bauble" [...] be taken away. Cromwell's troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E

[...] God told Moses that Moses {{was not able to}} see God's Glory lest he die, as [...] reports God said, [...] "men shall not see Me and live," [...] but for the sake of God's oath to Moses, God agreed to do as Moses asked. God instructed Moses to stand at the entrance of a cave, and God would cause all God's angels to pass before Moses. God told Moses to stand his ground, and not to fear, as [...] reports, [...] "And He said, I will make all My Goodness pass before you." [...] God told Moses that when he heard the Name that God had spoken to him, then Moses would know that God was before him, as [...] reports. The ministering angels complained that they served before God day and night, and they were unable to see God's Glory, but this man Moses born of woman desired to see God's Glory. The angels arose in wrath and excitement to kill Moses, and he came near to death. God intervened in a cloud to protect Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord descended in the cloud."

[...] Moses began to cry with a loud voice, and Moses said the words of [...] "O Lord, O Lord, a God full of compassion and gracious [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Moses asked God to pardon the iniquities of the people in connection with the Golden Calf. God told Moses that if he had asked God then to pardon the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations, God would have done so, as it was the appropriate time. But Moses had asked for pardon with reference to the Golden Calf, so God told Moses that it would be according to his words, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned according to your word.'" ...|$|E
