5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb <b>jellies,</b> crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box <b>jellies</b> and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box <b>jellies)</b> a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E

5000|$|Marinus van Dam, product {{developer}} and plant {{manager for the}} company, oversaw the development of <b>Jelly</b> Belly <b>jelly</b> beans. By the 1980s, many flavors had been developed. In 1980, Klein sold {{his interest in the}} <b>Jelly</b> Belly name. [...] "David Klein sold the <b>Jelly</b> Belly trademark to Rowland for $4.8 million, paid in monthly installments over 20 years, which Klein split with a partner." [...] The <b>Jelly</b> Belly trademark was registered August 3, 1982. [...] The Mr. <b>Jelly</b> Belly character was developed in 1983. Prior {{to the development of the}} character David Klein called himself [...] "Mr. <b>Jelly</b> Belly." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{terminology}} {{evolved in}} America for many years. From 1852 to 1877 such a dessert was called: <b>Jelly</b> Cake (1852), Roll <b>Jelly</b> Cake (1860), Swiss Roll (1872), <b>Jelly</b> Roll (1873), and Rolled <b>Jelly</b> Cake (1876). The name “Jelly Roll” was eventually adopted.|$|R
5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb <b>jellies),</b> and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb <b>jellies,</b> cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|The {{single-celled}} choanoflagellates {{resemble the}} choanocyte cells of sponges {{which are used}} to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules {{have been used as}} morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals. Some studies have shown that sponges do not form a monophyletic group, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that comb <b>jellies</b> rather than sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals.|$|E

5|$|The Australian <b>jelly</b> {{industry}} is worth approximately $1121million per annum, and Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> is the market leader with a 25% share. Over 19million packets of Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> are sold each year. Strawberry flavour {{is the top}} selling <b>jelly</b> variant with nearly 2 million packs sold each year. In 1953, Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> introduced Australia's first low calorie <b>jelly.</b> In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, <b>jelly</b> was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992. Now Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> is owned by American company, McCormicks foods; {{it used to be}} owned by Traders Pty Ltd. One of the least selling though was the lemon flavor which sold over 100,000 packets per annum.|$|R
5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb <b>jellies</b> {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and <b>jellies</b> which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{is an active}} predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb <b>jellies</b> and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, {{pelagic stingray}}s hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E
5000|$|After Ronald Reagan became President in 1980, {{the general}} public became aware of his {{preference}} for <b>Jelly</b> Belly <b>jelly</b> beans. The company supplied Reagan with <b>Jelly</b> Belly <b>jelly</b> beans during his eight years of presidency. Chairman Rowland recalls, [...] "We were thrilled by press reports that President Reagan gave jars of <b>Jelly</b> Belly <b>jelly</b> beans to visiting dignitaries." [...] (Reagan, however, [...] "started to favour M&M's as the official White House candy during his eighth and final year in office.") [...] Reagan made them the first <b>jelly</b> beans in space, sending them on the Space Shuttle Challenger during the STS-7 mission in 1983, surprising the astronauts.|$|R

25|$|High-ester pectins set {{at higher}} {{temperatures}} than low-ester pectins. However, gelling reactions with calcium increase as {{the degree of}} esterification falls. Similarly, lower pH-values or higher soluble solids (normally sugars) increase gelling speed. Suitable pectins can therefore be selected for jams and for <b>jellies,</b> or for higher sugar confectionery <b>jellies.</b>|$|E
