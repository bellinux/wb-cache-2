25|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} the export sector has been booming, {{acting as the}} main engine for {{economic}} growth. Swedish exports also {{have proven to be}} surprisingly robust. A marked shift {{in the structure of the}} exports, where services, the IT industry, and telecommunications have taken over from traditional industries such as steel, paper and pulp, has made the Swedish export sector less vulnerable to international fluctuations. However, at the same time the Swedish industry has received less money for its exports while the import prices have gone up. During the period 1995–2003 the <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> were reduced by 4% at the same time as the import prices climbed by 11%. The net effect is that the Swedish terms-of-trade fell 13%.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} as to whether the globalisation-related increase in competitive pressure may have caused the importance of cost pass-through (CPT) and pricing-to-market (PTM) for <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> in Germany to shift since the 1990 s is addressed by testing the long-run <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviour of German enterprises for changes in the impact of its determinants. As globalisation may have affected competitive pressure in individual product markets differently, <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> is analysed for 11 product categories. Analytically, this problem is solved by applying the Saikkonen (1991) approach to estimate the individual <b>export</b> <b>price</b> categories in single equations. The first hypothesis - that CPT is stronger, and PTM weaker, for heterogeneous products than for homogeneous products - is found to hold more for CPT than for PTM. The second hypothesis, which presumes that CPT has weakened and PTM has strengthened since the 1990 s, is confirmed with respect to the overall outcome, although for several product categories the results conflict with the hypothesis. Moreover, error correction models are used to test exporters' short-run price-setting behaviour for asymmetry, ie whether short-run increases in the <b>export</b> <b>price</b> determinants are passed through to a different extent than decreases. It is shown that symmetric <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> is seldom rejected. <b>Export</b> <b>pricing,</b> cost pass-through, pricing-to-market, Germany...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the key factors that enhance <b>price</b> competitiveness in <b>export</b> markets. <b>Export</b> <b>price</b> setting is a crucial managerial decision determining the ability to compete in foreign markets. <b>Export</b> <b>price</b> competitiveness depends on a comprehensive identification of environmental factors and a congruence of pricing decisions and actions by the company. Competitive <b>export</b> <b>price</b> should be flexible and change over time due to external and internal environmental conditions. Based on the reviewed and examined scientific research findings, the article establishes the most important environmental factors that have an impact on <b>price</b> competitiveness in <b>export</b> markets. Their probable effect on <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> decisions has been discussed in the article. Scientific studies on <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> practices are collected and reviewed.

25|$|The city {{benefited from}} {{its role as}} the main export port for the {{agricultural}} produce of the Peloponnese. It was the main centre for the organisation of production of raisin, offering warehouse, banking and insurance services. However, this early era of prosperity was short lived; {{the completion of the}} Corinth Canal in 1893 challenged the predominance of its port. Besides, in 1894 raisin <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> in the international markets began to plummet, due to overproduction and international circumstances, which triggered a prolonged crisis with deep financial, political and social repercussions, known as the Great raisin crisis. Trade with western Europe, mainly Britain, France and Italy, did much to shape the city's early identity as a significant port and cosmopolitan urban centre in early 20th century Greece.|$|E

The ANB was abolished by the Commonwealth Bank Act 1924, due to Treasurer and Country Party Leader Earle Page wanting to end the monetary contraction which particularly hurt his farming constituents, who were as a result receiving reduced <b>export</b> <b>prices.</b> The new Board of Directors replacing it, which was composed of various areas of the industry, soon appointed Garvan chairman, and thus he continued his policies. In 1925, both the pound sterling and Australian pound returned to the pre-war gold standard.

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his presidency in 1994, Alexander Lukashenka began to suggest the idea of integration with the Russian Federation and to undertake steps in this direction. From {{the beginning}}, there was also an idea of introducing a united currency for the Union of Russia and Belarus. Art. 13 of the 1999 [...] "Treaty of Creation of the Union State of Russia and Belarus" [...] foresaw a unified currency. Discussions about the Union currency has continued past the 2005 implementation goal set by both nations. Starting in 2008, the Central Bank of the Republic of Belarus announced that the ruble would be tied to the United States dollar instead of to the Russian ruble. [...] "Stanislav Bogdankevich, a former bank chairman, called the decision political, saying it was tied to Belarus' open displeasure at Russia's decision to hike oil and gas <b>export</b> <b>prices</b> to Belarus earlier this year. Belarus' economy is largely Soviet-style, centrally controlled and has been heavily reliant on cheap energy supplies from Russia".|$|E

The theor etical analysis develops a general model which hypothesizes a positive relation between <b>export</b> <b>price</b> and foreign price assuming international product differenti ation. This model further suggests that <b>export</b> <b>price</b> depends on foreign structur al traits as they determine foreign price. The empirical analysis, based on a cr oss- section of sixty-nine four-digit manufacturing industries matched between th e United States and Japan, provided support for the hypothesis that foreign mark et structure and foreign <b>pricing</b> affect <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> and thus the observed pri ce-cost margin.

40|$|Due to our {{interest}} in pricing {{and the fact that}} <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> has more or less been neglected by academic research, we found it interesting to write a thesis regarding this area. The purpose of the thesis in general is {{to gain a better understanding}} of <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> of industrial products by medium sized enterprises. We have narrowed this problem area down to examining factors influencing <b>export</b> <b>pricing,</b> and how the implemented pricing strategies can be described. We conducted the case study on LIKO AB, a company situated close to Luleå, Sweden. We found that different factors influencing <b>export</b> <b>pricing</b> have different impact on the choice of pricing strategy. Costs, gross margin required by senior management and management attitudes were some of the most important factors. Furthermore we concluded that several pricing strategies are used simultaneously.

40|$|Interesting stylized {{models that}} discuss the {{implications}} of the oil boom or oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase on an oil-rich economy must involve a tension between effects that tend to boost oil sector and harm non-oil sector and effects that vice versa tend to boost non-oil sector and harm oil sector. This paper explores such models and examines at large {{the implications of}} the oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase through the prism of interaction between these two effects. This paper applies the 1 - 2 - 3 -model of Devarajan et al. (1990) and develops two stylized models that examine the effects of the world price increase and oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase on the economy respectively. A central feature of the developed stylized models is that they can distinguish between the two effects generated by the oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase, namely the balance-of-trade effect and the import-competing effect. The balance-of-trade effect shows the response of the economy to the oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase, depending on whether the economy runs a trade surplus or a trade deficit in the benchmark equilibrium, with the import-competing effect set equal to one. It shows conditions that cause changes in the producers’ real costs and hence determines which sector grows and which sector shrinks {{in the wake of the}} oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase. The import-competing effect, under the assumption that trade is balanced, shows the effect of the variation in the Armington elasticity of substitution between oil goods in the second model and non-oil goods in the third model. It shows how competition between imported and import-competing goods affects producers’ real costs and hence determines which sector grows and which sector shrinks in the wake of the oil <b>export</b> <b>price</b> increase. ...|$|R
