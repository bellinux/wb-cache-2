So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E

But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E

The company is the UK’s biggest investor in robotics and artificial intelligence research, employing over 3,500 engineers and scientists, and engaging in more than 40 university research programmes. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Sir James Dyson said, “We’re looking at more non-domestic products but we are not rushing to do lots of different things,” he said. “We are a private company so we can do <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are ready.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{during the last}} quarter of 2010 and was co-produced by Rob Hawkins and Aaron Sprinkle. Recording was done in two parts: first with Hawkins in Nashville, then with Sprinkle in Seattle. Frontwoman Ariel commented on working with the two: [...] "Their work selves {{could not have been more}} opposite. We worked with Rob first and it was like go, go, go from nine to five everyday solid and [...] we get to Aaron. He was just like so chilled. Just hanging out. He’s like, 'We’ll get to <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get to it.' So, it was a lot of adjusting to the two extremes of work styles." ...|$|E

There were times that we were playing with props that didn't read anything — I just had a bunch of dialogue to say after. We had the Commlock. All of those things {{were on the verge of}} happening anyway. Now we're way past <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> made it, 1999 seemed so far away." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{traditional}} Southern prison work song that Helm learned from his father {{while growing up in}} Arkansas. It had been recorded by several artists, including Lead Belly. Bowman states that this track was recorded between late 1967 and early 1968 in an [...] "unknown studio". Fraboni recalled taping it with the Band years later at their Shangri-La studio in Los Angeles. [...] "I remember doing <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did 'Bessie Smith' in '75. They are both great songs and sound cool," [...] he told Griffin. Helm sings the first verse; Robertson, the second; Danko, the third; and Manuel, the fourth. All four sing harmony on the chorus. Ward calls the song [...] "one of the joys of the whole collection".|$|E
2500|$|This thesis targets {{a problem}} with the nature of inquiry {{originally}} postulated by Plato in Meno. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible. In other words, [...] "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems." [...] The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this paradox. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either consciously or unconsciously, a rationalist claims we don't really [...] "learn" [...] things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.|$|E

2500|$|The band's co-lead vocalist and rapper Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{served as}} {{producers}} for the album. [...] "Typically we'll have a once-a-week meeting to go {{listen to the}} songs that they're coming up with and talk about them. For {{so early in the}} project, they are much further along than they have been on the last two albums we did. On A Thousand Suns there were still a lot of irons in the fire. We knew, 'OK, we can't do this forever. Let's leave this batch and we'll come back and address <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> start up again, Rubin said. Bennington explained that Rubin [...] "gives us spaces to just be ourselves and to work on our own...He gives us a clear and concise description of what he likes...He would like us to push ourselves into a more fresh take on that particular sound." [...] He also stated that Shinoda guides the band through the process of each song, and called the team-up of Shinoda and Rubin [...] "our golden ticket." ...|$|E
2500|$|This, Regnier continued, makes Hoffman Estates part of {{a general}} pattern of cases where {{constitutional}} concerns the Court has used proactively in other situations are often dismissed by it when the case involves drug-law enforcement, a criticism made as well by Justice John Paul Stevens, who called the Court [...] "a loyal foot soldier in the Executive's fight against [...] " [...] in a 1991 dissent. He contrasts the Court's willingness to let the village clarify its ordinance with Papachristou v. Jacksonville, where it struck down an anti-vagrancy ordinance that used a number of terms for those targeted that were necvertheless insufficiently defined. [...] "In short, the Supreme Court in Flipside would have none of this hairsplitting about whether one could adequately define drug paraphernalia—not if it would prevent American communities from combating the scourge of drugs," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> see it, the Court seemed to say," [...] alluding to Justice Potter Stewart's famous definition of hard-core pornography in Jacobellis v. Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone following the first reunion show Only {{was asked about the}} future of the Misfits, and if there were plans to continue and possibly record new music. [...] "I want it to continue. I know Doyle wants it to continue. I know Glenn wants it to continue. We just have to be big-enough people to make it continue. And that's where we're at. Whatever it takes. We're going into our 40th anniversary so the timing couldn't be more perfect. Eventually Doyle's got to write a new album; I've got to write a new album; Glenn's got to write a new album. Why don't we work together and make the greatest album ever? Now we've got different elements. We've got Doyle playing more of a metal kind of thing. We've got Dave, who we're trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing. And Glenn's got his own thing. And Acey [...] fills in good, too. And I've got the band where it is today. So it's a matter of re-molding and using all the different elements that I've got." [...] When asked if Danzig would want to record new music Only said, [...] "I think it's got to evolve naturally. The thing is we've tried to plan things, and then we stand there and wait, and as it comes we'll just do <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> go back — I don't know about Glenn — but I canceled our touring and everything for this, so I'm going to go home and write and lift." ...|$|E
