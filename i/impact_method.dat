40|$|Background: Software Change Impact Analysis (CIA) is an {{essential}} technique in software engineering to identifying the potential influences of a change, or determining change entities to accomplish such a change. The results derived, in many cases, ambiguous for the software maintainers, introduces the problem of unclear starting point of these impacted entities. Objective: In an attempt to address this issue, this work proposes a novel approach for cross-level CIA, producing a ranked list of potentially <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> derived from class-level changes. Moreover, the approach of ranking the impact results {{is expected to be}} effective for maintainers to distinguish the probability of the <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> to be false-positives. Such results provide an eclectic approach for CIA. Method: The approach, FCA-CIA, uses formal concept analysis (FCA) to produce an intermediate representation of the program based on the static analysis of the source code. The representation is called Lattice of Class and Method Dependence (LoCMD). FCA-CIA takes the changed classes in the change set as a whole, and determines the reachable set from the changed classes on the LoCMD. Based on the hierarchical property of the LoCMD, the <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> are ranked according to the impact factor metric which corresponds to the priority of these methods to be inspected. Result: Empirical evaluations on four real-world software projects demonstrate the effectiveness of the impact factor metric and the FCA-CIA technique. The result shows the predicted <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> with higher <b>impact</b> factor values {{are more likely to be}} affected by the changes. Our study also shows that the FCA-CIA technique generates more accurate impact set than the JRipples and ICP coupling based CIA technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Software change impact {{analysis}} (CIA) {{is a key}} technique to identify unexpected and potential effects caused by software changes. Given a changed entity, most of current CIA techniques compute the change effect composed of some potentially impacted entities. The generated results are often of no help to the maintainers in starting the analysis of impacted entities. In this article, we combine concept lattice with call graph together to obtain a ranked list of potentially <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> from the proposed changed methods and/or classes. These <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> are ranked based on the hierarchical feature of concept lattice, represented by an impact factor, which can then be used to prioritize these methods to be inspected. Case studies based on four real-world programs show that our approach can improve the precision of the impact result without severely decreasing its recall, when compared with results from either concept lattice or call graph used independently. In addition, the predicted <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> with higher <b>impact</b> factor values are also shown to have higher probability {{to be affected by}} the changes. Our study also shows that our approach is better than the JRipples CIA approach in removing the false-positives, but at the cost of losing more false-negatives and much more time overhead. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The propagation of vibration from the ground to a receiving room is a complex problem.

The results presented suggests that, when using the <b>impact</b> <b>method</b> excitation process (point source), the distance of impact location to the building foundation is critical, drastically affecting the resulting transfer function. In addition when using train pass-bys as the excitation process, train length is shown to have an influence on the transfer function assessed.

40|$|Regression {{testing is}} {{essential}} to ensure software quality during software evolution. Two widely-used regression testing techniques, test case selection and prioritization, are used to maximize {{the value of the}} continuously enlarging test suite. However, few works consider both these two techniques together, which decreases the usefulness of the independently studied techniques in practice. In the presence of changes during program evolution, regression testing is usually conducted by selecting the test cases that cover the impact results of the changes. It seldom considers the false-positives in the information covered. Hence, the effectiveness of such regression testing techniques is decreased. In this paper, we propose an approach, ComboRT, which combines test case selection and prioritization together to directly generate a ranked list of test cases. It is based on the impact results predicted by the change impact analysis (CIA) technique, FCA-CIA, which generates a ranked list of <b>impacted</b> <b>methods.</b> Test cases which cover these <b>impacted</b> <b>methods</b> are included in the new test suite. As each method predicted by FCA-CIA is assigned with an impact factor value corresponding to the probability of this <b>method</b> to be <b>impacted,</b> test cases are then ordered according to the impact factor values of the <b>impacted</b> <b>methods.</b> Empirical studies on four Java based software systems demonstrate that ComboRT can be effectively used for regression testing in object-oriented Java-based software systems during their evolution.

METHODS: The sampling method was chosen by convenience through quotas, with selection of elderly subjects from four programs to achieve heterogeneity in the "health status", "functional capacity", "gender", and "age" variables. The Clinical <b>Impact</b> <b>Method</b> was used, consisting of the spontaneous and elicited selection by the respondents of relevant items to the construct Quality of Life in Old Age from a previously elaborated item pool. The respondents rated each item’s importance using a 5 -point Likert scale. The product of the proportion of elderly selecting the item as relevant (frequency) and the mean importance score they attributed to it (importance) represented the overall impact of that item in {{their quality of life}} (impact). The items were ordered according to their impact scores and the top 46 scoring items were grouped in dimensions by three experts. A review of the negative items was performed. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety three people (122 women and 71 men) were interviewed. Experts distributed the 46 items into eight dimensions. Closely related items were grouped and dimensions not reaching the minimum expected number of items received additional items resulting in eight dimensions and 43 items. DISCUSSION: The sample was heterogeneous and similar to what was expected. The dimensions and items demonstrated the multidimensionality of the construct.

40|$|Abstract. Instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> test <b>method</b> is {{possible}} to obtain various dynamic fracture characteristics from the load-deflection or load-time curve. Recently, instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> test <b>method</b> is widely used {{for the evaluation of}} toughness of various specimens of different materials with different sizes. It is important to record an accurate impact load in order to improve the reliability of this test method. In some standards of instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> test <b>method</b> such as ISO and ASTM, they havent clearly standardized striker geometry which seem to directly influence the obtained impact load. There are some differences between standards, although standard procedures are well defined. Therefore, instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> test <b>method</b> has a problem that measurement value is different depending on each standard. In the present study, the effect of striking edge geometries, which are difference between ISO and ASTM, on load-deflection curve and absorbed energy were investigated. According to ISO and ASTM, two types of striker having different radius were machined. There was no difference between the two different striking edge geometries for values of absorbed energy per unit ligament area less than 0. 75 J/mm 2. However, striking edge geometry according to ASTM is not propriety for Charpy <b>impact</b> test <b>method</b> because of four, instead of three, point bending on process of fracture at high level of absorbed energy. The effect of brinelling deformation, which was considered as an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM, is very small on instrumented Charpy impact test. Consequently, there seem to be not an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM. Therefore, standards should be unified in the striking edge geometry according to ISO...|$|R

40|$|The Equotip surface {{hardness}} tester {{is becoming a}} popular method for rock and stone weathering research. In order to improve the reliability of Equotip for on-site application this study tested four porous limestones under laboratory conditions. The range of stone porosity was chosen to represent likely porosities found in weathered limestones in the field. We consider several key issues: (i) its suitability for soft and porous stones; (ii) the type of probe required for specific on-site applications; (iii) appropriate (non-parametrical) statistical methods for Equotip data; (iv) sufficient sampling size. This study shows that the Equotip is suitable for soft and porous rock and stone. From the two tested probes the DL probe has some advantages over the D probe as it correlates slightly better with open porosity and allows for more controlled sampling in recessed areas and rough or curved areas. We show that appropriate sampling sizes and robust non-parametric methods for subsequent data evaluation can produce meaningful measures of rock {{surface hardness}} derived from the Equotip. The novel Hybrid dynamic hardness, a combination of two measuring procedures [single <b>impact</b> <b>method</b> (SIM) and repeated <b>impact</b> <b>method</b> (RIM) ], has been adapted {{and is based on}} median values to provide a more robust data evaluation. For the tested stones in this study we propose a sample size of 45 readings (for a confidence level of 95 %). This approach can certainly be transferred to stone and rock with similar porosities and hardness. Our approach also allows for consistent comparisons to be made across a wide variety of studies in the fields of rock weathering and stone deterioration research...|$|E
