40|$|Looking at the German and Dutch statistics, the {{percentage}} of dust explosions in all industries dealing with <b>explosible</b> <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> which have been ignited by electrostatic discharges is about 8 - 10 %. However, in the plastics industry this value is much higher: 25 %. In particular {{in the last few}} years some rather large industrial incidents probably have been caused by electrostatic charges. To understand why accidents may happen due to static electricity the several dangerous electrostatic discharges will be discussed briefly in connection with dust explosion hazards. In particular the propagating brush discharge and the cone or " Maurer " discharge are important. Ignitions are caused mainly in the case of easily ignitable powders or hybrid mixtures (powders in combination with flammable vapours) due to isolated conductors and non-conducting materials as the product itself or such process parts as flexible hoses, internally coated silos and ducts. To illustrate how hazards by electrostatic discharges may develop in real life both on a small and a large scale a few examples will be briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the experimental determination of the fundamental flame characteristics in a <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixture</b> and the influence of turbulence on flame propagation. Experiments were carried out in a tube having a 0. 19 meter inside diameter and a length of 0. 93 meter, and 1. 86 meter with both ends closed. A dispersion system was developed giving a good quality uniform dust suspension. A comparative method for the estimation of dust flame characteristics, based on well defined methane-air flame characteristics, was developed and employed to estimate the characteristics of a flame propagating in a cornstarch <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixture.</b> A systematic study of the influence of dispersion-induced turbulence on the dust flame propagation was carried out. The influence of obstacles on flame propagation also was investigated. Some mechanisms of flame propagation in a cornstarch <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixture</b> have been proposed and discussed. In the conclusion, general remarks concerning the dust flame characteristics and the influence of turbulence on flame propagation are made. The future direction of research is also indicated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSome {{results of}} {{measurements}} of laminar burning velocities and of maximum flame temperatures for combustible <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> (starch <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures,</b> lycopodium-air mixtures and sulphur flour-air mixtures) are presented. Thin (25 and 50 mu m) thermocouples {{have been used to}} measure maximum flame temperatures. The results are compared with those obtained with other devices such as resistors, pyrometers and are compared to the theoretical values. It appears that the observed discrepancies seem principally to come from the relatively poor efficiency of the burning processes inside the flame front than to heat losses by radiation as suggested before. Two methods for determining laminar burning velocities have been used: the classical 'tube method' and a 'direct method' based on the simultaneous determination of the flame speed and of the mixture velocity ahead of the flame front using a tomographic technique. Two different tube diameters are considered as well as additional results obtained with a small burner. The validity of these techniques is firstly assessed by comparing the results obtained with CH 4 -air mixtures and secondly by considering their relevancy for combustible <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> (influence {{of the size of the}} apparatus).

This is significant for modelling of dust explosions and suggests that explosion relief may be inadequate if this factor is not taken into consideration.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for turbulent combustion and ignition of polydispersed <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> is developed. The worked out {{mathematical model}} {{takes into account}} the two-way coupling effects in gas-particles interactions and combines both deterministic and stochastic approaches. The equations of motion for particles take into consideration the influence of random turbulent pulsations in the gas flow. The models for phase transitions and chemical reactions take into account thermal destruction of dust particles, vent of volatiles, chemical reactions in the gas phase, and heterogeneous oxidation of carbon by O 2 and CO 2 influenced by both diffusive and kinetic characteristics. The model is validated in comparison with experiments on organic dust combustion in confined volumes, under different levels of initial turbulization of the mixture. The developed mathematical model makes it possible to investigate the peculiarities of polydispersed organic dusts ignition and combustion and the influence of flow nonuniformities on the ignition limits.

The model describes the behaviour of a reacting particle which undergoes different steps during reaction: heating, devolatilization and homogeneous combustion. The model predicts the maximum {{values of the}} deflagration index, also including the role of turbulence. Four explosion regimes have been introduced {{to take into account}} the effect on the KSt value of the dust diameter and of the dust shape (different from sphere). These regimes are defined as function of dimensionless numbers (Bi, Da, Th) which contain the chemico-hysical properties of the <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The effect of fuel gas addition to dust was also included in the model by calculating an equivalent gas mixture composition given by the flammable gas present in the hybrid mixture and the pyrolysis products generated from the dust pyrolysis.

40|$|The {{explosion}} behaviour of heterogeneous/homogeneous fuel-air (hybrid) mixtures is here analysed {{and compared}} to the explosion features of heterogeneous fuel-air and homogeneous fuel air mixtures separately. Experiments are performed to measure the pressure history, deflagration index and flammability limits of nicotinic acid/acetone-air mixtures in a standard 20 L Siwek bomb adapted to vapour-air mixtures. Literature data are also used for comparison. The explosion tests performed on gas-air mixtures in the same conditions as explosion tests of <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures,</b> show {{that the increase in}} explosion severity of dust/gas air mixtures has to be addressed to the role of initial level of turbulence prior to ignition. At a fixed value of the equivalence ratio, by substituting the dust to the flammable gas in a dust/gas-air mixture the explosion severity decreases. Furthermore, the most severe conditions of dust-gas/air mixtures is found during explosion of gas-air mixture at stoichiometric concentration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{well known}} {{limitation}} of the ’cube-root-law’ is that it becomes invalid when the flame thickness is significant {{with respect to the}} vessel radius. In the literature flame thicknesses in <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> ranging from 15 to 80 centimeters have been reported [1], which exceed the radii of the 20 - 1 itre sphere and the 1 m 3 vessel. Therefore we have developed a model (the three zone model) for the pressure evolution of confined dust explosions in spherical vessels which takes the flame thickness into account. The pressure-time curves that are generated with this model show a good resemblance with those measured in practice. It is shown by numerical simulations that the maximum rate of pressure rise can be normalized with respect to the vessel volume {{as well as to the}} flame thickness and that the ’cube-root-law’ becomes inaccurate for relative flame thicknesses exceeding 1 %. Furthermore, the actual burning velocity and the flame thickness during real dust explosions can be obtained by fitting the model to the experimental pressure-time curve. Applied Science...|$|R
30|$|In a methane {{explosion}} event, {{the explosion}} propagation can quickly reach supersonic and thus generates shock wave. The shock wave is well capable of suspending the settled coal and rock dusts into mine air. Under this condition, the suspended rock dust {{along with the}} unexploded coal dust {{can act as a}} physical heat sink to absorb the heat in the passing hot air for creating a temperature equilibrium between the dust and air. Based on the law of energy conservation, a simplified model can be derived for assessing the rock dust’s heat sink effect. For example, a coal dust load is assumed to be 1.2  kg per meter length of a 2  m ×  6  m mine entry to create <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixture</b> at the minimum explosive concentration of 100  g/m 3 if fully suspended in the air. To demonstrate the heat sink effect of rock dusting, the entry is dusted with limestone powder at 0.00, 2.23 and 4.80  kg per meter of entry to create 0 %, 65 % and 80 % rock dust concentrations, respectively. In an explosion event, the passing hot air at 2000  °C suspends and fully mixes with the coal and rock dusts at a point. The airborne coal and rock dusts (originally at ambient temperature of 16  °C) absorb the heat from the hot air and lower its temperature.|$|R

The Wobbe Index determined for the upper explosive concentration (4000 g/m 3) falls within range of that of hydrogen gas, and wood <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> of this concentration could therefore behave in a similar manner in a gas turbine.

40|$|AbstractDespite the {{significant}} progress made towards {{the understanding of}} flame propagation mechanisms in <b>dust-air</b> <b>mixtures,</b> dust explosions still have a frequent occurrence and their danger presents a continuous threat to industries that produce, use and treat solid powders and dusts of combustible materials. In fact, many physical aspects are still needed to be clarified given the major difference existing between flame propagating in gaseous mixtures and in suspensions and many questions are still unanswered regarding the reasons behind the violence of fine metal dust explosions. Few experimental observations and theoretical considerations emphasized the potential role of radiation heat transfer in the behaviour of dust clouds’ flames in which acceleration in flame propagation speed and instabilities were observed. Unfortunately, only few information is available, so far, concerning the capacity of radiative transfers of {{taking part in the}} propagation process. While investigating radiation phenomenon in dust clouds, we are faced with a complicated problem difficult to model analytically. The development of numerical approach, based on discrete element method (DEM), in order to treat this problem, seems more convenient. MULTICOR code, developed at the LTI, has already succeeded at modelling heat transfer in a bed of particles. Under this work, radiative heat transfer exchanged between particles in suspension is successfully calculated and we propose an original method of calculating heat transfers between dust and gas in the preheat zone of the flame. We are currently working on adapting the radiation models implemented to the case of fine particles and taking into consideration light scattered.
