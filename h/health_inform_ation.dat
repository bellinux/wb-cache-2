This paper argues that the high resolution geospatial im ages of our earth's surface, produced from the earth observing satellites, can m ke a person visually exposed, resulting in a technological invasion of personal privacy. We propose a suitableaut horizat ion model for geospat ialdat a (GSAM) where controlled access can be specified based on the region covered by an im age with privilegem odes that include view, zoom-in, overlay and identify. Wedem onstrate how access control can be e#ciently enforced using a spatial indexing structure, called MX-RS quadtree, a variant of the MX-CIF quadtree. 1 Introducti on In the year 2000 and the newm illennium, there will be 31 satellites capable of providing land cover data at resolutions of 1 to 30 m eters in orbit; 14 of these will be privately funded by US corporations, all with resolutions of 10 m eters or better.

40|$|The {{concept of}} SAFRINET {{is that of}} {{establishing}} and sustaining cooperation and coordination in taxonomy between the SADC member States to develop realistic self-reliance in this science to meet the sub-regions requirements. This is being done by pooling and sharing existing and developing local resources both human and physical, to develop a functional network of skilled people who use their expertise and national resources and infrastructures {{to contribute to the}} SADC objective, i. e., Towards Economic Liberation. 2. STRATEGIES The strategy has four main areas of approach which have been designed and instituted to enable the fulfilment of the SAFRINET objective, which is realistic self-reliance in biosystematic capacity. The main areas of approach are information and communication services, training in biosystematics, development and rehabilitation of resources, and development and application of new biosystematic technologies. These are annotated below. i. Information and Communication Services The installation of an <b>inform</b> <b>ation</b> and a comm unication network infrastructure for scientists to liaise with one another and those who have need of their services and to avoid the costly duplication of information and skills. SAFRINET proposes holding specialised literature at Centres of Excellence within the com munity and com municating relevant <b>inform</b> <b>ation</b> to users. In order to utilise individual country's resources as a subregional asset and to enable rapid response sophisticated, fast, efficient and reliable communication systems need to be established and maintained. ii. Training in Biosystematics The provision of an efficient, quality biosystematic service to the agricultural, medical, scientific and other sectors of the community requires investment in human resources. To attain SAFRINET's objectives people skilled to operate in technical and scientific positions are required. Training to embrace new recruits for new posts and of incumbents for redeployment as taxonomists or support staff. iii. Development and Rehabilitation of Resource...|$|R

Given the model struc-ture, the proposed model can estimate economic impacts by type of secondary repercussions (indirect, and induced spillovers), by industry type and by zone. In addition, the proposed model will forecast the size of land by land-use type and by zone and estimate changes in traf ® c volumes on transport networks due to an urban policy.

40|$|Measuring the {{integrity}} of critical operating system components and securely storing these measurements in a hardware-protected Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a well-known approach for improving system security. However, currently {{it is not possible}} to securely extend this approach to TPMs used in virtualized environments. In this paper, we show how to multiplex integrity measurements of arbitrarily many Virtual Machines (VMs) with just a single standard TPM. In contrast to existing approaches such as vTPM, our approach achieves a higher level of security since measurements will never be held in software but are fully hardware-protected by the TPM at all times. We establish an integrity-protected mapping between each measurement and its respective VM such that it is not possible for an attacker to alter this mapping during remote attestation without being detected. Furthermore, all measurements will be stored in the TPM in a concealed manner in order to prevent <b>inform</b> <b>ation</b> leakage of other VMs during remote attestation.
