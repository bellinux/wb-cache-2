25|$|Genetic {{maps are}} very {{important}} to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping.</b> It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} these {{homeotic}} genes determine an organ’s identity becomes evident when a gene that represents a particular function, for example the A gene, is not expressed. In Arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. This method for studying gene function uses reverse genetics techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through RNA interference. In other studies, using forward genetics techniques such as <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping,</b> it is {{the analysis of the}} phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest. The flowers may possess a non-functional or over expressed allele for the gene being studied.|$|E
25|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism {{plays an}} important role in genome wide association studies because they act as primary biomarker. SNPs are currently the marker of choice due to their large numbers in virtually all populations of individuals. The location of these biomarkers can be tremendously important in terms of predicting functional significance, <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> and population genetics. Each SNP represents a nucleotide change between two individuals at a defined location. SNPs are the most common genetic variant found in all individual with one SNP every 100–300 bp in some species. Since there is a massive number of SNPs on the genome, there is a clear need to prioritize SNPs according to their potential effect in order to expedite genotyping and analysis.|$|E

To combine next generation sequencing technology with SRAP, Illumina's Solexa sequencing was used to sequence tagged SRAP PCR products. Results Three sets of SRAP primers and three sets of tagging primers were used in 77, 568 SRAP PCR reactions and {{the same number of}} tagging PCR reactions respectively to produce a pooled sample for Illumina's Solexa sequencing. After sequencing, 1. 28 GB of sequence with over 13 million paired-end sequences was obtained and used to match Solexa sequences with their corresponding SRAP markers and to integrate Solexa sequences on an ultradense <b>genetic</b> <b>map.</b> The ultradense <b>genetic</b> bin <b>map</b> with 465 bins was constructed using a recombinant inbred (RI) line mapping population in B. rapa. For this ultradense <b>genetic</b> bin <b>map,</b> 9, 177 SRAP markers, 1, 737 integrated unique Solexa paired-end sequences and 46 SSR markers representing 10, 960 independent genetic loci were assembled and 141 unique Solexa paired-end sequences were matched with their corresponding SRAP markers. The <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> in B. rapa was aligned with the previous ultradense <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> in B. napus through common SRAP markers in these two species. Additionally, SSR markers were used to perform alignment of the current <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> with other five <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> in B. rapa and B. napus. Conclusion We used SRAP to construct an ultradense <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> with 10, 960 independent genetic loci in B. rapa that is the most saturated <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> ever constructed in this species.

The most up-to-date version of the A. thaliana genome is maintained by the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR).

40|$|Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) is an {{important}} food legume crop of rainfed agriculture. Owing to exposure of the crop {{to a number of}} biotic and abiotic stresses, the crop productivity has remained stagnant for almost last five decades at ca. 750 kg/ha. The availability of a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system has facilitated the development and release of hybrids which are expected to enhance the productivity of pigeonpea. Recent advances in genomics and molecular breeding such as marker-assisted selection (MAS) offer the possibility to accelerate hybrid breeding. Molecular markers and <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> are pre-requisites for deploying MAS in breeding. However, in the case of pigeonpea, only one inter- and two intra-specific <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> are available so far. Here, four new intra-specific <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> comprising 59 – 140 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci with map lengths ranging from 586. 9 to 881. 6 cM have been constructed. Using these four <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> together with two recently published intra-specific <b>genetic</b> <b>maps,</b> a consensus map was constructed, comprising of 339 SSR loci spanning a distance of 1, 059 cM.

Here, we present a new <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> for an Arabidopsis Bayreuth × Shahdara recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, built on RNA-seq data. RNA-seq analysis on 160 RILs of this population identified 30, 049 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the whole genome. Based on a 100 -kbp window SNP binning method, 1059 bin-markers were identified, physically anchored on the genome. The total length of the RNA-seq <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> spans 471. 70 centimorgans (cM) with an average marker distance of 0. 45 cM and a maximum marker distance of 4. 81 cM.

To highlight the advantages of such high-density map, we compared it to two publicly available <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> for the same population, comprising 69 PCR-based markers and 497 gene expression markers derived from microarray data, respectively. In this study, we show that SNP markers can effectively be derived from RNA-seq data.

Based on the average rate of recombination (centimorgans/kb) found for other S. cerevisiae chromosomes, the outermost markers on the <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> of chromosome I were expected to be close {{to the ends of the}} DNA molecule. While the rightmost genetic marker was 3 kb from the end, the leftmost marker, CDC 24, was located near the middle of the left arm, suggesting that the <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> would be much longer. To extend the <b>genetic</b> <b>map,</b> a copy of the S. cerevisiae URA 3 gene was integrated in the outermost cloned region located 32 kb centromere distal to CDC 24, and the <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> distance between these two genes was determined. The new marker substantially increased the <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> length of chromosome I. In addition, we determined the relationship between physical and <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> distance along most of the length of the chromosome. Consistent with the longer <b>genetic</b> <b>map,</b> the average rate of recombination between markers on chromosome I was greater than 50 % higher than the average found on other yeast chromosomes.
