5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the <b>decay</b> <b>fungus</b> Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E

40|$|The {{microbial}} {{invasion of}} unpeeled birch pulpwood during outside storage was studied. It was {{shown that the}} wood was invaded {{by a number of}} different micro-organisms -especially by fungi. Fungi with a minor wood-destroying capacity were found early in the wood, but later disappeared, being unable to compete with more pronounced wood-destroyers. When various <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> were cultured together, most frequently the mycelium of one of the two species finally suppressed or destroyed that of the other. Corticium laeve, for instance, which occurs in the wood at an early stage, was suppressed and its mycelium lysed by most of the other <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> tested. Temperature had a decisive effcct on the development of interaction phenomena between <b>decay</b> <b>fungi.</b> Coloured contact-zones between two different mycelia commonly occurred in culture. Interactions between bacteria isolated from birch and aspen pulpwood and <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> found in the same wood were studied. If the bacteria were transferred to the substrate before or {{at the same time as}} the <b>decay</b> <b>fungi,</b> the development of the latter was almost always reduced. If, on the contrary, the bacterial inoculation was performed after the fungal inoculation, the inhibiting effect often did not occur; a stimulation of the activity of the fungi even resulted. The bacteria produced diffusable substances, which could reduce or inhibit the growth of the <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> at considerable distance from the bacterial colony. The temperature had a substantial influence on the antagonistic activity of the bacteria on agar as well as in wood. Small amounts of culture filtrate from bacteria could completely replace thiamine in a nutrient solution for thiamine-heterotrophic <b>decay</b> <b>fungi.</b> One wood bacterium species greatly accelerated the decomposition caused by <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> on wood impregnated with o-aminophenol or sodium pentachlorophenate...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to his teaching, Grand conducted research {{on a variety of}} mycological areas. Grand did research on ectomycorrhizal fungi {{on a wide variety of}} plants including conifers and ericaceous plants. His PhD work focused on the genus Suillus, which is an ectomycorrhizal fungus that associates with a variety of conifers. Grand did not describe many species, but he resurrected the name Suillus americanus var. reticulipes, which later was redacted to S. americanus. He did some research with ectomycorrhizae fungi associated with ericaceous hosts, which led to a patent for a method of lyophilizing ericoid mycorrhizae fungi for horticulture application. In addition, he studied the biology of ectomycorrhizal trees and the resiliency of trees when grown in suboptimal environments, such as high air pollutants. His passion was for wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi,</b> and this was highlighted in his research on this group of fungi. Several projects were related to the biogeography of poroid wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi,</b> and were in part possible due to his participation in the All Taxon Biodiversity Inventory Project of the Great Smoky Mountains. These projects resulted in expanding geographic distribution ranges, ecological niches, and hosts of numerous species of wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi.</b> This research showed that North Carolina and the Southern Appalachia region is a center of biodiversity of wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> and a transition for temperate and subtropical species of wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi.</b> Grand's work on wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> in this area was greatly important, and will continue to be cited as geographic ranges expand due to climate change. Grand served as the fungal inventory biologist for the North Carolina Parks Service. Lastly, he was involved with research that was related to plant pathogenic fungi, including work with powdery mildew on several hosts, Honeylocust canker, Fusiform rust, and Phytophthora root rot of Frasier Fir. Grand was highly published in journals to include Phytopathology, Mycologia, Mycotaxon and Plant Disease to name a few.

50|$|A further {{possible}} way of combating dry rot {{is by the}} use of antagonistic organisms that reduce the ability of the <b>decay</b> <b>fungus</b> to colonise or degrade the wood. The principle here is that when in a building the fungus is not in its natural environment and therefore natural competitors are unlikely to be present. It may, however, be possible to introduce these competitors into the building environment to control the dry rot.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the in vitro studies was to identify a Trichoderma strain with a high antagonistic potential against the basidiomycetes Ganoderma adspersum, Ganoderma lipsiense, Inonotus hispidus, Polyporus squamosus and the ascomycete Kretzschmaria deusta. For this purpose dual culture and interaction tests in wood blocks as well as investigations on fungal growth and germination behavior of conidia under different conditions were performed. Hyphal interactions were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of Trichoderma spp. on wood colonization and degradation of wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> were quantitatively analyzed by means of dry weight loss measurements of wood and qualitatively by histological studies. The different Trichoderma species all showed an antagonistic potential against wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> in the in vitro studies.

40|$|Wood rot is {{a serious}} fungal disease of trees. Wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> {{penetrate}} and gain entry into trees through pruning cuts or open wounds using extracellular digestive enzymes to attack all components of the cell wall, leading {{to the destruction of}} sapwood which compromises wood strength and stability. On living trees, {{it is often difficult to}} diagnose wood rot disease, particularly during extreme weather conditions when trees can fail, causing tree parts to fall onto people and property. Today, tree stability evaluation and inner decay detection are performed visually and by the use of commercial instruments and methods that are often invasive, time-consuming and sometimes inadequate for use within the urban environment. Moreover, most conventional instruments do not provide an adequate evaluation of decay that occurs in the root system. A long-term research project, initiated in 2004, was aimed at developing a novel approach for diagnosing inner tree decays by detecting differences in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> and wood from healthy and decayed trees. Different commercial electronic noses (ENs) were tested under laboratory conditions and directly in the field, on healthy and artificially-inoculated stem wood chips, and root fragments. The first stage of the research was focused on testing different commercially available electronic noses (e-noses) for the capabilities of discriminating between different strains and species of wood <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> as well as sapwood belonging to different tree species. In the second stage, sapwood of different tree species was artificially inoculated with <b>decay</b> <b>fungi</b> to test the diagnostic ability of the e-noses to detect differences in aroma bouquets emitted by healthy and inoculated woods. Root fragments were then inoculated with specific root <b>decaying</b> <b>fungi</b> and incubated under different types of soils to assess whether soil odors could influence the ability of the e-nose to discriminate between non-inoculated and diseased root fragments.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{individual}} and interaction effects of wood extractives, acid copper chromate (ACC), and boric acid (B) on the resistance to fungus of treated wood species. Walnut (Juglans regia L.) heartwood extractives were extracted with hot water, methanol, and ethanol solvents. Test specimens were prepared from beech sapwood (Fagus orientalis) to meet BS 838 (1961) requirements, then exposed to white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor, for 14 weeks under laboratory conditions. Extractives of walnut heartwood contributed to increased resistance against fungus attack {{in the presence of}} B preservative only. The lowest weight loss (0. 12 %) occurred in the samples treated with 3. 5 % hot water extract and 1 % boric acid, and the highest weight loss occurred in the control samples (23. 7 %). Results indicated that there was significant difference between the weight loss and actual retention for all treatments, but there was not any significant difference between the weight loss of treatments containing B preservative. The weight loss of samples treated with hot water extract (18. 32 %) was less than samples treated with methanol and ethanol extracts (21. 5 % and 23. 1 %, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT Improved Fumigants After 13 years, chioropicrin, methylisothiocyanate (MIT), Vapam, and Vorlex {{continue}} to effectively control internal decay of pressure-treated Douglas-fir transmission poles. The estimated retreating schedules for {{application of these}} fumigants to treated wood may be as long as 10 years for Vapam and 15 years for the others. The close-tube bioassay, developed during this research, {{has proven to be}} an effective method for determining the persistence of these fumigants in wood and should help in determining when fumigant-treated poles should be retreated. The use of gelatin to encapsulate MIT for wood treatment was ideal because the capsules did not react with MIT, were MIT impermeable when dry, permitting prolonged storage without significant fumigant loss, and readily released MIT when moistened in the wood. Although release of encapsulated MIT in the wood was enhanced by small amounts of water, excess moisture appeared to hinder MIT diffusion into wood. Assays of Vapam treated wood show that the amount of MIT released by breakdown of Vapam is significantly lower than the expected theoretical yield from this fumigant. Encapsulated MIT reduced the <b>decay</b> <b>fungus</b> population in poles in service more effectively than applications of Vapam. The effectiveness of a fumigant in controlling decay may be expressed as the product of the fumigant concentration (C) and the time (T) the <b>decay</b> <b>fungus</b> is exposed to the fumigant before it succumbs.
