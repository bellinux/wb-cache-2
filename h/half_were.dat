5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the other <b>half</b> <b>were</b> either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} end of {{hostilities}} in the Pacific, the recently established garrison headquarters No.11 Group unofficially directed the wing's operations. Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, No.82 Wing's Liberators were converted to transports and used to repatriate RAAF personnel from the South West Pacific. Over the course of its wartime existence, the wing's personnel numbered between 3,000 and 5,000, of whom more than <b>half</b> <b>were</b> ground crew. Along with its flying squadrons, its complement included No.24 Air Stores Park, No.6 Repair and Servicing Unit, and No.30 Medical Clearing Station.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 500,000 Volksdeutsche living in Yugoslavia before the war, about <b>half</b> <b>were</b> evacuated, 50,000 died in Yugoslav concentration camps, 15,000 {{were killed by}} the Partisans and about 150,000 were deported to the Soviet Union as forced labourers. They were also stripped of their property. By 1948, only 55,337 Volksdeutsche remained in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Bačka is now part of Vojvodina, an autonomous province of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The 24-man {{animation}} {{team was}} {{split into two}} groups. <b>Half</b> <b>were</b> assigned {{to the creation of}} the 15 new CGI creatures populating noitulovE (in Maya), while the other half created the backgrounds (in Houdini). Compositing work – combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and CGI elements – was performed in Flame and Inferno. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the 576i definition used by British PAL-encoded television sets, to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.|$|E
5|$|The border fortifications were {{progressively}} {{torn down}} and eventually {{abandoned in the}} months following its opening. Dozens of new crossings were opened by February 1990, and the guards no longer carried weapons nor made much effort to check travellers' passports. The guards' numbers were rapidly reduced; <b>half</b> <b>were</b> dismissed within five months of the opening. On 1July 1990 the border was abandoned and the Grenztruppen were officially abolished; all but 2,000 of them were dismissed or transferred to other jobs.|$|E

5|$|The fire {{resulted}} in 244people requiring medical aidmainly {{on the first}} day of the fire. From those 117 had symptoms attributable to the incident, of whom 38 were members of the public. The majority of those visiting hospitals were from the rescue services and attended for precautionary check ups. Most of them had no symptoms, except for 63 emergency workers who suffered respiratory complaints, of which <b>half</b> <b>were</b> sore throats.|$|E
5|$|The main beaches, codenamed White and Red, lay {{in front}} of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the {{majority}} of the 4th and 6th Brigades became pinned down on the beach, and despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the Calgary Tank Regiment, casualties were heavy. Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than <b>half</b> <b>were</b> killed, wounded or captured.|$|E
5|$|Across eastern Mexico, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused mudslides and floods, which {{damaged or destroyed}} 90,000houses, and damaged or destroyed about 3,088,000acres (1,250,000hectares) of crop fields; thousands of livestock were also killed. The floods affected 819 Municipalities of Mexico in 17states and the federal district, leaving about 500,000people homeless, of whom <b>half</b> <b>were</b> in Tabasco and Veracruz states. Several ports were closed due to the floods. Although power lines were downed, most electrical systems were not damaged, and power was quickly restored within a week in most areas. A total of 39rivers overflowed, which washed away bridges, roads, dams, and some entire houses, and {{there were thousands of}} landslides, mostly in unpopulated areas. Collectively, 28federal highways and 300rural roads were closed or damaged. The federal highway network sustained damage in 1,237locations as a result of 1,164landslides or mudslides and 28damaged bridges. Damage was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos).|$|E

5|$|American {{businessman}} and philanthropist Armand Hammer, {{well known to}} the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with 2,300 pounds of medical supplies that were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, and the other <b>half</b> <b>were</b> his own personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who {{had worked in the}} aftermath of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich led {{all players}} with nine tackles. Of the nine stops, {{one and a}} <b>half</b> <b>were</b> for {{negative}} yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was Cody Grimm, who had eight tackles, {{two and a half}} of which were for losses. One and a half of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced a fumble and broke up one Boston College pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. Boston College sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First <b>Half</b> <b>were</b> either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

5|$|Further {{complicating the}} sales {{situation}} was the announcement by JaguarSport of a road-going {{version of the}} Jaguar XJR-9, {{the last of the}} racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine. The Jaguar XJR-15 was developed by TWR and styled by Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar, and featured the V12 engine {{and a host of other}} technologies not adopted for the XJ220, including carbon fibre construction and the option of a six-speed racing gearbox. It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale; only 50 were built, each with a list price of £600,000 ($1 million) in 1990. It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road-legal vehicle. About <b>half</b> <b>were</b> built as road-going variants, which added £55,000 to the list price.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{sector of the}} island, in February 1945, Major General Kesao Kijima—commander of the Japanese 38th Independent Mixed Brigade— had ordered a withdrawal to Numa Numa, following the fighting around Tsimba Ridge. He subsequently left a force of 1,400 sailors drawn from the 87th Naval Garrison Force and 2,000 civilians to hold the Bonis Peninsula. Of these civilians, about 600 were armed, although only <b>half</b> <b>were</b> trained to undertake a combat role. As their supplies dwindled, in May–June the Japanese sailors—under the command of Captain Eikichi Kato, the senior naval officer in Buka—began to raid the Australian supply lines between Ruri Bay and Ratsua as they attempted {{to hold a position}} between Porton Plantation and Tarbut.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} the first ever game played by the University of Alabama, a team of Birmingham-area high school players lost to the Cadets 56–0 at Birmingham's Lakeview Park. Played on November 11, the game served as a {{practice}} game for Alabama's contest against the Birmingham Athletic Club scheduled for the next day. Although details of the second half are unavailable, touchdowns in the first <b>half</b> <b>were</b> scored by David Grayson, G. H. Kyser, Dan Smith (twice), William Little and T. S. Frazer. The play utilized most throughout the game was a rushing formation developed by Harvard earlier in the season called the flying wedge.|$|E

5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other <b>half</b> <b>were</b> fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, <b>half</b> <b>were</b> out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{had some}} {{difficulties}} with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols.

After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen; Roddenberry acquiesced. He had been promised five full seasons of the new show, but ultimately, only one and a <b>half</b> <b>were</b> produced.|$|E
