40|$|Per capita {{energy and}} water {{consumption}} figures of five fully accredited eco-resorts were benchmarked against 11 hotels, 13 condominium complexes and six caravan parks located in three major tourist destinations in Queensland, Australia. Somewhat surprisingly, it appears some eco-resorts fail to achieve above average standards with respect to these dimensions of environmental performance. The most efficient resource consumption outcomes were evident where resource use efficiency was factored in at the early stage of resort planning. A noteworthy observation was {{that none of the}} businesses investigated could provide data for waste and wastewater production. The problems of developing a benchmarking process for the consumption of water and electricity by accommodation providers are discussed. A major obstacle was found in the fact that consumption rates are influenced by a multitude of site specific characteristics such as age of building, building size and layout, nature of operation, extent of communal facilities, climate, etc. With such a large number of factors affecting {{energy and water}} consumption, one is drawn into the problem of how many benchmarking groups need to be developed in order for benchmarking accommodation complex resource consumption to be a meaningful exercise. This also renders problematic the development of <b>environmental</b> compliance <b>accreditation</b> criteria. The study's findings renew concerns about the focus of some industry administered green accreditation schemes and the emphasis placed on their role as a key instrument for promoting more sustainable outcomes for the tourist accommodation sector.

40|$|Relations between {{northern}} Ontario’s human {{communities and}} black bears {{have often been}} violent, and hunting is promoted for economic and “safety” reasons. The Ontario spring bear hunt was previously banned but was recently reinstated, compounding concerns about human-bear conflict and bear management. Today, both human-bear conflict and the stagnation of the northern economy continue, despite increased killing of black bears in the spring hunting season. This thesis considers alternatives to the hunting of bears. Specifically, it assesses bear viewing programs and the added benefits of collaborative <b>environmental</b> agreements and <b>accreditation</b> programs. I explore the potential of these alternative programs to address human-bear conflict, to benefit local settler and indigenous communities, and to reduce resource exploitation in northern Ontario. The thesis is driven by two research questions: (i) what ecotourism policies, strategies, and programs are the most viable for Ontario? (ii) Which policies or programs offer the most potential for fostering solidarity within and across species, as well as economic, social, political, and environmental benefits for northern Ontario communities? I consider these questions by utilizing a combination of targeted, semi-structured interviews and a multispecies reimagining of an Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) framework. Three industry specialists were interviewed in order to interrogate the policy benefits and limitations of the Great Bear Rainforest Agreement, as well as bear viewing programs within the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary, Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary, and the Great Bear Rainforest. I argue that these programs offer important lessons and models that should be utilized and imitated in northern Ontario in order to transform interspecies relations and mitigate ongoing conflict. The results confirm the educational, cultural, and economic value and importance of guided bear viewing and accompanying habitat protection. This study also reveals areas of possibility and incentive for locales seeking to transition into ecotourism...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2009 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 27, 28, and 29, 2009 Athens, Georgia. This {{presentation}} introduces several conservation alternatives in rainwater and stormwater management. These concepts include greenway acquisition, wetlands, cisterns, pervious concrete, earthworks, {{native plants}} and green roofs. By implementing these practices Atlanta could use rainwater more efficiently. This paper examines water {{use in the}} Metro North GA Water Planning District, which encompasses 14 counties. This paper 1) compares daily water use to an accumulation of 1 -inch of rainwater within the district, 2) describes the cost of treating stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, and 3) loss of groundwater recharge due {{to the presence of}} impervious surface (Figure 1. American River). The alternatives presented here evolved from research promoted by USGBC's Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> Design LEED <b>accreditation</b> process. The concepts include forgotten knowledge from thousands of years ago (e. g. cisterns, green roofs, and earthworks) and those only a few decades old (e. g. pervious concrete, wetlands replication, bio-swales). Although these methods are sometimes initially more costly, when properly installed and maintained, they have a life-cyclecost less than today’s traditional systems of paving and piping stormwater [...] By implementing simple and natural concepts in rainwater and stormwater management, water can be cleaned, harvested, and used in an efficient way; thus, reducing the financial burden and environmental problems created in the past century. Specific alternatives to be presented include: • Loss of pervious land • The cost of this loss • The problems with traditional infrastructure • New ways of management. • Greenway Acquisition: Purchase and restoration of native ecosystems primarily along streams • Small Ponds and Wetlands: Cisterns: Onsite storage of water for onsite use • Pervious Concrete: Allows stormwater runoff to be treated and then returned to the ground • Contouring land through Earthworks: Introducing basins and swales to keep the water on the land longer for plants and groundwater recharge. • Native Plants: Using native plants for diversity and natural water use. • Green Roofs: Promoting Green Roofs for stormwater management, reducing the heat island effect and increasing insulation References: American Rivers, Natural Resources Defense Council and Smart Growth America, Report Landscaping with Native Plants Fact Sheet [URL] #Native% 20 Plant Metro North GA Water Planning District 5 year update for 2008, Chattahoochee Basin Advisory Committee meetings, Metcalf & Eddy | AECOMSponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U.
