Active exchanges are found in 29 emerging market countries, mostly trading financial products. Volume concentration measures suggest that smaller exchanges have increased their market shares outpacing larger ones. This is confirmed by a clear and significant reduction in the concentration index between developed and emerging market exchanges in favor of the latter. Non-US exchanges have dominated US counterparts, while trade has increasingly concentrated on financial derivatives rather than commodities. Exchange-traded derivatives showed a greater concentration than OTC markets, although these described a faster increase in concentration levels...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} architecture, {{elements}} of market design, and the products traded in <b>derivatives</b> <b>exchanges</b> around the world. The core {{function of a}} derivatives exchange is to facilitate the transfer of risk among economic agents by providing mechanisms to enhance liquidity and facilitate price discovery. They test the proposition that organizational arrangements necessary to perform this function {{are not the same}} across markets. They also examine the sequencing of products introduced in <b>derivatives</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Using a survey instrument, they find that: a) Financial systems perform the same core functions across time and place but institutional arrangements differ. b) The ownership structure of <b>derivatives</b> <b>exchanges</b> assumes different forms across markets. c) The success of an exchange depends on the structure adopted and the products traded. d) Exchanges are regulated directly or indirectly through a government law. In addition, exchanges have their own regulatory structure. e) Typically (but not always) market-making systems are based on open outcry, with daily mark-to-market and gross margining [...] but electronic systems are gaining popularity. f) Several (but not all) exchanges own clearing facilities and use netting settlement procedures. As for derivative products traded, they find that: i) Although most of the older exchanges started with (mainly agricultural) commodity derivatives, newer exchanges first introduce financial derivative products. ii) Derivatives based on a domestic stock index have greater potential for success followed by derivatives based on local interest rates and currencies. iii) The introduction of derivatives contracts appears to take more time in emerging markets compared with developed markets, with the exception of index products.

Ôhe investigation of its price discovery mechanism has been motivated by the existing paucity of similar research in such newly established (emerging) futures markets and the growing importance of this market for both investors and the Greek capital market. The results show the presence of a bi- directional causality between stock index spot and futures markets, indicating that the newly established ADEX can provide futures contracts that serve as a focal point of information assimilation and fulfil their price discovery.
