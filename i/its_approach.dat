The bridge and <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> highways, connecting the main branch of Primary State Highway 1 in Seattle to its Eastside branch near Bellevue, {{were added to}} the state highway system in March 1961. The western approach, an expressway between the Roanoke Interchange, Portage Bay, Montlake, and the Washington Park Arboretum, began construction in early 1962. The eastern approach was constructed between 1962 and 1963, connecting Medina, Secondary State Highway 2A in southern Houghton, and Northup Way, which continued east towards Redmond.|$|E

5|$|The BRA {{subsequently}} re-evaluated <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> {{to urban}} renewal in its future projects, including {{the construction of}} Government Center. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the Dorchester neighborhood, the first Community Health Center in the United States. It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center. The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized from 1984 to 1990 into a mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments.|$|E

5|$|The {{advisory}} board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> to selecting {{new members of}} the Order of Canada, generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown; political interference has occurred only once, when in 1978 Paul Desmarais's investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. However, some of the committee's selections have caused controversy. For instance, the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson, host of the long-running Sunday Night Sex Show, as a Member stirred controversy among some of Canada's Christian organizations, as Johanson had taught teenagers methods of safe sex alongside abstinence. Similarly, the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the snow {{hurricane}} prior to <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> near New England are mostly unknown. Though a modern study conducted in 2006 traced its origins to north of Puerto Rico on 4October 1804 and reports indicated it also passed by Dominique and Guadaloupe the same day, little else was known about the storm until <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> towards the East Coast of the United States and transit near South Carolina. Weather historian David Ludlum concluded that both the hurricane's strength and its abnormally cold environment were derived from the influx of unseasonably cold air from the north converging upon the storm's abundant moisture, increasing the pressure gradient and leading to intensification. He also speculated that the storm could have formed non-tropically from the southern Appalachian Mountains before arriving on the Atlantic coast, but given meteorological circumstances, characteristics, and timing, it was evaluated that the storm was of tropical origin. The earliest evidence of a disturbance near the United States was noted on 8October, when rainfall was recorded in upstate New York, precipitated by the storm's western periphery in advance of an approaching trough. The following morning, the trough's motion near the Virginia Capes area was accompanied by intensifying winds and a change in their direction; initially southwesterly force3, the incoming gale's winds rapidly turned towards the west-northwest, escalating to force6 by the afternoon. A 2001study noted the unusual orientation of the storm's winds; although a majority of New England hurricanes induced southeasterly gusts, the 1804 snow hurricane's, in contrast, were mostly southwesterly.|$|E

Ellefson explained that the band changed <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.|$|E
5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|By the late-19th century, Charing Cross {{was seen}} as being inconveniently placed. In 1889, the newly-formed London County Council's John Burns {{proposed}} that the station and <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> should be demolished, with a road bridge put in place. The idea gained support with in the council as it would allow the Strand to be widened and put a road crossing over the Thames that could bypass Whitehall. When the SECR went to Parliament asking for an act to strengthen the bridge in 1916, Burns suggested the station {{was in the wrong}} place and should be rebuilt {{on the south side of}} the Thames. The following year, an act was passed to reconstruct the bridge, with strict conditions about its appearance and a ban on enlarging the station building itself.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> with showers of grapeshot.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a booming economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam {{technology in the}} mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication {{of what he had}} hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in <b>its</b> <b>approach.</b> A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E

During {{the first week}} in March 1942, the wooden-hulled coastal minesweeper plied the waters of Boston harbor and <b>its</b> <b>approaches,</b> performing tasks which would soon become familiar. At night, she functioned as a guard and escort vessel; then, as sunrise came, she began daily exploratory sweeps, searching for moored, magnetic, and sonic mines in the harbor and <b>its</b> <b>approaches.</b> At times, severe weather or low visibility forced Trident to secure from sweep operations; and, in foggy weather, she helped to regulate harbor traffic.|$|R
5|$|For an {{operation}} of the size and complexity of Frequent Wind, casualties were relatively light.

5|$|Hurricane Emily in 1993 caused record {{flooding}} in the Outer Banks of North Carolina while remaining just offshore. The fifth named storm {{and the first}} and strongest hurricane of the year's hurricane season, Emily developed from a tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles on August22. It moved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on August25, after becoming nearly stationary southeast of Bermuda. Emily then curved to the southwest but quickly resumed its northwest trajectory while strengthening into a hurricane. Late on August31, the hurricane reached peak winds of 115mph (185km/h) on <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> to North Carolina. Although part of the eye passed over Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks, its absolute center remained 23mi (37km/h) offshore. Gradually weakening, the hurricane swerved away from the coast toward the northeast and later east. Emily stalled again, this time northeast of Bermuda, and dissipated on September6 to the southeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{the entire}} length of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was widened into a divided highway, which at the time was the best {{superhighway}} and the longest stretch of divided highway in the world. During the course of the 1930s, several other state roads were constructed while others were widened into divided highways. In 1935, the DSHD took over maintenance of all remaining county roads, tripling the mileage of the state highway system, and took over several city streets in Wilmington in 1936. Progress on improving the state highway system slowed during World War II; the only major project completed during that time was the construction of the high-level St. Georges Bridge to replace a lift bridge destroyed by a ship in 1939. Following the war, several highway improvement projects took place including widening more roads to divided highways. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> road opened to traffic, providing a fixed road link for US 40 across the Delaware River to New Jersey and replacing ferry service that previously existed. Following the completion of the bridge, traffic along US 13 and US 40 increased, with plans made for a new freeway to handle the increased traffic. In 1957, US 13 was widened into a divided highway between Greenwood and Harrington, providing a divided highway running the north-south length of the state.|$|E
