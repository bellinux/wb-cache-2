500|$|For example, a {{punk rock}} band formed in Chile in 2008 named {{themselves}} Omayra Sánchez; they express their [...] "discontent {{that they feel}} with the negligence {{on the part of}} the people who in this day and age run the world". Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero (1988), written by Eduardo Santa as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe. In No Morirás (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house. Isabel Allende's short story, [...] "And of Clay Are We Created" [...] ("De barro estamos hechos"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, [...] "Her [...] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>dreams.</b> Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] is an EDM {{song that}} {{features}} heavy bass; it lasts for 3 minutes and 42 seconds. The instrumentation {{is provided by}} an acoustic guitar and synthesizers. Brown uses auto-tune on the hook and breakdown. [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] is written in the key of B♭ major and is set in common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Brown's vocal range spans from the note of G4 to the note of C6. The song contains lyrics about a lost loved one who exists only in a dream, as stated by Brittany R. Villalva of The Christian Post. [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] begins with a spoken introduction by an unidentified woman saying, [...] "Dearly Beloved, if this love only exists <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>dreams,</b> don't wake me up". Robbie Daw of Idolator compared her voice to that of Rihanna. The song's chorus consists of the hook [...] "Don't wake me up". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that the chorus [...] "flourishes into a pulse-racing mix of thundering beats and squiggly electronic swizzles". HitFix's Melinda Newman noted that the song [...] "resembles the sweet bounciness of 'Forever'".|$|E

2500|$|This time, teacher Elli Erl {{emerged as}} the winner. Though Erl agreed to release the Bohlen-produced {{coronation}} song [...] "This Is My Life" [...] in a remixed edition, she declined collaborating with him on her debut album <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Dreams</b> due to musical differences. While the debut single still reached the top three of the German Singles Chart, the album, released in October 2004, reached number thirty-three on the German Albums Chart and spawned another two singles of which none became a commercial hit, making Erl the lowest-selling DSDS winner to date. Her following two albums Moving Out (2007) and Human (2009) failed to chart anywhere.|$|E

2500|$|... "The white man’s lodges for the Great Spirit, whose pinnacles {{reach the}} sky, and which have stood for more seasons than the red man reckon, all struck me with terrible wonder. And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>dreams.</b> [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "No Idea" [...] {{is based}} upon the film Inception (2010), {{specifically}} the scene where the character Dom Cobb has a dream relationship with his wife. Gaskarth said it was [...] "actually something I can relate to, as there is someone from my past I'm distanced with now and the only at I can revisit that time is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>dreams.</b> It made for a cool song." [...] Gaskarth called [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] the [...] "kind of front porch, snare brushes and acoustic guitar slow jam I always wanted to write." [...] He added the lyrics were [...] "very personal" [...] and said it is a [...] "good song to put on when you miss somebody and just want to relax." [...] Gaskarth calld [...] "Heroes" [...] the [...] "no-so-find farewell closer" [...] that is also the [...] "most pop-punk song" [...] on the record, in tribute to their roots. He classed it as an ironic song since it mocks the concept of [...] "people idolising bands and all the drama that goes along with that when those bands try to evolve their sound as they grow up." [...] He said it was an [...] "important final song and point to make for this album specifically as we've really taken some risks and stretched ourselves." [...] The title of [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] comes from the film National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989).|$|E
