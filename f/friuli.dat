5|$|The first town to {{fall into}} the Lombards' hands was Forum Iulii (Cividale del <b>Friuli),</b> the seat of the local magister militum. Alboin chose this walled town close to the {{frontier}} to be capital of the Duchy of <b>Friuli</b> and made his nephew and shield bearer, Gisulf, duke of the region, with the specific duty of defending the borders from Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those farae, or clans, that he preferred.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Classica Sarda, Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, the Giro del <b>Friuli,</b> Dwars door Vlaanderen, Gent–Wevelgem, and Brabantse Pijl, but {{finished}} {{no higher than}} 13th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|During his exile, Duke Henry III of Eppenstein, {{brother of}} Ulrich I, patriarch of Aquileia (r. 1086–1121), had seized {{property}} {{belonging to the}} Salzburg diocese in <b>Friuli</b> and Carinthia. Conrad excommunicated him and sent a force of 1,000 soldiers to Carinthia, forcing the duke to return the properties.|$|E
5|$|In 800, Eric's {{successor}} Cadolah of <b>Friuli</b> {{invaded the}} Dalmatian Croatia by {{the order of}} Charlemagne, but without considerable military success. Still, Tarsatica was burned down. Tarsatica's surviving inhabitants moved to a more protected hill, where they established a new settlement called Trsat. Višeslav continued to rule over the Dalmatian Croatia and warred against the Franks, avoiding defeat upon his death in 802. He was succeeded by his son Borna, who later become a Frankish ally.|$|E
5|$|The {{diverging}} {{interests of}} the League members began to show, and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don John attacked and took Tunis, only {{for it to be}} retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of her Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of <b>Friuli,</b> and eager to cut her losses and resume the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated unilateral negotiations with the Porte.|$|E
5|$|The squad was not {{competitive}} at {{the first}} three monument races in the spring season, coming just 66th in Milan–San Remo, 35th at the Tour of Flanders, and 18th at Paris–Roubaix. Kišerlovski and Clarke took seventh places at two early-season classics, respectively the Classica Sarda and the Giro del <b>Friuli,</b> the latter a race run in such difficult conditions that only 25 riders finished.|$|E
5|$|As {{the eldest}} son of Gerold of Vinzgouw and as a high ranking Frankish commander, Eric was titled from 789 to his death the Duke of <b>Friuli</b> (dux Foroiulensis). He was {{appointed}} governor of Istria, Fruli, and neighbouring areas by Charlemagne. Eric wanted to extend his dominion by conquering Dalmatian Croatia. In the autumn of 799, Eric marched from Istria along the seacoast of Liburnia towards the town of Trsat, which is today {{part of the city}} of Rijeka. Meanwhile his opponent, duke Višeslav, gathered his forces and moved north from his governing center at Nin.|$|E
5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, {{where women}} broke social {{conventions}} by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares these traditions to the benandanti of early modern <b>Friuli,</b> and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to construe the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 2012, Juventus {{announced}} that it had purchased {{the other half of}} Giovinco's transfer rights from Parma for €11 million, tying him to the Turin club until 30 June 2015. Although he had stated that he would have been pleased to wear the number 10 shirt, which was vacated after Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero left the club, Giovinco was handed the number 12 jersey under manager Antonio Conte. On 11 August 2012, Giovinco won his first title with Juventus, helping the team to defeat Napoli 4–2 in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana. Giovinco started in the first league match of the 2012–13 season against his former club, Parma; Juventus won the match 2–0, although Giovinco suffered a minor injury two minutes {{from the end of the}} game. In the following league match against Udinese on 2 September, Giovinco scored two goals and won a penalty, which was converted by Chilean teammate Arturo Vidal, as Juventus went on to defeat the <b>Friuli</b> team 4–1 in Udine.|$|E
5|$|Paul the Deacon was {{the most}} {{important}} Italian writer of the 8th century. Born in the 720s or 730s, he came from a noble Lombard family from <b>Friuli.</b> He entered the clergy early, and eventually became a monk of the monastery of Monte Cassino. His most famous work is the Historia Langobardorum, a history of the Lombard nation. Written after 787, it is a continuation of his previous major historical work, the Historia Romana, which was based on the Breviarium of Eutropius, with six books added describing historical events up to Justinian's empire. Both of these works mention Thurisind and the third Lombard–Gepid War, which represent the only overlap between the Historia Langobardorum and the Historia Romana. Both books also mention the duel between the kings' sons, an event which is absent in Procopius' writing and is thought to have originated through oral tradition. Similarly, the meeting between Thurisind and Audoin's son at the former's court derives from an oral source.|$|E
5|$|While {{fighting}} the Avars, the Franks called for Slavic-Croatian support. Croatian Prince Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia launched a joint counterattack {{with the help}} of Frankish troops under Charlemagne in 791. The offensive was successful and the Avars were driven out of Croatia. In return for the help of Charlemagne, Vojnomir was obliged to recognize Frankish sovereignty, convert to Christianity, and have his territory named Pannonian Croatia. Charlemagne again campaigned against the Avars and won a major victory in 796. Prince Vojnomir aided him, and the Franks became overlords of the Croatians of northern Dalmatia, Slavonia, and Pannonia. The Franks placed Pannonian Croats under Eric, the margrave of <b>Friuli,</b> who then tried to extend his rule over the Croatians of Dalmatia.|$|E
5|$|A krsnik or kresnik {{was a man}} {{born with}} a caul, who could leave his body in spirit {{transformed}} into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak (werewolves) and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance {{of all sorts of}} agricultural products. The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia. The benandanti were men born with a caul recorded in the region of <b>Friuli</b> in north-eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches. The táltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the táltos were initiated at a certain age into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision.|$|E
5|$|During late October and November 1943, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} anti-partisan operations around Žaga (Saga) and Kobarid (Karfreit), including Operation Traufe (Eaves). In late November, it was placed {{under the command of}} the Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy, SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (Lieutenant General) Karl Wolff for an operation. In February 1944, {{the battalion}} conducted Operation Ratte (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of Komen and Branik (Rihenberg), and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brandt suggested that Slovene nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by Yugoslav Partisans. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the Gorizia region. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of operations, including Zypresse (Cypress), Märzveilchen (Violet), Maulwurf (Mole) and Hellblau (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerrilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation Osterglocke (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation Liane in late May, and the long-running Operation Annemarie which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944. In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of Cividale del <b>Friuli.</b> Two days later, they were found naked with their severed heads impaled on bayonets. The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans. While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000.|$|E
25|$|When {{his older}} brother Unruoch III died in 874, Berengar succeeded him in the March of <b>Friuli.</b> With this he {{obtained}} a key position in the Carolingian Empire, as the march bordered the Croats and other Slavs who were a constant threat to the Italian peninsula. He was a territorial magnate with lordship over several counties in northeastern Italy. He was an important channel for the men of <b>Friuli</b> {{to get access to}} the emperor and for the emperor to exercise authority in <b>Friuli.</b> He even had a large degree of influence on the church of <b>Friuli.</b> In 884–885, Berengar intervened with the emperor on behalf of Haimo, Bishop of Belluno.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Italy, King Alboin gave {{control of}} the Eastern Alps {{to one of his}} most trusted lieutenants, Gisulf, who became the first Duke of <b>Friuli</b> in 568. The duchy, {{established}} in the Roman town of Forum Iulii (modern-day Cividale del <b>Friuli),</b> constantly fought with the Slavic population across the Gorizia border. Justified by its exceptional military needs, the Duchy of <b>Friuli</b> thus had greater autonomy compared to other duchies of Langobardia Maior until the reign of Liutprand (712–744).|$|E
25|$|The Castellieri were {{fortified}} boroughs, usually {{located on}} hills or mountains or, more rarely (such as in <b>Friuli),</b> in plains. They were constituted {{by one or}} more concentric series of walls, of rounded or elliptical shape in Istria and Venezia Giulia, or quadrangular in <b>Friuli,</b> within which was the inhabited area.|$|E
25|$|Francesco Barbaro was Luogotenente of <b>Friuli</b> from 1458 to 1459.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{the grape}} {{is known as}} Franconia Nera, with 127 {{hectares}} (310) planted mostly in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine regions of the <b>Friuli</b> Isonzo and <b>Friuli</b> Latisana Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC)s. In Spain, some experimental plantings of Blaufränkisch {{are found in the}} Spanish wine region of Málaga and Sierras de Málaga, where a German-descended winemaker is making varietal wines under the synonym Lemberger.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{vineyards}} of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{are located in}} the southern half of the region, including the large wine regions of Collio Goriziano, Colli Orientali del <b>Friuli,</b> Isonzo and Carso. The Lison-Pramaggiore region is shared with the Veneto. Smaller regions such as the Annia, Aquileia, Grave and Latisana {{are located in the}} central and western part of the region around the city of Pordenone. These smaller regions are located on alluvial plains with soils composed of gravel and sand. The wines made here are lighter and less elegant than the <b>Friuli</b> wines made in the major southern wine regions. Unlike other <b>Friuli</b> regions which require 100%, a varietal wine in the Graves and Aquileia zones only need 85% of the grape variety with the Latisana and Annia zones requiring 90%. More red wine is produced in these zones than {{in the rest of the}} <b>Friuli</b> with Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon being the leading varietals. With wine production still, frizzante and spumante styles are produced from Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, DNA {{analysis}} showed that the <b>Friuli</b> table grape Refosco di Guarnieri was identical to the Venetian wine grape Trevisana nera.|$|E
25|$|After {{the truce}} with Guy was signed, Arnulf of Germany endeavoured to invade Italy through <b>Friuli.</b> Berengar, {{in order to}} prevent a war, sent dignitaries (leading men) ahead to meet Arnulf. He himself then had a meeting, {{sometime}} between early November and Christmas, at Trent. He was allowed to keep Italy, as Arnulf's vassal, but the curtes of Navus and Sagus were taken from him. Arnulf allowed his army to return to Germany, but he himself celebrated Christmas in <b>Friuli,</b> at Karnberg.|$|E
25|$|Major Slavic colonies were in <b>Friuli,</b> Veneto, Marche, Sicily and {{throughout}} the Kingdom of Naples (including Apulia, Molise, Abruzzo, Calabria, Terra di Lavoro and Campania).|$|E
25|$|The best {{vineyards}} in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{are located}} on the south facing slopes of the Alps foothills {{in the southern part}} of the region where they can benefit from the most direct sunlight to go along with the night-time cool breezes from the Adriatic. The vineyard yields of the <b>Friuli</b> are among the lowest in Italy averaging 3.5 tons an acre. This is a result of the <b>Friuli</b> quest for high quality over quantity in their wines and also a reason why these wines tend to be more costly than other Italian whites.|$|E
25|$|Substantial fragmentary {{manuscript}} {{sources from}} Padua, Cividale del <b>Friuli,</b> {{and from the}} area around Milan point to these areas as substantial areas of manuscript production as well.|$|E
25|$|The Lombards {{engaged in}} fierce battles with Slavic peoples during these years: In 623–26 the Lombards unsuccessfully {{attacked}} Carantanians; in 663–64, the Slavs raided the Vipava Valley and the <b>Friuli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Germany and Austria-Hungary {{had only}} {{advanced}} {{the possibility of}} negotiating parts of the Trentino and Eastern <b>Friuli,</b> without Gorizia and Trieste. The offer of the French colony of Tunisia was deemed unsatisfactory.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, where Pinot noir {{is known}} as Pinot nero, it has {{traditionally}} been cultivated in South Tyrol, the Collio Goriziano, Franciacorta, Oltrepò Pavese, Veneto, <b>Friuli</b> and Trentino. It is also planted in Tuscany.|$|E
25|$|In Slovenia, {{and in the}} {{adjacent}} Italian regions of <b>Friuli</b> Venezia Giulia and nearby Italian region of Veneto, horseradish (often grated and mixed with sour cream, vinegar, hard-boiled eggs, or apples) is also a traditional Easter dish.|$|E
25|$|Early in 889, their truce having expired, Guy {{defeated}} Berengar at the Battle of the Trebbia {{and made}} himself sole king in Italy, though Berengar maintained his authority in <b>Friuli.</b> Represented by his counsellor Walfred {{at the city}} of Verona, he remained master in <b>Friuli,</b> which was always {{the base of his}} support. Though Guy had been supported by Pope Stephen V since before the death of Charles the Fat, he was now abandoned by the pope, who turned to Arnulf. Arnulf, for his part, remained a staunch partisan of Berengar and it has even been suggested that he was creating a Carolingian alliance between himself and Louis of Provence, Charles III of France, and Berengar against Guy and Rudolph I of Upper Burgundy.|$|E
25|$|In 1593-4 Marcantonio Barbaro {{was one of}} the Venetian nobles {{in charge}} of the {{building}} of the star-shaped fortress town of Palmanova in <b>Friuli.</b> Marcantonio headed the group, Marcantonio Martinego was in charge of construction, and Giulio Savorgnan acted as an adviser.|$|E
25|$|From the mid 1990s {{there has}} been a revival of amber wine {{production}} in the <b>Friuli</b> which involves leaving the white wine grapes in extended maceration with their grape skins. The resulting wines have a hint of color pigments that give them an orange hue.|$|E
25|$|On 24 January, the Macchi 205 were {{transferred}} to two bases in <b>Friuli.</b> On 28 January, the C.205s, now with Italian markings, succeeded in shooting down a B-24 Liberator, their first four-engined American bomber. This air victory was credited to Sergente Marconcini, wingman of the ace Visconti.|$|E
25|$|The Chief Carver of the {{mountain}} was Luigi del Bianco, artisan and headstone carver in Port Chester, NY. Del Bianco emigrated to the U.S. from <b>Friuli</b> in Italy, and was chosen {{to work on this}} project because of his remarkable skill at etching emotions and personality into his carved portraits.|$|E
25|$|Having {{been cleared}} {{of all the}} tax evasion charges by Italian {{officials}} in 1988, Zico decided to pay a tribute to Udine, the city that had madly welcomed him six years before, and played his farewell match for the Seleção in March 1989 losing 1–2 to a World All-Stars team at Stadio <b>Friuli.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from <b>Friuli,</b> Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from <b>Friuli,</b> Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, {{there is no reason}} to think that he celebrated mass.|$|E
25|$|Zotto's {{successor}} was Arechis I (died in 640), {{from the}} Duchy of <b>Friuli,</b> who captured Capua and Crotone, sacked the Byzantine Amalfi {{but was unable}} to capture Naples. After his reign the Eastern Roman Empire had left in southern Italy only Naples, Amalfi, Gaeta, Sorrento, the tip of Calabria and the maritime cities of Apulia.|$|E
