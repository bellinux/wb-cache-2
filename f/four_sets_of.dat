5|$|King George V had <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines {{were arranged}} in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was {{incorporated in the}} exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
5|$|Garrisoned by a captain, a knight, eight squires and ten crossbowmen, the Bastille was encircled with ditches {{fed by the}} River Seine, {{and faced}} with stone. The {{fortress}} had <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> drawbridges, which allowed the Rue Saint-Antoine to pass eastwards through the Bastille's gates while giving {{easy access to the}} city walls on the north and south sides. The Bastille overlooked the Saint-Antoine gate, which by 1380 was a strong, square building with turrets and protected by two drawbridges of its own. Charles V chose to live close to the Bastille for his own safety and created a royal complex to the south of the fortress called the Hôtel St. Paul, stretching from the Porte Saint-Paul up to the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions.

The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree.

5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> European human remains found {{could possibly be}} women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> manga anthologies {{produced}} by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ohzora under the title Clannad, was released in June 2004 under their Twin Heart Comics imprint. Volumes for this series continued to be released until April 2005 with the fifth volume. The second anthology was released in a single volume by Jive on January 25, 2005 titled Clannad Comic Anthology: Another Symphony. The third anthology series was released in two volumes by Ichijinsha on June 25, 2004 and July 24, 2004 under their DNA Media Comics; a third special volume was released much later on December 25, 2007. The first volume of the last anthology series, a collection of four-panel comic strips released by Enterbrain under the title Magi-Cu 4-koma Clannad, was released on February 25, 2008 under their MC Comics imprint; the tenth volume in the series was released on August 26, 2009.

5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin {{the naming}} of {{tropical}} cyclones started in 1960, with <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> female names initially designed to be used consecutively before being repeated. In 1965 after two lists of names had been used, {{it was decided to}} return {{to the top of the}} second list and to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basis. In 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the WMO to select new sets of names. The WMO selected six lists of names which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic. Since 1978 the same lists of names have been used, with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.|$|E

5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (<b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, <b>four</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E

40|$|We {{distinguish}} between undefined terms {{as used in}} lambda definability of partial recursive functions and meaningless terms as used in infinite lambda calculus for the infinitary terms models that generalise the Bohm model. While there are uncountable many known <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> meaningless terms, there are <b>four</b> known <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> undefined terms. Two <b>of</b> these <b>four</b> are <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> meaningless terms. In this paper we first present <b>set</b> <b>of</b> sufficient conditions for a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> lambda terms to serve as <b>set</b> <b>of</b> undefined terms in lambda definability of partial functions. The <b>four</b> known <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> undefined terms satisfy these conditions. Next we locate the smallest <b>set</b> <b>of</b> meaningless terms satisfying these conditions. This set sits very low in the lattice <b>of</b> all <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> meaningless terms. Any larger <b>set</b> <b>of</b> meaningless terms than this smallest set is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> undefined terms. Thus we find uncountably many new <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> undefined terms. As an unexpected bonus of our careful analysis of lambda definability we obtain a natural modification, strict lambda-definability, which allows for a Barendregt style of proof in which the representation of composition is truly the composition of representations...|$|R
