40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes in Hungary referring to the 2006 system and a hypothetical flat tax reform. For this, a microsimulation model is used, which is based on a matched sample of an income and a consumption survey and administrative tax records. The Hungarian budget receives more revenues from VAT than from PIT. This has major implications on equity, as while PIT is progressive, VAT is regressive, imposing a higher tax burden on low-income households. We highlight the importance of tax allowances. The absolute amount of total tax allowances tends to increase with income, and the share of allowances within total incomes is around 5 - 7 % in all income groups, except the top fifth, where it declines. Targeting is thus inadequate, and it is especially so in case of child support. <b>Family</b> <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> reaches the bottom decile only to a limited extent. This is in sharp contrast with the universal child benefit, which is well targeted to the poorest. The second part explores the likely impact of the introduction of a flat tax, where VAT and PIT rates are set at 20 %, and a tax free bracket for low incomes is kept. We show that a budget neutral solution would have a largely regressive effect, where 70 % of the population would lose, with a minority {{on the top of the}} distribution gaining. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{analytical}} framework devoted to compare <b>family</b> size related <b>tax</b> credits and <b>allowances.</b> As a main result, we obtain that, {{in a social}} welfare context à la Atkinson and Bourguignon (1987), if <b>tax</b> credits and <b>allowances</b> are compared in an individual context, it could be assured that a progressive income <b>tax</b> with <b>family</b> size related <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> is never welfare superior to an equal-yield income tax involving tax credits. Theoretical results are checked on empirical grounds for the Spanish personal income tax (IRPF) in force in 1999. We develop a micro-simulation exercise, using the Panel of IRPF Returns, which belongs to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Two results {{can be derived from}} this exercise. Firstly, that, both adopting an individual or household approach, <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits are welfare superior to an equal-yield proportional tax. And secondly, that, although a tax credit system reduces global income inequality more than what allowances does, also from an individual or household approach, {{it is not possible to}} determine superiority in welfare terms of a system over the other.

40|$|In {{this paper}} reforms of both present Italian {{personal}} income taxation and family allowances are evaluated {{with the aim}} to make the tax benefit system able to better support family burden. Two kind of reforms are considered: family quotient, based on the change of the tax unit from persons to families, and a new generalized family allowance, based on equivalent income and absorbing current <b>family</b> <b>tax</b> credits and <b>allowances.</b> After an evaluation of some limits of family quotient (higher effective marginal tax rate for spouse with lower income and a reduced support for low income families) and the current mix of <b>tax</b> credits and <b>allowances</b> (<b>families</b> with higher equivalent income can receive higher support for family burden), the comparison among two specific reforms is performed using a microsimulation model built on Bank of Italy survey about the Italian household and personal incomes. Results shows {{that it is possible}} to shape quotient family based reforms with redistributive effects, but also that the new generalized family allowance here presented is able to better support bottom quintiles of population, with or without dependent children. Each of the two reforms would cost about 9 billion of euro, an acceptable share of both the Italian GNP and the public budget.

30|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of direct}} taxation into schedules, {{tax credits and}} a part attributable to <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> showed that redistribution is effected mainly via the schedules. The redistributive effect of tax schedules {{is largely due to}} their size {{and to a lesser extent}} to their progressivity. Neither <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> nor <b>tax</b> credits influence inequality levels to any great extent. However, it should be kept in mind that the effect of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits is critically linked to the design of tax schedules. In particular, <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits cannot, by design, have a significant impact in the context of low taxation levels. <b>Tax</b> <b>allowances</b> are progressive in a context of flat rate taxation but regressive in a progressive regime. Both <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits affect inequality much less than means-tested and even non-contributory benefits. This reinforces the idea that the inequality-reducing capacity of fiscal benefits is limited.|$|R

Yet, the redistributive effect of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits works in complex and often unanticipated ways.

30|$|By far {{the largest}} {{component}} of the tax-benefit system, taxes are also the most significant driver of overall system size variation. When including employee and employer social insurance contributions, taxation ranges between 32 % of disposable income in Bulgaria to 106 % in Sweden. Obviously, the high taxation levels shown in Figure 1 are also due to the separation of <b>tax</b> schedules, <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits. Part of the income tax liabilities shown in the blue bars above are returned via <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits 10. In fact, {{there is a very}} close relationship between taxation levels and the use of <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> and <b>tax</b> credit instruments 11. Broadly speaking, countries may be loosely categorised as having either simple and low tax rates systems (Cyprus, Bulgaria) or more complicated higher taxation ones (Denmark, Austria). Essentially, higher initial gross tax liabilities are reduced via <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits, thus resulting in much lower average tax rates than what the tax schedule alone would suggest. Theoretically, the use of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits should provide extra flexibility to adjust the burden on particular groups.|$|R

30|$|Since direct {{income taxes}} {{are often the}} result of complex {{taxation}} systems, we disaggregate them into three components not {{all of which are}} necessarily present in all countries: <b>tax</b> schedules, <b>tax</b> <b>allowances,</b> and <b>tax</b> credits. <b>Tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits are so-called fiscal benefits and they may be an important channel through which the tax benefit system directs resources towards households. A <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> is any type of deduction from initial taxable income that would lower the effective tax base. This includes social insurance contributions whenever they are deductible from the tax base, as well as any tax bands where the tax rate is zero. A tax credit is any type of non-refundable deduction from the initial tax liability (gross tax). To effect the decomposition we take following approach. First, using EUROMOD, we estimate the gross tax (i.e. before any tax credits) payable in the baseline scenario. We then re-calculate gross tax when all <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> in the system (including social insurance contributions when deductible, 0 rate bands etc.) are removed, i.e. set to zero. The difference between the gross taxes calculated in the two scenarios provides a measure of the ‘value’ of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> for each household, i.e. the amount of income each household gains via lower taxes due to the existence of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances.</b> We measure the size of tax schedules as the gross tax that would be payable in the absence of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances.</b> The size of this variable is driven by the tax schedule but also by other elements of the income tax system such as the extent to which various types of incomes are subject to taxation, joint vs. individual taxation, progressivity adjustments etc. In the remainder of the paper we will refer to the tax schedule/taxable base component of the income tax system as “taxes”. Finally, tax credits are the difference between gross and net taxes. Refundable tax credits are treated as benefits and thus included in the benefit concepts, not in tax credits, as explained above.|$|R
