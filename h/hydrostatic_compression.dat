In contrast, the orthorhombic phase has been reported to occur only above � 60 GPa in an earlier experiments under hydrostatic pressure. However, the transition pressures derived from the square of the symmetry-breaking strain versus pressure data in the two cases differ only marginally, the values being 44 (8) GPa and 49 (2) GPa under nonhydrostatic and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>compressions,</b> respectively. We combine the d-spacings measured under nonhydrostatic and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>compressions</b> to derive a parameter Q(hkl) that contains the information on differential stress t (a measure of compressive strength) and single-crystal elasticity. The compressive strengths derived from the average value of Q(hkl) and line-width analysis agree well. It increases from � 4 GPa at 20 GPa to � 8 GPa at 40 GPa and decreases as the transition pressure is approached. In the orthorhombic phase, t increases with pressure monotonically. The mean crystallite size of the sample decreases from � 5000 Å to � 1000 Å as the pressure is increased from 20 GPa to 45 GPa and remains nearly unchanged between 45 GPa and 70 GPa.

One of the prerequisites for forming these textures is low wallrock permeability, but its mechanisms have not been well understood. In this contribution, we investigated the mechanisms leading to low wallrock permeability at the Dajishan tungsten deposit by conducting finite element computer experiments. The numerical experiments suggest that the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>compression</b> exerted by high-pressure fluids on the wallrock decreases the wallrock permeability significantly in a short geological time. The deeper part of the deposit is more likely to create low wallrock permeability and form infill textures than the shallower part. The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>compression</b> also prohibits the fluid flow from the fracture zone to the country rock and limits water-rock interactions. Therefore, the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>compression</b> facilitates both the fluid focusing and the high ore-formation efficiency in fracture zones.

By contrasting our model to experiments we quantify the deviations from mean-field behavior and find that the tilt fluctuations of the MF 6 octahedra increase with metal cation size.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validated model of plastic strain accumulation in railway rail steel under repeated wheel-rail contact. Such contacts subject the rails to severe stresses, taking the material local to the contact beyond yield, and {{leading to the}} incremental accumulation of plastic deformation (ratheting) as wheels pass.

Existing plasticity models are inadequate for modelling the strain accumulation taking place in this material, which is under high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>compression</b> (of the order of 1 GPa) and is severely anisotropic.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} avoid the {{numerical}} difficulties in locally enforcing the incompressibility constraint using the displacement formulation of the Finite Element Method, slight compressibility is typically assumed when simulating transversely isotropic, soft tissue. The current standard method of accounting for slight compressibility of hyperelastic soft tissue assumes an additive decomposition of the strain-energy function into a volumetric and a deviatoric part. This has been shown, however, to be inconsistent with the linear theory for anisotropic materials. It is further shown here that, under <b>hydrostatic</b> tension or <b>compression,</b> a transversely isotropic cube modelled using this additive split is simply deformed into another cube regardless {{of the size of the}} deformation, in contravention of the physics of the problem. A remedy for these defects is proposed here: the trace of the Cauchy stress is assumed linear in both volume change and fibre stretch. The general form of the strain-energy function consistent with this model is obtained and is shown to be a generalisation of the current standard model. A specific example is used to clearly demonstrate the differences in behaviour between the two models in <b>hydrostatic</b> tension and <b>compression...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{composition}} on the elastic responses of alumina particle-filled epoxy composites is examined using isotropic elastic response models relating the average stresses and strains in a discretely reinforced composite material consisting of perfectly bonded and uniformly distributed particles in a solid isotropic elastic matrix. Responses for small elastic deformations and large <b>hydrostatic</b> and plane-strain <b>compressions</b> are considered. The response model for small elastic deformations depends on known elastic {{properties of the}} matrix and particles, the volume fraction of the particles, and two additional material properties that reflect the composition and microstructure of the composite material.
