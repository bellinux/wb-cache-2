In this paper, we propose an approach to generate constraint solvers given {{the definition of the}} constraints that combines the advantages of generation by construction with generation by testing. In our proposed approach, semantically valid rules are constructed sym-bolically, then the constructed rules are used to prune the search tree of a <b>generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>method.</b> The combined approach leads in general to more expressive and efficient constraint solvers. The generated rules are implemented in the language Constraint Handling Rules. ...|$|E

However, writing, maintaining and identifying good formulas for tabular data and spreadsheets can be time consuming and error-prone. We investigate the automatic learning of constraints (formulas and relations) in raw tabular data in an unsupervised way. We represent common spreadsheet formulas and relations through predicates and expressions whose arguments must satisfy the inherent {{properties of the}} constraint. The challenge is to automatically infer the set of constraints that {{is present in the}} data, without labeled examples or user feedback. We propose a two-stage <b>generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> where the first stage uses constraint solving techniques to efficiently reduce the number of candidates, based on the predicate signatures. Our approach takes inspiration from inductive logic programming, constraint learning and constraint satisfaction. We show that we are able to accurately discover constraints in spreadsheets from various sourcesstatus: accepte...|$|E
40|$|WASP is {{a forward}} {{reasoning}} rule-based system that takes as input data {{a set of}} words {{and a set of}} verse patterns and returns a set of verses. Using a <b>generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>method,</b> guided by a set of construction heuristics obtained from formal literature on Spanish poetry, the system can operate in two modes: either generating an unrestricted set of verses, or generating a poem according to one of three predefined structures (romance, cuarteto,orterceto). Five different construction heuristics are tested over different combinations of two sets of initial data, one obtained from a classic poem and one obtained from a paragraph of a doctoral thesis in linguistics. A set of numerical parameters are extracted from each test, and evaluated in search of significant correlations. The aim is to ascertain the relative importance of size of initial vocabulary, choice of words, choice of verse patterns and construction heuristics with respect to the general acceptability of the resulting verse...|$|E

40|$|Parallel-connected {{photovoltaic}} inverters {{are required}} in large solar plants {{where it is}} not economically or technically reasonable to use a single inverter. Currently, parallel inverters require individual isolating transformers to cut the path for the circulating current. In this doctoral dissertation, the problem is approached by attempting to minimize the generated circulating current. The circulating current {{is a function of}} the generated common-mode voltages of the parallel inverters and can be minimized by synchronizing the inverters. The synchronization has previously been achieved by a communication link. However, in photovoltaic systems the inverters may be located far apart from each other. Thus, a control free of communication is desired. It is shown in this doctoral dissertation that the circulating current can also be obtained by a common-mode voltage measurement. A control method based on a short-time switching frequency transition is developed <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> with an actual photovoltaic environment of two parallel inverters connected to two 5 kW solar arrays. Controls based on the measurement of the circulating current and the common-mode voltage are <b>generated</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested.</b> A communication-free <b>method</b> of controlling the circulating current between parallelconnected inverters is developed and verified...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is {{designing}} a method for automatic gamelan music composition using rule-base expert system approach. The program is designed for non-expert user in order to help them composing gamelan music or analyzing their composition to achieve explanation and recommendation of ideal composition. There are 2 essential components in this method, which are knowledge and inference. Knowledge is represented into basic knowledge and melodic knowledge. Basic knowledge contains rules that control the structure of gamelan song, and melodic knowledge supports system in composing or analyzing notations sequence that fit the characteristics of melody in gamelan music. Basic knowledge represents basic rules of gamelan music that have quantitative value, so deterministic approach is used for basic knowledge acquisition. Melodic knowledge consists of dynamic data, so stochastic approach is used to create the melodic knowledge base. The rules of composing and analyzing a composition are defined based on basic knowledge and melodic knowledge. The inference engine is designed to compose and analyze a composition. Automatic composition for gamelan music is proposed using <b>Generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>Test</b> <b>method</b> (GAT) with random technique, and composition analysis is proposed using backward chaining metho...|$|E
40|$|Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, {{has stated}} {{that one of the}} nuclear waste legacy issues is ``The {{challenge}} of managing the fuel cycle's back end and assuring the safe use of nuclear power. '' Waste management (i. e., the back end) is a domestic and international issue that must be addressed. A key tool in gaining acceptance of nuclear waste repository technologies is transparency. Transparency provides information to outside parties for independent assessment of safety, security, and legitimate use of materials. Transparency is a combination of technologies and processes that apply to all elements of the development, operation, and closure of a repository system. A test bed for nuclear repository transparency technologies has been proposed to develop a broad-based set of concepts and strategies for transparency monitoring of nuclear materials at the back end of the fuel/weapons cycle. WIPP is the world's first complete geologic repository system for nuclear materials at the back end of the cycle. While it is understood that WIPP does not currently require this type of transparency, this repository has been proposed as realistic demonstration site to <b>generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> ideas, <b>methods,</b> <b>and</b> technologies about what transparency may entail at the back end of the nuclear materials cycle, and which could be applicable to other international repository developments. An integrated set of transparency demonstrations was developed and deployed during the summer, and fall of 1999 as a proof-of-concept of the repository transparency technology concept. These demonstrations also provided valuable experience and insight into the implementation of future transparency technology development and application. These demonstrations included: Container Monitoring Rocky Flats to WIPP; Underground Container Monitoring; Real-Time Radiation and Environmental Monitoring; Integrated level of confidence in the system and information provided. As the world's only operating deep geologic repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) offers a unique opportunity to serve as an international cooperative test bed for developing and demonstrating technologies and processes in a fully operational repository system setting. To address the substantial national security implications for the US resulting from the lack of integrated, transparent management and disposition of nuclear materials at the back-end of the nuclear fuel and weapons cycles, it is proposed that WIPP be used as a test bed to develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable the transparent and proliferation-resistant geologic isolation of nuclear materials. The objectives of this initiative are to: (1) enhance public confidence in safe, secure geologic isolation of nuclear materials; (2) develop, <b>test,</b> <b>and</b> demonstrate transparency measures and technologies for the back-end of nuclear fuel cycle; and (3) foster international collaborations leading to workable, effective, globally-accepted standards for the transparent monitoring of geological repositories for nuclear materials. Test-bed activities include: development <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> of monitoring measures and technologies; international demonstration experiments; transparency workshops; visiting scientist exchanges; and educational outreach. These activities are proposed to be managed by the Department of Energy/Carlsbad Area Office (DOE/CAO) as part of The Center for Applied Repository and Underground Studies (CARUS) ...|$|R

40|$|Fixturing, i. e. {{the process}} of immobilizing a {{workpiece}} for manufacturing or assembly operations, is a fundamental task in manufacturing. Fixtures can either be fabricated from scratch or assembled from a toolkit of modular components; the latter approach is termed modular fixturing. Recently, many researchers have proposed <b>generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> fixture design algorithms for minimal modular fixture toolkits where minimal fixture toolkits incorporate a single degree of freedom and constrain fixture elements to {{a finite number of}} locations. <b>Generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies have succeeded because minimal fixture toolkits can only fixture generic workpieces in a finite number of ways. In this paper, we present alternative minimal toolkits and two generic fixture design algorithms: a complete enumeration algorithm based upon the <b>generate</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> paradigm, <b>and</b> an efficacious heuristic hill climbing algorithm.
