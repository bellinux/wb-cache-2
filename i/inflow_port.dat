30|$|Manual {{pressure}} systems {{maintain the}} necessary intrauterine pressure {{by using a}} pressure bag or blood pressure cuff around the fluid bag. The disadvantage of all these systems is that they keep the flow and the pressure at the <b>inflow</b> <b>port</b> constant and therefore if the pressure exceeds the mean arterial pressure {{it can lead to}} excessive fluid absorption. Irrigation of fluid is achieved by opening partially or fully the outflow tap and applying varying amounts of negative pressure (suction).|$|E
30|$|Intrauterine {{distension}} {{pressure can}} be maintained using simple gravity, manual and automated pressure delivery systems. Simple gravity systems deliver the distension fluid by hydrostatic pressure. The achieved pressure in the <b>inflow</b> <b>port</b> of the hysteroscope {{is the product of}} the width of the inflow tube and the level difference between the highest portion of the fluid column and level of the uterus. Elevation of the bag will increase the intrauterine pressure and one foot of height will approximate to around 25  mm of Hg [59]. When the fluid is maintained at a level of 1 to 1.5  m above the patient’s uterus, the intrauterine pressure will be between 70 to 100  mmHg [21].|$|E
30|$|VV-ECMO {{can be used}} as a {{salvage therapy}} for {{patients}} with severe or refractory hypoxia [11]. Multiple cannula configurations can be used to take blood from and return it to the venous system. The Avalon Elite Bicaval Dual Lumen Cannula® allows this to be accomplished using a single site. The <b>inflow</b> <b>port</b> of this particular catheter draws blood from both the superior and inferior vena cava. This blood flows into the oxygenator and is then returned through a reinfusion port, which is directed toward the tricuspid valve. Fluoroscopy or transesophageal echocardiography is utilized for proper placement of the catheter to ensure that the distal drainage port is located within the IVC, while the proximal drainage port lies in the superior vena cava [11 – 13].|$|E

This study provides important theoretical implications to the literature on global supply chain management in port hinterlands.

This study shows how the government supporting policy can be effective to FDI <b>inflow</b> in Pohang-Yeongil <b>port</b> hinterland {{with regard to the}} institutional theory. The resource-based view is used to justify FTZ, industry cluster, and ICT infrastructures as major determinants to attract MNEs' FDI.

30|$|The CO 2 {{dialysis}} was terminated, and the dialysis circuit was disconnected after clamping the <b>inflow</b> and outflow <b>ports.</b> The animals {{continued to}} be on mechanical ventilation, while the disposable parts of the circuits were separated, flushed with saline, and visually inspected for clot formation. Parts of the diffusion membrane were collected for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and following post-intervention phase, the animals were euthanized under general anaesthesia using a single dose of pentobarbital (150  mg/kg).|$|R
30|$|The {{anticipated}} catheter for {{use with}} the LF-PAL is the Hemolung 15.5 Fr dual lumen catheter. The catheter was inserted into a 1600 -mL reservoir bag, and pressure was measured at the <b>inflow</b> and outflow <b>ports</b> of the catheter using a differential fluid pressure transducer. Pressure within the reservoir {{was assumed to be}} spatially uniform so that the resistance of the catheter may be calculated as the pressure difference between the inflow and outflow tubing connection ports of the catheter. Flow was driven by a Biomedicus BP- 80 pump (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and ranged between 100 and 900  mL/min.|$|R
30|$|The sweep gas flows (100  % O 2) {{through the}} {{diffusion}} membrane were titrated to 5  L of oxygen, {{and the blood}} flow was maintained at 200  mL/min. In group 2, Ringer’s lactate infusion was tapered accordingly, since there was continuous infusion of 4  % trisodium citrate at the <b>inflow</b> <b>port</b> of the catheter, which chelated the ionized calcium of inflowing blood. A continuous infusion of calcium gluconate 10  % at the outflow port of the catheter maintained the systemic ionized calcium. Monitoring of anticoagulation in this group was performed by hourly measurement of the ionized-calcium levels at the post-oxygenator and in the animal. The infusions of 4  % trisodium citrate and calcium gluconate were titrated accordingly to maintain the ionized-calcium level between 0.25 and 0.35  mmol/L [15] in the dialysis circuit and a systemic ionized-calcium level of 1.12 – 1.20  mmol/L.|$|E
30|$|A {{variety of}} {{automated}} fluid pumps exist. Some will keep a constant pre-set pressure at the <b>inflow</b> <b>port</b> {{but they will}} continue delivering fluid despite the resistance in the uterine cavity. Other systems will titrate the intrauterine fluid pressure constantly at 70 – 80  mmHg and will reduce the fluid flow (inflow and outflow) accordingly. A device which maintains constant intrauterine pressure is more sensitive and limits excessive intrauterine pressures and subsequent intravasation of the distending medium [15]. These systems can be costly {{to set up and}} run. They are not necessary for short operative or diagnostic procedures but maybe beneficial for prolonged, operative cases such as resection of the endometrium or submucosal fibroids where endometrial and myometrial disruption occur causing bleeding and the formation of intrauterine tissue debris that can compromise visualisation of the operative field.|$|E
3000|$|The {{adequacy}} of the delivered RRT dose decreases proportionally {{with the increase in}} blood recirculation. Blood recirculation occurs when dialyzed blood returning through the venous DC lumen reenters the extracorporeal circuit through the arterial lumen, rather than returning to the systemic circulation. Several mechanisms contribute to blood recirculation, such as Foucault current due to turbulent flow and catheter tip clotting, obstruction flow in the vein, reversal of flow in the central venous system during the atrial systole (normal pulsatile flow, tricuspid regurgitation), sheathing of the catheter with fibrin, which can create a pathway from the outflow to the <b>inflow</b> <b>port,</b> positive pressure ventilation, and reversal of the outflow and inflow lines. Blood recirculation is minimized when the venous outlet is positioned in a large central vein with a high blood flow rate and therefore depends on the length of DCs. Because blood recirculation depends mainly on the ratio of the flow in the catheter and in the vessel in which it is located, its impact on the delivered RRT dose is lesser in continuous RRT, which uses lower Q [...]...|$|E
40|$|Background: Continuous {{hemofiltration}} {{is used in}} pediatric {{patients with}} acute renal fail-ure. Many of these patients are treated with catecholamines for hemodynamic instability. The authors studied the pharmacokinetics of dopamine and dobutamine on patients under-going continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Methods and Results: Three critically ill pediatric patients with acute renal failure and car-diovascular instability treated with hemofiltration and intravenous infusion of dopamine and/or dobutamine were entered into the study. Blood samples were drawn at steady-state levels from the arterial <b>port</b> (<b>inflow)</b> of the hemofilter, from the venous port (outflow) of the hemofilter, and from the ultrafilter. Sixteen (n = 16) pharmacokinetic measurements were made, six (n = 6) for dopamine and 10 (n = 10) for dobutamine. The clearance of dopamine by the hemofilter was 0. 078 &plusmn; 0. 011 mL/kg/min, and for dobutamine it was 0. 036 &plusmn; 0. 008 mL/kg/min. On the average, 0. 56 % of the dopamine dose and 0. 13 % of the dobutamine dose was removed by the hemofilter. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetics of dopamine and dobutamine at the dosage range of 5 - 25 &mu;g/kg/min are not altered by continuous hemoliltration. Relative to total plasma clear...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 15). Edema, increased tissue fluid volume, may be caused by impaired lymphatic system return. This edema formation inhibits organ function. We hypothesized that increased lymphatic fluid protein concentration would cause increased resistance to flow through lymphatic vessels. Mesenteric lymphatic vessels in anesthetized sheep were catheterized at both ends and connected to polyethylene tubing that functioned as <b>inflow</b> and outflow <b>ports.</b> Outflow pressure and, thus, the end-to-end pressure gradient were manipulated by altering the height of the outflow port. Two fluids - lactated Ringers solution and 6 % albumin in lactated Ringers solution - were introduced alternately into the vessels. Flow through the vessel was determined for several pressure gradients. We calculated the resistance for each solution using the inverse of the slope of the flow-pressure gradient relationship. The calculated resistance for the Lactated-Ringers solution was 1. 796 ? 0. 213 mmHgm?in/ml while the resistance for the 6 % albumin solution was 1. 911 ? 0. 154 mmHgm?in/ml. The resistance calculated for the 6 % albumin solution was greater in all experiments, however the difference in resistance between the two solutions was not statistically significant (P =. 201). We conclude that the number of experiments included in this study was insufficient to resolve {{the nature of the relationship}} between protein concentration and resistance in lymphatic vessels...|$|R
40|$|Diffusive and {{convective}} {{transfer of}} cytokine-inducing bacterial products across hemodialysis membranes. The {{widespread use of}} bicarbonate dialysate, and high-flux and high-efficiency dialyzers have raised concerns regarding the transmembrane passage of bacterial products from the dialysate into the blood compartment. To study the mechanisms as well as magnitude of the transmembrane transfer of bacterial products from the dialysate, we developed a computerized in vitro dialysis model which provides continuous pressure recording from the arterial, venous, dialysate <b>inflow</b> and outflow <b>ports.</b> By virtue of a computer controlled on-line infusion pump, this model permits control of ultrafiltration/backfiltration. Heparinized (10 U/ml) whole blood (150 ml) was circulated through the blood compartment for 120 minutes at 100 ml/min. Bicarbonate dialysate contaminated with Pseudomonas maltophilia filtrate was circulated through the dialysate compartment at 100 ml/min. A two-point pressure of + 10 mm of Hg (ultrafiltration) was maintained for the first 60 minutes and - 10 mm of Hg (backfiltration) for the next 60 minutes. Whole blood samples (10 ml) were drawn from the blood at 0, 60 and 120 minutes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) harvested from these samples were incubated for 24 hours in tissue culture medium. In addition, 0. 5 ml samples of dialysate were collected at 0, 60 and 120 minutes and incubated with PBMC from the same donor for 24 hours. After 24 hour incubation, total cell-associated IL- 1 Ra and IL- 1 β were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Paired experiments were performed with eight high-flux synthetic membranes (polyamide) and eight low-flux cellulose membranes (hemophan). Cytokine production is expressed as pg/ 2. 5 million PBMC. During the mandatory ultrafiltration phase of the experiment (first hour), the production of IL- 1 Ra by PBMC from the blood compartment rose from 515 ± 118 to 785 ± 209 with polyamide membranes, and from 1175 ± 365 to 3865 ± 1847 with hemophan membranes, suggesting diffusive transport of bacterial products across the membrane. In contrast, {{at the end of}} the backfiltration phase (second hour), there was no further rise in the production of IL- 1 Ra by PBMC from the blood compartment (702 ± 123 with polyamide, and 2284 ± 886 with hemophan). The production of IL- 1 Ra by PBMC harvested from the blood compartment of polyamide membranes at 0, 60 and 120 minutes was lower than that with hemophan membranes (P = 0. 01). In contrast to IL- 1 Ra, the production of IL- 1 β by PBMC harvested from the blood compartment with both membranes was uniformly low. The results of this study demonstrate the diffusive transfer of bacterial products across dialysis membranes. Therefore, any condition that increases diffusive transport such as dialyzers with large surface areas and high blood and dialysate flow rates could potentially increase the reverse transfer of bacterial products from the dialysate. This risk is not greater for synthetic high-flux membranes such as polyamide. Further, IL- 1 β is a less sensitive indicator than IL- 1 Ra of the transmembrane passage of cytokine-inducing substances from the dialysate to blood compartment...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution and}} activity of chloroethene-degrading microorganisms and associated functional genes during reductive dehalogenation of tetrachloroethene to ethene in a laboratory continuous-flow column. Using real-time PCR, we quantified “Dehalococcoides” species 16 S rRNA and chloroethene-reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes (pceA, tceA, vcrA, and bvcA) in nucleic acid extracts from different sections of the column. Dehalococcoides 16 S rRNA gene copies were highest at the <b>inflow</b> <b>port</b> [(3. 6 ± 0. 6) × 106 (mean ± standard deviation) per gram soil] where the electron donor and acceptor were introduced into the column. The highest transcript numbers for tceA, vcrA, and bvcA were detected 5 to 10 cm from the column inflow. bvcA was the most highly expressed of all RDase genes and the only vinyl chloride reductase-encoding transcript detectable close to the column outflow. Interestingly, no expression of pceA was detected in the column, {{despite the presence of}} the genes in the microbial community throughout the column. By comparing the 16 S rRNA gene copy numbers to the sum of all four RDase genes, we found that 50 % of the Dehalococcoides population {{in the first part of}} the column did not contain either one of the known chloroethene RDase genes. Analysis of 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries from both ends of the flow column revealed a microbial community dominated by members of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Higher clone sequence diversity was observed near the column outflow. The results presented have implications for our understanding of the ecophysiology of reductively dehalogenating Dehalococcoides spp. and their role in bioremediation of chloroethenes...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} study of {{liquefied}} natural gas impacts on device performance and pollutant emissions for existing equipment in California, this report describes a cmoputer modeling study of a partially premixed flame issueing from a single cooktop burner port. The model consisted of a reactive computational fluid dynamics three-dimensional spatial grid and a 71 -species chemical mechanism with propane combustion capability. Simulations were conducted with a simplified fuel mixture containing methane, ethane, and propane in proportions that yield properties similar to fuels distributed throughout much of California now and in recent years (baseline fuel), as well as with two variations of simulated liquefied natural gas blends. A variety of simulations were conducted with baseline fuel to explore the effect of several key parameters on pollutant formation and other flame characteristics. Simulations started with fuel and air issuing through the burner port, igniting, and continuing until the flame was steady with time. Conditions at this point were analyzed to understand fuel, secondary air and reaction product flows, regions of pollutant formation, and exhaust concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and formaldehyde. A sensitivity study was conducted, varying the inflow parameters of this baseline gs about real-world operating conditions. Flame properties responded as expected from reactive flow theory. In the simulation, carbon monoxide levels were influenced more by the mixture's inflow velocity than by the gas-to-air ratio in the mixture issuing from the <b>inflow</b> <b>port.</b> Additional simulations were executed at two inflow conditions - high heat release and medium heat release - to examine the impact of replacing the baseline gas with two mixtures representative of liquefied natural gas. Flame properties and pollutant generation rates were very similar among the three fuel mixtures...|$|E
40|$|The Spiral Vortex (SV) {{ventricular}} assist device (VAD) {{was investigated}} by 2 -component laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) while pumping a refractive index-matched blood analogue fluid. The VAD was operated under physiological conditions corresponding to 75 % assist (4 litres/minute) or weaning from assist (2 litres/minute). Data were sampled on a 5 -mm grid {{throughout most of}} the interior of the blood chamber, using two orthogonal LDA configurations from which 3 D velocity data were synthesised. Data were subjected to statistical analysis of quasistatic time intervals and approximation by Fourier series. The velocity vector fields were explored statically (via 2 D plots) and dynamically (using 3 D animations of the reduced data). Reynolds stresses were computed and visualised in 2 D. Fluid pathlines were simulated and plotted in 3 D. The flow was found to be dominated by an irrotational vortex that accelerated and precessed in phase with the pumping diaphragm. Two unexpected flow structures, a rising, swirling near-wall layer in diastole and a reflection of the outflow vortex upon valve closure, enhanced washing of the walls. The thickness of the boundary layer was estimated to be 2 mm. Fluid velocities were generally lower than those reported in steady-flow studies on the SV VAD, although turbulence was comparable. Under the weaning mode, the coherence of the main vortex was degraded and flow recirculation was observed distal to the inflow port; this operating mode must be regarded as an indication for anticoagulation. In both pumping modes, turbulence was elevated in association with asymmetric buckling of the pneumatically driven diaphragm. Suboptimal orientation of the tilting-disc inlet valve gave rise to augmented turbulence production and skewing of the main vortex; similar results were obtained for an axisymmetric polymer (Jellyfish) valve, despite its advantageous haemodynamics. Flow stagnation was apparent where the inflow stream impinged on the wall, opposite the <b>inflow</b> <b>port.</b> The overall design of the SV VAD appears to almost ideal, in the context of current technology. However, elimination of recirculation/stagnation zones, especially in the weaning mode, remains a priority for the ultimate optimisation of haemocompatibility. Pulsatile VADs will probably never be entirely free of flow recirculation or stagnation, and published claims to the contrary probably reflect study limitations...|$|E
