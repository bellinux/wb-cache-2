50|$|On October 10, 2006, the Bombay High Court's Aurangabad bench {{served a}} notice on Google for {{allowing}} a hate campaign against India. This {{referred to a}} community on Orkut called 'We Hate India', which initially carried {{a picture of an}} Indian flag being burned and some anti-India content. The High Court order was issued in response to a public-interest petition filed by an Aurangabad advocate. Google had six weeks to respond. Even before the petition was filed, many Orkut users had noticed this community and were mailing or otherwise messaging their contacts on Orkut to report the community as bogus to Google, which could result in its removal. The community has now been deleted but has spawned several 'We hate those who hate India' communities. Prior to the 60th Independence Day of India, Orkut's main page was revamped. The section which usually displayed a collage of photos of various people, showed a stylized Orkut logo. The word Orkut was written in Devanagari script and was coloured in Indian national colours. Clicking on the logo redirects to a post by the Orkut India ProductManager, Manu Rekhi, on the Orkut <b>internal</b> <b>blog.</b> There has also been some media outcry against Orkut after a couple of youngsters were apparently lured by fake profiles on the site and later murdered.|$|E
40|$|Objective: An interprofessional {{steering}} committee was created at Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Medicine {{to examine how}} social media are integrated in medical and health professional education in universities across the globe, and to propose a strategic plan for integrating social media in the Faculty’s various curricula. This presentation will summarize the {{steering committee}}’s work and describe the librarian’s contribution. Methods: The Committee’s project leader first conducted a literature search on best practices of social media in medical and health professional curricula. A reference website was then created (mse. med. umontreal. ca) to provide easy access to {{a large number of}} the articles and resources reviewed. A steering committee was constituted and 11 meetings were held over a 9 -month period. The Committee comprised 18 members and included assistant deans, academic program directors, professors, communication advisors, undergraduate and graduate students and a librarian. An online survey on social media use by students and professors of the Faculty was conducted, ten pilot projects were put forward and a three-year strategic plan was proposed. Results: A total of 1508 students and 565 professors participated in the survey. Results showed that both groups had a strong interest in learning how social media could be integrated in academic and professional activities. Participants reported concern with risks associated with social media use and expressed the need for a Faculty policy and guidelines. The librarian’s contribution to the steering committee included: writing posts on the website’s <b>internal</b> <b>blog,</b> assisting {{in the design of the}} survey questionnaires and writing the final report’s survey results chapter. She also proposed two pilot projects: creating a social media learning portal and an altmetrics workshop. Conclusions: Based on the literature review and the survey results, the Committee affirmed the importance of integrating social media in the various study programs of the Faculty of Medicine. Despite the restricted timeline, this interprofessional steering committee was able to carry out its mandate because of the leadership and expertise of each of its members. As the librarian had the most experience with the use of social media in a professional context, her knowledge was instrumental in assisting the project leader in a group mainly composed of social media non-users...|$|E

40|$|The {{authors of}} this thesis have interviewed three {{companies}} that all together submitted more than 15 000 suggestions for improvement in 2010. The aim of the thesis was to find examples of how companies work with continuous improvements in practice. The thesis began with a literature study on continuous improvement as a base. The literature study focuses on the implementation of continuous improvement, success factors and why implementation fails. After this, we interviewed a quality manager and operators in three companies, except in one company were we couldn’t interview an operator. After this, the result were analyzed and compared to the literature study to find practical example that correspond with literatures success factors. Based on Sörqvist (2004) key factors in Continuous Improvement we categorized the success factors from all firms. The key factors are management commitment, anchoring, structure and feedback from results and progression. From each category an example from a company that had a clear and simple approach within each categorization were chosen and described more detailed. In management commitment, all companies worked very similar, this is why all three companies exemplify this category. All the improvements that employees feel they can implement without help is {{up to them to}} implement. In this way they become involved and feel that they own the working method. In anchoring Continuous Improvement Coca-Cola showed an easy way to working with this. A new initiative is a new <b>internal</b> <b>blog.</b> The blog is all about continuous improvement where the employees on a daily basis can read of continuous improvement in a more relaxed form. Within the structure we use Cloetta {{as an example of a}} practical working method. Cloetta uses an improvement board for suggestions. The employees use a card and write down the suggestion. The proposals are then discussed at the next meeting of improvements, if the suggestion is decided to implement an action plan is created and the card is moved to the next step on the board. St. Jude Medical stands for the example of feedback of results and progression. This thanks to the work with its CI-board. CI stands for Continuous Improvement, and this group is created specifically to develop and give feedback of continuous improvement at the company. The CI-board is a centralized group and acts as a coach group in improving matters for St. Jude Medical's internal customers. A support function that can be of great importance for a company's middle managers who then feel the support from an internal, but in the same time external, expert in continuous improvement. All three companies worked long term with continuous improvement and decided new, higher goals. The weakest point in all three companies was the dissemination of "best practice" in which none of the companies felt they had a good system for. Validerat; 20120322 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} the use of {{corporate}} blogs in Norwegian organizations. A review of existing literature and research in the field of blogging and corporate blogging has been done, and the advantages/disadvantages of corporate blogging and blog reading are described. A web survey has been conducted to investigate if Norwegian organizations are blogging and their views on corporate blogging and blog reading. In addition to this, three case studies from Norwegian organizations that have adopted the blog as a tool is presented to give a more profound insight on how Norwegian organizations are utilizing blogs. The problem statement for this thesis was: What is the state of corporate blogging in Norway? With the following underlying research questions: Are Norwegian organizations blogging? Why do they blog? How do they do it? What are their experiences? How do corporate blogging in Norway compare to corporate blogging abroad? The results from this thesis show that Norwegian organizations have adopted the blog as a tool, but in small numbers so far. Both external and <b>internal</b> <b>blogging</b> has been seen in this research. The early adopters are seeing a variety of benefits from their blogging initiatives and the majority state that their blogs are considered as successful and that they will continue to blog in the future. We have also seen that the number of Norwegian organizations that read blogs and monitor the blogosphere is greater than the number of Norwegian organizations blogging themselves, and have seen indications that there is an increased interest in corporate blogging amongst Norwegian organizations...|$|R

We studied a large <b>internal</b> corporate <b>blogging</b> community using log files and interviews and found that employees expected to receive attention when they contributed to blogs, but these expectations often went unmet. Like in the external blogosphere, a few people received most of the attention, and many people received little or none. Employees expressed frustration if they invested time and received little or no perceived return on investment. While many corporations are looking to adopt Web-based communication tools like blogs, wikis, and forums, these efforts will fail unless employees are motivated to participate and contribute content. We identify where the attention economy breaks down in a corporate blog community and suggest mechanisms for improvement. Author Keywords Blogging, blog readers, attention economy, workplace...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out how viral and WOM marketing techniques can be used in online branding. The main case in the study is the mobile and Internet-based service Ovi by Nokia. The study also wants to find out what viral marketing experts have to say about the future of viral marketing and whether it really is the new revolutionary force in marketing. The theoretical part covers the topics of 1) branding in the digital age, 2) WOM (word-of-mouth) marketing and 3) viral marketing. At the end of the theoretical part, a detailed viral marketing classification system will be presented and explained, which will function as a part of the theoretical framework of the study. The framework, which examines how viral marketing and branding intersect, will – together with the results acquired from the empirical part – guide the formation of a branding and viral communication plan for Ovi by Nokia, which will be summarized at the end of this thesis. The research was conducted as an exploratory qualitative study. The data was collected from two sources: semi-structured interviews with carefully selected viral marketing and branding experts and other data such as informal discussions with Nokia personnel and non-public material such as <b>internal</b> <b>blogs,</b> informal discussions and presentations. The respondents of the interviews were from Nokia, the advertising agency Laundry, The Finnish Direct Marketing Association (ASML) and the communications agency Fruktmusic. The data analysis followed a thematic analysis approach and was focused around 3 main themes and 11 individual sub-themes, through which the data acquired from the interviews was analyzed. From these themes, conclusions and recommendations for the branding of Ovi by Nokia were drawn. Previous studies have proven that viral and WOM marketing have a connection with company growth and customer loyalty, among others, whereas this study has established that viral and WOM marketing techniques are indeed becoming increasingly important in brand building and management, but for the impact of viral marketing to be beneficial for the brand, the viral efforts must be designed and targeted correctly. The results of this study also suggest that in the future viral marketing itself will become more interactive, communal and commonplace as well as more refined and multi-dimensional. Viral marketing will also evolve more to the direction of trans-media storytelling and professionally produced projects. Viral marketing will probably not override other forms of marketing and branding completely any time soon, but it is becoming increasingly clear that whereas viral marketing is increasing in popularity, traditional marketing’s popularity is decreasing...|$|R
40|$|Organizational {{identity}} {{has traditionally been}} understood as a fixed product that can be identified and communicated to employees. Organizational identity formation should, however, {{be understood as a}} reflexive process. There is not just one organizational identity but several, and the construction of these identities takes place in a continuing process among several participants. Yet, in many organizations management aims at a conventional identity formation in the official internal identity communication, when communicating identity to employees with the ambition of creating a monolithic organization of devoted employees. This kind of conventional identity formation has several implications. Firstly, it creates a gap between the official and the unofficial identity formation. Secondly, it runs the risk of making the organization appear untrustworthy. Thirdly, it may lead to a homogenous work force, which seems contradictory to the strive for innovation and creativeness that also characterizes contemporary organizations. Finally, its inherent aim of social control seems morally questionable. Thus, organizations could beneficially strive for a higher degree of reflexiveness by letting more voices be part of the official identity formation. The empirically-based research on how to facilitate such reflexivity is, however, sparse. In order to address this gap in the literature, this PhD dissertation explores how to affect rhetorical agency at work by implementing <b>internal</b> employee <b>blogs</b> in organizations [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Firms {{pursuing}} an {{open innovation}} strategy have increasingly turned to individuals {{as sources of}} new ideas. Two main approaches are often highlighted. First, firms can use online innovation contests, where individuals submit ideas in competition for a prize. Second, firms can use firm-hosted online communities, drawing from collaborative efforts of individuals with more intrinsic motivations to participate. A central challenge in both cases is that firms often struggle to sustain participation and effort of participants on an on-going basis. A third hybrid approach, where firms establish community-based innovation contests, has been largely ignored by research, but seems to help firms to engage participants on an on-going basis. This study focuses on community-based innovation contests to understand how firms engage communities to participate in contest over time. I conducted fieldwork at two firms that have successfully run them for many years, Chicago-based T-Shirt firm Threadless and Phoenix-based automotive firm Local Motors. Over ninety interviews with firm employees and community members, over six months of on-site observation at the two firms’ headquarters as well as <b>internal</b> documents and <b>blog</b> data have been collected and analysed. Based on this data {{the core of the}} thesis consists of three empirical chapters that examine how firms are able to engage the communities to participate in their contests on a regular basis. First, it shows that the addition of a community to contests increases contestants’ opportunities to learn. In experiential learning, contests provide experience whereas the community provides room for reflection and learning. These learning opportunities motivate contestants to come back and create contest entries on an on-going basis. Secondly, taking a social identity perspective, the research shows how the firms are able to engage the community members continuously by creating a joint firm-community identity. Lastly, it explains how these firms are able to influence community members’ perception of the tasks they are doing through the contest design. Firms are able to turn activities that have been traditionally regarded as work into a recreational activity. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
