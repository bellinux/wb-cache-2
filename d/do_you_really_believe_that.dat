6000|$|... "Worthless!" [...] she repeated. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it, father. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Thain {{would do}} you an ill turn like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Britt, {{looking into}} her clear eyes, {{acquired}} a new confidence in her. [...] "Tell me, Miss Lambert, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> your father {{comes to you}} in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{the affair}} {{to have been}} {{carrying}} on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Because {{you have}} been taught that it is all evil--'only evil continually.' Somehow, often as people say that, they never seem, to me, to <b>believe</b> it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{called me}} a Puritan, and then you quoted that ill-natured French proverb at me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> your sister thinks evil, Frank?" [...] and as she spoke she put her arm caressingly round his neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Le Drieux," [...] said Arthur; [...] "let us {{be honest}} with one another, now that the thing is settled and {{diplomacy}} is uncalled for. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jones is Jack Andrews?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Isabel," [...] I said, {{after it}} was all over, and Mrs. Deering had {{vanished}} in a mist of happy tears, [...] "I suppose {{this is what you}} call perfectly providential. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Miss Gage didn't send her back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, [...] "we are in London, {{alone in}} a taxicab, secure against any {{possible}} eavesdropping. You preach the advantage of our Kaiser-led country. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Kaiser is the man for the task which is coming?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me more," [...] said Kate, eagerly. [...] "It is all so unreal to me--I {{want to see}} more. Dr. Britt {{has told}} us {{wonderful}} things of <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> the dead speak to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't {{called you}} any names, nor do I {{intend to do}} so; I only wanted mother {{to know the truth}} of the {{business}} between us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> I had any hand in breaking into your store?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--your husband--your husband! How strange it seems! I {{remember}} you hinted {{something of the}} sort the other day. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in these matters, Tess?" [...] he asked. [...] "You seem to have no religion--perhaps owing to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the idiom of this country, Countess," [...] he said, [...] "I {{raise my}} hat to you. You {{preserve}} your mask of ignorance to the end. So much so, indeed, that I find myself asking <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Germany {{intends to do}} this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{nothing about}} it!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff. [...] "I wish I had a {{thousand}} tongues {{to talk of}} it. Captain, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Cheddy man is a priest, or what goes for one in his own country? If he is, he ought to marry you and Edna." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you expect}} to carry that by going {{out into the streets}} with all the roughs of London, and putting {{yourself}} in direct opposition to the authority of the magistrates? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the ballot will become {{the law of the land}} any sooner because you incur this danger and inconvenience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My friends, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in that kingdom, {{and in that}} King? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{believe that}} you are now {{actually}} in a kingdom of heaven, which cannot be moved; and that the living, acting, guiding, practical, real King thereof is Christ who died on the Cross? ...|$|R
6000|$|He leant back on {{his hand}} and looked at me, smiling frankly. [...] "Even now," [...] he said, [...] "it's odd, but the whole of {{that seems like a}} silly dream. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think there WAS a Lord Warden? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> we sank all that machinery--for fun? It was a dream. And yet--it happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he didn't," [...] {{answered}} the widow, {{for about the}} two hundred and fiftieth time, for there had been occasions when she thought Dorcas put this question inopportunely. [...] "He hated it, and he was drowned in it through trustin' a sailorman, which I never did nor shall. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> those men are comin' here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Holy step-father, you mean; for a step-father {{he seems}} to prove to merry England. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> an old man down in Italy can make a bit of rag conquer by saying a few prayers at it? If I am to believe in a magic flag, give me Harold Hardraade's Landcyda, at least, with Harold and his Norsemen behind it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor dear Percival!" [...] cried Count Fosco, {{looking after}} him gaily, [...] "he {{is the victim}} of English spleen. But, my dear Miss Halcombe, my dear Lady Glyde, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> crimes cause their own detection? And you, my angel," [...] he continued, turning to his wife, who had not uttered a word yet, [...] "do you think so too?" ...|$|E
60|$|You further charge us {{with being}} disunionists. If {{you mean that}} it is our aim to {{dissolve}} the Union, I for myself answer that it is untrue; for those who act with me I answer that it is untrue. Have you heard us assert that as our aim? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such is our aim? Do you find it in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere? If not, withdraw the charge.|$|E
5000|$|Levy, who {{continues}} to consider himself {{a member of the}} [...] "left", says that the book grew out of a phone call he received from French President Nicolas Sarkozy on January 23, 2007 asking for his support in the Presidential campaign. Levy responded that, [...] "no matter how much I like and respect you, the Left is my family", to which Sarkozy replied, [...] "These people who've spent 30 years telling you to go (expletive) yourself? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> what you're saying, that these people are your family?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In any case," [...] she remarked, [...] "we are a {{hospital}} ship. I expect they'd leave us alone. Major Thomson," [...] she went on, [...] "I wonder, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> all these {{stories of the}} horrible doings of the Germans--the way they have treated drowning people attacked by their submarines, and these hateful stories of Belgium? Sometimes {{it seems to me}} as though there was a fog of hatred which had sprung up between the two countries, and we could neither of us quite see clearly what the other was doing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Good evening, candidates. This is Seekster from Arlington, Texas, {{and this}} {{question}} is for Ron Paul. I've {{met a lot of}} your supporters online, but I've noticed that a good number of them seem to buy into this conspiracy theory regarding the Council of Foreign Relations, and some plan to make a North American union by merging the United States with Canada and Mexico. These supporters of yours seem to think that you also believe in this theory. So my question to <b>you</b> is: <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in all this, or are people just putting words in your mouth? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the triumph}} of it had been very great. I had been assured of {{the love of her}} who among all the high ones of the world {{seemed to me to be}} the highest. Then came your decision. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I could abandon the sweetness, that I could be robbed of my triumph, that I could think I could never again be allowed to put my arm round your waist, never again to feel your cheek close to mine, that I should lose all that had seemed left to me among the gods, without feeling it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me guess}} what {{troubles}} you now. Oh! I {{am not the}} empty-headed fop that you would believe. I have ears and eyes, and if I hold aloof from Court intrigues, it is only because I see too much of their inner workings. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I do not see what goes on around me now? Do I not know how your noble sympathy must {{at this very moment}} be going out to the unfortunate young prince whom you honour with your friendship? Surely, surely, you cannot be a party to the criminal supineness which at this very moment besets France, and causes her to abandon him to his fate?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jesus also (saith the apostle) that {{he might}} sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered: Where? Not in any believer, but without the gate of Jerusalem (Heb 13:12). How say you, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> at that time when Jesus did hang on the cross without Jerusalem's gate, even at that time he did give the justice of God a full and {{complete}} satisfaction for all the sins of all believers, that have been formerly, or are now, or hereafter shall be? Or do you look upon Jesus {{at that time to}} be but a shadow, or type of some what that was afterwards to be done within? Answer plainly, yea, or no; that the simple may understand you.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since we}} wrote a paper (1) on the constructivist theory of {{knowledge}} for the Journal, fifteen years ago, chemists and chemical educators have asked: <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in the constructivist theory? The answer is: Yes. As {{we talk to}} colleagues we have become convinced {{that the source of}} their concern about this theory is the version to which they have been exposed. As we note in this paper, even critics of this theory argue "that there is a very broad and loose sense in which all of us these days are constructivists [...] . " This paper outlines the different forms of the constructivist theory and describes a version proposed by the clinical psychologist, George Kelly, that avoids some of the controversial elements of the radical constructivist theory developed {{as an extension of the}} work of Jean Piaget.

6000|$|COLONEL. 'You {{are very}} clever, Alice, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I <b>believe</b> {{that this is}} no shock to you? Oh, woman, why has this {{deception}} not struck you to the ground?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Halsey," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am going}} out to lunch. At least, I wish it to be thought that I am {{going out to}} lunch. As a matter of fact, I shall return in about ten minutes by the back way. I <b>do</b> not wish <b>you,</b> however, to know this. I {{want you to have}} it in your mind that I have gone to lunch and shall not be back until a quarter past two. If there are {{visitors}} for me--Inquirers of any sort--act exactly as <b>you</b> would have <b>done</b> if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> that I was not in the building." ...|$|R
60|$|Is it so, my friends? But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus is the Son of God? For sure I am, {{that if you}} did, and I did, {{really and}} fully believe that, we could all lead much better lives than we are leading, manful and godly, useful and honourable, truly {{independent}} and yet truly humble; fearing God and fearing nothing else. But do you believe it? Have you ever thought of all that those great words mean, 'Jesus is the Son of God'?--That he who died on the cross, and rose again for us, now sits at God's right hand, having all power given to him in heaven and earth? For, think, if we really believed that, what power it would give us to overcome the world, and all its chances and changes; all its seemingly iron laws; all its selfish struggling; all its hearsays and fashions.|$|E
5000|$|Emperor Taizong had a {{horse with}} the name [...] "Lion Stallion", {{and it was so}} large and strong that no one could get on its back. I was a lady in waiting {{attending}} Emperor Taizong, and I suggested to him, [...] "I only need three things to subordinate it: an iron whip, an iron hammer, and a sharp dagger. I will whip it with the iron whip. If it does not submit, I will hammer its head with the iron hammer. If it still does not submit, I will cut its throat with the dagger." [...] Emperor Taizong praised my bravery. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are qualified to dirty my dagger? ...|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Johnson, English author, critic, and biographer, was {{convinced}} that Macpherson was [...] "a , a liar, and a fraud, and that the poems were forgeries". Johnson also dismissed the poems' quality. Upon being asked, [...] "But Doctor Johnson, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any man today could write such poetry?" [...] he famously replied, [...] "Yes. Many men. Many women. And many children." [...] Johnson is cited as calling the story of Ossian [...] "as gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with". In support of his claim, Johnson also called Gaelic the rude speech of a barbarous people, and {{said there were no}} manuscripts in it more than 100 years old. In reply, it was proved that the Advocates' library at Edinburgh contained Gaelic manuscripts 500 years old, and one of even greater antiquity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just wish}} you could have seen that {{squirrel}} when I found him sitting {{at the front door}} of Sonny Hedgehog's hole, ready to get under cover {{at the first sign of}} danger! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> he had tired out the 'Squire and that there wasn't any danger he could come to harm! ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} it later, Betts was {{philosophical}} about the experience: It {{was one of those}} things where it was a job you can't say no to, even though I was nine months pregnant. ... It's weird, all the criticism and all the tough calls at Bazaar, and getting fired ultimately, those were all hard things to experience, but with hindsight, which is always 20/20, they were great experiences. I don't regret any of it at all. It was an amazing opportunity to learn how to edit a magazine in two years, and get it over with. There are a lot of lessons there, but the thing I always come back to is, if you're <b>doing</b> something <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in, <b>you</b> never regret anything <b>you</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{the good}} news of this text, in which the Son of God himself said to mortal men like ourselves, 'Handle me and {{see that it is}} I, indeed; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.' <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{believe that there is a}} Man evermore on the right hand of God? That now as we speak a man is {{offering}} up before the Father his perfect and all-cleansing sacrifice? That, in the midst of the throne of God, is he himself who was born of the Virgin Mary, and crucified under Pontius Pilate? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish to find out whether you believe that or not? Then look at your own hearts. Look at your own prayers. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think of the Lord Jesus Christ, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> pray to the Lord Jesus Christ, as a man, very man, born of woman? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> pray to him as to one who can be touched with the feeling of your infirmities, because he has been tempted in all things like as you are, yet without sin? When you are sad, perplexed, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take all your sorrows and doubts and troubles to the Lord Jesus, and speak them all out to him honestly and frankly, however reverently, as a man speaketh to his friend? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> cast all your care on him, because you believe that he careth for <b>you?</b> If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> then indeed <b>you</b> believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ; and you will surely have your reward in a peace of mind, amid all the chances and changes of this mortal life, which passes man's understanding. That blessed knowledge that the Lord knows all, cares for all, condescends to all--That thought of a loving human face smiling upon your joys, sorrowing over your sorrows, watching you, educating you from youth to manhood, from manhood to the grave, from the grave to eternities of eternities-- Whosoever has felt that, has indeed found the pearl of great price, for which, if need be, he would give up all else in earth or heaven.|$|R
