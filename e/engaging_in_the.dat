5|$|The American white ibis is territorial, {{defending}} the nesting and display sites against intruders. Agonistic or threat displays include lunging {{forward with the}} bill in a horizontal posture, and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent's head or wings.|$|E
5|$|The new tolls {{cause the}} price of food and other {{essentials}} to rise, enriching both Süß and the Duke. Süß gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corruption of their morals. The increase in {{the price of}} basic necessities causes the people of Württemberg to suffer great privation.|$|E
5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. They took the {{portcullis}} down, but could not find boats to cross the Doubs, so some soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not knowing that the battle had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E

5|$|Other {{similarities}} include <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suspense {{the speaker}} is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean force {{eventually}} withdrew {{after several}} unsuccessful attacks, having suffered heavy casualties. As it was disengaging from Masan, US Air Force aircraft caught the North Korean truck columns {{as they were}} retreating, inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties. This fight, {{with a number of}} smaller engagements in the region, effectively stopped the North Korean offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. It also gave both sides a reprieve from the fighting to resupply and re-enforce before <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after.|$|E
5|$|After first {{arriving}} at Fort Crockett, Middleton adapted to garrison life while <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Galveston social scene by attending Saturday night dances in town. At one such dance {{he had a}} navy lieutenant introduce him to Jerusha Collins, who would later become his wife. She had attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas and had made her debut in Galveston society in 1911. Following {{the death of her}} father, Sidney G. Collins, Jerusha had come to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. John Hagemann, in the heart of Galveston. As a merchant, Hagemann was well to do, and drove a Studebaker touring car when most people in the town rode in buggies, wagons, and surreys. Middleton met the Hagemanns, soon becoming a regular visitor at their house while calling on Jerusha.|$|E

5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left had less momentum {{than the rest of}} its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E
5|$|Rupert had {{demonstrated}} {{an interest in}} colonial issues for many years. On arriving in England in 1660, he had encouraged the government to continue Rupert's own exploration of the Gambia {{in an attempt to}} find gold, leading to Robert Holmes's expedition the following year. Rupert was an active shareholder in the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa that was established as a result in 1662. The company continued operations for the next eight years, with backers including the King, the Duke of York and the Royal Society, with operations including <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Africa slave trade until it folded in 1670. The company's operations merged with those of the Gambia Merchants' Company into the new Royal African Company, with a royal charter to set up forts, factories, troops and to exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade in gold, silver and slaves; Rupert was the third named member of the company's executive committee.|$|E

In a fluctuating battle, it captured Moircy on 30 December and Remagne on 31 December. On 2 January 1945, it took Germont, on 10 January Tillet, and reached the Ourthe by 13 January.

After the fall of Neuendorf on 9 February, the Division went on the defensive until the 26 February, when Ormont and Hallschlag were taken in night attacks. The 87th crossed the Kyll River on 6 March, took Dollendorf on 8 March, and after a brief rest, returned to combat on 13 March 1945, crossing the Moselle on 16 March and clearing Koblenz, on 18–19 March. The Division crossed the Rhine on 25–26 March and despite strong opposition, consolidated its bridgehead, and secured Grossenlinden and Langgöns. On 7 April, it jumped off in an attack which carried it through Thuringia into Saxony. Plauen fell on 17 April, and the Division took up defensive positions on 20 April, about 4miles from the Czech border.
