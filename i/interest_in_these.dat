His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E

5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were to educate people in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. <b>Interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
5|$|With few ties in Britain, {{he decided}} to emigrate to Canada, {{arriving}} in Nova Scotia in 1907, where he gained work {{on a farm in}} Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a logging camp, before gaining a job as an accounting clerk at the British Columbia Electric Railway in April 1912. He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about Eastern religion, yoga, and Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's Book 4 and volume one, number one of The Equinox. Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the A∴A∴, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.|$|E

The publications of studies into European folk customs and culture by scholars like Johann Gottfried Herder and Jacob Grimm resulted in a wider <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> subjects and a growth in cultural self-consciousness. At the time, it was commonly believed that almost all such folk customs were survivals from the pre-Christian period.|$|E

Now, with many experts in these fields approaching retirement age, action is needed to avoid a workforce gap in these critical fields, for example by building student <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> careers, expanding the educational capacity of universities and colleges, and providing more specific on-the-job training.|$|E

While the University of King's College has never lost nor relinquished <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> granting powers, they are held in abeyance due to agreements with the University of King's College's partner, Dalhousie University, {{as part of the}} agreement to allow the portion of Dalhousie's campus to be used by the University of King's College.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Bakelite spurred {{scientific}} {{investigations into the}} chemistry of the phenol/formaldehyde reaction. One result was the discovery made in 1942 by the Austrian chemist Alois Zinke, that p-alkyl phenols and formaldehyde in a strongly basic solution yield mixtures containing cyclic tetramers. Concomitantly, the American chemists Joseph Niederl and H. J. Vogel obtained similar cyclic tetramers from the acid-catalyzed reaction of resorcinol and aldehydes such as benzaldehyde. A number of years later, the British chemist John Cornforth showed that the product from p-tert-butylphenol and formaldehyde {{is a mixture of}} the cyclic tetramer and another ambiguous cyclomer. His <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> compounds was in the tuberculostatic properties of their oxyethylated derivatives.|$|E

The temples located inside the reservoir area were part of the then Padmapur, one of the oldest and most populous villages in the region prior to the dam construction. More than 200 temples were submerged by the dam; nearly 150 temples have either perished or are underwater and about 50 are visible during summer. These lost temples present excellent opportunities for scuba diving enthusiasts to explore under the Hirakud Dam. These temple are visible to visitors on boats only during the summer months of May and June.|$|E
