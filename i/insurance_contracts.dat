5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

25|$|Separate <b>{{insurance}}</b> <b>contracts</b> (i.e., {{insurance policies}} not bundled with loans or {{other kinds of}} contracts) were invented in Genoa in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates.

25|$|There was {{a degree}} of public and {{legislative}} distaste for a limitation of liability, with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity.

Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the Companies Act 1862.

The New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced in March 2009 that he was investigating whether AIG's trading counterparties improperly received government money. Goldman Sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to AIG and received $12.9 billion during the unwind of credit default swap (CDS) contracts by AIG after receiving the government loans.|$|E

25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an energy plan that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E
500|$|Insurance is a {{contract}} based upon speculation. The special facts, {{upon which the}} contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in {{the knowledge of the}} insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use uberrima fides), it is still used in <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts.</b> In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably knows more about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual [...] "good faith," [...] the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider the basic notion that an <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> premium must be {{independent}} {{of the outcome of}} the insured event. This is done by simply assuming that the parties to an <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> may agree that the contract becomes null should the value of the insurable loss fall outside a preestablished support, in which case any premiums corresponding to the contract that have been paid are returned. Using this concept of insurance, we show that the classic deductible contract format is no longer optimal, since the insured will always prefer to purchase supplementary insurance to cover the deductible.

2500|$|Because {{contracts}} {{of insurance}} {{have many features}} in common with wagers, <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party {{has an interest in}} the [...] "bet-upon" [...] outcome beyond the specific financial terms. e.g.: a [...] "bet" [...] with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather insurance — as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home independent of the purely financial aspects of the [...] "bet" [...] (i.e., the insurance policy).
