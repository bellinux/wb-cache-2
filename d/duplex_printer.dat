50|$|Between 1884 and 1886, Mayorga Rivas {{published}} his first three-volume anthology, Guirnalda Salvadoreña, which collected biographical {{information and the}} works of Salvadoran poets. During this period, he also founded the newspaper El independiente in Granada, Nicaragua, the city where he also was married. After returning to El Salvador, he established the newspaper Diario del Salvador (1895-1932), {{one of the most}} important newspapers in Central Americal and the most modern of that era—and the newspaper for which a <b>duplex</b> <b>printer</b> was first brought to El Salvador. In his journalism, Mayorga Rivas collaborated with many notable writers, including Francisco Gavidia, David J. Guzmán, Porfirio Barba Jacob (known as Ricardo Arenales), and José María Peralta Lagos.|$|E

40|$|Developing a more {{thorough}} understanding of what motivates young people to adopt sustainable behaviours is an important area of concern that has practical implications for creating sound educational interventions and ensuring a sustainable future. The overall purpose of this thesis was to assess and understand primary- and high-school students’ environmentally sustainable behaviours in order to inform educational interventions. Moreover, it aimed at analysing one particular socially sustainable behavioural intention among university students, notably their intention to buy fair trade products. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) {{was used as the}} basic theoretical framework to examine these behaviours. We first conducted a pilot study for each behaviour, with the aim to identify salient beliefs of the target populations with regard to the behaviour investigated. Open-ended questionnaires were administered to a sample of 116 primary-school students, 92 high-school students, and 17 voluntary participants at the university level. A content analysis of the participants’ responses allowed the determination of the most salient beliefs, which were used {{as the basis for the}} quantitative measures of beliefs in the main studies. The first and second main studies investigated the beliefs of 812 primary-school students and 602 high-school students regarding the adoption of pro-environmental behaviours using a longitudinal approach. The gist of our results seems to be that for both age groups, educational interventions should target control beliefs especially. For instance, students insist on tools that would facilitate pro-environmental behaviours (e. g., having <b>duplex</b> <b>printers</b> or recycling bins at school and at home). However, behavioural and normative beliefs should not be neglected. The last study examined mainly differences in male and female university students’ intentions to consume fair trade products. The results indicate that for women, more emphasis should be placed on perceived behavioural control (e. g., factors that facilitate the ii purchase of fair trade products), while for men, more emphasis should be placed on attitudes towards buying fair trade products (i. e., the advantages of adopting this behaviour). Our results confirm the usefulness of the TPB as a framework for understanding young people’s sustainable intentions and behaviours, with perceived control and attitudes having considerable impacts on sustainable intentions and perceived social pressure having a rather low weight. In addition, perceived control and intentions contributed significantly to the explained variance in primary- and high-school students’ eco-friendly behaviours. This thesis makes a number of important contributions to the literature. From a practical point of view, primary- and high-school students are important populations because sustainability-related habits might be established early in life. Moreover, in their roles as potentially important future decision makers in our society (e. g., future company leaders, politicians, global citizens), university students should be sensitized to the unequal power relationships often involved in conventional trading. Offering fair trade products and encouraging their consumption should be considered a small, but important, step in universities’ duty to create awareness. Despite the positive input for interventions inspired by this thesis, some limitations have to be considered, for instance, our reliance on self-report questionnaires and the possibility that participants may have overestimated the extent to which they perform environmentally and socially desirable behaviours related to sustainability. Last, further research is needed to test the effectiveness of interventions based on the present results...|$|R
40|$|Embedded system {{developers}} face {{many and}} sometimes conflicting challenges. To increase efficiency and drive down hardware cost, they must aim for ever {{higher levels of}} system integration. But to keep applications manageable and scaleable, they need solutions that are as general and modular as possible. At the same time, embedded system complexity rises, quality standards go up and development time needs to decrease. With such opposing forces, how can the development of embedded systems still remain successful, maintainable and reliable? This white paper gives an overview of how embedded system engineers can cope with these issues, {{now and in the}} future. It does so by showing what successful strategies we have developed in the past few years. Taking the development of the fastest <b>duplex</b> cut sheet <b>printer</b> in the world as a case example, we outline four elements of successful embedded software design: • Model driven development as the leading method for designing and building real-time systems. • A standard real-time embedded software architecture. • Reuse of software as a “company philosophy”. • Systematic approach to quality control. The lessons learned from our experiences with embedded design are so general that they can be applied {{to a wide range of}} real-time system designs.
