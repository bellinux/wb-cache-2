500|$|Following {{her role}} in Green Lantern, news {{surfaced}} of Blake Lively leaving the show to further her acting career in Hollywood. IOL notes [...] "Despite all talk of career trajectories and fanbase, Blake insists her choices are made through far simpler criteria and when asked about playing in a comic-book film says: 'It’s not really a suitable question because the decisions I make on parts come from a more emotional place. It {{has to be a}} character I connect with or someone <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> empathy with.'" [...] New York Magazine and various media periodicals have also noted the possibility of Lively leaving the show. Serena and Georgina's dresses were designed by Jenny Packham and Marchesa, respectively. Blair wore an Alexis Mabille dress while Chuck wore a Ralph Lauren suit.|$|E

Her auditions for both Bollywood and Hollywood productions, including {{for the role of}} Bond girl Camille Montes in Marc Forster's Quantum of Solace (2008), were largely unsuccessful.

500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{begins to}} {{read one of}} his {{childhood}} horror stories to the children, but Michael enters and insists that he stop upsetting the kids. Michael decides to show {{the children and the}} office a video of him as a child (Jake Kalender) during an appearance on a kid's show, where he revealed his dream was to [...] "get married and have 100 kids, so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> 100 friends, and no one can say 'no' to being my friend." [...] He retreats into his office when he realizes that he never came close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name [...] "Little Kid Lover"). After being tormented by Jake all day, Dwight is finally stern with him, which quietly pleases Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Pam wins over Jake with the paper shredder. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) leaves the office early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party by singing to the children.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{agreed to}} what {{at the time}} was {{considered}} a controversial commercial sponsorship agreement with PepsiCo, which was later seen as helping {{to pave the way for}} other big money tours by other artists. For his part, Bowie recorded a TV commercial with Tina Turner to the tune [...] "Modern Love" [...] in May 1987 while he was preparing for the tour. The commercial had a short run, as Pepsi withdrew the commercial after Bowie was accused of sexual assault during the tour. Of the sponsorship agreement, Bowie said, [...] "We did a commercial sponsorship thing only for North America with the Pepsi-Cola company. As far as I'm concerned, what it's allowed me to do, having them underwrite the tour, is to be able to produce a far more extravagant show than if I were just doing it myself. It means that instead of just having 1 or 2 sets <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> 3 or 4 sets made, and they can travel independently and they can be far more complicated." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career in far-right politics, Tyndall became less outspoken on race after his {{prosecution}} under the race relations legislation. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used Spearhead to claim that [...] "the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure" [...] than white Europeans. In 1988, Tyndall described his crime as having [...] "dared to publish an honest and frank opinion on the relative merits of Whites and Negroes." [...] Tyndall argued that non-whites were unassimilable to Britain and that those living in Britain should be repatriated. Tyndall strongly objected to interracial relationships and miscegenation and remarked in his book The Eleventh Hour: [...] "I feel deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> no sympathy whatever for the parents... They produced an offspring that will never wholly fit, and will undoubtedly face a life much harder than the normal person born of pure race." [...] In contrast to his views on non-white migration, he spoke positively of white immigrants from Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states, regarding them as being racially similar and sharing the [...] "same basic culture" [...] as the British and were thus easily able to assimilate [...] "within a generation or two".|$|E
500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E

Thomas solved this problem without asking his government for directions. He arranged with the captains of the Hamburg steamers to take these soldiers across the ocean at half price, and together with some friends he [...] "made up a little purse" [...] with which they could be sent to Hamburg. [...] "I am well aware," [...] he reported to the U.S. Department of State, [...] "that as consul <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> nothing to do with enlisting soldiers, but no international law can prevent me from paying a soldier's passage from here to Hamburg out of my own pocket."

2500|$|In 1936, philosopher Alfred Ayer {{considered}} the standard philosophical question of other minds: {{how do we}} know that other people have the same conscious experiences that we do? In his book, Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: [...] "The only ground <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined." [...] (This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence. Moreover, it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.) In other words, a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test.|$|E
2500|$|Since late 2001 Karzai {{has been}} trying for peace in his country, going as far as pardoning militants that lay down weapons and join the {{rebuilding}} process. However, his offers were not accepted by the militant groups. In April 2007, Karzai acknowledged that he spoke to some militants about trying to bring peace in Afghanistan. He noted that the Afghan militants are always welcome in the country, although foreign insurgents are not. In September 2007, Karzai again offered talks with militant fighters after a security scare forced him to end a commemoration speech. Karzai left the event and was taken back to his palace, where he was due to meet visiting Latvian President Valdis Zatlers. After the meeting the pair held a joint news conference, at which Karzai called for talks with his Taliban foes. [...] "We don't have any formal negotiations with the Taliban. They don't have an address. Who do we talk to?" [...] Karzai told reporters.

Irwin also realized that his style of performance was at odds with the main venue available to comedians today: comedy clubs. (Irwin joking refers to comedy clubs as [...] "evil, smelly places".) [...] Some of his stories are an hour in length, and Irwin notes, [...] "here was a time when comedians could do that but they can't anymore because the clubs give them three minutes, and they are timing the laughs per minute." [...] Using storytelling as a theatrical form allows Irwin to create more fully drawn characters and to explore darker subject matters as well.
