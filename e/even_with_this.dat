5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E

5|$|The Qing state's main shamanistic ritual was {{performed}} at the tangse by the emperor {{on the first day}} of the New Year. In the Shunzhi (1644–1661), Kangxi (1662–1722), and Yongzheng (1723–1735) eras, this ceremony was the emperor's first activity {{on the first day of}} the New Year, but sometime during the Qianlong era (1736–1796) it fell to the second rank after private sacrifices to the Aisin Gioro ancestors. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> somewhat diminished importance, these shamanic rites continued to the end of the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m {{telescope}} {{was used for}} speckle imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO camera on the Palomar Observatory's 5m {{telescope was}} used for its adaptive optics capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results that had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E

5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

25|$|Growth in {{strength}} did not initially translate into larger {{numbers in the}} Reichstag. The original constituencies had been drawn at the empire's formation in 1871, when Germany was almost two-thirds rural. They were never redrawn to reflect the dramatic growth of Germany's cities in the 1890s.

25|$|With {{the blessing}} of the king, {{construction}} of the railroad could commence. However, there was one major obstacle, a lack of qualified railroad construction engineers.

This made the railroad incompatible with those of neighbouring countries, whereas the system was originally intended to link up with them (the railroads would later be converted to standard gauge to remedy this). It also delayed delivery of the locomotives.|$|E

25|$|A {{prototype}} Commander 112 crashed {{after the}} tail failed during testing, {{which led to}} a redesign of the tail unit. This delayed the delivery of the first production aircraft until late in 1972. It also led to changes that further increased the weight of the aircraft. This resulted it is being seriously underpowered; the 112 prototype was powered by a 180hp (134kW) Lycoming O-360 engine, this was replaced by a 200hp (149kW) IO-360 engine in production aircraft. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> engine there is widespread agreement that the aircraft was underpowered. Another annoyance was that the fibreglass composite doors did not fit well and tended to leak.|$|E

25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> new title, {{however, the}} method of {{selection}} of the bishop of Rome remained much the same.

Emperor Honorius stepped in to resolve the schism between Eulalius and Pope Boniface I (both elected), siding with Eulalius first and then Boniface I. Honorius decreed that any future schisms should be decided by unanimous selection; although this decree has never been employed in resolving a disputed papal election, it indicates the increasing degree of imperial interest in the question of papal succession.|$|E
