5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> and returns to his world.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, the SS Eastland capsized while docked in the Chicago River, {{with the}} loss of over 800 lives.

5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} machinations of Yelü Yixin, {{the only other}} event of note from Emperor Daozong's rule was a war fought between 1092 and 1102 between the Liao and a Mongolian, {{possibly}} Tatar tribe, group known as the Zubu. The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b> In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao to capture and kill the Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. The war against the Zubu was the last successful military campaign waged by the Liao dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction,</b> the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced her <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> and {{she ended up}} getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column was near the action, so he led it <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b> As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 1, 1824, Desha {{attended}} a celebration at a neighbor's house. He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that he knew where Bickley lived and, intending to ride <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction,</b> asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{was adopted}} as North Devon's Liberal {{candidate}} in April 1952. His political stance matched {{that of other}} young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b> He {{spent much of his}} spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.|$|E
