5000|$|When {{developed}} in the mid-1800s, Morse code telegraphy was first used for signaling over wires and underwater cables. With the introduction of wireless (radio) by Guglielmo Marconi in the early 1900s Morse code was quickly adapted to the new radio technology giving rise to radiotelegraphy. Morse code's channel code, known as on-off keying or OOK modulation, is also known in modern channel code parlance as unipolar encoding. Unipolar encoding is the simplest form of amplitude modulation (AM) composed of only two amplitudes; the two amplitudes known generically as [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off". The [...] "off" [...] state is simply a no-signal silent period the [...] "on" [...] state is simply a full power signal. Signaling using OOK by keying a single frequency radio carrier, as opposed to using damped transient oscillations triggered by spark gaps as originally developed by Marconi, historically then became known as continuous wave or simply CW signaling instead of spark; the nomenclature CW being inappropriate as it happens, since the keyed radio carrier is certainly not continuous because of the ubiquitous silent periods present in the OOK modulation generated by the Morse code! Historically CW has also been known as wireless telegraphy (W/T), or simply as radiotelegraphy. Modern era radio amateurs (hams) usually refer {{to the use of}} <b>keyed</b> <b>carrier</b> Morse code simply as [...] "CW". It is the presence of the ubiquitous silent (off) periods in CW that is {{the most important aspect of}} the Morse code OOK modulation code that provides the [...] "listen while sending" [...] support for so-called QSK operation.|$|E

Implanted just below the skull along with a high-density intracortical microelectrode array, the chip enables leadless op-eration of the resulting microsystem, accepting power and data through an inductive link {{from the outside world}} and inserting information into the nervous system in the form of stimulating currents. Each module contains eight current drivers, generating stimulus currents up to 270 A with 5 -b resolution, 100 M output impedance, and a dynamic range (headroom voltage) that extends within 150 mV of the 5 V supply rail, and 250 mV of the ground level. As many as 64 modules can be used in parallel, to drive multiprobe arrays of up to 2048 sites, with only a pair of connections to a common inductive–capacitive (LC) tank circuit, while receiving power (8. 25 mW/module) and data (2. 5 Mb/s) from a 5 / 10 -MHz frequency shift <b>keyed</b> <b>carrier.</b> Every 4. 6 mm 4. 6 mm chip fabricated in a 1. 5 - m, 2 M/ 2 P standard CMOS process through MOSIS, houses two modules and generates up to 65 800 stimulus pulses/s.

This study is of particular significance given the close connection between quantum cloning and quantum cryptography: using an optimal cloner generally makes it possible to obtain a tight bound on the best individual eavesdropping strategy in a quantum cryptosystem. In this Chapter, the issue of cloning a continuous-variable quantum system will be analyzed, and a Gaussian cloning transformation will be introduced. This cloner, which copies equally well any two canonically conjugate continuous variables, duplicates all coherent states with a same fidelity (F= 2 / 3).

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{multicarrier}} {{modulation scheme}} is presented for acoustic communication at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). User bits are put through a rate 1 / 3 turbo encoder and interleaved with periodic training bits. A maximal-length sequence is prefixed for signal detection and equalizer convergence, {{and the resulting}} bit stream is simultaneously modulated onto multiple phase-shift <b>keyed</b> <b>carriers.</b> Since each subband carries the same symbol sequence, the baseband ensemble is amenable to multichannel equalization. An adaptive multiband equalizer is thus constructed for joint equalization and despreading of the frequency bands. Iterative equalization using soft information from the turbo decoder further enhances the receiver performance. A reduction in complexity is achieved by equipping the subbands with separate recursive least squares tap updates, yet guided by a common error signal. The proposed algorithms are tested on acoustic data from the Baltic Sea, using eight subbands of 460 Hz each, at an effective data rate of 75 b/s. Robust receiver operation is demonstrated at overall receive SNRs down to - 12 dB in three different channels, which corresponds to an SNR per bit [...] . ...|$|R

Recent progress in the clinical application of SAF as a risk marker for diabetic nephropathy as well as cardiovascular disease in nondiabetic end-stage kidney disease, less advanced chronic kidney disease, and renal transplant recipients is reviewed. Recent findings Experimental studies highlight the fundamental role of the interaction of AGEs with the receptor for AGEs (RAGEs), also called the AGE-RAGE axis, in the pathogenesis of vascular and chronic kidney disease. SAF predicts (cardiovascular) mortality in renal failure and also chronic renal transplant dysfunction.

40|$|AbstractBorreliosis {{caused by}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is a {{cosmopolitan}} zoonosis studied worldwide; {{it is called}} Lyme disease in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere and Lyme-like or Baggio-Yoshinari Syndrome in Brazil. However, despite {{the increasing number of}} suspect cases, this disease is still neglected in Brazil by the medical and veterinary communities. Brazilian Lyme-like borreliosis likely involves capybaras as reservoirs and Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks as vectors. Thus, domestic animals can serve as <b>key</b> <b>carriers</b> in pathogen dissemination. This zoonosis has been little studied in horses in Brazil. The first survey was performed in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and this Brazilian Borreliosis exhibits many differences from the disease widely described in the Northern Hemisphere. The etiological agent shows different morphological and genetic characteristics, the disease has a higher recurrence rate after treatment with antibiotics, and the pathogen stimulates intense symptoms such as a broader immune response in humans. Additionally, the Brazilian zoonosis is not transmitted by the Ixodes ricinus complex. With respect to clinical manifestations, Baggio-Yoshinari Syndrome has been reported to cause neurological, cardiac, ophthalmic, muscle, and joint alterations in humans.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1985 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was twofold. One aim was to discover the origins of the vertical curriculum structure that has made a considerable impact on state secondary schools in the last decade. The other aim was to establish how the idea spread throughout the system and why schools made this major change away from the horizontal curriculum. Three research methods were used in this study. Firstly, Education Department Secondary School Handbooks were studied to identify the vertically structured schools in 1975 and 1982. Secondly, a telephone survey was undertaken in order to find more information about each of the forty-four vertical models discovered in the 1983 Handbook. This survey also enabled the original innovative schools to be identified, key individuals to be established and communication links between schools to be drawn up. Finally, the <b>key</b> <b>carriers</b> of the concept were interviewed to gain in depth information on the innovation.

The paper seeks to address two aspects of individual transformation into project manager; first, it aims to understand the specific factors, which drive the transformation of technical specialists into project managers and, second, to illuminate the tensions and challenges experienced in this new position. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical base for the study is a series of structured group discussions with project managers from a range of distinct industrial sectors and organisations. Findings - The paper illustrates the tensions implicit in the process of becoming a project manager. It identifies a number of conflicts that arise between the overarching philosophy of project management and the process of enacting the role of project manager around the themes of status, organisational value, power, influence and ambiguity.

40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{importance}} of an institutional perspective of trust. The core argument is that the type, scope and organization of civil society play a crucial role for the high level of trust and social capital in the Scandinavian countries. We argue that both the legitimacy of public institutions and their ability to deliver over time depend on a vibrant organizational society in which the organizations have independent institutional significance in their own right. Similar to other key social institutions, their functions include shaping sets of values and reducing vulnerability and uncertainty. Furthermore, these organizations constitute an entirely necessary infrastructure for cooperation, which makes it possible for trust to be institutionalized, reinvested and converted into action, and which also demonstrates that cooperation is rational and yields results. The aftermath of the terror attacks in Norway in 2011 demonstrated the existence of a strong civil society and its crucial role for community resilience. It contributed to curtailing widespread fear, mobilizing for collective manifestations of grief and restoring a sense of normalcy. However, the key role of civil society is not a permanent given. Developments within organized civil society may change their direct role as institutions and their indirect role as premise-setters and critical-correctors, particular in relation to the public sector.

Each one of those so-called long waves has been characterized by a sustained period of social modernization, most notably by sustained periods of increasing economic productivity.

Digital Information and Communication Technologies fulfill those requirements and therefore represent a general purpose technology that can transform an entire economy, leading to a modern, and more developed form of socio-economic and political organization often referred to as the post-industrial society, the fifth Kondratiev, Information society, digital age, and network society, among others.|$|R
