5|$|Krueger {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Hollandia in May 1944. The swampy area with its restricted anchorages proved unsuitable {{for a major}} airbase complex, although fighter strips were constructed, and it was developed as a staging area. MacArthur was compelled to press on with the Wakde-Sarmi project lest his troops become stranded without adequate air cover. A shortage of shipping meant that the operation had {{to be carried out}} by the troops in the Hollandia area, so Krueger nominated the 163rd Regimental Combat Team for Wakde, {{while the rest of the}} 41st Infantry Division captured Sarmi. However, with only <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> doubts surfaced about the viability of construction in the Sarmi area, and Biak was substituted. In view of the difficulties involved in changing plans, and moving the troops around, MacArthur agreed to postpone both operations, Wakde until 17 May and Biak to 27 May.|$|E
5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E

After the World Championship, in which he finished fifth behind Roche, Kelly returned to Ireland to win the Nissan for the third consecutive time.|$|E

Lancashire Lightning and Worcestershire Royals both lost in Division One, leaving them tied on points with two other teams {{at the bottom of}} the table. The final round of the Championship saw Hampshire beat the newly crowned county champions Nottinghamshire by an innings and 188 runs, their second win over Nottinghamshire in the Championship this year, but they still finished 2.5 points behind. Surrey were relegated after conceding too many bonus points to Middlesex, and a total of four innings victories were registered on the final matchday.|$|E

500|$|Chotiner {{had worked}} on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular {{governor}} {{did not want to}} be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|E

500|$|Abrams {{spent much}} of the {{remainder}} of the campaign trying to get Ferraro's endorsement. Ferraro, enraged and bitter after the nature of the primary, ignored Abrams and accepted Bill Clinton's request to campaign for his presidential bid instead. She was eventually persuaded by Governor Mario Cuomo and state party leaders into giving an unenthusiastic endorsement with just three <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the general election, in exchange for an apology by Abrams for the tone of the primary. D'Amato won the election by a very narrow margin. Overall the 1992 U.S. Senate elections saw five victories that it became known as the [...] "Year of the Woman". The Ferraro-Holtzman fighting of the campaign was viewed as a disaster by many feminists, however, with Ferraro denied her political comeback while Holtzman also politically damaged herself. The feud between Ferraro and Holtzman from the 1992 Senate primary lingered, as the following year Ferraro supported Assemblyman Alan Hevesi's successful primary challenge that unseated Holtzman as New York City comptroller; Ferraro denied that her endorsement was motivated by revenge against Holtzman, saying it was due to his liberal State Assembly voting record.|$|E
500|$|Chotiner had parted {{ways with}} Governor Warren, {{and the popular}} governor, who was running for a third term, [...] "wanted no part" [...] of the Nixon campaign.

Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to {{know who she was}} supporting for governor. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the election and the Democratic candidate [...] "close to collapse" [...] from the bitter campaign, she responded to the latest Holt needle with her [...] "hope and pray" [...] that Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt would be elected.

500|$|Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben (1551–1637) was a Protestant canoness at the cloister in Gerresheim, today a {{district}} of Düsseldorf. Her family was a cadet {{line of the}} old House of Mansfeld which, by the mid-16th century, had {{lost much of its}} affluence, but not its influence. The Mansfeld-Eisleben line retained significant authority in its district; several of Agnes' cousins and uncles had signed the Book of Concord, and the family exercised considerable influence in Reformation affairs. She had been raised in Eisleben, the town in which Martin Luther had been born. The family's estates were located in Saxony, but Agnes' sister lived in the city of Cologne, married to the Freiherr (or Baron), Peter von Kriechingen. Although a member of the Gerresheim cloister, Agnes was free during her <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> where she wished. Reports differ on how she came to Gebhard's notice. Some say he saw her on one of her visits to her sister in Cologne. Others claim he noticed her during a religious procession. Regardless, in late 1579or early 1580, she attracted Gebhard's notice. He sought her out, and they started a liaison. Two of her brothers, Ernst and Hoyer Christoph, soon visited Gebhard at the archbishop's residence to discuss a marriage. [...] "Gebhard's Catholic belief, which was by no means based on his innermost conviction, started to waver when he had to decide whether to renounce the bishop's mitre and stay faithful to the woman he loved, or to renounce his love and remain a member of the church hierarchy." [...] While he considered this, rumors of his possible conversion flew throughout the Electorate.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the loss}} of Zupano the French planned to {{reinforce}} their garrison on Mezzo, an island between Ragusa and Zupano.

The French retreated to a fortified castle on a hill, which the British then bombarded with a 12-pounder carronade they had brought {{from one of the}} ships. Harper had to leave for two <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Curzola. In his absence, Weazel's men established a battery of three brass guns on a point overlooking the castle. On 22 July, after his return, the British started firing on the castle. The French surrendered that afternoon. [...] The British captured five 9-pounder guns, a brass howitzer, munitions, and 59 men. The British freed their captives against their parole that they would not serve against the British until exchanged for an equal number of British prisoners. The capture of the island cost Saracen one man killed, and Weazle two men wounded.|$|E

We’ll beat England in that.” [...] Moschella returned to the shop and bought 38 of the shirts for the side to wear in the showdown versus England.
