5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, the match did not happen because Hogan changed <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> he was supposedly {{not happy with the}} planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> he {{became a symbol of}} World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E

5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker was hoping for, until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, and he has been communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> a dissociative disorder upon the aftermath of the white phosphorus strike. Rationalizing the actions he had witnessed and carried out, Walker distorted many subsequent events of the game to make Konrad look responsible. With this revelation, 'Konrad' forces Walker, at gunpoint, to decide once and for all if he is to blame for his actions in Dubai.|$|E

McLachlan therefore cost Costello his final opportunity to become Prime Minister.|$|E

The date of January 1980 was in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> a retirement date, however nothing had been made definite. It was during this time, due to a combination of a large parliamentary majority and the search for a new leader, when party discipline began to break down.|$|E

25|$|Biddle soon changed <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> he {{approved}} {{a modified version}} of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues discussed at Yalta. At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal. Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.|$|E
25|$|Once more Ibn Battuta {{returned}} to Tangier, but only stayed {{for a short}} while. In 1324, two years before {{his first visit to}} Cairo, the West African Malian Mansa, or king of kings, Musa had passed through the same city on his own hajj and caused a sensation with a display of extravagant riches brought from his gold-rich homeland. Although Ibn Battuta never mentioned this visit specifically, when he heard the story it may have planted a seed in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> he then decided to cross the Sahara and visit the Muslim kingdoms on its far side.|$|E

His victims, he stated to investigators, had lost any degree of humanity in his eyes once he had chosen to render them captive.|$|E

25|$|As {{his foot}} pressed the half-damp, half-dry seamosses matting the place, {{and a chance}} phantom cats-paw--an islet of breeze, unheralded, unfollowed--as this ghostly cats-paw came fanning his cheek; as his glance fell upon the row of small, round dead-lights--all closed like {{coppered}} eyes of the coffined--and the state-cabin door, once connecting with the gallery, even as the dead-:lights had once looked out upon it, but now calked fast like a sarcophagus lid; and to a purple-black, tarred-over panel, threshold, and post; and he bethought him of the time, when that state-cabin and this state-balcony had heard {{the voices of the}} Spanish king's officers, and the forms of the Lima viceroy's daughters had perhaps learned where he stood--as these and other images flitted through <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> the cats-paw through the calm, gradually he felt rising a dreamy inquietude, like that of one who alone on the prairie feels unrest from the repose of the moon.|$|E
25|$|Simeon was the {{returning}} officer {{for many of}} the early elections held in Canterbury. When it came to the election of the first Superintendent for the Canterbury Province, Simeon made the controversial decision of allowing Colonel James Campbell to stand for election, but declaring that should he be elected, he would not allow the election as Campbell was not on the Akaroa roll. In November 1852, Simeon announced his intention to stand in the first election for the New Zealand Parliament. In June 1853, he advertised that he had changed <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> his role as Resident Magistrate kept him too busy that he could leave the region for long periods attending Parliament in Auckland, and that he would stand for election in the Christchurch Country electorate for the Canterbury Provincial Council instead. He received the power from the Governor to appoint a deputy returning officer in case he wanted to stand in one of the elections himself. Five candidates stood for the four positions, and Simeon {{was at the top of}} the poll with 158 votes; the other successful candidates were Henry Tancred (154 votes), John Hall (151 votes), and Charles Bowen (132 votes). Simeon was the first Speaker of the Provincial Council from September 1853 to April 1855; he was succeeded in that role by Charles Bowen. He was a member of the Canterbury Executive Council from October 1853 to October 1854 and was the first Provincial Treasurer. During a day of low attendance in October 1854, Richard Packer secured a suspension of the council's standing orders, which allowed him to have the first two readings of a bill to enlarge the council's membership by 12 additional members passed. Whilst there was justification for such a measure due to the long session lengths, the Executive Council consisting of Henry Tancred, Henry Godfrey Gouland, Simeon, and William John Warburton Hamilton regarded the matter as a vote of no confidence and resigned. Simeon was a provincial councillor until his resignation on 5 September 1855 in preparation for returning to England. The resulting by-election was contested by three candidates and won by James Henry Moore.|$|E
500|$|In February 1996, Gardner {{threatened}} to sue to force the state of Utah to execute him by firing squad.

He said that he preferred the firing squad because of his [...] "Mormon heritage." [...] Gardner also felt that lawmakers were trying to eliminate the firing squad, in opposition to popular opinion in Utah, because of concern over the state's image in the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E

500|$|In July 738, {{at the age}} of 74, Nasr was {{appointed}} as governor of Khurasan. Despite his age, he was widely respected both for his military record, his knowledge of the affairs of Khurasan and his abilities as a statesman. Julius Wellhausen wrote of him that [...] "His age did not affect the freshness of <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> is testified not only by his deeds, but also by the verses in which he gave expression to his feelings till the very end of his life". However, in the climate of the times, his nomination owed more to his appropriate tribal affiliation than his personal qualities.|$|E

The landmark hundredth issue gave more detail on John Constantine's father, and the abusive relationship that they had shared. However, it is unclear as to whether this is happening in reality, or in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> John convalesces in a coma. [...] "Last Man Standing" [...] reveals that his friend Rich is the current descendant of King Arthur, and Merlin's attempt to discover God's secret, an act which would destroy England, using John's few remaining friends as bait.|$|E

Brigadier-General George Townshend wrote that [...] "by some intelligence the General had, he has changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> to the place he intended to land."

500|$|Washington, {{who was in}} 1789 {{elected the}} first president, resented Mason's strong stances against the {{ratification}} of the constitution, and these differences destroyed their friendship. Although some sources accept that Mason dined at Mount Vernon on November 2, 1788, Peter R. Henriques noted that Washington's diary states that Mr. George Mason was the guest, and as Washington, elsewhere in his diary, always referred to his former colleague at Philadelphia as Colonel Mason, the visitor was likely George Mason V, the son. Mason always wrote positively of Washington, and the president said nothing publicly, but in a letter referred to Mason as a [...] " [...] friend" [...] who would not recant {{his position on the}} constitution because [...] "pride on the one hand, and want of manly candour on the other, will not I am certain let him acknowledge error in his opinions respecting it [...] though conviction should flash on <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> strongly as a ray of light".

Mark had his [...] "work cut out for him" [...] as he began questioning the suspects, as they each pointed the finger at someone else. He also received conflicting information as everyone had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor revealed that Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) had given Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall) a false alibi, Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) points out that Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) earring was found {{at the crime scene}} and Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) did not help himself with his attitude towards the investigation. Of the case, McGregor said [...] "Brennan is {{in the thick of the}} investigation so it's pretty exciting, I've never had so much responsibility." [...] McGregor later explained that it had been [...] "great" [...] to be involved in the storyline, even though he did not share many scenes with Dennis, as he was in a hospital bed. Rebecca was revealed to have been the one who pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit. However, Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis. McGregor later said that his first week on Neighbours, filming the Who Pushed P.R? storyline, had stuck in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> there were many long interview scenes he had to get through.|$|E
