25|$|One of {{the main}} global risks posed by {{breastmilk}} specifically is the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases. Breastfeeding by an HIV-infected mother poses a 5–20% chance of transmitting HIV to the baby. However, if a mother has HIV, she {{is more likely to}} transmit it to her child during the pregnancy or birth than during breastfeeding. A 2012 study conducted by researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine showed reduced HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice, due to components in the breast milk. Cytomegalovirus infection poses potentially dangerous consequences for pre-term babies. Other risks include mother's infection with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 (viruses that could cause T-cell leukemia in the baby), herpes simplex when lesions are present on the breasts, and chickenpox in the newborn when the disease manifested in the mother within a few days of birth. In some cases these risks can be mitigated by using <b>heat-treated</b> <b>milk</b> and nursing for a briefer time (e.g. 6 months, rather than 18–24 months), and can be avoided by using an uninfected woman's milk, as via a wet-nurse or milk bank, or by using infant formula and/or treated milk.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} addresses nutritional {{and functional}} changes {{brought about by}} heat treatment of yogurt containing live cultures. Several lines of research evidence suggest that these products are not equivalent. Recent research shows that yogurt bacteria are able to survive passage through the human intestine. Yogurt containing viable starter cultures {{has been shown to}} improve lactose digestion in lactose-intolerant people; heat treatment of the product diminishes this improvement. There are indications for a role of live yogurt cultures in modulating the immune system of the consumer. Long-term consumption of live yogurt reduces nasal allergies, particularly in young adults, a reduction that is not observed any more after heat treatment. Studies in the growing pig, an accepted model for studying protein digestion in humans, show that nitrogen absorption from live yogurt is higher and more evenly distributed in time than nitrogen absorption from <b>heat-treated</b> fermented <b>milk.</b> Taken together, these findings indicate that heat treatment of yogurt results in relevant nutritional and functional changes which would challenge an assertion of their equivalency. Such differences should be reflected in naming of these products to avoid consumer confusion. Additional health benefits of yogurt include the release of bioactive peptides, impact on gut flora, alleviation of diarrhoea in children, immune system modulation, prevention of infections, inhibition of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, improved oral health and improved symptoms of collagen-induced arthritis.

The GABRIEL study was designed to investigate this hypothesis in a large population of European children, calling for a rapid alternative to classical culture techniques to determine bacteriological properties of milk samples. One objective was to evaluate 2 different rapid methods to determine bacteriological properties in a large number of cow milk samples collected under field conditions. BactoScan (Foss Analytical, Hillerod, Denmark), an automated standard flow cytometric method utilized for routine testing of milk quality, and TEMPO (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), an automated most-probable-number method, were used to assess the total viable bacterial count in farm and commercial milk samples. Both methods were compared with standard plate count method and each other. Measurements based on the TEMPO method were in good agreement with the standard plate count method and showed reliable results, whereas BactoScan results did not correlate with standard plate count measurements and yielded higher bacteria counts in <b>heat-treated</b> <b>milk</b> samples compared with raw milk samples. Most likely, these discrepant results were due to inferences with staining reactions and detection of bacteria in <b>heat-treated</b> <b>milk</b> samples. We conclude that, in contrast to the routinely used BactoScan method, the TEMPO method is an inexpensive and rapid alternative to standard culture methods suitable to assess total bacterial counts in processed and raw milk sample...|$|E

Therefore, the effects of high-temperature storage and heat treatment on skim milk of defined genetic variants of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) were measured. The samples had 45 % total solids, the temperature of aging was 50 °C, and the heat treatment was 90 °C for 10 min prior to evaporation.

The resulting supernatants (SPNTs 2) were analysed by OD (at 600 and 280 nm) and SDS-PAGE in order to characterise proteins still soluble as a function of pH. Particle size in SPNTs 1 was analysed by Steric Exclusion Chromatography. The OD 600 nm revealed that during acidification soluble casein in both control and heat-treated samples exhibits variations in its optical properties or size as previously shown with micellar casein. In heat-treated samples, soluble casein and heat-induced covalent soluble aggregates precipitate at the same pH value. A progressive acidification of the soluble phase did not separate them. Increasing the temperature of acidification from 20 to 38 °C resulted in an increase in the precipitation pH of the proteins. However choice of acidifier did not have a significant effect on OD profiles. The soluble covalent aggregates from mHtd 7 · 2 were smaller, more numerous, and had a higher content of κ-casein than mHtd 6 · 5. Both types of aggregates began to precipitate at the same pH value but precipitation occurred over a narrower pH-range for soluble aggregates prepared from mHtd 7 · 2.

40|$|Background: Up to 40 % of all mother-to-child {{transmission}} of HIVoccurs {{by means of}} breast-feeding; yet, in developing countries, infant formula {{may not be a}} safe option. The World Health Orga-nization recommends <b>heat-treated</b> breast <b>milk</b> as an infant-feeding alternative. We investigated the ability of a simple method, flash-heat, to inactivate HIV in breast milk from HIV-positive mothers. Methods: Ninety-eight breast milk samples, collected from 84 HIV-positive mothers in a periurban settlement in South Africa, were aliquoted to unheated control and flash-heating. Reverse transcriptase (RT) assays (lower detection limit of 400 HIV copies/mL) were per-formed to differentiate active versus inactivated cell-free HIV in unheated and flash-heated samples. Results: We found detectable HIV in breast milk samples from 31 % (26 of 84) of mothers. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed a statistically significant negative asso-ciation between detectable virus in breast milk and maternal CD 4 + T-lymphocyte count (P = 0. 045) and volume of breast milk expressed (P = 0. 01) and a positive association with use of multivitamins (P = 0. 03). All flash-heated samples showed undetectable levels of cell-free HIV- 1 as detected by the RT assay (P, 0. 00001). Conclusions: Flash-heat can inactivate HIV in naturally infected breast milk from HIV-positive women. Field studies are urgently needed to determine the feasibility of in-home flash-heating breast milk to improve infant health while reducing postnatal transmission of HIV in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of the Australian-grown &# 039;Wonderful&# 039; pomegranate juice (WPJ) including total phenolic compounds (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AA) were determined and compared with four different brands of imported pomegranate juices (IPJs). The TPC in WPJ {{was found to be}} 2, 400 ± 200 mg/L gallic acid equivalent (GAE) while in the IPJs it ranged from 1, 000 to 2, 800 mg/L GAE. The AA of WPJ was 11. 0 ± 1. 0 mM/L Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) while in IPJs it ranged from 5. 5 to 14. 5 mM/L TEAC. To facilitate consumer access to the health benefits of pomegranate, a probiotic product was developed from bovine milk supplemented with different levels of IPJ. Maximum IPJ supplementation level in <b>heat-treated</b> <b>milk</b> with no adverse effects on yogurt attributes was found to be 20 % (V/V), resulting in maximum TPC level of 731 ± 69 mg/L GAE in probiotic yoghurt...|$|E
40|$|Different protein {{aggregates}} including beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) {{were detected}} in the pH 4. 6 insoluble fraction recovered from actual <b>heat-treated</b> <b>milk</b> samples by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-beta-lg polyclonal antibodies was developed to analyze the beta-lg partition in the protein fractions obtained upon acidification of both milk and Mozzarella cheese at pH 4. 6. According to ELISA determinations, nearly 90 % of the pH 4. 6 soluble beta-lg included in raw milk {{was found in the}} pH 4. 6 insoluble fraction of ultrahigh temperature (UHT) -treated milk. As concerns Mozzarella cheese analysis, ELISA results indicated that about 36 % of the total beta-lg milk content was transferred from pasteurized milk to Mozzarella cheese, whereas less than 0. 5 % was transferred from raw milk. The pH 4. 6 insoluble beta-lg proved to be a suitable indicator of the intensity of the heat treatment applied to milk. The ELISA-based detection of this parameter was suggested for quality control of both drinking milk and raw milk cheese...|$|E
40|$|The dairy {{industry}} adds starter bacterial cultures to <b>heat-treated</b> <b>milk</b> {{to control the}} fermentation process during the manufacture of many cheeses. These highly concentrated bacterial populations are susceptible to virulent phages that are ubiquitous in cheese factories. In this study, the dissemination of these phages by the airborne route and their presence on working surfaces were investigated in a cheese factory. Several surfaces were swabbed, and five air samplers (polytetrafluoroethylene filter, polycarbonate filter, BioSampler, Coriolis cyclone sampler, and NIOSH two-stage cyclone bioaerosol personal sampler) were tested. Samples were then analyzed {{for the presence of}} two Lactococcus lactis phage groups (936 and c 2), and quantification was done by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Both lactococcal phage groups were found on most swabbed surfaces, while airborne phages were detected at concentrations of at least 103 genomes/m 3 of air. The NIOSH sampler had the highest rate of air samples with detectable levels of lactococcal phages. This study demonstrates that virulent phages can circulate through the air and that they are ubiquitous in cheese manufacturing facilities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} a reference method for the detection of cow milk in ewe and goat cheeses (EC 273 / 08) in order to protect manufacturers and consumers from adulterations and imitations, and to ensure alignment with the demands of domestic and EU markets. The method includes isolation of casein from cheese, isoelectric focusing of γ 2 - and γ 3 -casein originating from the hydrolysis of β-casein by plasmin, the detection and quantitative determination of γ-casein in cow, ewe and goat cheese by densitometry. Ewe or goat cheese products with a minimum of 1 % of cow milk are considered to be adulterated. For the quantitative determination of cow, ewe and goat milk in cheeses, standard mixtures of cow-ewe and cow-goat milk were made by adding 0; 0. 5; 1; 2; 5; 10; 25; 50; 75 and 100 % (v/v) of cow milk. The quantification was performed by determining the peak area ratio of cow γ-casein in comparison to ewe/goat casein in prepared standard cheeses. The calibration curves were calculated based on the relation of the peak area ratio of cow γ-caseins (calculated as the percentage of total γ-caseins) in contrast to the relative content (%) of cow milk in the mixture. The method proved to be adequate for the detection of raw and <b>heat-treated</b> cow <b>milk</b> in fresh and ripened cheeses made from ewe or goat milk, or a mixture of ewe and goat milk...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{freezing}} point (FP) {{was established in}} 48 bulk tank samples of raw and 48 samples of pasteu-rized goat milk that were collected {{in the course of}} lactation. Alongside, non-fat solids (NFS) content was moni-tored. Milk {{freezing point}} measurements were carried out using the thermistor cryoscope method in compliance with the standard CTS 570538 (1998). The mean freezing point of raw milk was found to be in an interval of – 0. 5513 ± 0. 0046 °C, variation ranged from – 0. 5466 °C to – 0. 5567 °C, with higher values in the spring months and a drop at the end of lactation. FP corresponded to the NFS content. The average freezing point of goat <b>milk</b> <b>heat-treated</b> on the farm to the temperature of 72 °C over a period of 20 s was – 0. 5488 ± 0. 0046 °C, pasteurisation brought an average increase in FP by 0. 0025 °C...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{importance}} of healthcare workers' guidance for women infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) regarding infant feeding practices cannot be overemphasised. ObjectiveTo determine the knowledge, opinions and practices of healthcare workers in maternity wards in a regional hospital in Bloemfontein, Free State Province, South Africa, regarding infant feeding {{in the context of}} HIV. MethodsFor this descriptive cross-sectional study, all the healthcare workers in the maternity wards of Pelonomi Regional Hospital who voluntarily gave their consent during the scheduled meetings (n =  64), were enrolled and handed over the self-administered questionnaires. ResultsOnly 14 % of the respondents considered themselves to be experts in HIV and infant feeding. Approximately 97 % felt that breastfeeding was an excellent feeding choice provided proper guidelines were followed. However, 10 % indicated that formula feeding is the safest feeding option. 45 % stated that <b>heat-treated</b> breast <b>milk</b> is a good infant feeding option; however, 29 % considered it a good infant feeding option but it requires too much work. Only 6 % could comprehensively explain the term “exclusive breastfeeding” as per World Health Organisation (WHO) definition. Confusion existed regarding the period for which an infant could be breastfed according to the newest WHO guidelines, with only 26 % providing the correct answer. Twenty per cent reported that no risk exists for HIV transmission via breastfeeding if all the necessary guidelines are followed. ConclusionHealthcare workers' knowledge did not conform favourably with the current WHO guidelines. These healthcare workers were actively involved in the care of patients in the maternity wards where HIV-infected mothers regularly seek counselling on infant feeding matters...|$|R
