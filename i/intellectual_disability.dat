40|$|Background: Transition to {{adulthood}} {{may be a}} period of vulnerability for health for individuals with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> No large-scale studies have compared the health of individuals with and without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> undergoing transition. The aims {{of this study were}} (1) to compare health during transition for individuals with and without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> across a whole country population and (2) to establish whether transition is associated with health in the population with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Methods: Data were drawn from Scotland's Census, 2011. Frequency data were calculated for young people with and without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Logistic regressions were used {{to determine the extent to}} which <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> account for seven health outcomes (general health, mental health, physical disabilities, hearing impairment, visual impairment, long-term illness and day-to-day activity limitations), adjusted for age and gender. Within the <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> population, logistic regressions were then used to determine whether age group (13 – 18 or 19 – 24 years) is associated with the seven health outcomes, adjusted by gender. Results: A total of 5556 / 815 889 young people aged 13 – 24 years had <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Those with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> were 9. 6 – 125. 0 times more likely to have poor health on the seven outcomes. Within the population with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> the 19 - to 24 -year-olds with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> were more likely to have mental health problems than the 13 - to 18 -year-olds, but did not have poorer health on the other outcomes. The difference between age groups for mental health problems was greater for young people who did not have <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> but their overall level of mental health problems was substantially lower than for the young people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Conclusions: This largest-to-date study quantifies the extent of the substantial health disparities experienced by young people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> compared with people without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The young population with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> have substantial health problems; therefore, transition between child and adult services must be carefully planned in order to ensure that existing health conditions are managed and emerging problems minimised...|$|R

40|$|Intimacy, {{partnership}} and parenthood {{of persons with}} moderate to severe and profound <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> is a topical area of their life, which despite increasing acceptance in society still pose many questions. This led us through a survey of Slovenian and foreing literature and research in this field. In the analysis, we focused on the sexual development of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> forms of sexual behavior of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> changes in sexual history taking {{in the world and}} in Slovenia, the right to intimacy, {{partnership and}} parenthood of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> on the ways and importance of information on intimacy, partnership and parenthood for people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> their parents and the wider area, and the views of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> their parents, professionals and the general public to intimacy, partnership and parenthood of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> After reviewing the literature we can conclude that Slovenia follows the changes in the acceptance of new views of intimacy and partnership, but there still remain pressing issues of marriage and parenthood of persons with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Younger generation of parents od persons with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> professionals and society are becoming more favorable at their intimacy and partnership. They improved the living conditions of persons with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> allowing more privacy and thus the realization of sexual desires in an acceptable manner.

40|$|This paper reviews {{research}} published since March 2002 {{that has}} addressed {{the situation of}} families with a person with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Such research is organized into research concerning families with a child with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> and families with an adult with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> including parents with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Trends in family research, including greater methodological diversity and an expanding conception of the family, are highlighted. Recent findings: Parents of children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> report relatively high levels of distress, {{with a wide range}} of child, parent, family and service support factors implicated in parental distress. However, many parents also report positive perceptions of their child with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Research with parents who themselves have <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> report very high levels of maternal distress, associated with a lack of social support. Methodologically, most studies are quantitative cross-sectional surveys using correlational analyses, with little consistency in measures or constructs across studies. However, increasing methodological diversity in family research is apparent. Summary: Research concerning families with people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> is gradually becoming more methodologically diverse and theoretically sophisticated, although more cooperation between research groups is required. Family research is also changing to reflect the changing status of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> in society, with expanding conceptions of family systems and increasing attempts to elicit the views of people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> on their perceptions of these family systems...|$|R
40|$|Background Research has {{established}} a clear relationship between life events and psychopathology amongst children generally, but this relationship has not been investigated in children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Methods A secondary analysis of data collected by the 1999 ONS survey of the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in Great Britain, investigating associations between adverse life events and psychopathology amongst 264 children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> and 10 040 children without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Results Children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{were more likely to}} experience a greater number and range of adverse life events than children without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> a difference partly accounted for by family poverty. For children with and without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities,</b> there were robust associations between several life events and child psychiatric disorders, most strongly emotional disorder. There also appeared to be a cumulative effect of life events on the psychopathology of children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Conclusions Adverse life events {{play an important role in}} the psychopathology of children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> and require further research attention.

5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or <b>intellectual</b> <b>disability</b> because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses.

In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder.

Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable <b>intellectual</b> <b>disability.</b> In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease.

RESULTS: Substance use was similar in prisoners with and without <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> in the year prior to their current prison terms. Prisoners with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> were much less likely to report that substance use was an antecedent to the offences leading to their imprisonment. The completion rate of alcohol and drug treatment programmes was much lower for those with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Substance use may be as common in prisoners with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> as those without this condition.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine (a) whether children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> have a theory of mind deficit relative to younger children of the same verbal mental age and (b) whether theory of mind in children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> is domain-specific or related to other general cognitive functions. A group of 15 children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> (mean age= 10; 0), 15 children of average intelligence (mean age= 10; 0) and 15 children of average intelligence (mean age= 6 : 0) matched on verbal mental age with the children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The children were given a series of theory of mind tasks. The children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> were significantly lower on theory of mind performance from the children of average intelligence of the same age, but not from the younger children of average intelligence matched for verbal mental age. This indicates that the children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> do not exhibit a theory of mind deficit relative to other children of the same verbal mental age. General cognitive functioning accounted for the difference between the groups and was significantly correlated with theory of mind performance in the group with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities.</b> It is concluded that children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> do not have a deficit in theory of mind relative to younger children of the same verbal mental age, and that theory of mind in children with <b>intellectual</b> <b>disabilities</b> is not domain-specific, but is related to verbal skills and general cognitive functioning...|$|R

5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR).

Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, <b>intellectual</b> <b>disability</b> in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable <b>intellectual</b> <b>disability,</b> a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world.
