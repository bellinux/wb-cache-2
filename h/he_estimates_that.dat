5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries {{to run away from}} any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises to the rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book <b>he</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E
25|$|During this period, he was incarcerated several times, {{but this}} did not stop him from working in several jobs while in prison. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> he spent some four {{years of his life}} behind bars. After being in and out of prison under {{political}} charges, Changmarín was finally exiled to Chile in 1968. While living there, he studied painting at the Universidad National de Chile and became very active in the Salvador Allende presidential campaign.|$|E
25|$|The book {{contains}} no references whatsoever, based alternately on alleged conversations with present-day cannibals, the eating of ape brain {{by the author}} and direct insight from deep meditation. Many parts have been deemed by some as being outright racist, particularly the photographic plates comparing various ethnic faces (primarily Arab and African) to apes. He says that blacks have smaller brains than whites and that contemporary cannibal tribes are seeking to remedy this discrepancy by consuming brains in a frantic attempt to catch up, though <b>he</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> it would take them roughly 100,000 years to do so.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjustment}} {{would therefore}} rationalise any {{search for the}} city in search engines, since Foz do Iguaçu's claim to fame worldwide is due almost entirely to the falls, which are known as the Iguassu Falls. Djalma Pastorello felt that tourism {{to the city of}} Foz do Iguaçu would be improved greatly by a clarification of its association with the now-famous Iguassu Falls. However, <b>he</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> 70% of the city's population were against the name change because the local media anticipated the change and presented it in a distorted way, so that locals were unable to see that the intention was to benefit the population.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} stock market {{indicators}} in the United States {{and other countries}} provide {{an indication of the}} market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds. The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{groups were}} {{the target of}} {{systematic}} and enduring military actions from fully armed regular troops of the Securitate. The strength of the Securitate troops could vary from platoon to battalion up to regiment, including armoured vehicles, artillery and occasionally even aviation. The insurgent groups sustained losses consisting of dead and wounded captured by the Securitate. They also fell victim to treason from supporters or infiltrated persons, which led to losses and captures. Gavrilă-Ogoranu claims {{that some of the}} arrested rebels and their supporters were killed during interrogation, while other members of resistance groups were indicted in public or secret trials, and sentenced to death or prison. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> several thousands of convictions were imposed. Death penalties were carried out either secretly, with bodies thrown into unknown common graves, or publicly in order to intimidate the local population. A significant number of detained rebels, who had not been sentenced to death, were killed outside prisons, under unexplained circumstances. In areas where the rebels were active, the population underwent systematic intimidation and terror from the authorities.|$|E

25|$|According to Efraim Karsh, {{before the}} {{fighting}} started, the IDF used loudspeakers broadcasting in Arabic {{to urge the}} locals to evacuate the camp, and <b>he</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> some 11,000 left. Stephanie Gutmann {{also noted that the}} IDF used bullhorns and announcements in Arabic to inform the residents of the invasion, and that the troops massed outside the camp for a day because of rain. She estimated that 1,200 remained in the camp, but {{that it was impossible to}} tell how many of them were fighters. After the battle, Israeli intelligence estimated that half the population of noncombatants had left before the invasion, and 90% had done so by the third day, leaving around 1,300 people. Others estimated that 4,000 people had remained in the camp. Some camp residents reported hearing the Israeli calls to evacuate, while others said they did not. Many thousands did leave the camp, with women and children usually permitted to move into the villages in the surrounding hills or the neighbouring city. However, the men who left were almost all temporarily detained. Instructed by Israeli soldiers to strip before they were taken away, journalists who entered Jenin following the invasion remarked that heaps of discarded clothing in the ruined streets showed where they were taken into custody.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Soule {{composed}} {{music for}} the first Guild Wars title, and would ultimately go on to compose music for all expansions for the first game, {{as well as the}} soundtrack for Guild Wars 2. Soule also uses DirectSong to sell [...] "expansion packs" [...] of music for games such as Guild Wars that can be played in game {{like the rest of the}} soundtrack. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> at least 10% of the players of Guild Wars have bought his musical expansion for the game, Battle Pak 1. Soule also worked on another of Chris Taylor's real-time strategy titles in 2007, with the launch of Supreme Commander.|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} pop album to be {{mastered}} without the momentary gaps that are typically placed between tracks {{as a point of}} demarcation. It made use of two crossfades that blended songs together, giving the impression of a continuous live performance. Although both stereo and monaural mixes of the album were prepared, the Beatles were minimally involved in what they regarded as the less important stereo mix sessions, leaving the task to Martin and Emerick. Emerick recalls: [...] "We spent three weeks on the mono mixes and maybe three days on the stereo." [...] <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> they spent 700 hours on the LP, more than 30 times that of the first Beatles album, Please Please Me, which cost £400 to produce. The final cost of Sgt. Pepper was approximately £25,000. The album was completed on 21 April 1967 with the recording of random noises and voices that were included on the run-out groove along with a high-pitched tone, inaudible to human ears, that could be heard by dogs.|$|E

500|$|Parcells instituted {{numerous}} changes {{before the}} 1984 season. He changed {{half of the}} roster, getting rid of players he deemed problematic, overhauled the team's strength training program, and trained the players harder {{to make them more}} resistant to injury. The Giants had a problem with player abusing drugs in the early 1980s, and Parcells decided he had to take a stand. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> he released 20–30 players due to drug use in his first three years as head coach, some after giving them second chances. He would often call their mothers to tell them of the players habits in an attempt to get them off drugs, and several times he recounts crying along with players as he released them. Simms won the starting job back for the season, and Brunner was released. Parcells announced the decision by saying, [...] "e gives us our best chance to win right now." [...] Simms responded by throwing for 4,044 yards, making him the first Giant to reach 4,000yards passing in a season. The Giants had a resurgent season, highlighted by a midseason stretch where they won five of six against opponents such as the defending conference champion Redskins, the Dallas Cowboys and their new co–tenants at Giants Stadium, the Jets. With two games left the Giants had a 9–5 record and a chance to win their first divisional title in 21 years. Yet {{despite the fact that they}} lost those final two games to finish 9–7, the Giants still made the playoffs as a Wild Card. In the first round, they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16-13 in Anaheim before losing, 21–10, to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. Standout performers included Rob Carpenter and Joe Morris, who split running back duties, combining for over 1,300yards and 11 touchdowns. Four receivers had over 30 catches on the year, including tight end Zeke Mowatt and receiver Bobby Johnson who tied for the team lead with 48 catches each. Phil McConkey returned punts and kickoffs. Parcells installed five new starters on defense, including Leonard Marshall at defensive end and Jim Burt at nose tackle, and the team's first round pick was used to draft Michigan State linebacker Carl Banks, who would become a key member of the Giants' linebacking corps for the next several seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Former pitcher Tom House, {{drafted in}} 1967 and active in MLB from 1971-1978, has {{admitted}} to using [...] "steroids they wouldn't give to horses" [...] during his playing career. According to House, {{the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs was widespread at that time. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> [...] "six or seven" [...] pitchers on every team were at least experimental users of steroids or human growth hormone, and says that after losses, players would frequently joke that they'd been [...] "out-milligrammed" [...] rather than beaten.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the whole}} of the period between 1914 and 1922 and for {{the whole of}} Anatolia, there are {{academic}} estimates of death toll ranging from 289,000 to 750,000. The figure of 750,000 is suggested by political scientist Adam Jones. Scholar Rudolph Rummel compiled various figures from several studies to estimate lower and higher bounds for the death toll between 1914 and 1923. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> 384,000 Greeks were exterminated from 1914 to 1918, and 264,000 from 1920 to 1922.

2500|$|According to {{anthropologist}} Scott Atran, {{the influence}} of the Muslim Brotherhood even in Egypt has been overstated by Western commentators. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> it can count on only 100,000 militants (out of some 600,000 dues paying members) in a population of more than 80million, and that such support as it does have among Egyptians—an often cited figure is 20 percent to 30 percent—is less a matter of true attachment than an accident of circumstance: secular opposition groups that might have countered it were suppressed for many decades, but in driving the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, a more youthful constellation of secular movements has emerged to threaten the Muslim Brotherhood's dominance of the political opposition. This has not yet been the case, however, as evidenced by the Brotherhood's strong showing in national elections. Polls also indicate that a majority of Egyptians and other Arab nations endorse laws based on [...] "Sharia".|$|E
2500|$|Result (23) {{also leads}} to some {{understanding}} {{of what happens when}} atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the band-structure is no longer free-electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the surface barrier, and also the electron wave-functions at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor , the prefactor P, and (to a limited extent) the correction factor λ'd. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter DF and (to a limited extent) the parameter dF. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point [...] "F" [...] may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor λB into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: <b>he</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range 0.01<λB<10.|$|E
2500|$|Another issue {{can arise}} {{in regard to}} the capital-labor ratio in the global population. Freeman (2010) holds that the new {{entrants}} to the global workforce since the 1980s brought little capital with them, either because they were poor or because the capital they had was of little economic value. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> the entry of China, India and the Eastern Bloc into the global economy cut the global capital-labor ratio to around 55–60% of what it otherwise would have been. The capital-labor ratio, according to Freeman, is a critical determinant of the wages paid to workers and of the returns to capital. The more capital each worker has, the higher will be their productivity and pay. Even considering the high savings rate of new entrants—he cites World Bank estimates that China has a savings rate of 40% of GDP—he estimates it would take 30 or so years for the world to re-attain the capital-labor ratio among the countries that had previously made up the global economy. [...] This, along with the effects of the Great Recession, could mean that downward pressure on wages and compensation, particularly in more advanced economies, will continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E
