40|$|Abstract—Noise has {{adverse effect}} on human health and comfort. Noise not only cause hearing impairment, but it also acts as a causal factor for stress and raising {{systolic}} pressure. Additionally {{it can be a}} causal factor in work accidents, both by marking <b>hazards</b> and <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> and by impeding concentration. Industry workers also suffer psychological and physical stress as well as hearing loss due to industrial noise. This paper proposes an approach to enable engineers to point out quantitatively the noisiest source for modification, while multiple machines are operating simultaneously. The model with the point source and spherical radiation in a free field was adopted to formulate the problem. The procedure works very well in ideal cases (point source and free field). However, most of the industrial noise problems are {{complicated by the fact that}} the noise is confined in a room. Reflections from the walls, floor, ceiling, and equipment in a room create a reverberant sound field that alters th...|$|R

As the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> used {{by the majority of}} LDW systems are disliked by drivers, most effort was put in the design of haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The iterative design process resulted in two different haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> displayed through vibration motors in the seat: a 2 ̆ 2 blinking 2 ̆ 2 signal for Medium Criticality departures and a continuously vibrating signal for High Criticality departures.

40|$|The {{potential}} use of non-visual <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> {{to present}} spatial information to car drivers {{has been successfully}} demonstrated in several recent studies (Ho & Spence, submitted, in preparation; Ho, Tan, & Spence, submitted). Among {{the three types of}} spatial <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> investigated (namely auditory, visual, and vibrotactile), spatial vibrotactile cues were found to be particularly effective in directing a driver’s visual spatial attention to potentially dangerous events on the road. We conducted the present study in order to examine the factors governing the relative effectiveness of auditory, visual, and vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The speeded discrimination of <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> presented in the various different modalities was investigated in order to explore whether the differences found in our previous research were a result of the relative speed with which people can detect <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> presented in a given modality, or whether they were attributable to differences in the efficacy with which people can relate the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> to the subsequent visually-specified target driving events. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect that an auditory collision <b>warning</b> <b>signal's</b> pulse rate, pulse pattern, and onset distance had on subject braking responses in a simulated crane/overhead power line collision scenario. The experimental <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> alerted subjects of their proximity to overhead power lines. The experimental taks required subjects to monitor a simulated auditory collision <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> while simultaneously operating a single-axis driving simulation task. The driving task simulated an actual crane operator's mental workload required to navigate a crane and manipulate various loads. Subjects were required to initiate braking responses {{based on the information}} conveyed solely through the auditory collision warning system. No visual information was provided to the subjects to isolate the effects of the <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> Subjective ratings of the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were obtained to compare subjects'actual performance using the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> versus their subjective preferences. Results indicate that subjects were able to initiate appropriate braking responses while using an auditory collision <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> with moderate onset distances and low pulse rates. The auditory pulse pattern did not have a large impact on subjects'braking responses except at extremely short onset distances. Overall, it was concluded that a pulsing auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> comprised of a moderate onset distance and low pulse rate could work effectively as a proximity warning device for mobile cranes. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} series of three {{experiments}} designed to assess the relative speed with which people can initiate speeded head-orienting responses following the presentation of spatial <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> Background: Recent cognitive neuroscience findings have shown that the human brain tends to treat stimuli occurring in peripersonal space as being somehow more behaviorally relevant and attention demanding than stimuli occurring in extrapersonal space. These brain mechanisms may be exploited in the design of <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> Method: Experiment 1 assessed the effectiveness of various different unisensory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in eliciting a head-turning response to look at the potential source of danger requiring participants' immediate attention; Experiment 2 assessed the latency of a driver's responses to events occurring in the cued direction; Experiment 3 assessed the relative effectiveness of various <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in reorienting a person's gaze back to a central driving task while he or she was distracted by a secondary task. Results: The results show that participants initiated head-turning movements and made speeded discrimination or braking responses significantly more rapidly following the presentation of a close rear auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> than following the presentation of either a far frontal auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> a vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> presented to their waist, or a peripheral visual <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> Conclusion: These results support the claim that the introduction of peripersonal <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> results in a significant performance advantage relative to traditionally designed warnings.

40|$|Abstract Aposematic organisms have <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> {{advertising}} their unpalatability to predators, {{and because}} signal efficiency is better in higher densities, positive frequency-dependent selection {{is expected to}} select against less common signals. The wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) occurs across the Holarctic and its conspicuous hindwings serve as <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> to predators.

We placed artificial moths with both local dominant and foreign forewing patterns in each of the two regions to test if predators select against the foreign forewing types, which would suggest the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> function of forewing patters.

The present study conducted six experiments to understand the cause of these conflicting findings.
