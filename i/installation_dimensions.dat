50|$|When the radial {{air-cooled}} engine was first introduced, the engine cylinders were cooled by exposing {{them to the}} air stream. In 1929 the NACA reported the results of some tests in which the cylinders were enclosed by a sheet-metal ring or cowling, which {{became known as the}} NACA cowling. This cowling reduced the drag of the radial engine to less than 20% of its original value and gave sufficient cooling for flight operation. In order to improve the cooling available with this cowling, deflectors or baffles were used to guide the airflow close to the cylinders. With the combination of baffles and cowling, a large gain over the exposed engine in both cooling and drag was realized. At that stage of development, cut-and-try methods were largely used in cowling design. Often a supposed improvement in design resulted in a decrease in performance and cooling. In 1935 NACA mounted a comprehensive investigation of the cowling and cooling problem, the general purpose of which was to furnish data on the physical functioning of the propeller-nacelle-cowling unit under varied flight conditions. The information obtained embodies the detailed principles ofoperation. If a complete understanding of the cowling and cooling problem is obtained, determining the <b>installation</b> <b>dimensions</b> becomes simple. Since an airplane designer has neither the time nor the opportunity to acquire a detailed knowledge of every part of the airplane, he wants a simple method of obtaining the optimum cowling dimensions, and some of the more important reasons for selecting these dimensions. It is the purpose of this report to present such a method and to illustrate the method by working a few examples.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{consideration}} of environmental constraints in production, transport {{and distribution of}} cold energy resulted in reconsidering the practices of <b>installations</b> <b>dimensioning</b> in particular. Their containment {{led to the development}} of secondary refrigerants such as ice slurries to store, transport and distribute the cold energy. These heat transfer fluids should have good thermophysical properties, giving high transport capability, high heat transfer ability as well as low pressure drops. The use of ice slurries can lead to lower flow rates and smaller pumping power compared to single phase fluid. The purpose of the presented work is to study the distribution network of indirect cold systems thanks to a model allowing the evaluation of the influence of various parameters on the operating behaviour of the installation. The available domain for the use of secondary heat transfer fluid (whether in their single phase or two phase form) is determined considering the best design from an energetic point of view. Because of the essential role of the fluid distribution between the production site and consumers, we focus our study on pressure drops and pumping power due to the fluid flow in cooling loops. For each investigated case, the minimum consumption power is obtained with the two phases (solid-liquid) heat transfer fluid (ice slurry) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the reflectivity of light on concrete and asphalt pavement systems. In 1983, the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) published the first recommended practice (RP- 8) for the design of roadway and parking lot lighting. This design method implemented empirically tested factors which were defined as the “reduced luminance coefficients” or the R-Tables. The R-Tables are essential for proper design of light pole <b>installation</b> <b>dimensions,</b> required power, and the distribution of light. The originally tested pavements are not necessarily representative of modern pavement materials used today. Moreover, recent Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are a relatively new light technology consistently implemented in roadway and parking lot design. Therefore, the objective of this research is to reevaluate the reflectiveness of two pavement systems. The reflective properties of each pavements were evaluated considering angles (β and γ) of illuminated light from each varied light source (i. e., incandescent and LED). Research findings concluded that modern concrete pavement is up to 3 times more reflective than modern asphalt pavement. Furthermore, this research also indicates that the angular light reflectivity is not only influenced by the pavement system but also the light source being used to illuminate that surface with respect to varied (α, β, and γ) angles...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{methodology}} of the dynamic optimum design of the one translational and three rotational degrees of freedom parallel robots while considering the rigid-body dynamic property. The dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU (underlined P denotes an active prismatic joint driven by a servomotor) parallel robot is presented while considering the constraints on the <b>installation</b> <b>dimension,</b> joint rotation angle, and the interference. The maximum driving torque and the maximum driving power of the actuating joints are taken as the objective functions in the dynamic optimum design, respectively. The physical meanings of the objective functions are the maximum driving torque and the maximum driving power of the actuating joints when the moving platform translates along the z-axis in the maximum linear acceleration amax, rotates about an arbitrary axis in the maximum angular acceleration αmax, translates along the z-axis in the maximum linear velocity vmax, and rotates about an arbitrary axis in the maximum angular velocity ωmax at the same time. The object of the dynamic optimum design is to minimize the maximum driving torque or the maximum driving power by employing worst case criterion. In the predefined design task, {{the results of the}} dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU parallel robot are the same when taking the maximum driving torque and the maximum driving power as the objective functions. The phenomenon can be verified {{by the fact that the}} distributions of the maximum driving torque and the maximum driving power are very similar to each other. The robot dimension has also been taken into account in the dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU parallel robot due to the consideration of the building cost and the miniaturization.

40|$|A suction caisson is an upturned ‘bucket’ of {{cylindrical}} shape {{made from}} steel. This type of foundation {{has been very}} popular in {{the oil and gas}} industry and the current trend is to extend its use to offshore wind farms. Seepage conditions play a pivotal role in suction caisson installation process in sand. Pressure gradients generated by imposed suction inside the caisson cavity cause an overall reduction in the soil resistance around the caisson wall and tip. This transient soil loosening around the caisson wall helps caisson penetration into the seabed. In this paper, we present a study of the role of seepage on the suction caisson installation process in homogenous sand. We also investigate the effects of seepage conditions on soil resistance to caisson penetration with a particular focus on how frictional and tip resistances are differently affected. For this purpose, a series of numerical models are developed using FLAC 3 D. These models are used to investigate the variation of suction pressure during caisson installation in homogenous sand and to predict the amount of suction required to penetrate the caisson to a certain depth. An explicit strategy is used for each embedment depth, which consists of updating current suction based on displacement history available after the previous prescribed displacement increment. The numerical models are developed for different caisson sizes and wall thicknesses to study the effects of caisson geometry on soil resistance during caisson <b>installation.</b> Problem <b>dimensions</b> are normalised with respect to the diameter of the caisson in order to obtain the results that can be applied to any caisson size. The results showed that suction pressure tends to increase with the embedment depth. Additionally, the overall behaviour and the pressure variation with depth are similar for caissons of different sizes and wall thicknesses. Finally, in order to validate the developed numerical models, data from centrifuge tests are investigated and compared with the results obtained from this study. The developed finite difference models are found to be in good agreement with centrifuge tests, in particular for thicker caissons (t/D = 1 %) ...|$|R

Thereforeongoing projects have been analyzed. The purpose was to determine achieved energy efficiency, costs and profitability for the studied projects. It was concluded that the Energy Collaboration {{is a good way}} of selling energy efficiency services, since the customer takes no risk and energy savings of about 15 - 25 % can be achieved with simple measures. ÅF’s costs for binding capital in projects were calculated and the result showed that it is possible for ÅF to use this concept and still make a good profit. However, {{it is important not to}} run too many measures at the same time, since it will result in lower profitability for ÅF. The thesis did also include two studies of energy efficient measures. The first one dealt with how to install an air/water heat pump to lower a building’s use of energy. This was carried out through simulation. Therefore, a code in MATLAB was written for this purpose, and this model was used to evaluate the potential energy savings from the heat pump <b>installation.</b> An existing <b>dimensioning</b> program from NIBE was also used for comparison.

The second study was about presence control of lighting in a museum that was part of an ongoing Energy Collaboration. The study was done mostly in theory, except foran inventory of the current building, and potential energy efficiency and costs were calculated. The results showed that it is profitable to realize this measure in the Energy Collaboration, and the most profitable solution is to wait for all the older measures to be paid off before the presence control installation is carried out...|$|R
40|$|This project focusses on {{the study}} of the energy {{efficiency}} in production machines. The main objectives that we seek with the project are: 	Developing an energy monitoring system 	Making a guideline for the design, maintenance and modification of energy efficient equipment or machines, based on our measurement results. The first step is to make a test installation to measure the efficiency of the motor. Afterwards the efficiency of this engine in combination with a gearbox, a pump and a compressor installation are measured. The test installation has to be built with a 4 KW electrical engine, but it must also be valid for other engines. Therefore the design should allow the regulation of the elements that compose the test stand due to the difference in dimensions between the different electrical motors. My goal with this project is to design, calculate and prepare the different test installations in accordance with the machine directives and the related norms. On the one hand we have to choose the necessary equipment following my own design and doing the necessary calculations, {{and on the other hand}} deal with companies in order to get the best offers for our tests. In the first test installation all the technical data we need are measured and the efficiency of the engine showing the results in an ISO efficiency graph is calculated. The next step includes showing the behaviour of the engine when we use it in a pump- or compressor installation and measuring the efficiency of the installation in different conditions (with misalignment, dirty filter, bad settings, over-dimensioning, etc.).

Attracted feels the viewer of isolated objects that float at first glance before monochrome black background. If it occurs closer to the work in order to study the detailed, sometimes mysterious entity reveals itself dimly suspected drawing in black of the background. We look to the very dark former context, which now alone made ​​and modified pixels. We guess masterpieces of art history. The great arc of modern times to present day we find so exciting disparate artists such as Piero della Francesca, Jacques Louis David, Luis Melendez, Fritz Radziwill, Richard Oelze or Georgia O'Keeffe combined in a topical collection. To the same extent as Brög moves an object in an independent composition into the light, he makes us curious about what happens in the dark, and challenges our memory and our imagination. Brög confronts us with the simultaneity of two image planes and presents us with the problem to synchronize them. He gives us the opportunity to see a new image, to lead us in the next moment in the seemingly familiar terrain of art history. An obviously targeted activated sliding and jumping our impression and our reflection, we already know from other work Brögs.

A common feature of the artworks clarity, conciseness and simplicity of the approach. The method of isolation, can be mentally as fruitful project to the group of Show rooms, conversely, the gesture of pointing for the insulation is essential. In a striking way, both fields of work thematize the surrounding space and our perception of it. Address the insulation memory and loss by floating, usually identifiable objects / objects they point to the first view in the empty space in front of a barely legible origin, the Show premises rather activate our imagination and speak to our structuring, rhythmisierendes perception...|$|R
40|$|Os métodos geofísicos constituem um conjunto de várias ferramentas de investigação, com características específicas e com aplicação, em especial, no estudo de áreas submersas, tendo em vista a inacessibilidade as estes ambientes pelos métodos convencionais. Entretanto, sua aplicação nem sempre traz os resultados esperados e assim, o objetivo {{principal}} deste estudo é discutir e avaliar a aplicabilidade dos métodos geofísicos, com ênfase nos métodos sísmicos, em estudos de áreas submersas rasas: plataforma continental interna, áreas costeiras, rios, lagos e reservatórios. O estabelecimento de critérios que auxiliem a escolha do método geofísico mais adequado para a melhor solução ao problema geológico ou geotécnico colocado, visa, entre outros aspectos, contribuir para a mitigação dos problemas, principalmente ambientais, causados pela atividade antrópica concentrada nestes ambientes e ampliar o conhecimento geológico básico, propiciando deste modo intervenções sustentadas nestes complexos ambientes. Geophysical methods {{consist of}} a series of investigation tools with specific features that are critical to the study of water-covered areas, since these environments cannot be reached with conventional methods. However, sometimes these applications fail to provide the expected results. The objective {{of this study is to}} discuss and assess the applicability of geophysical methods by focusing on seismic methods in studies conducted in shallow water-covered areas: inner continental shelves, coastal areas, rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Criteria to help to select the most appropriate geophysical method to solve geological or geotechnical issues must be established to minimize problems, particularly environmental problems caused by concentrated anthropic activity, and to expand basic geological knowledge to allow for sustained interventions in these complex environments. This study is based on extensive bibliographic research and on several projects developed by IPT (Institute for Technological Research of São Paulo State) and by IOUSP (Oceanography Institute of the University of São Paulo), in addition to partnerships with private companies and other institutes in Brazil that address this field of knowledge. The focus on shallow waters was driven by the lack of systematic data and the demand for geological and geotechnical knowledge in these areas, due to the concentration, in these sectors, of the main economic activities of our current society: projects to build or reassess port <b>dimensions,</b> <b>installation</b> of moles, ducts, marinas, bridges, tunnels, fishing activities, beach regeneration, mineral prospecting, waterways, dredging, installation of reservoirs for water storage or flood containment, and reservoir silting. In any of these topics, basic geological knowledge of the bottom and subbottom of water-covered areas is essential to ensure the ventures success. Considering this, geophysical methods, particularly seismic ones, are investigation tools that effectively contribute to generate new information, and are the only set of tools available to quickly and objectively provide enough data to improve the geological understanding of the area under investigation. The result of this study includes a discussion on the feasibility of the methodologies recommended, based on an extensive survey conducted in 2005 / 2006 on the availability of geophysical equipment in research institutes and private companies in Brazil...|$|R
