40|$|The {{importance}} of network ties is {{emphasized in the}} current literature on opportunity recognition. However, {{it is unclear how}} firms with limited bridging networks, such as family SMEs, recognize international opportunities through their network ties. In this case study we found that in gaining foreign market entry, those family SMEs that lack existing network ties recognize opportunities through weak ties formed in international exhibitions. The findings also indicate that rather than being proactive, family SMEs respond reactively to opportunities that emerge coincidentally. The trustfulness of the tie is important when they consider these opportunities and form new ties for internationalization. The nature of the cooperator appears to be more important than the target country. From these findings we develop five propositions that are intended to lead to further studies on this topic. Research highlights Our findings indicate that in family SMEs, <b>intermediary</b> <b>network</b> ties are a more important source of international opportunity recognition than they are in other types of firm. These <b>intermediary</b> <b>network</b> ties are most often mediated by international trade exhibitions. Interestingly, informal ties with family members do not generally help in the international opportunity recognition of family SMEs. In this regard, we observe a contrast with the knowledge-intensive SMEs where existing network ties had a more significant role in their international opportunity recognition. It seems that in family SMEs, international opportunities are more often recognized through weak ties than is the case in other types of firm. Furthermore, in family SMEs, more time resources are dedicated to the rapid development of new weak ties into strong ties than is the case in other types of firm. In family SMEs, foreign market selection is more related to reactiveness and less to proactive opportunity-seeking with a particular foreign market in mind.

40|$|Innovation is an {{interactive}} learning process {{which is of}} special interest for emerging technologies in which complex complementary knowledge from heterogeneous stakeholders is combined.

Although the importance of interactive learning is widely acknowledged, an adequate framework for studying interactive learning processes in emerging technologies is still missing. Therefore we formulated the leading research question: How to understand and conceptualize interactive learning in the context of emerging technologies? We did not only take the outcome of interactive learning into account, but also focused on opening the black box of the interactive learning process. We developed a framework based on characteristic elements of the interactive learning process in emerging technologies (i. e. prime mover, <b>intermediaries,</b> <b>network</b> formation and knowledge flows), influencing conditions (geographical, cognitive, regulatory, cultural and organisational proximity), and the outcome of the interactive learning process (single-loop and double-loop, tacit and codified knowledge).

We found an emerged asymmetric threshold of epidemic on VTN, in which local proliferation within nodes plays a more critical role than global diffusion in spreading of EHEC-like diseases, i. e. sufficient local proliferation is the precondition for global diffusion. We also found that a strong modularity on VTN structure, which restricts the spreading of EHEC-like diseases; however, within the communities, the diffusion is quick and easy.

40|$|Recently, the Internet {{has become}} a popular {{platform}} for the delivery of multimedia content. However, its best effort delivery approach is ill-suited to guarantee the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of many existing multimedia services, which results in a significant reduction of the Quality of Experience. This paper presents a solution to these problems, {{in the form of}} a framework for dynamically setting up federations between the stakeholders involved in the content delivery chain. More specifically, the framework provides an automated mechanism to set up end-to-end delivery paths from the content provider to the access Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which act as its direct customers and represent a group of end-users. Driven by Service Level Agreements (SLAs), QoS contracts are automatically negotiated between the content provider, the access ISPs, and the <b>intermediary</b> <b>network</b> domains along the delivery paths. These contracts capture the delivered QoS and resource reservation costs, which are subsequently used in the price negotiations between content provider and access ISPs. Additionally, it supports the inclusion of cloud providers within the federations, supporting on-the-fly allocation of computational and storage resources. This allows the automatic deployment and configuration of proxy caches along the delivery paths, which potentially reduce delivery costs and increase delivered quality...|$|E

The net group or organization is however an unstable one with many sites closing down or becoming inactive while others emerge. One key element for the success of a website can be the creation of a virtual “community ” of users and this, in turn, is often fostered through provision for users to communicate with each other through a bulletin board system (BBS) provided by the website. This paper looks at a popular, frequently accessed website founded by a voluntary site-owner and examines how the administrator approached problems as they arose. As the BBS is not an official fan site it is necessary for the administrator to enforce rules frequently and strictly and to act as an <b>intermediary.</b> <b>Network</b> communities can be divided into two types: weak-tied forums (Type F) or strong-tied dialogs (Type D). Paradoxically, although the policy of the administrator is to strongly guide this site towards an F-type, when D-type discussion did appear, with the administrator and participants ’ refraining from stifling this, the level of discussion was of a higher quality than that usually in the BBS. Though the inherently anonymous and open nature of the network makes it vulnerable, this touchy dynamism has been making the BBS remain popular and enjoyable for its participants...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the Internet {{has become}} a popular {{platform}} for the delivery of multimedia content. Currently, multimedia services are either offered by Over-the-top (OTT) providers or by access ISPs over a managed IP network. As OTT providers offer their content across the best-effort Internet, they cannot offer any Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to their users. On the other hand, users of managed multimedia services are limited to the relatively small selection of content offered by their own ISP. This article presents a framework that combines the advantages of both existing approaches, by dynamically setting up federations between the stakeholders involved in the content delivery process. Specifically, the framework provides an automated mechanism to set up end-to-end federations for QoS-aware delivery of multimedia content across the Internet. QoS contracts are automatically negotiated between the content provider, its customers, and the <b>intermediary</b> <b>network</b> domains. Additionally, a federated resource reservation algorithm is presented, which allows the framework to identify the optimal set of stakeholders and resources to include within a federation. Its goal is to minimize delivery costs for the content provider, while satisfying customer QoS requirements. Moreover, the presented framework allows intermediary storage sites {{to be included in}} these federations, supporting on-the-fly deployment of content caches along the delivery paths. The algorithm was thoroughly evaluated in order to validate our approach and assess the merits of including intermediary storage sites.

Triple helix intermediation is, thus, generally intended to ‘reduce search costs and bargaining costs for the firms and universities that are seeking collaboration partners’ (Kodama 2008 : 1226; see also Todeva (2013 : 263)) and to mitigate overall uncertainty about the profitability of collaboration (see Hoppe and Ozdenoren (2005)). Accordingly, the underutilization of advance legal planning tools in, and the resultant under-institutionalisation of, triple helix intermediation must be regarded as both costly and inefficient—in particular, when the specific triple-helix project in question ultimately and prematurely fails. In every real-world triple helix network, there will come a juncture where inter-helical ties thicken and organisational complexity increases, where the distribution of future innovation gains from network activity (and, therefore, the prior individual investment of non-shared productive resources by each helix in support of such activity) begins to matter to network participants, and where, in result, any heretofore decentralised, ad hoc and diffuse network activity begins to require a certain, additional degree of permanent and systematic coordination, centralisation and control in its deployment of scarce network and network-participant resources (Etzkowitz 2003 a; see also Etzkowitz (2002); Todeva (2014)). Such coordination, centralisation and control functions by an <b>intermediary</b> <b>network</b> hub necessitate both planning and conscious ‘interjection’. For example, cooperative research centres (CRCs) ‘that bring together universities, industries and government agencies {{in the context of}} strictly commercial research’ (Tuunainen 2005 b; see also Fernández-Esquinas et al.

And their functional and organisational interjection among and between the university-industry-government helices should be carefully planned and executed—in particular, through (i) the legal institution of a CRC entity (or of multiple entities, as the case may require) separate from the sponsoring helices and (ii) the advance legal ordering of the rights and responsibilities of the promoting helices as CRC stakeholders and (most likely, also) owners of the respective CRC entity (or entities) (see Garrett-Jones et al.
