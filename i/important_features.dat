The Mesoamerican language area shares a number of <b>important</b> <b>features,</b> including widespread loanwords, and use of a vigesimal number system.|$|E

5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and omission of <b>important</b> <b>features.</b> However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the level of difficulty and realistic driving model would appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba {{encouraged}} his devotees to pray, chant God's name, {{and read}} holy scriptures. He told Muslims {{to study the}} Qur'an and Hindus to study texts such as the Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita, and Yoga Vasistha.

5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most <b>important</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Important</b> <b>features</b> {{incorporated}} in the line include four loops (spirals) and four 'Z' reverses (zigzags). The introduction of bogie carriages allowed for {{the replacement of the}} basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Spirals located on steep hills are a feature of the railway that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{capturing}} Lang Vei was entrusted to the 24th Regiment, Vietnam People's Army 304th Division, led by Colonel Le Cong Phe. The regiment {{was to be}} supported by the 2nd Battalion (part of the 101D Regiment, 325th Division), the 2nd Artillery Battalion (part of the 675th Artillery Regiment), one tank company (part of the 198th Tank Battalion, 203rd Armored Regiment), two sapper companies, one anti-aircraft gun company, and one flamethrower platoon. One of the most <b>important</b> <b>features</b> of the North Vietnamese formation were {{the elements of the}} 203rd Armoured Regiment; the Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign marked the first time the Vietnam People’s Army deployed its armored forces on the battlefield. In 1964, soldiers of North Vietnam’s first armored unit—the 202nd Armored Regiment—was sent into South Vietnam without their T-34 main battle tanks, because their prime mission was to learn enemy armor tactics in order to prepare for future missions. On 22 June 1965, the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense passed Resolution 100/QD-QP, to establish the 203rd Armored Regiment, and Resolution 101/QD-QP to create an Armored Force Command.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} group theory, {{the elements}} of any group may be partitioned into conjugacy classes; {{members of the same}} conjugacy class share many properties, and study of conjugacy classes of non-abelian groups reveals many <b>important</b> <b>features</b> of their structure.
