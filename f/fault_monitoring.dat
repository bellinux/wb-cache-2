Approach: A fiber <b>fault</b> <b>monitoring</b> scheme is proposed whereas Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is placed on each branch of the Optical Network Unit (ONU). The advantages of the scheme are that it is simple, low cost and efficient in monitoring fiber fault in ONU.

40|$|Abstract—Rapid fault {{identification}} and localization in optical networks are crucial {{due to high}} data rates. These problems are more challenging than in traditional electronic networks because of optical transparency. In a transparent optical network which does not regenerate optical signals, a fault may propagate to {{various parts of the}} network from the origin, and multiple alarms can be generated for a single failure. In order {{to reduce the number of}} redundant alarms, simplify fault localization, and reduce the fault localization time, the number and location of <b>fault</b> <b>monitors</b> that are turned on should be optimized for a given network. In this paper, we formulate a problem on the optimal activation of network monitoring devices and propose a solution approach.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the protection schemes, ground <b>fault</b> <b>monitoring</b> techniques for the DC microgrid are also important. Detecting a high-resistance grounding fault proves a tough and challenging task for DC system safety. Traditionally, the methods of AC injection and DC leakage are widely used [84]. The method of AC injection monitors the ground fault through injecting a low frequency sine wave signal into the DC system, while the method of DC leakage directly inspects the ground fault with a DC leakage current. Reference [84] proposed a novel method of injecting different frequency signals. This method maintains both the advantages of high precision of the traditional AC injection method {{and it can be}} protected from the influence of the distributed capacitor in the DC system. A ground <b>fault</b> <b>monitoring</b> technique for an extra-low voltage direct current (ELVDC, up to a 60 V DC) distribution system was presented in [85]. A built environment equipotential property was applied in this technique. It is a good solution for ground fault detection when the DC leakage current is at a low level and not detectable. Reference [44] designed a probe unit to detect and locate the ground fault for unground a DC traction system. Although the proposed method realized fast detection and accurate location of the ground fault, it increased the cost with the need for additional equipment. A novel high-resistance ground <b>fault</b> <b>monitoring</b> method for DC railway traction systems was put forward in [86]. The voltage and current of two adjacent substations are applied in calculating the ground fault. The resistance effect was wiped out with the help of communications.
