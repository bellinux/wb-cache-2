40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of entry in two-sided markets where buyers and sellers act strategically. Applying new tools from supermodular optimization/games, Sufficient {{conditions}} for different comparative statics results are obtained. While normality of one good is Sufficient for the equilibrium price to be <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of buyers, normality of both goods is required for equilibrium bids and sellers' equilibrium utilities to be <b>increasing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of buyers. When the economy is replicated, normality of both goods and gross substitutes guarantee that the equilibrium of the strategic market game converges monotonically (<b>in</b> quantities) to <b>the</b> competitive equilibrium. Simple counter-examples are provided to settle other potential conjectures of interest. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article {{describes}} recent trends in AIDS among US Hispanics. METHODS: Incidence rates were calculated from AIDS surveillance data for persons diagnosed from 1991 through 1996. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of cases among Hispanics were calculated by linear regression. RESULTS: Of the 415, 864 persons diagnosed with AIDS from 1991 through 1996, 19 % were Hispanic. Among Hispanics with AIDS, 67 % were born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States or Puerto Rico. The relative risk (RR) of AIDS for Hispanics compared with Whites was highest for women (RR = 7. 0), followed by children (RR = 6. 2) and men (RR = 2. 8). <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of cases were higher among foreign-born Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of which Hispanic subgroups are at greatest risk for HIV infection {{is important for}} prevention efforts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the evolution {{of international trade and}} the behaviour of export diversification <b>in</b> Colombia during <b>the</b> 1991 - 2011 period. In order to measure trade diversification and follow its behaviour throughout the period, we employ alternative ways of decomposing trade flows in their intensive and extensive margins, using the latter as a measure of diversification. The results indicate that trade diversification in Colombia is relatively limited, and seems to follow a pattern according to which exports are diversified mainly through <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of products rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of partners. At the same time imports tend to diversify mainly by <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of countries of origin rather than by <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of products. Furthermore, trade with upper middle-income countries seems to be an important driver of trade diversification...|$|R
