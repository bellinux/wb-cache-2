5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff.

5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman elected to bat, allowing Lindwall {{more time to}} recover from a groin strain before being required to bowl. Hassett came in to join Morris at 2/87 when Bradman fell soon after lunch on the first day. The new ball was available, but England had declined to take it. Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain finally called for a replacement ball. Journalist and retired Australian cricketer Bill O'Reilly said that the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E

5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> respond, or <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{fault-tolerant}} distributed systems is a costly and diflicult task. Its cost and difficulty increase dramatically with {{the severity of}} failures that a system must tolerate. We seek to simplify this task by developing methods to automatically translate protocols tolerant of “benign ” <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> ones tolerant of more “severe” failures. This paper describes two new translation mechanisms for qr~hronous systems; one translates programs tolerant of crash failures into programs tolerant of general omission failures, and the other translates from gene& omiesion <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> arbitrary <b>failures.</b> Together these {{can be used to}} translate any program tolerant of the most benign <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> a program tolerant of the most severe. ...|$|R
