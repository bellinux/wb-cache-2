40|$|The {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of rising oil price {{over the past decade}} {{has been the subject of}} much debate. The role of speculation in financial markets has come increasingly under the microscope with many economists arguing that in commodity markets, such as oil, <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustment</b> should prevent speculative pressures from unduly influencing price. However, if demand and supply are relatively inelastic (not very price responsive) in the short run, then <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustment</b> can be slow to occur. In turn, the theory presented herein suggests that speculative activity can exacerbate price movements that are hinged on underlying market fundamentals. In other words, when constraints are present, <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustment</b> can be sluggish, which will reinforce the speculative notion that markets are becoming tighter. This will continue until something happens to unhinge that expectation, such as inventory build or economic collapse. Otherwise, speculation cannot exert an influence on price.

40|$|The food {{commodity}} price increases beginning in 2001 and {{culminating in the}} food crisis of 2007 / 08 reflected a combination of several factors, including economic growth, biofuel expansion, exchange rate fluctuations, and energy price inflation. To quantify these influences, the authors developed an empirical model that also included crop <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The study shows that, if inventory effects are not taken into account, the impacts of the various factors on food {{commodity price}} inflation would be overestimated. If the analysis ignores crop <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustments,</b> it indicates that prices of corn, soybean, rapeseed, rice, and wheat would have been, respectively, 42, 38, 52, and 45 percent lower than the corresponding observed prices in 2007. If inventories are properly taken into account, {{the contributions of the}} above mentioned factors to those commodity prices are 36, 26, 26, and 35 percent, respectively. Those four factors, taken together, explain 70 percent of the price increase for corn, 55 percent for soybean, 54 percent for wheat, and 47 percent for rice during the 2001 - 2007 period.

Agents are confronted with permanent and transitory shocks. Even with full knowledge about the stochastic structure their best perception at any particular time will usually be erroneous Prices for each period are set {{at the beginning of the}} period on the basis of market conditions The realization of the shock process thus creates a short-run 2 ̆ 7 disequilibrium 2 ̆ 7 absorbed by <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustments.</b> This adjustment translates perceived transitory monetary shocks into serially correlated output movements. The analysis proceeds within the context of rational expectations it offers a generalization of equilibrium analysis in two respects.

40|$|A stock-adjustment {{model is}} applied to monthly retail food store {{inventory}} data from 1968 through 1988. Estimates of the speed-of-adjustment coefficient (. 34 to. 75) are higher than estimates from previous research, indicating that periods of inventory disequilibrium in food retailing are short-lived. The results indicate that inventories are insensitive to financial carrying costs. The hypothesis that parameters of the model are constant over the sample period cannot be rejected, indicating that changes in food retailing (e. g., electronic scanning and diversification of product mixes) have not affected inventory behavior. Key words: retail food store inventories, stock-adjustment model. Previous {{research has indicated that}} retail food stores can be quite slow in adjusting their in-ventories to desired levels. Blinder (1981) found that retailers may require up to seven months to make half of desired inventory changes, thus there may be prolonged periods of inventory disequilibrium in food retailing. Such slow <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustments</b> indicate that retailers face substantial costs in adjusting their inventories to changing economic conditions. Blinder (1981) used aggregate seasonally ad-justed data in his analysis. He acknowledged that the use of seasonal data would have been preferable, but such data were not available {{at the time of his}} study (p. 477). Removing the seasonal pattern from the data can obscure im-portant aspects of inventory behavior (Sum-mers). Presumably, firms find seasonal varia-tions in demand relatively easy to predict and can adjust their inventories accordingly. De-seasonalized data can mask such adjustments and result in lower estimates of the speed at which retailers make inventory changes (Irvine 1981 b). Thus, Blinder's (1981) results may overstate the time required for retail food store <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Blinder's (1981) study was based on data through 1980.

Our empirical results provide support for this theory as we demonstrate that the appropriately measured probability of becoming employed during a recovery falls relative to normal because of the unusually high proportion of low turnover individuals who have lost "permanent" jobs. As aresult, recovery is much slower than is indicated by normal relationships although each individual is searching optimally. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies of the {{relationship}} between national and regional fluctuations have often found evidence of consistent space-time lags in regional economic adjustment. Some researchers have argued that depressed and peripheral regions take longer to adjust to national fluctuations than more central and prosperous regions. In this paper, a series of hypotheses are suggested to account for variations in space-time economic adjustments at the local level. The spatial and temporal transmission of market outcomes, uncertainty and the role of money are shown to be particularly important determinants of adjustment regardless of industrial location patterns. Emphasis is placed on <b>inventory</b> <b>adjustments</b> and unanticipated changes in sales by firms operating under conditions of imperfect competition.
