5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as <b>Fomes</b> pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of <b>Fomes</b> pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that may have been}} used as tinder (<b>Fomes</b> fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.|$|E
5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera <b>fomes),</b> from which the forest gets its name.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (<b>FOME)</b> {{evaluates the}} episodic memory {{functions}} of encoding, storage, and recall across five recall trials and a delayed recall trial. This {{study examined the}} clinical validity of <b>FOME</b> as a screening tool for dementia in older Chinese adults. Method: The psychometric properties and the discriminative power of <b>FOME</b> were examined in {{a convenience sample of}} 192 community-dwelling older individuals, of which 57 were diagnosed with dementia. The influence of age and education on the <b>FOME</b> performance was also estimated. Results: The test-retest reliability and parallel-form reliability of <b>FOME</b> were excellent, with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranging from 0. 91 - 0. 96. Good convergent validity of <b>FOME</b> was established with Mini-Mental State Examination (rp= 0. 69 - 0. 74), and the Memory subscale and the Initiation/Perseveration subscale of Dementia Rating Scale (rp= 0. 63 - 0. 74). The <b>FOME</b> total retrieval (TR) score and delayed recall (DR) score demonstrated good discriminative power in differentiating dementia from normal cognitive functioning, with area under the curve values of 0. 97 and 0. 93 respectively. The optimal cut-off scores suggested for TR and DR were 31 (93 % sensitivity, 90 specificity) and 7 (91 % sensitivity, 82 % specificity), respectively. The performance of the <b>FOME</b> was not influenced by the educational level. Conclusions: The results suggest that the <b>FOME</b> is a reliable and valid instrument to screen for dementia in older community-dwelling Chinese adults. The absence of the effects of education on the assessment performance makes <b>FOME</b> a clinically useful instrument for older adults with limited education.

25|$|Ecological {{succession}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a climax community typical of the climatic zone. Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated {{as a result of}} soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera <b>fomes</b> begins to appear.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans flora is characterised by the {{abundance}} of sundari (Heritiera <b>fomes),</b> gewa (Excoecaria agallocha), goran (Ceriops decandra) and keora (Sonneratia apetala) all of which occur prominently throughout the area. The characteristic tree of the forest is the sundari (Heritiera littoralis), from which {{the name of the}} forest had probably been derived. It yields a hard wood, used for building houses and making boats, furniture and other things. New forest accretions is often conspicuously dominated by keora (Sonneratia apetala) and tidal forests. It is an indicator species for newly accreted mudbanks and is an important species for wildlife, especially spotted deer (Axis axis). There is abundance of dhundul or passur (Xylocarpus granatum) and kankra (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) though distribution is discontinuous. Among palms, Poresia coaractata, Myriostachya wightiana and golpata (Nypa fruticans), and among grasses spear grass (Imperata cylindrica) and khagra (Phragmites karka) are well distributed.|$|E
25|$|Most major {{classes of}} predatory and {{parasitic}} arthropods contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that bees {{are the primary}} pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other Hymenoptera other than bees consume pollen as adults, though {{only a small number}} feed on pollen as larvae (including some ant larvae). Spiders are normally considered carnivores but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for spiderlings, which catch pollen on their webs. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains. Some predatory mites also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as Euseius tularensis, which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as Mordellidae and Melyridae feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, and Scarabaeidae are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of ground beetles, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, Ladybird beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. Hemiptera are mostly herbivores or omnivores but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the Anthocoridae). Many adult flies, especially Syrphidae, feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all flies, cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid). Some species of fungus, including <b>Fomes</b> fomentarius, are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen. Pollen may be valuable diet supplement for detritivores, providing them with nutrients needed for growth, development and maturation. It was suggested that obtaining nutrients from pollen, deposited on the forest floor during periods of pollen rains, allows fungi to decompose nutritionally scarce litter.|$|E

This report traces the evolution of <b>Fome</b> Zero, seeking to draw lessons from the programme which could be relevant to other countries committed to ending hunger, and lists key issues for scaling up food security programmes associated with the Latin America and the Caribbean Hunger-Free initiative (ALCSH).
