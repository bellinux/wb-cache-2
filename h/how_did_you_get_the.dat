First, it explains how the idea for a computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma was inspired by the artificial intelligence research on computer checkers and computer chess. Second, it shows how the vulnerability of simple reciprocity to misunderstanding or misimplementation can be eliminated with the addition of some degree of generosity or contrition. Third, it recounts the unusual collaboration between the author, a political scientist, and William D. Hamilton, an evolutionary biologist. 1 This article is a response to three questions, starting with the one I am asked most often. 1. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea for a computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma? 2. After thirty years and nine thousand citations, do you see any problems with your early work on the evolution of cooperation? 3.

40|$|Our faculty writing {{group in}} the Faculty of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada began in 2009 {{and over the past}} three years it has grown into a {{successfully}} publishing community of practice. When we have presented papers on the writing group at conferences, we have found that the first question asked tends to be: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> writing group to work? It is a deceptively simple question but the answer taps into many issues surrounding the difficulty of faculty writing and publishing in academic contexts. For many academics, the challenge of navigating the competitive discourse demands of conducting research and publishing journal articles, while at the same time navigating teaching and administrative loads, often leads to anxiety and stress. Situated within the literature on writing groups and research productivity, we contribute by narrating and analysing the evolving story of our group. The purpose of this paper is to explore why members continue to participate and why we have been able to successfully write and publish both individually and as a group. This study used ‘the self as data’, a qualitative methodology particularly relevant in the analysis of writing processes and groups. The data collected consisted of weekly written reflections, additional writte...|$|E
