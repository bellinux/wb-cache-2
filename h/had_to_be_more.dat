5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

500|$|Before the 2002–03 NBA season, Don Nelson and Mark Cuban {{put more}} {{emphasis}} on defense in the training drills, specialising in a zone defense anchored by prolific shotblockers Raef LaFrentz and Shawn Bradley. The Mavericks won their first eleven games, and Finley, Nash and Nowitzki were voted [...] "Western Conference Players of the Month" [...] in November 2002. In that season, Nowitzki lifted his averages again, now scoring 25.1 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. In addition, the German had 41 double-double games, the seventh highest figure that season. By averaging 25.1, {{he became the first}} European to score 2,000 points in a season. As a reward, he was voted into the All-Star Game and the All-NBA Second Team again, and was also runner-up in the [...] "German Athlete of the Year" [...] election, only losing to ski jumper Sven Hannawald. He led the Mavericks to a franchise-high 60–22 record, which earned them the third seed: as a result, the Mavericks had to play sixth seed Portland Trail Blazers in the 2003 NBA Playoffs. Now playing in a best-of-seven series instead of the former best-of-five, the Mavericks quickly won the first three games, but then completely lost their rhythm and the next three. In Game 7, Portland held the game close, but Nowitzki hit a clutch three to make it 100–94 with 1:21 left and the Mavericks won 107–95.

2500|$|In {{the final}} years of World War II, Nazi Germany {{researched}} and developed low-cost anti-tank weapons. [...] Large anti-tank cannon firing high velocity projectiles were the best option, but expensive to produce as well as requiring a well trained crew. [...] They also lacked mobility on the battlefield once emplaced. [...] Anti-tank rocket launchers and recoilless rifles, while much lighter and simpler to manufacture, gave the gunner's position away and were not as accurate as anti-tank cannons. Recoilless rifles used a huge amount of propellant to fire the projectile, with estimates ranging from only one-fifth to one-ninth of the propellant gases being used to push the projectile forward. [...] The German military asked for an anti-tank weapon with performance in-between that of the standard high velocity cannon and the cheaper rocket and recoilless infantry anti-tank weapons. [...] They also stipulated that any solution <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> efficient in the use of propellant, as German war industry had reached maximum cannon propellant production capacity.|$|E
2500|$|These early {{headphones}} used moving iron drivers, {{with either}} single-ended or balanced armatures. [...] The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles {{of a permanent}} magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm. [...] The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves. [...] The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor sound quality. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their impedance varied; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75ohms. Those used with early wireless radio <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> sensitive and were made with more turns of finer wire. Impedance of 1000 to 2000ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers. [...] Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{considerable}} hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, {{the time when}} adverse possession began was when [...] "possession" [...] was taken. This <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period. But [...] "possession" [...] did not require actual occupation. So in Powell v McFarlane, it was held to be [...] "possession" [...] when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: {{it was only later}} that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered [...] "adverse" [...] if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in BP Properties Ltd v Buckler, Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 1942, Wallace {{delivered}} {{what became}} {{his most famous}} speech, to the Free World Association in New York City. The speech, delivered during the darkest days of the war, was formally titled [...] "The Price of Free World Victory" [...] but came to be identified by its phrase [...] "the century of the common man". This was Wallace's answer to Republican publisher Henry Luce's call for an [...] "American Century" [...] after the war. For Wallace the war was a conflict between the slave states and the free world."The concept of freedom," [...] Wallace explained, was rooted in the Bible, with its [...] "extraordinary emphasis on {{the dignity of the}} individual," [...] but only recently had it become a reality for large numbers of people. [...] "Democracy is the only true political expression of Christianity," [...] he declared, adding that with freedom must come abundance. [...] "Men and women can never be really free until they have plenty to eat, and time and ability to read and think and talk things over." [...] For Wallace the outcome of the war <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than a restoration of the status quo. He wished to see the ideals of New Deal liberalism continuing at home and spreading throughout a world in which colonialism had been abolished and where labor would be represented by unions. [...] "Most of all," [...] write Culver and Hyde, [...] "He wanted to end the deadly cycle of economic warfare followed by military combat followed by isolationism and more economic warfare and more conflict.” For millions Wallace's speech defined America's mission in the war and the vision of a peaceful and more equitable world to follow. Nevertheless, it roused the ire of more conservative Democrats, business leaders and conservatives, not to mention Winston Churchill, who was strongly committed to preserving Britain's colonial empire.|$|E
