40|$|Toner is a main {{component}} of <b>electrophotographic</b> printing and <b>copying</b> <b>processes.</b> One {{of the most}} important ingredients of toner is magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) which provides the tribocharging property for toner particles. In this study, nano- and microparticles of Fe 3 O 4 were synthesized using the coprecipitation method and different amounts of lauric acid as a surfactant. The synthesized nano and micro Fe 3 O 4 was then used as the charge control agent to produce toner by emulsion aggregation. The Fe 3 O 4 and toner were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), atomic gradient force magnetometry (AGFM), dynamic laser scattering (DLS), particle size analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the optimum amount of surfactant not only reduced particle size but also reduced the magnetite properties of Fe 3 O 4. It was found that the magnetite behavior of the toner is not similar to the Fe 3 O 4 used to produce it. Although small-sized Fe 3 O 4 created toner with a smaller size, toners made with micro Fe 3 O 4 showed better magnetite properties than toner made with nano Fe 3 O 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{manuscript}} Brussels Bibliothèque royale II 3824 is a chant manuscript in French notational style. It {{was written}} for Saint-Bénigne of Dijon.

There are several minor differences between the readings of Sacerdotes eius in the two manuscripts. The melodic versions are not identical. They are not organized in the same fashion.

40|$|Abstract It is {{proposed}} that processes characteristic of biology today, autocatalysis, selection of molecules for linkage by their electrical shape, and evolution by survival selection {{were also the}} processes that initiated biology. A reconnaissance is made of both paradoxes and potential questions. It is argued that the minimal requirement for initiating Darwinian evolution is not a molecule <b>copying</b> <b>process,</b> but a linkage <b>copying</b> <b>process.</b> Survival selection evolution {{does not require a}} heterocatalytic polymer and a separate replicase process until there is uncertainty where molecular additions will occur. It is argued that a linkage directing process will be found for a lipid membrane (though this needs to be verified) and may in the right environment result in initial evolution, including initiation of α-helices, the development of a single chirality and NTPs. The system has at this point become sufficiently complex that higher precision copying is needed. However it seems likely that this state is able to generate the first miniature ribozymes and their replicases, and so satisfies the prior requirement. With the proposed requirements, {{it is likely that the}} development of polymers was within membranes...|$|R
