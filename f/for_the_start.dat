5|$|Early in the season, Arthur Carr {{was named}} as England captain <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the series; Carr {{was a popular}} choice and the only other serious {{contender}} {{at the time was}} Percy Fender.

Australia dominated most of the third Test but England saved the game; Chapman scored 15 and 42 not out in the match. However, Carr's tactical approach during the match was heavily criticised and he dropped a crucial catch on the first morning. Chapman was omitted from the side for the fourth Test, but fielded as substitute when Carr became ill during the game.|$|E
