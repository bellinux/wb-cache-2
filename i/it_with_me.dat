500|$|People {{have been}} wanting me to release {{something}} specifically for country radio for years, but I didn't {{want to just}} release something that has a steel guitar on it [...] I wanted to release something I'm proud of, and we finally found that song. It's my favorite kind of country music; it's like 1980s, 1990s country music, that throwback, two-steppin' style. And I'm freakin' stoked I got Vince Gill to sing on <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> so I win 'cause he's like {{one of my favorite}} people.|$|E

Glenn's business partner was Henri Landwirth, a Holocaust survivor who became his best friend. He remembered learning about Landwirth's background: [...] "Henri doesn't talk about it much. It was years before he spoke about <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and then only because of an accident. We were down in Florida during the space program. Everyone was wearing short-sleeved Ban-Lon shirtseveryone but Henri. Then one day I saw Henri at the pool and noticed the number on his arm. I told Henri {{that if it were}} me I'd wear that number like a medal with a spotlight on it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "We had {{the song}} pitched {{to us and}} {{originally}} it wasn’t a duet. The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

2500|$|SFGate {{described}} the [...] "show-tune- style songs" [...] as [...] "pleasant but forgettable", adding that [...] "the singing by Short, Belushi, Curry and Broadway belter Golden {{is the best}} thing about the film". It also noted that [...] "One of the obvious obstacles was how to color a film whose natural shadings tend toward black, white and degrees of gray. The result is a lot of odd but fascinating colorations -- the sky might turn up yellow at times, or the sea a deep maroon". The Spokesman-Review wrote [...] "in an era when G-rated movies are as rare as Hollywood humility, any attempt at family entertainment should be lauded", adding [...] "let us salute Don Bluth and his team of animators". In a rare case, The Daily Gazette gave the film 4 stars. The Animated Movie Guide said the film was an [...] "utter waste of talent and resources", due to interference from external forces. Monica Sullivan of Movie Magazine International noted that the film was [...] "heartily enjoyed by the two little girls who saw <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> at a kiddie matinee".|$|E
2500|$|In the season's {{final game}} at Chicago, Curtis was disqualified {{early in the}} game on grounds of {{unnecessary}} roughness. Early in the game, Chicago quarterback Walter Eckersall, considered {{the best player in the}} West, dropped back for a punt from Chicago's 40-yard line, and Curtis broke through and threw Eckersall to the frozen ground as he tried to block the kick. Eckersall lay on the ground knocked out for two minutes following the blow. The referee ruled that Curtis had swung an upper cut at Eckersall's jaw and ruled Curtis out of the game. [...] A newspaper account of the incident reported that, after Eckersall had gotten the punt safely away, Curtis, who had broken through, [...] "came down on the little maroon like a whirlwind, knocking him down." [...] Without Curtis in the lineup, Michigan lost its first game since 1900, losing to Chicago by a score of 2 to 0. After the game, Yost observed, [...] "Michigan's chances were materially lessened when Curtis went out." [...] The ruling ejecting Curtis from the Chicago game became a source of controversy. Eckersall himself spoke in defense of Curtis:"I will never believe that Curtis intended to rough <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in that unfortunate incident in the Michigan game. He was doing his best to block the punt, but could not stop in time to keep from running me down. I have known Curtis for several years, and he is a gentleman and one of the best sportsmen I have ever met. I feel that he has been unjustly censured for the play in which I was injured and for which he was ruled out of the game." ...|$|E
