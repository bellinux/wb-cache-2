40|$|This trial {{evaluated}} the reproductive performance {{in an early}} routine oestrus induction programme using two different PGF 2 α preparations in dairy cattle. D-cloprostenol sodium (n = 192; Group A) or dinoprost (n = 187; Group B) was administered between days 35 and 42 post partum. Also, a group of non-treated cows (n = 135; Group C) was included as control. Pedometers were used to detect oestrus, and also secondary oestrous signs and vaginal mucus quality were assessed prior to artificial insemination (AI). When oestrus was not detected for 14 days after PGF 2 α administration, the treatment was repeated, up {{to a maximum of}} three times. There were no differences between the study groups in oestrus detection (A = 73. 48 %, B = 73. 01 %, C = 79. 26 %; P = 0. 428), good mucus quality (A = 96. 45 %, B = 91. 30 %, C = 93. 45 %; P = 0. 203) and the presence of mounting lesions (A = 98. 58, B = 94. 93 %, C = 98. 13; P = 0. 414). First-service pregnancy rates were 19. 78 %, 15. 64 % and 32. 03 % in Groups A, B and C, respectively (P = 0. 003). There were no inter-group differences for the interval from parturition to first AI. However, a significantly shorter interval from parturition to conception (92. 17 days, 99. 45 days, 118. 93 days; P = 0. 002) and significantly less services per conception (2. 12, 2. 18, 2. 66; P = 0. 003) were observed in Groups A and B in comparison with Group C.

40|$|The first Chapter in {{this thesis}} aims to present an {{adequate}} background information on the previous work. Short of introducing routine antepartum prophylaxis programme, the only avenues open to impact on the incidence of RhD alloimmunisation, were efforts to fine-tune {{the operation of the}} existing <b>postpartum</b> prophylaxis <b>programme.</b>   This included improvement of the accuracy of measuring the volume of transplacental bleeds, {{in order to ensure that}} sufficient dose of anti-D is administered to afford protection against sensitisation.   Chapter II discusses the results of a Kleihauer Quality Assurance Scheme in Scotland, and demonstrates that, this scheme was effective in bringing about a change in the practice of Kleihauer testing in Scotland, and introduction of greater standardisation and harmonisation of practice with trends towards improved test results. The data presented in Chapter III, provide data on the incidence of RhD alloimmunisation in Scotland and relate this incidence to similar results obtained using different methodologies and denominators.   These data show that there had been no significant changes in the alloimmunisation rates over the previous decade. Mortality due to Rh disease had been underestimated, due to reliance on registry data.   Combining registry data, information from the case notes of alloimmunised mothers and data from tertiary referral centre in Scotland, as set out in chapter IV demonstrated the true magnitude of fetal / neonatal loss in Scotland between 1987 - 1991 and provides some information on the long term sequelea of Rh disease.   A total of 20 fetal losses occurred over this period, several fold greater than suggested by the registry data. Finally, in collaboration with Health Economic Research Unit in Aberdeen University, the above information was utilised to assess the economic aspects of introducing routine antenatal prophylaxis.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesCross-sectional {{estimates}} of contraceptive use {{do not provide}} understanding of time to postpartum uptake. This paper uses a range of Malawian data sources: a prospective study to explore time to uptake of contraception and a cross-sectional survey to assess whether sexually active postpartum women whose fecundity has returned use contraception, and whether abstaining/amenorrheic women report using contraception. Study designA demographic surveillance site (DSS) in Malawi was used to identify 7393 women aged 15 – 49 years eligible for a 1 -year prospective study of contraception using provider-recorded data on patient-held records (2012 – 2013). This provided a reliable record of time to uptake of postpartum contraception. The average timing of resumption of sexual activities after postpartum abstinence and return of menses was estimated from a population-based sexual behaviour survey in the DSS (2010 – 2011). ResultsOf 4678 women recruited to the prospective contraception study, 442 delivered an infant during the observation period. Of these, 28. 4 % used modern contraception within 6 months of delivery. However, at 6 – 9 months after delivery, only 28. 0 % women had started menstruation and resumed sexual activities; of these, 77. 6 % used contraception. Amongst abstaining/amenorrheic women, a quarter reported contraceptive use. ConclusionsThe low uptake of postpartum contraception is likely due to many women abstaining and/or experiencing amenorrhea. Self-reports of contraceptive use amongst abstaining/amenorrheic women bring into question the quality of cross-sectional surveys and demonstrate that contraceptive use by women at low risk of pregnancy could contribute to the Malawi paradox of high contraceptive use and high fertility. Given relatively low risk of pregnancy in the postpartum period in this context, a focus on long-acting/permanent methods {{may be more effective}} to avert unintended pregnancies. ImplicationsThere has been increasing interest in the utility of <b>postpartum</b> contraceptive <b>programmes</b> to assist women to space births. Our findings suggest that, although uptake of contraception is low, this is partly due to postpartum abstinence and amenorrhea. Provision of long-acting/permanent methods will be more effective for women after delivery...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess Tanzanian women's perceptions of their concerns during the early postpartum period and explore the relationship of these concerns to parity, experience with child care, age, marital status, religion and tribe. The Lazarus and Folkman (1984) stress, appraisal, and coping framework guided the study. A convenience sample of 100 mothers with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries were selected from Dar-Es- Salaam. By means of a card-sort, mothers sorted items as "worries", "interests", "confidences", or "not applicable". Hotelling's multivariate test, followed by univariate F-tests and Bonferroni correction determined that primiparas had significantly more worries and interests than multiparas, and that multiparas had significantly mor e confidences than primiparas. Two-sample ~-tests showed that the two groups of mothers did not differ in their level of worry and interest, but multiparas' level of confidence was significantly higher than that of primiparas. Spearman rank order correlations showed that age categories were negatively correlated with the number of worries and positively correlated with the number of confidences. Pearson correlation coefficients showed that parity was negatively correlated with the number of worries and positively correlated with the number of confidences. However, parity and the age of the mother were not independent of each other because 64 % of the primiparas were below 20 years and only one multipara was below 20 years of age. Child-care experience score was negatively correlated with the number of worries and marginally correlated with the number of interests and positively correlated with the number of confidences. Regression of age, parity, and experience with child care score on the number of worries, interests, and confidences showed that experience with child care explained most of the variations in worries and confidences. The findings indicate the need for postpartum follow-up care to assist mothers in reducing the number of worries and in increasing their confidence in dealing with postpartum concerns.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceSevere <b>postpartum</b> haemorrhages (PPH) are {{responsible}} for maternal morbidity/mortality. Their complex management sometimes requires haemostatic supplementation, and therapeutic trials on fibrinogen or activated factor VII, which may add to the thrombotic risk, are currently being considered. Furthermore, {{there is a risk}} of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the postpartum period, hence we studied the relationship between severe PPH and VTE in women during their first pregnancy. Among the 32, 463 women enrolled between January 1, 1999 and February 1, 2004 in the NOHA First cohort, 317 developed severe PPH, 11 postpartum VTE and 60 had postpartum superficial vein thrombosis (SVT). In the women with severe PPH, whilst there were no episodes of VTE, there were three episodes of SVT, which occurred 6 weeks postpartum. All of the women with severe PPH received packed red blood cell (RBC) units, 29 (9. 1 %) platelets units, 51 (16. 1 %) fresh frozen plasma and 29 (9. 1 %) fibrinogen concentrates. Three patients with both severe PPH and SVT received only packed RBC. Severe PPH or packed RBC unit transfusion were associated with postpartum SVT (adjusted relative risk: 5. 3 (1. 6 - 17) and 4. 7 (1. 5 - 15) respectively), independent of caesarean section delivery and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use in the postpartum, but were not independent indicators of one another. This the VTE and SVT risks associated with severe PPH are low (< 1 % and < 2 %, respectively). Severe PPH increases the risk of postpartum SVT, but transfusion with platelet units and plasma supplementation using fresh frozen plasma or fibrinogen concentrates do not markedly modulate the risk of venous thrombosis...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Postpartum</b> {{hemorrhage}} (PPH) is a {{major cause}} of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Several recent publications have noted an increasing trend in incidence over time. The international PPH collaboration was convened to explore the observed trends and to set out actions to address the factors identified. METHODS: We reviewed available data sources on the incidence of PPH over time in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and the USA. Where information was available, the incidence of PPH was stratified by cause. RESULTS: We observed an increasing trend in PPH, using heterogeneous definitions, in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. The observed increase in PPH in Australia, Canada and the USA was limited solely to immediate/atonic PPH. We noted increasing rates of severe adverse outcomes due to hemorrhage in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. CONCLUSION: Key Recommendations 1. Future revisions of the International Classification of Diseases should include separate codes for atonic PPH and PPH immediately following childbirth that is due to other causes. Also, additional codes are required for placenta accreta/percreta/increta. 2. Definitions of PPH should be unified; further research is required to investigate how definitions are applied in practice to the coding of data. 3. Additional improvement in the collection of data concerning PPH is required, specifically including a measure of severity. 4. Further research is required to determine whether an increased rate of reported PPH is also observed in other countries, and to further investigate potential risk factors including increased duration of labor, obesity and changes in second and third stage management practice. 5. Training should be provided to all staff involved in maternity care concerning assessment of blood loss and the monitoring of women after childbirth. This is key to reducing the severity of PPH and preventing any adverse outcomes. 6. Clinicians should be more vigilant given the possibility that the frequency and severity of PPH has in fact increased. This applies particularly to small hospitals with relatively few deliveries where management protocols may not be defined adequately and drugs or equipment may not be on hand to deal with unexpected severe PPH...|$|R
40|$|In urban Bangladesh, as in {{many other}} settings, an {{immediate}} postpartum family planning strategy prevails, where providers seek to promote and provide contraception at 40 - 45 days following birth to women regardless of their breastfeeding or menstrual status. Despite such practices, the majority of women choose to delay the initiation of contraception until menses resumes, often several months after birth. The present paper seeks to explain this discrepancy by describing poor, urban women's understandings regarding the chances of conception and the risks associated with contraceptive use in the postpartum period. Findings from in-depth interviews reveal that the majority of women perceive no personal risk of pregnancy during amenorrhoea, though most do not recognise an association between this diminished risk of conception and breastfeeding. In addition, the data illustrate that women are primarily concerned with their own and their newly born child's health and well-being in the period following childbirth, both of which are perceived to be extremely vulnerable. These perceptions, plus an understanding that modern methods of contraception are "strong" and potentially damaging to the health, mean that the majority of women are reluctant to adopt family planning methods soon after birth, particularly during postpartum amenorrhoea. The paper advocates that, since breastfeeding affords good protection against pregnancy for six to nine months following birth, efforts should be made to actively incorporate lactational amenorrhoea into postpartum family planning strategies in Bangladesh. Recommendations are also made for ways in which women may be encouraged to adopt contraception during amenorrhoea beyond the period of high natural protection. The paper highlights the importance of taking the client's perspective into consideration in attempts to improve the quality and effectiveness of family planning <b>programmes.</b> <b>postpartum</b> contraception lactational amenorrhoea Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceBACKGROUND: Severe <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhages (PPH) {{represent}} a significant cause of maternal morbidity/mortality, but {{little is known}} about its hemostasis-related risk factors. Among the 32 463 women enrolled in the NOHA First cohort, 317 developed severe PPH (S-PPH group), 1269 non-severe PPH (NS-PPH group) and the remaining individuals were considered as control women (C group). METHODS: We performed a case-control study, including 317 triplets of women allocated from the three groups that shared the same clinical characteristics as the S-PPH group. RESULTS: From values obtained 6 - 9 months after delivery, low (but not-deficient) levels of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, factor (F) XI, platelet CD 42 b, TRAP-induced increase of platelet CD 41 a and high values of serum residual prothrombin activity or closure aperture times using the collagen-ADP cartridge on the PFA- 100 system, and blood group O, were independently associated with a significant risk of severe PPH. Being positive for at least two of these eight variables was found in 1. 6 %, 3. 5 % and 20. 8 % of the women from the C, the NS-PPH and the S-PPH groups, respectively, the odds ratio for S-PPH in such a case being 16. 4, 95 %CI (6. 5 - 41), P < 0. 0001. CONCLUSIONS: Women with some hemostasis-related variables at the low or high end of the population distributions are prone to the severe forms of PPH. Clinical trials will allow us to know if acting on these risk factors can lower the clinical severity of PPH...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Psychology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} the effect of a prenatal hypnotherapeutic programme on the maintenance and promotion of postpartum psychological well-being of a group of first-time mother. Relevant literature on pregnancy, early motherhood and psychological well-being were explained in order to abstract important facets and perspectives to use as a background for the development and implementation of an intervention programme for the facilitation of psychological well-being of first-time mothers. Theoretical perspectives on, and practical applications of, clinical hypnosis were further analysed and used as foundation for the development of the hypnotherapeutic intervention. A hypnotherapeutic programme was developed, based on existing theoretical knowledge regarding pregnancy, childbirth and early motherhood, as well as clinical hypnosis, with specific emphasis on Ericksonian principles and ego state therapy techniques, enriched from the perspective of psychofortology. The empirical study consisted of a quantitative component and a qualitative component. In the quantitative component, a pretest-posttest-follow-up comparative design was implemented, with random assignment of participants to the experimental and control groups within the limits of practicalities. Both groups, each consisting of 23 women in their first pregnancy, completed the following questionnaires: (i) Perception of Labour and Delivery Scale (PLD), adapted from Padawer et al. (1988). Feelings about the baby and relationship with the baby (FRB), adapted from Wwllett and Parr (1997), Maternal Self- Confidence Scale (MSC), adapted from Ruble et al. (1990) and Maternal Self-Efficacy Scale (MSE) (Teti & Gelfand, 1991), to explore aspects of psychological well-being related to early motherhood; (ii) The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ofCox et al. (1987) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (Goldberg & Hillier, 1979), to investigate aspects of psychological well-being as evident by the absence of pathology; and (iii) the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener et al., 1985), the Affectometer 2 (AFM) (Kammann & Flett, 1983), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC) of Antonovsky (1979) and the Generalised Self-efficacy Scale (GSE), developed by Schwarrer, (1993), to measure general psychological well-being. The Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale (SHCS) (Morgan & Hilgard, 1978) was used for the experimental group to assess hypnotisabili. The qualitative component consisted of in-depth interviews and an analysis of written responses of mothers in the experimental group. They commented on their experience of the programme and its impact at two weeks and ten weeks postpartum. Results from the empirical study indicated that the experimental group showed significantly more symptoms of depression and symptomatology during the prenatal evaluation than the control group. Since the experimental group was possibly more vulnerable than the control group in a psychological sense, the effect of the intervention programme could not be deduced from a pure comparison of postnatal evaluation scores between the groups. Therefore, it was decided to explore the significance of differences within each of the experimental and control groups, as well as between the experimental and control group, using the mean difference scores between prenatal and postnatal evaluation on each variable. Results indicate that the hypnotherapeutic programme was effective in enhancing most aspects of psychological well-being within the experimental group. This strengthened sense of psychological well-being was evident both in the immediate postpartum period and at ten weeks postpartum. The control group showed a spontaneous increase in psychological well-being later in the <b>postpartum</b> period. The <b>programme</b> thus assisted mothers in the more vulnerable experimental group to experience a stronger sense of psychological well-being sooner after the baby's birth. The experimental and control groups were further compared on the mean differences in prenatal versus postnatal scores on measures of psychological well-being. The results suggest that the hypnotherapeutic intervention contributed to an enhanced sense of psychological well-being in mothers in the experimental group, in comparison to the control group, during the early postpartum period, as measured by variables related to motherhood, absence of pathology and general psychological well-being. At ten weeks postpartum, the differences between the experimental and control group were less obvious. However, a very important finding was that mothers in the experimental group continued to show a significant improvement in psychological well-being as indicated by the absence of pathology. Specifically, there was a continued decrease in depression and general symptoms of pathology. Findings from the quantitative study were supported by remarks by mothers in postpartum and follow-up interviews, as well as their written responses, as part of a qualitative exploration of their experience of the programme and its impact on them. The findings give compelling evidence that a hypnotherapeutic intervention, focusing on the enhancement of strengths and inner resources, could alleviate depression and psychological distress during the perinatal period, as well as prevent the exacerbation of symptoms. Findings from the current study indicate that the developed prenatal hypnotherapeutic programme was effective in enhancing the psychological well-being of mothers experiencing a first pregnancy. Recommendations for clinical practice and further research were made, based on the current research findings. The contribution of the current study lies in the fact that it is the first to explore pregnancy, childbirth and early motherhood from a salutogenidfortigenic perspective, and to utilise hypnosis to facilitate psychological well-being in this context. It contributed to scientific knowledge in the fields of developmental psychology, psychofortology and clinical hypnosis. Doctora...|$|R
