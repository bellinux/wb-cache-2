2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and then I went to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly <b>Jimmy</b> <b>said</b> he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he asked if I would be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E

60|$|<b>Jimmy</b> <b>said</b> he had cooked some flapjacks, {{although}} {{he felt he}} ought to wait until his host arrived.|$|E
60|$|<b>Jimmy</b> <b>said</b> he had {{not been}} far north; and Burnell {{appeared}} to reflect for a moment or two.|$|E
60|$|And as {{the door}} closed he had turned to rend Kennedy as he had rent Fenn; while Fenn walked back to Kay's feeling {{that there was a}} good deal in what <b>Jimmy</b> had <b>said.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Just one moment," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jimmy.</b> [...] "I <b>said</b> {{just now}} that there were reasons besides the revol--well, pipe--why you should not ring that bell. One {{of them is that}} all the {{servants}} will be in their places in the audience, so that there won't be anyone to answer it. But that's not the most convincing reason. Will you listen to one more before getting busy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went home}} {{directly}} the bar here closed," [...] <b>Jimmy</b> <b>said,</b> in a still dazed tone. [...] "I heard {{nothing about it}} till the next morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “She won’t stand much of this,” <b>Jimmy</b> <b>said</b> gravely, {{running the}} end of his finger along the shallow groove made by the sharp teeth of the {{splitting}} ice.|$|E
60|$|<b>Jimmy</b> Skunk <b>said</b> he would, so {{they all}} went down on the Green Meadows together, Bobby Coon first, Reddy Fox next and Jimmy Skunk last of all, for Jimmy Skunk never hurries. Pretty soon {{they came to the}} house of Johnny Chuck.|$|R
60|$|<b>Jimmy</b> Wheelock <b>said</b> nothing, but he {{knew that}} in the {{meanwhile}} he must put his career aside; and once more he set his lips and braced himself to face the task before him as he had done often in the sailing-ship days.|$|R
50|$|In a 1997 Detroit Free Press article, Wings vice {{president}} <b>Jimmy</b> Devellano <b>said</b> the team refused to hang the number {{because he was}} not a Hall of Famer, {{despite the fact that the}} number was already retired before Ilitch became the owner in 1982.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Jimmy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Thank you," [...] {{and gave}} her a {{thoughtful}} look. Margaret's voice was cultivated, but she talked like a bush girl. At the hotel she had not.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} sort," [...] <b>Jimmy</b> <b>said</b> complacently, {{watching}} his glass being filled. [...] "A whisky and soda {{when the doctor}} orders it, and ginger ale with his luncheon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'You needn't talk to me,' <b>Jimmy</b> <b>said</b> before I'd {{more than}} half spoken what was in my mind. 'After that jump of mine I'll back myself against the whole farm gang.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} work I {{did not like}} and admit I've had enough," [...] <b>Jimmy</b> <b>said,</b> and laughed. [...] "When I started for Canada, my notion was I'd be content to play about." ...|$|E
