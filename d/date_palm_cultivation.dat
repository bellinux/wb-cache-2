30|$|All of the island's core {{livelihood}} activities (e.g., herding, <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> tree <b>cultivation,</b> etc.) {{that constitute}} production are subsistence-oriented and are {{guided by the}} `norms of sufficiency'. The latter term refers to {{a situation where the}} `level of effort is regulated to suit the desired level of satisfaction, and the latter is brought in line with the level of effort people are willing to make' (Gorz [1993]: 61). Accordingly, production does not entail formal organization of productive labour beyond the household level. Soqotrans seems merely to strategically harness their environment's providential whims, as nature assumes almost entirely the burden of production. The notion of `mode of production' cannot be used to explain the nature of traditional economic activity on the island. Perhaps `mode of use' of the island's environmental resources might be more applicable. There is no consistently organized production that is aimed at a local or external market, with the exception of fishing, which is not an economic activity within the pastoral domain proper, although it is performed by pastoralists.|$|R

Before {{the development of the}} oil industry, <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>cultivation</b> dominated Bahrain's agriculture, producing sufficient dates for both domestic consumption and export. At least twenty-three varieties of dates are grown, and the leaves, branches, buds, and flowers of the date palm also are used extensively. From the 1950s through the 1970s, changing food consumption habits, as well as the increasing salinity of the aquifers that served as irrigation sources, led to a gradual decline in date cultivation. By the 1980s, a significant number of palm groves had been replaced by new kinds of agricultural activities, including vegetable gardens, nurseries for trees and flowers, poultry production, and dairy farms.|$|E

40|$|Oases are desert-farming agro-ecosystems, where <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> (Phoenix dactyliferaL.) plays a {{keystone}} role in offsetting {{the effects}} of drought and maintaining a suitable microclimate for agriculture. At present, abundance, diversity and plant growth promotion (PGP) of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> root-associated bacteria remain unknown. Considering the environmental pressure determined by the water scarcity in the desert environments, we hypothesized that bacteria associated with <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> roots improve plant resistance to drought. Here, the ecology of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> root endophytes from oases in the Tunisian Sahara was studied with emphasis on their capacity to promote growth under drought. Endophytic communities segregated along a north-south gradient in correlation with geo-climatic parameters. Screening of 120 endophytes indicated that <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> roots select for bacteria with multiple PGP traits. Bacteria rapidly cross-colonized the root tissues of different species of plants, including the original Tunisian <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivar, Saudi Arabian cultivars and Arabidopsis. Selected endophytes significantly increased the biomass of <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> exposed to repeated drought stress periods during a 9 -month greenhouse experiment. Overall, results indicate that <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> roots shape endophytic communities that are capable to promote plant growth under drought conditions, thereby contributing an essential ecological service to the entire oasis ecosystem. © 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components that govern a possible expansion of the <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>cultivation</b> is the availability and quality of the water, which primarily depend on climatic conditions. With respect to <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>cultivation,</b> we note that (a) temperature should not be less than 10  °C, (b) no rainfall should occur during the pollination period March–April, (c) no rainfall should occur during the harvesting period in August and September, and (d) no frost period is allowed. These climatic requirements are met in the Lower Jordan Valley. Additional water resources in the West Bank can be derived from groundwater and rainfall harvesting. Surface water is still unutilized due to Israeli restrictions on dam construction and access to the Jordan River, but flows from surface layer, root zone and aquifer can be accessed.
