25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor</b> with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> {{are also}} widely used to limit inrush current. These are {{inherently}} less efficient, since the resistance never {{falls from the}} value required to limit the inrush current. Consequently they are generally chosen for lower power circuitry, where the additional ongoing power waste is minor. Inrush limiting resistors are much cheaper than thermistors. They are found in most compact fluorescent lamps (light bulbs).|$|R

50|$|An {{inrush current}} limiter is a {{component}} used to limit inrush current to avoid gradual damage to components and avoid blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and <b>fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> {{are often used}} to limit inrush current. NTC thermistors {{can be used as}} inrush-current limiting devices in power supply circuits when added in series with the circuit being protected. They present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on. As current continues to flow, NTC thermistors heat up, allowing higher current flow during normal operation. NTC thermistors are usually much larger than measurement type thermistors, and are purposely designed for power applications.|$|R
50|$|As {{counterpart}} to a current source, the electronic load is a current sink. When loading a current source with a <b>fixed</b> <b>resistor</b> one can set one determined load current by the connected load resistor.

50|$|Electronic amateurs {{could build}} this circuit much more cheaply - e.g., with a four-position switch (four steps in {{level of the}} rear sound from min. to max. level) using <b>fixed</b> <b>resistors</b> of, for example, 20, 10, 5 and 0 (short-circuit) ohms. Because, in practice, only the highest level was of any use, a more basic set-up with only the <b>fixed</b> 10 ohm <b>resistor</b> at close-to-zero cost is possible.Note that the system {{requires}} more or less flat impedance curves for the rear speakers to work properly, which was often {{the case in the}} tube-amplifier days.Tube amplifiers had a constant impedance over a wide range, and worked best with high-efficiency speakers. Later on, when transistor amplifiers were used, speakers tended to lose that design feature. (Lower impedance meant higher power output for these amplifiers, compensating for the lower efficiency of such designs.) The system worked best using a transistor-based stereo amplifier, low-efficiency front speakers, and high-efficiency, constant impedance rear speakers.|$|R
