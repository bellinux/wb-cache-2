60|$|Judge Douglas has again, for, I believe, {{the fifth}} time, {{if not the}} seventh, in my presence, reiterated his charge of a {{conspiracy}} or combination between the National Democrats and Republicans. What evidence Judge Douglas has upon this subject I know not, inasmuch as he never favors us with any. I have said upon a former occasion, and I do not choose to suppress it now, that I {{have no objection to}} the division in the Judge's party. He got it up himself. It was all his and their work. He had, I think, a great deal {{more to do with the}} steps that led to the Lecompton Constitution than Mr. Buchanan had; though at last, when they reached it, they quarreled over it, and their friends divided upon it. I am very free to confess to Judge Douglas that I have no objection to the division; but I defy the Judge to show any evidence that I have in any way promoted that division, unless he insists on being a witness himself in merely saying so. I can give all fair friends of Judge Douglas here to understand exactly the view that Republicans take in regard to that division. Don't you remember how two years ago the opponents of the Democratic party were divided between Fremont and Fillmore? I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Any Democrat who remembers that division will remember also that he was at the time very glad of it, and then he will be able to see all there is between the National Democrats and the Republicans. What we now think of the two divisions of Democrats, you then thought of the Fremont and Fillmore divisions. That is all there is of it.|$|E

And I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not do that with major labels when you're an unknown artist. I didn't like anyone trying to change me though and A & R reps like to manipulate {{even though most of}} them are complete idiots. They kept telling me to write songs like Cinderella, Bon Jovi, and Poison. It was insulting to me. Why should I follow in their footsteps just because they are successful? ... Here's the pivotal reason I left L.A. Guns. Izzy Stradlin and I got busted together. Rumors shot around town that Guns N' Roses were going to lose their deal with Geffen. PolyGramfelt it was time to replace me before signing L.A. Guns to a deal." [...] â€”Black on why he was replaced. Later, in 1985, Guns and singer Paul Black reformed L.A. Guns with Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander. Robert Stoddard, former The Dogs D'Amour singer, briefly became guitarist for the group, co-writing the song [...] "Nothing to Lose" [...] that appeared on L.A. Guns debut album. Initially, the group were to be called Faster Pussycat (later the name of another band; several of that band's members over the years were also in L.A. Guns) but soon re-adopted the L.A. Guns moniker. After writing material and playing shows, the group signed with PolyGram. Black was soon replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while Kelly Nickels (formerly of Faster Pussycat) was added to the lineup.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] said Mr. Dickerson tolerantly, [...] "you {{say that}} now; and I don't blame <b>you.</b> But I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> care, once, Nelie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite right," [...] he said. [...] "This {{should make}} it clear that some of the city men with money are on our trail." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> such a {{good job}} in fooling a lot of people, you {{ultimately}} fooled yourself...a man's name tells you who he is; Madoff made off with the money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Night," [...] {{said the}} burglar; [...] "just when I'm busiest. Say, take down that arm of yours--I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> won't--Say! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever try Blickerstaff's Blood Builder?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} latter, {{with an air}} of reflection, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> might <b>do</b> if <b>you</b> got a piece of raw steak from the cook and tied it around your face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> that, you'd have {{to fight}} me, and you'd find me pretty smart with the bowie-knife an' the revolver, either in the dark or in daylight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{your part}} in {{attending}} to the work and letting me rest," [...] said Marilla. [...] "You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual. Of course it wasn't exactly necessary to starch Matthew's handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way evidently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>do</b> much harm, and Wandle may {{not have}} gone by the lake after all. You can pick up Stanton if you find out anything, and I'll try to join you {{from one of the}} {{stations}} along the line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sure {{look pretty}} lively after {{falling off the}} Montreal express. <b>Guess</b> <b>you</b> must have <b>done</b> {{that kind of thing}} before? But our bosses are getting blamed {{particular}} about these free rides." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Implicitly," [...] {{returned}} English Jim. [...] "You {{must have}} had some reason I cannot <b>guess</b> for what <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> That sounds like presumption, doesn't it? But you can count upon my silence, madam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know," [...] he said desperately, [...] "I couldn't <b>guess.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think I {{would have}} had this thing happen to you? I was carried away--we were both carried away--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> {{may have}} <b>done</b> so, but I didn't get the deer. It {{was in the}} fern, and the light was going. I just got the one shot, {{and it was too}} dark to follow up the trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I callated," [...] he cried, {{still holding}} Wetherell's {{hand in a}} mild, but persuasive grip. [...] "So I callated. <b>Guess</b> I <b>done</b> <b>you</b> an injustice, Will." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{all know}} that, yet {{most of us}} are just foolish enough to make such a wish now and then. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> it. I know I have. Peter Rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards. I suspect that even shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty of it more than once. So it is not {{surprising}} that Reddy Fox, terribly hungry as he was, should do a little foolish wishing.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'll {{tell you}} who he is,' says Mr. Mayor, sitting up in bed. 'He's a detective {{employed}} by the State Medical Society. He's been following you over five counties. He came to me yesterday and we fixed up this scheme to catch <b>you.</b> I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>do</b> any more doctoring around these parts, Mr. Fakir. What was it you said I had, doc?' the mayor laughs, 'compound--well, it wasn't softening of the brain, I guess, anyway.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, but <b>you</b> {{ought to}} <b>guess.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{not see how}} names impress their own individuality? You need not laugh; I know they <b>do.</b> Could <b>you</b> {{possibly}} have been called Augusta, and did not Katherine quite pervade Miss Fennimore?' ...|$|R
50|$|What Southport {{is famous}} for is the shit and the piss throwing. Because the inmates {{have no access to}} each other, what they do is fill cups up with shit and piss and throw it at each other. <b>You</b> get caught <b>doing</b> it once, they keep your hands handcuffed behind your back so you can't throw anything. So if you really still want to get your {{neighbor}} with shit, <b>guess</b> what <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> put it in your mouth and {{when you get to the}} yard, you spit it on someone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am glad I <b>did</b> not <b>guess</b> what <b>you</b> were <b>doing.</b> I {{thought it}} so impossible, that I {{did not think}} of begging you not. I shall keep them always. It is a good thing for us to be put in mind how frail all our joy is.' ...|$|R
60|$|My Dearest Augusta,--I {{have only}} {{time to say}} that I shall write tomorrow, and that my present and long silence has been occasioned by a {{thousand}} things (with which you are not concerned).

6000|$|... "If not yourself," [...] he retorted, [...] "you {{spoke of}} it to some one ... {{who went to the}} Stadtholder ... and warned him! to some one ... some one who.... Ah!" [...] he cried {{suddenly}} with a loud and ghoulish scream wherein rage, horror and fear and a kind of savage triumph too rang out, [...] "I see that I have <b>guessed</b> aright. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> speak of what you knew ... to the miserable knave whom Nicolaes paid to outrage you ... and you offered him money to betray your own brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I can <b>guess</b> the reason. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{not keep}} your word to me, though you knew how anxious I {{was to see}} you {{at the end of your}} {{fortnight}} at Kingston; and the reason is that you have something on your mind which you fear to tell me--which you are ashamed to tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, reflectively, [...] "if it's the {{one that}} was Barbara last time, I <b>guess</b> I <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> have been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch? She was up yonder ten minutes ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> it <b>does.</b> <b>You</b> {{would have}} had to pay money down for the seed, and I'll be glad to let the thing stand over until you have thrashed out. The price doesn't count; you can give me back as many bushels as you get." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Norah!" [...] he said, exultantly. [...] "It is you, {{it is you}} I love! <b>You</b> never <b>guessed</b> it, <b>did</b> <b>you?</b> 'Tis you I meant all the time. Now I can speak.

6000|$|... "I hain't {{got time}} to go back," [...] he said, as an {{inspiration}} came to him; [...] "but I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> kin <b>do</b> jest as well. This book here," [...] picking up {{the last of the}} three from the seat, [...] "I offered to sell yer uncle fer five dollars; but he wanted it fer four. I ain't no haggler, you understan', so I jest driv away. Now Mr. Merrick has changed his mind an' is willin' to give five fer it; but there ain't nuthin' small about me.

6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> may <b>do</b> some good, sir, in this wretched house," [...] {{the girl}} went on, {{with her eyes}} still earnestly fixed on my face. [...] "There is no love, no trust, no peace, at Morwick Farm. They want {{somebody}} here, except Ambrose. Don't think ill of Ambrose; he is only thoughtless. I say, {{the rest of them}} want somebody here to make them ashamed of their hard hearts, and their horrid, false, envious ways. You are a gentleman; you know more than they know; they can't help themselves; they must look up to you. Try, Mr. Lefrank, when you have the opportunity--pray try, sir, to make peace among them. You heard what went on at supper-time; and you were disgusted with it. Oh yes, you were! I saw you frown to yourself; and I know what that means in you Englishmen." ...|$|R
