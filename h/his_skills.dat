He served as editor from 1907 to 1915, and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, {{in contrast to the}} more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, Max Baginski. Under Berkman's stewardship, circulation of Mother Earth rose as high as 10,000 and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S.|$|E
