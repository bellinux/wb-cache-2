5|$|Windy Nook Primary is {{the only}} school in the village. Some {{children}} of primary school age attend Colegate Community Primary School, located {{on the fringe of}} Windy Nook at Colegate West in neighbouring Leam Lane. This too is a satisfactory school which suffers from inconsistent attainment among pupils. The nearest Roman Catholic school is St Augustine's Primary; a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> at Leam Lane Estate. Secondary school provision is at Thomas Hepburn Community Academy on Swards Road in Felling. This is a satisfactory but improving school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals is more than twice the national average.|$|E
5|$|Deckham {{is an area}} {{of social}} and {{economic}} deprivation, in the top ten per cent of such areas according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Housing stock is predominantly council housing and is, in many places, outdated and in need of modernisation. Whilst once the site of a coal mine, there is today no major employer in Deckham, which is considered a residential suburb of Gateshead. The main economic activity is in a commercial development on Old Durham Road. Deckham has a number of public houses, one of which, the Plough Inn, is more than 150 years old. The only education provision is at South Street Primary School, which is a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> according to OFSTED. There are two churches, one of which, the Church of St George, is a Grade II listed building, and community facilities are provided by Deckham Community Centre and the Elgin Centre in Carr Hill.|$|E

His parents were Justus Heinrich Domhardt († 1736) and his wife Katharina Gertrud Trüstedt, who came from a family of civic leaders in Gardelegen, Saxony-Anhalt. He attended the Martineum (Halberstadt) and the Royal Litvian Provincial School and acquired a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> education. His father died when he was 19 years old.

3000|$|Search {{probability}} [...] (γ _j,k^o^k) uniformly shifts toward bad schools. This {{is especially}} pronounced for low experience teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools,</b> who shift search by 10 percentage points. From the school-side, {{a reduction in}} the number of vacancies from <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> means lower competition for highly desirable teachers for <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> that are still in the market. As such, their strategy of search shifts to searching more heavily for mid and high experience teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools.</b> Low experience teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> who are in the search market respond to this by shifting search to the bad school market, where they are most likely to find a match.|$|R

Colegate Community primary school, at Colegate West, is a {{satisfactory}} school with well behaved pupils who make satisfactory progress. Falla Park Community primary school on Falla Park Road is an average sized school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals is well above the national average. This is a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> where pupils perform consistently well at key stage two. Also a <b>good</b> <b>school</b> is The Drive Community primary school; a smaller than average school which achieves good results despite being located in an area of [...] "considerable social disadvantage". To the north, at Mulberry Street, lies Brandling primary school; another good, smaller than average-sized school. Bede Community primary school, at Old Fold Road, is in an area with a [...] "high incidence of social and economic deprivation" [...] with a very high proportion of children entitled to free school meals and with learning difficulties. Here children do not achieve as well in examinations but instead enjoy a high level of personal development and so, according to the latest OFSTED report, this too is a <b>good</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E

30|$|Bad {{schools have}} the highest probabilities of {{matching}} with teachers {{with low levels of}} experience (39.91 % with teachers from bad schools and 55.21 % with teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools).</b> They also stand a good chance of matching with teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools,</b> especially those with low levels of experience. This is consistent with the high search rate of these teachers for bad schools, as was seen in Table 4. In addition, because teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> outnumber those from bad schools by more than 6 to 1, even a small fraction of teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> seeking to move to a bad school will make matching relatively easy from the school-side. <b>Good</b> <b>schools</b> can more easily match with teachers from bad schools, but they spend almost no time searching in these markets. Summing across all experience levels, <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> spend only 11.69 % of their search time for teachers from bad schools. Yet even if <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> search in the low experience, bad school origin market, their chance of matching stands at 62 %. Again, this is indicative of the high degree of search friction in the teacher transfer labor market. These probabilities affect the schools’ search decisions. Bad schools search mostly for mid-level and highly experienced teachers originating from both bad and <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> (77.03 % of their search time). <b>Good</b> <b>schools</b> focus mostly on mid-level and highly experienced teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> (75.06 % of their search time). Again, this confirms the utility parameters on the school side from Table 4.|$|R
30|$|Bad schools tend {{to target}} medium and highly {{experienced}} teachers from both bad and <b>good</b> <b>schools,</b> while <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> search for experienced teachers originating from <b>good</b> <b>schools.</b> The matching rate {{from the school}} side is relatively low across all teacher types (with the exclusion of low experienced teachers), hinting {{at the possibility of}} a very inefficient market.|$|R
3000|$|... 28 If {{teachers}} are matched by a central authority {{according to a}} seniority rule, the model would express this preference by over-estimating a <b>good</b> <b>school’s</b> utility from matching with an experienced teacher. The higher utility {{would be consistent with}} more <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> choosing to search in the experienced teacher market, which in turn will lead to a higher probability of good teachers successfully matching with <b>good</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R

30|$|Both bad and <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> have {{relatively}} high probabilities of matching with low experienced teachers, yet {{they decide to}} shun these markets (although bad schools will sometimes search for low experience teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools).</b> The search pattern of schools {{in light of the}} probability of match reveals why both types of schools behave in this manner. <b>Good</b> <b>schools</b> simply focus on recruiting highly experienced teachers from <b>good</b> <b>schools</b> because they have a high probability of finding their desired match. Bad schools are indifferent bewteen low experienced teachers and newly minted teachers. Since the outside option is guaranteed, many of these schools will attempt to match with a teacher with more experience.|$|R
