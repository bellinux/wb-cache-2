5|$|Among those Chinese who {{did manage}} to escape Nanking were Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling, who had flown out of Nanking on a private plane just before the crack of <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> December 7. The mayor of Nanking {{and most of the}} {{municipal}} government left the same day, entrusting management of the city to the Nanking Garrison Force.|$|E
5|$|By <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 20 April 1941, the Germans {{were well}} aware that British and Allied forces had begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece. The Luftwaffe made substantial attacks against these departure points {{in a bid to}} prevent or forestall an evacuation. On Sunday 20 April — Hitler's 52nd birthday — the Luftwaffe mounted mass attacks against Allied shipping in Piraeus Harbour.|$|E
5|$|Kean saw the North Korean {{breakthrough}} at Haman as {{a serious}} threat to his division's line. At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> September 1, Kean requested permission from Walker to commit the entire 27th Infantry Regiment, just arrived at Masan the previous evening and still held in Eighth Army reserve. Walker denied this request, but did release one battalion of the regiment to Kean's control.|$|E

5|$|The next German {{attack was}} at <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 9 June, when a heavy mortar barrage {{landed on the}} 9th Parachute Battalion positions. Then 'A' and 'C' Companies were {{attacked}} simultaneously. After taking heavy casualties, the Germans retreated into the woods surrounding the Château, where they reformed and attempted another unsuccessful attack an hour later.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{finally reached}} the Virginia shore near Machodoc Creek before <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> April 23. There, they made contact with Thomas Harbin, whom Booth had {{previously}} brought into his erstwhile kidnapping plot. Harbin took Booth and Herold to another Confederate agent in the area named William Bryant who supplied them with horses.|$|E
5|$|When {{the last}} of it ran out shortly before <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese {{soldiers}} attacking his position. By {{the end of the}} engagement, Japanese forces opposite their section of the line had been virtually annihilated. For his actions during the battle, Basilone received the United States military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly {{the whole}} thing <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> me. I had {{forgotten}} what a long time I had been away.|$|R
5|$|After re-organising, in mid-August the 11th Battalion {{moved to}} La Boisselle {{where they were}} placed into brigade reserve. Just before <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 21 August, about 200 men from the 11th took part in an attack around Mouquet Farm; {{casualties}} amounted to 20 killed and 40 wounded and afterwards the battalion was moved to Belgium. The 11th Battalion spent the remainder of 1916 in the Ypres sector, in Flanders, but was {{moved back to the}} Somme {{at the end of the}} year as the worst winter in 40 years descended on the front.|$|E
5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 15 October, the {{men were}} taken to a public {{cemetery}} near Shanghai, where they were shot by a Japanese firing squad. Following the bodies' cremation, the ashes were taken to a mortuary. After the war ended, the men's ashes were recovered and their letters found in a secret file of the War Ministry Building in Tokyo. In 1946, Farrow was interred with honors at the Arlington National Cemetery, Section 12, Grave 157.|$|E
5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E
60|$|A slow, {{cumulative}} groan {{broke from}} the assembly as {{the meaning of}} his words gradually <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> his hearers.|$|R
60|$|A look of relief, that I {{could almost}} have called beautiful, <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> his countenance. ‘Anything—anything you wish,’ said he.|$|R
60|$|He woke {{to think}} of her of whom he had dreamed. The light had <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> his soul. Coningsby loved.|$|R
5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 7 September 1191, as Richard's forces {{began moving}} out of camp enemy scouts were visible in all directions, hinting that Saladin's whole army lay hidden in the woodland. King Richard took especial pains over the {{disposition}} of his army. The probable posts of greatest danger, at the front and especially {{the rear of the}} column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.|$|E
5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village.|$|E
5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> May23, the Cabildo {{informed}} {{the population that}} the Viceroy would end his mandate. The highest authority would be transferred temporarily to the Cabildo until {{the appointment of a}} governing junta. Notices were placed at various points throughout the city, which announced the imminent creation of a junta and the summoning of representatives from the provinces. The notices also called for the public to refrain from actions contrary to public policy.|$|E
60|$|But no such day {{had ever}} <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> Mr Dombey, or his wife; {{and the course}} of each was taken.|$|R
60|$|Noel Vanstone's color {{began to}} rise again, as the captain's stratagem <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> him at last in its true light.|$|R

5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|At <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> the 13th, as Waller's army {{approached}} Alton, Crawford fled {{with the}} cavalry to Winchester, leaving Colonel Richardus Boles to defend Alton {{with only the}} infantry. Outnumbered and overpowered, Boles's men were soon forced to seek refuge in the Church of St Lawrence, where they made a desperate last stand. Boles was killed, along with most of his remaining men. The Parliamentarians won a clear victory, losing only a few men and taking many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 5 July, Pakistani troops set off {{a series}} of explosions around the mosque. Gunfire was {{exchanged}} throughout the day, but open clashes apparently stopped. Deadline extensions continued on 5 July, with the government planning to evacuate the mosque and Jamia Hafsa before the final assault. Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao announced {{at a press conference}} that the government believed that between 300 and 400 students remained in the mosque, and only 50 to 60 were considered to be militants.|$|E
60|$|For a moment, Tommy {{stared at}} him. Then it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> him {{that of course}} the lawyer did not know.|$|R
60|$|I searched again, {{but could}} see no wound. Then the truth <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> me -- the man was frightened, not hurt.|$|R

5|$|Before <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted the {{military}} junta led by General Dương Văn Minh from {{the leadership of}} South Vietnam without firing a shot. It came {{less than three months}} after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after power had been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> September 13, 1964, {{the ruling}} {{military}} junta of South Vietnam, led by General Nguyễn Khánh, was {{threatened by a}} coup attempt headed by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, who sent dissident units into the capital Saigon. They captured various key points and announced over national radio {{the overthrow of the}} incumbent regime. With the help of the Americans, Khánh was able to rally support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties.|$|E
5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, {{hoping to}} slip past the inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E

60|$|Jordan {{gazed at}} him a moment in amazement, and then laughed in a fashion which {{suggested}} that comprehension had <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{failed to}} {{understand}} the light touch of mocking amusement in her tone; it had not <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> him that this was her defense.|$|R
