5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman.

500|$|A {{big part}} of the Smallville series relies on the effects it delivers, whether digital, physical, or special make-up effects. The effects shots, part of the {{post-production}} work, are developed and added in Los Angeles. David Nutter hired Thomas Special Effects to create digital cornfields for the pilot episode. After attempting to grow ten thousand stalks of corn in a greenhouse, which only grew two feet tall, Nutter was forced to rely primarily on digital corn. Faux corn was also flown in from Arizona. CGI supervisor Bill Millar created digital butterflies for a scene in Lana's bedroom, and all the insects Greg Arkin (Chad Donella) collected in the episode [...] "Metamorphosis". Greg's insects had to be created digitally, because a green hue was needed to illustrate the kryptonite radiation in the insects. After the opening credits, the first person view of someone, later revealed to be Clark, flying through Lana's open window and <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> was created digitally. The effect was accomplished with stock footage, a sound stage and computer generated imagery. Stock footage shot from a helicopter, as it flew over several farms during the day, was used for the first person point of view. It was altered from day to night, and a CGI house was created in an empty field. Lana's bedroom as built on a soundstage, and CGI was used to create the illusion of someone traveling through her open window and stopping above her bed.|$|E
500|$|Brougham Castle is {{entered through}} a three-storey double-gatehouse. Originally the {{coat of arms}} of Roger Clifford and his wife was carved above the {{entrance}} to the gatehouse but in the 19th century this was replaced by the current inscription, [...] "Thys Made Roger", by Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet. The inscription was originally above the entrance of the great hall built by Roger Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford. Erected on the slope inclining down to the river, the gatehouse was constructed in the early 14th century by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. The complex has three components: the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between. The inner gatehouse survives to a height of [...] in the east. The ground-floor passage through the building is vaulted and there was a portcullis at the east end. A postern gate was hidden behind a buttress in {{the north side of the}} gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle. The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep, allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside. In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Like the inner gatehouse, the outer section had a square plan, and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room. The building survives to a height of [...] in the east. Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon, and at ground floor level on the north side the guardroom. The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences. Although the very top of the gatehouse no longer survives, it would have been crested by machicolations.|$|E
2500|$|Helena and Valentine {{attempt to}} stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, {{learning}} that it is called the [...] "MirrorMask".

She discovers that a doppelgänger of herself is living there and behaving radically different from her. The doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Valentine betrays Helena to the Queen of Shadows in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen's servants warp Helena's mind so she will believe she is the Princess of Shadows. Valentine has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the spell on her. They search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror. They flee the castle with the charm.|$|E

2500|$|Shaw also {{testified that}} four months later, in September 1988, she got drunk with Allan and {{accompanied}} {{her to a}} 1 am rendezvous with Terre'Blanche. She alleged she watched from a wall as the couple kissed, embraced and fondled {{for half an hour}} in the back of Allan's car. Terre'Blanche denied ever having met Shaw. [...] Allan alleged that Shaw had sinister motivations for testifying against her, saying [...] "she has told people she was obsessed with me and {{that was the only way}} she could exorcise me. She was openly bisexual." [...] She also agreed with the statement that Shaw was a [...] "habitual liar" [...] and continued [...] "I disapproved of the number of men she had traipsing <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> and suggested she should have a turnstile on her bedroom door". Andrew Broulidakis, a childhood friend of Allan's who also knew Shaw, brought into question the latter's character in a draft statement supplied to the court. Sebastian Faulks remarked in The Guardian: [...] "What is it that makes George Carman worth £10,000 a day when plaintiffs witness Andrew Broulidakis was so easily able to wrong foot him." [...] A witness also alleged that Shaw had disparagingly referred to Allan as a [...] "frigid bitch" [...] and it would be a [...] "scream" [...] to have her [...] "nailed for gang-banging Nazis". Shaw also faced allegations that she had deliberately gotten pregnant to ensnare a boyfriend and that she had said [...] "I Never trust a man until I've slept with him." ...|$|E

[...] "I thought, you know, be quiet, because if he hears you, he might take you too, and you're the only person who has seen this," [...] Mary Katherine said in a later interview. [...] "I was, like, shaking." [...] She hid for an undetermined amount of time. Investigators later concluded that she may have been hiding over two hours before she felt safe enough to come out.|$|R
5000|$|Six {{months before}} their wedding in 1991, Homolka stole the {{anesthetic}} agent halothane from the Martindale Veterinarian Clinic where she worked.
