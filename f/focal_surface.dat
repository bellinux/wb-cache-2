40|$|It {{is shown}} that the Hyperbolic Branch of the {{radiative}} electroweak symmetry breaking contains in it three regions: the Focal Point, Focal Curves, and <b>Focal</b> <b>Surfaces.</b> Further, the <b>Focal</b> Point is shown to lie on the boundary of a Focal Curve. These focal regions allow for a small μ while scalar masses can become large and {{may lie in the}} several TeV region. It is shown that for the mSUGRA model the current LHC- 7 constraint depletes the Focal Point region while regions on Focal Curves and <b>Focal</b> <b>Surfaces</b> remain largely intact. The LHC implications for models which lie on Focal Curves are briefly discussed as well as the implications of dark matter constraints for the Focal Point, Focal Curves and <b>Focal</b> <b>Surfaces</b> are discussed.

50|$|As the {{principal}} curvatures are the eigenvalues {{of the second}} fundamental form, there are two at each point, and these give rise to two points of the <b>focal</b> <b>surface</b> on each normal direction to the surface. Away from umbilical points, these two points of the <b>focal</b> <b>surface</b> are distinct; at umbilical points the two sheets come together. When the surface has a ridge the <b>focal</b> <b>surface</b> has a cuspidal edge, three such edges pass through an elliptical umbilic and only one through a hyperbolic umbilic. At points where the Gaussian curvature is zero, one sheet of the <b>focal</b> <b>surface</b> will have a point at infinity corresponding to the zero principal curvature.|$|E

40|$|An {{exciting}} new area in computer graphics is {{the synthesis of}} novel images with photographic effect from an initial database of reference images. This is the primary theme of imagebased rendering algorithms. This research extends the light field and lumigraph image-based rendering methods and greatly extends their utility, especially in scenes with much depth variation. First, we have added the ability to vary the apparent focus within a light field using intuitive camera-like controls such as a variable aperture and focus ring. As with lumigraphs, we allow for more general and flexible <b>focal</b> <b>surfaces</b> than a typical focal plane. However, this parameterization works independently of scene geometry; {{we do not need}} to recover actual or approximate geometry of the scene for focusing. In addition, we present a method for using multiple <b>focal</b> <b>surfaces</b> in a single image rendering process...|$|R
