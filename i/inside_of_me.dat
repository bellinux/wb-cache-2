It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

He's the boy that lives <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot."

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of [...] "discovering what a big city could offer you and what it could take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me?</b> / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "not an instant classic, but a solid start to the season". Sepinwall said it started slowly, but gradually built to a [...] "very funny, and kinda sweet climax in the conference room". New York magazine writer Will Leitch said [...] "Gossip" [...] appeared to be a return to a more normal Office atmosphere, compared to the surprises and twists of the fifth season. Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said he was concerned the season premiere would not be good because Steve Carell, John Krasinski and Ed Helms would be too distracted with their growing film careers. But, he said, [...] "Thankfully, if Thursday's premiere was any indication, it appears that the Dunder Mifflin crew still has a lot to offer." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said, [...] "'Gossip' had some terrific moments, but I don't know that I'd put it on my all-time great episodes list." [...] She specifically praised the performances of Brian Baumgartner and Jenna Fischer.|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E

The second disc, described by Aguilera herself as [...] "a '20s, '30s vibe," [...] was solely produced by her longtime collaborater–producer Linda Perry. During the recording session, Aguilera wanted to record a song about the pain of losing a loved one and asked Perry for help. Perry developed the idea while thinking about her father, who had died {{less than a year}} ago. She revealed, [...] "And she [...] came to me, and had these two chords that her and this guy wrote, and she was like 'I really like these chords, can you turn this into a song?

Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blaming {{herself for}} the album's {{commercial}} results, Norwood dismissed the album as [...] "too pop."

Commenting on this decision, she later elaborated: [...] "I was listening to the voice of my team more so than what was going on <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> With Human, I felt like I wanted to do more R music and that’s not what we decided to do on that album." [...] The debut season of her 2010 VH1 reality series [...] further revealed that the album's underperformance resulted in another argument between her and executive producer Rodney Jerkins, whose commitment to the project Norwood felt not as [...] "creative and forthcoming" [...] as on previous albums and that he purposefully did not put his best work in the album. Jerkins had distanced himself from the project following its official release, declaring his dissatisfaction with the involvement of other producers on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Hari {{has been}} the subject of a number of police {{investigations}} for charges of assault and has gained a reputation for violent behavior. A psychologist who spoke to Hari in relation to one of his trials, concluded that his success as an athlete and celebrity status, combined with a lack of personal guidance, has resulted in narcissistic personality traits. About his violent eruptions, Hari has said: [...] "I am able to explode at any moment.

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
