5000|$|The {{two main}} {{processing}} techniques for salmon jerky are wet-brining and <b>dry</b> <b>salting.</b> In {{both cases the}} salmon is trimmed into narrow slices and then stored cold for less than one day. After being skinned and frozen, if the fish is to undergo the brining method it will require an additional step in which the salmon is left soaking in wet brine (salt solution) for one hour. It is then removed and the excess water is discarded. After this, in both the wet-brining and <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> method, ingredients such as non-iodized salt, potato starch, or light brown sugar are added. [...] In some smoked salmon jerky products preservatives may also be added to extend the shelf life of the final product. The salmon is then minced with the additives and reformed into thin strips that will be smoked for twenty hours. Between the brining and salting methods for smoked salmon jerky the brining method {{has been found to}} leave the salmon more tender with up to double the moisture content of salted jerky. The salmon jerky that undergoes the <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> method has a tougher texture due to the lower moisture content and water activity. Both forms of salmon jerky still have a much lower moisture content than is found in raw salmon.|$|E

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} <b>dry</b> <b>salting,</b> fish brining or wet-salting is {{performed}} by immersion of fish into brine, or just sprinkling it with salt without draining the moisture. To ensure long-term preservation, the solution has to contain at least 20% of salt, {{a process called}} [...] "heavy salting" [...] in fisheries; heavy-salted fish must be desalted in cold water or milk before consumption. If less salt is used, the fish is suited for immediate consumption, but additional refrigeration is necessary for longer preservation.|$|E
5000|$|This type is {{produced}} by using fresh whole milk. The first step is heating milk at 35 C. Specific enzymes, like rennet and lipase, are then added as liquid solution and the milk starts to coagulate. The curd is kneaded and partially cooked. The curd is broken into many little pieces (of {{the size of a}} nut), whereupon the curd is cooked again at approximately 45 C. Later, this mixture is poured into molds with perforated walls; afterwards there is a first <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> and then the mold is squeezed with a press, usually hydraulic, for about four hours. Then the rounds are wrapped laterally with plastic bands (which put the brand Asiago around the entire form) and are placed in a room called [...] "Frescura" [...] for two to three days to dry.At this point the bandages are removed to allow one last curing by a bath in brine for a period of two days. Then the forms are allowed to rest in a dry environment for a period ranging from 20 to 40 days. The finished cheese has a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 30 - 40 cm and height about 15 cm. The average weight of a wheel is 11 - 15 kg. The crust is thin and elastic; dough inside is soft, buttery, white or slightly yellowish.|$|E

40|$|Several smoking {{conditions}} were examined {{with the objective}} of enhancing the numbers of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by natural means in vacuum-packaged cold-smoked salmon during 21 days of storage at 5 C. Three combinations of salting, drying, and smoking were used: (i) <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> time of salting (2 or 6 h); (ii) wet salting (6 h) <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> (6 h) with mor without sugar; and (iii) wet salting (6 h) <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> (6 h) different times of smoking (2 or 6 h of drying and 2 or 6 h of smoking). Two batches were processed for each set of conditions. Determinations of pH and salt content in the water phase were carried out for products in each treatment. Microbiological analyses (total viable count, total LAB, Lactobacillus spp., and Enterobacteriaceae) also were conducted at the beginning of storage (t 0) and after 21 days of refrigerated storage (t 1). There were differential increases in total LAB and lactobacilli during the storage period according to the treatment performed. The most effective treatment to enhance LAB growth was 6 h of <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> with sugar, 6 h of drying, and 2 h of smoking. These salting-drying-smoking conditions also selected the LAB as the dominant flora {{at the end of the}} storage period. The LAB promoted by these processing parameters seem to be potentially useful protective cultures because of their anti-Listeria activity. From the results of this research, we conclude that it is possible to enhance the growth of LAB in general and that of inhibitory strains in particular by suitable choices of processing parameters...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>dry</b> <b>salting,</b> cold smoking and 14 days refrigerated storage at 4 °C on the stability of carotenoids, color and fatty acids in commercially reared organic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). As reference, conventionally reared Atlantic salmon was used. Pigment sources in feeds for the organic and conventional salmon were Panaferd-AX® (PAN) and Carophyll Pink® (CP), respectively. The <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> process was found to be the main cause for losses of carotenoids throughout salting, smoking and storage, whereas no differences were found in stability of the different flesh carotenoids. The diverse composition of flesh carotenoids in organic salmon seems however to have minor influence on the color of the cold smoked product. Colorimetric characteristics of the fillet surface and liquid loss during storage of cold smoke fillets were found to be mostly affected by the fatty acid composition of the flesh which differed between the organic and conventional raw material. Moreover, <b>dry</b> <b>salting</b> and cold smoking were found to alter colorimetric differences between raw organically and conventionally reared salmon, resulting in an equal colorimetric perception of cold smoked organic and conventional salmon fillets after 14 days refrigerated vacuum storage. Statement of relevance: •This paper investigates the stability of carotenoids, color and fatty acids throughout processing and storage of cold smoked organic farmed Atlantic salmon. •This paper focuses on the diversity of carotenoids presented in organic salmon fed a feed containing Panaferd-AX and how these carotenoids affect the color of the smoked product. •This paper investigates the suitability of the presented organic salmon as raw material for the smoking industry...|$|E

The present work focuses on the meat-salting step, which is the first and critical stage of kaddid's elaboration. Kinetics and modelling of sodium chloride uptake and water loss were investigated for different salting experimental conditions of brine concentration (15 %, 21 % and 26. 5 % w/w) and salting modality (wet and <b>dry</b> <b>salting).</b> The results obtained show an effect of the brine concentration and salting method on water exudation and sodium chloride uptake during meat salting. Furthermore, Zuggarramundi and Lupin's and Peleg's models were satisfactorily tested for the description of water exudation and sodium chloride uptake by beef meat during salting process. Values calculated for sodium chloride apparent diffusivity (D (S)) varied between 4. 08 x 10 (- 10) and 8. 07 x 10 (- 10) m(2) /s and those of water (D (w)) were in the range of 1. 04 x 10 (- 9) to 1. 47 x 10 (- 9) m(2) /s depending on brine concentrations and salting method. In addition, meat quality changes i. e. protein and microbial characteristics, were explored during the salting step. Changes in protein characteristics due to salting process were confirmed by electrophoretic studies of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins. At the lower brine concentration tested (15 %), myofibrillar proteins suffered solubilisation, while at high salt concentration (brining at 26. 5 % and <b>dry</b> <b>salting),</b> they underwent degradation. All salting cases studied have shown an inhibitor effect on microorganism proliferation either after 24 or 48 h of processing. <b>Dry</b> <b>salting</b> during 24 h is the most suitable salting method for kaddid meat elaboration since it allows the highest dehydration level, preserves microbial quality and induces proteolysis which could generate aromatic compounds...|$|E
