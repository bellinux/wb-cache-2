For example, members of the Synapsida generally possess incisors, canines ("eyeteeth"), premolars, and molars. The presence of heterodont dentition is evidence of some degree of feeding/hunting specialization in a species. In contrast, <b>homodont</b> <b>dentition</b> refers to a set of teeth that possess the same tooth morphology.|$|E

50|$|The saber-like {{teeth of}} Tiarajudens are unique among anomodonts, {{a group of}} entirely herbivorous therapsids. Although large canines are often found in carnivores, the {{surrounding}} teeth of Tiarajudens indicate {{that it was an}} herbivore. Tiarajudens is one of the earliest herbivores to possess saber-like canines; previously the oldest known saber-toothed herbivores were large extinct mammals such as Titanoides, which lived around 60 million years ago. The teeth are even larger than those of the carnivorous therapsid Inostrancevia, one of the largest members of Gorgonopsia, a group characterized by the presence of long canines. The large canines of Tiarajudens were likely used as a defense against predators or as a means of fighting for mates; living mammals such as the water deer and musk deer use their saber teeth for these purposes. The palatal teeth are broad and fit tightly together, an adaptation to consuming fibrous plants. This variation in tooth shape, known as a heterodont dentition, is common in mammals. While most other Permian therapsids had <b>homodont</b> <b>dentitions</b> (teeth of the same shape), Tiarajudens is one of the earliest therapsids to have a heterodont dentition.|$|R
40|$|Inference {{of feeding}} {{preferences}} in fossil terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) has been drawn predominantly from craniodental morphology, and less so from fossil specimens preserving conclusive evidence of diet {{in the form}} of oral and/or gut contents. Recently, the pivotal role of insectivory in tetrapod evolution was emphasized by the identification of putative insectivores as the closest relatives of the oldest known herbivorous amniotes. We provide the first compelling evidence for insectivory among early tetrapods on the basis of two 280 -million-year-old (late Palaeozoic) fossil specimens of a new species of acleistorhinid parareptile with preserved arthropod cuticle on their toothed palates. Their dental morphology, consisting of <b>homodont</b> marginal <b>dentition</b> with cutting edges and slightly recurved tips, is consistent with an insectivorous diet. The intimate association of arthropod cuticle with the oral region of two small reptiles, from a rich fossil locality that has otherwise not produced invertebrate remains, strongly supports the inference of insectivory in the reptiles. These fossils lend additional support to the hypothesis that the origins and earliest stages of higher vertebrate evolution are associated with relatively small terrestrial insectivores...|$|R

40|$|EVOLUTIONARY AND DEVELOPMENTAL ASPECTS OF DENTITION OF SQUAMATE REPTILES Summary of the PhD. thesis Dentition and its {{evolutionary}} modifications played {{important roles}} during the radiation of reptiles. It is generally accepted that a plesiomorphic state for reptiles {{is represented by}} <b>homodont,</b> polyphyodont <b>dentition</b> with conical or cylindroconical teeth. However, in contrast to mammalian dentition which {{is the object of}} intensive research, reptilian dentition is studied only rarely. I therefore focused on developmental and evolutionary aspects of squamate dentition and used histological, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods, computerised tomography, rentgenography and scanning electron microskopy. The goals of this work were as following: (a) to choose the model taxa representing squamate lineages relevant from a phylogenetic position as well as possessing dissimilar types of dental adaptations; (b) to evaluate using of these taxa as model species; (c) in these taxa describe basic odontogenic features. As a species with generalized dentition gecko Paroedura picta was chosen, the up coming reptilian model species with features also present in a wide spectrum of other lizards.

5000|$|Desmatosuchus had blunt, bulbous, {{slightly}} recurved teeth. Furthermore, {{they are}} believed to have had <b>homodont</b> <b>dentition.</b> This, combined with its shovel like snout, indicate that Desmatosuchus fed by digging up soft vegetation. This method of feeding is further evidenced by its toothless premaxilla and dentary tip, which were covered in horny sheaths. These sheaths protected the bones and could be used for cutting or holding objects. It is believed that Desmatosuchus dug for food in the soft mud near bodies of water due to the abundance of lakes and rivers in the Dockum area and the fact that Desmatosuchus scutes are often found among parts of other reptiles that are known to have fed along waterways. It is unknown whether or not Desmatosuchus replaced their teeth and, if so, how. The low number of Desmatosuchus teeth that have been discovered indicates that they were only held in place by soft tissue connections. The jaw articulation point is below the tooth line, holding its upper and lower tooth rows parallel while biting {{in a way that is}} reminiscent of ornithischian dinosaurs. [...] The armor and spikes of Desmatosuchus were its only ways to defend itself from predators. The lateral spike rows showed variation in size among individuals, especially the second most anterior spike. This spike was always shorter than the one in front of it, but to what extent varied drastically. This variation may indicate sexual dimorphism. It has also been hypothesized as a form of sexual display. Aside from this armor, Desmatosuchus was defenseless from attacks from carnivores. Several Desmatosuchus bones have been found amongst skeletons of Postosuchus, indicating predation by Postosuchus. The herd nature of Desmatosuchus apparently did little to discourage predators, as Postosuchus along with several other Late Triassic carnivores also traveled in groups.|$|E
40|$|Heterodonty, having {{multiple}} {{different types}} of teeth in the jaws, is well documented in chondrichthyan and sarcopterygian lineages, but is poorly documented within the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes). To further our understanding of actinopterygian dentition, a broad-scale literature review of tooth types across all families of actinopterygian fishes was conducted to (1) summarize the diversity of oral jaw teeth that exists within the group and (2) assess the distribution of heterodonty. Based on a thorough survey of the published literature on actinopterygian fishes, 15 distinct types of oral jaw teeth are recognized and named based on attributes of tooth shape. Heterodonty is widespread within the Actinopterygii and is documented in 20 of the 45 orders ray-finned fishes. The oral jaws of actinopterygiian fishes have 39 distinct forms of heterodonty, which comprise two, three or four different tooth types. The results of ancestral character state reconstruction analyses, conducted {{in conjunction with a}} recently published molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for actinopterygian fishes, confirm that heterodonty has evolved multiple times throughout the evolutionary history of the group and suggest that a <b>homodont</b> <b>dentition</b> comprised only of coniform teeth is a plesiomorphic condition for the Actinopterygii.

40|$|A key {{step in the}} {{evolutionary}} history of Odontoceti (echolocating toothed cetaceans) is {{the transition from the}} ancestral heterodont conditionÂ â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Â characterized by the presence of double-rooted cheek teeth bearing accessory denticlesÂ â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Â to the <b>homodont</b> <b>dentition</b> displayed by most extant odontocete species. During the last few decades, new finds and the reassessment of specimens in collections revealed an increased morphological disparity amongst the Oligoâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Miocene heterodont odontocetes. Based on a partly articulated skeleton from late Early Miocene (Burdigalian, 18. 8 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 318. 0 Ma) beds of the Chilcatay Formation (Pisco Basin, Peru), we describe a new genus and species of heterodont odontocete, Inticetus vertizi, in the new family Inticetidae. This large dolphin is characterized by, amongst other things, a long and robust rostrum bearing at least 18 teeth per quadrant; the absence of procumbent anterior teeth; many large, broad-based accessory denticles in double-rooted posterior cheek teeth; a reduced ornament of dental crowns; the styliform process of the jugal being markedly robust; a large fovea epitubaria on the periotic, with a correspondingly voluminous accessory ossicle of the tympanic bulla; and a shortened tuberculum of the malleus. Phylogenetic analyses (with and without molecular constraint; with and without down-weighting of homoplastic characters) yielded contrasting results, with Inticetus falling either as a stem Odontoceti or as an early branching member of a large Platanistoidea clade. With its large size, robust rostrum and unusual dental morphology, and the absence of conspicuous tooth wear, Inticetus increases the morphological and ecological disparity of Late Oligoceneâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Early Miocene heterodont odontocetes. Finally, this new taxon calls for caution when attempting to identify isolated cetacean cheek teeth, even at the suborder level. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Skull {{morphology}} modification {{and dietary}} {{differences in the}} Triassic small protorosaurs Macrocnemus and Langobardisaurus Renesto S. 1 1 Department of Structural and Functional Biology, Università degli Studi dell’Insubria, via Dunant 3 Varese Italy, silvio. renesto@uninsubria. it Abstract The Protorosauria Huxley 1881 (Prolacertiformes Camp 1945) constitutes a clade of mainly Triassic reptiles among which the genera Macrocnemus, Tanystropheus and Langobardisaurus from the Middle and Late Triassic of Northern Italy, Switzerlandand and recently China, are the best known ones. All genera share the same skeletal architecture, characterized by a long neck formed via elongation of individual vertebrae rather than an increase in their number (with an extreme in Tanystropheus); and a great disparity in length between fore- and hind-limbs. Tanystropheus was aquatic or semiaquatic with different species showing great size variability from the medium-sized T. meridensis, (approx 1, 5 m long) to the very large T. longobardicus, (up to 5 m long), while both Macrocnemus and Langobardisaurus were smaller, swift terrestrial reptiles, able of bipedal gait during fast run. One of the major differences among the similar sized terrestrial taxa (Macrocnemus and Langobardisaurus) {{can be found in}} the dentition and skull architecture: Macrocnemus had simple <b>homodont</b> <b>dentition</b> with small sharp teeth ad a lightly built skull, with sleder jaws, a pattern that fits easily with the model of a carnivore which fed on invertebrates or small vertebrates which were swallowed whole or after very little processing. Langobardisaurus had instead a robust, short and high skull, with a deep lower jaw, peg-like front teeth (absent in the lower jaw) followed by few bulky three-cusped teeth and a large, flattened molariform last tooth and its feeding habits are more difficult to be interpreted. An analysis of the functional and mechanical implications of the dentition, of the skull and of the lower jaw, along with a reconstruction of the jaw musculature by comparison with extant durophagous and herbivorous diapsids and anapsids, suggests that Langobardisaurus was able of complex food processing and may have been an omnivore which fed on hard and/or though food, possibly comprising vegetals...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from a few}} exceptions, extant odontocetes (toothed cetaceans) {{exhibit a}} roughly <b>homodont</b> <b>dentition.</b> The {{transition}} from basilosaurid-like double-rooted cheek teeth with accessory denticles to single-rooted conical teeth occurred during the late Oligocene-early Miocene. At that time, several clades of now extinct, homodont and predominantly long-snouted odontocetes appeared in the fossil record. Among them, members of the genera Argyrocetus Lydekker, 1893 and Macrodelphinus Wilson, 1935, from the early Miocene of the Northeast Pacific and Argentina, were tentatively attributed to the family Eurhinodelphinidae. However, due to the fragmentary state of the specimens, unambiguous apomorphies of the family could not be detected. Based on two well-preserved skulls with associated mandibular elements, discovered in early Miocene layers of the Chilcatay Formation (Pisco Basin, Peru), we report on a new genus and species of long-snouted homodont odontocete, Chilcacetus cavirhinus n. gen., n. sp. Characterized by, among others, the presence of alveoli on the anterior premaxillary portion of the rostrum, {{the lack of a}} lateral groove on the rostrum, anterodorsally elevated nasals, a possibly autapomorphic cavity between nasals and mesethmoid in the posterior wall of the bony nares, a high temporal fossa, and the absence of ankylosis along the mandibular symphysis, C. cavirhinus n. gen., n. sp. does not fit in any of the known odontocete families, but shares several morphological features with Argyrocetus spp. and Macrodelphinus. Our phylogenetic analysis, based on 77 characters for 35 odontocete taxa, suggests the existence of an early Miocene Eastern Pacific long-snouted homodont odontocete clade (with an hypothetical South Atlantic member, the poorly known Argyrocetus patagonicus Lydekker, 1893), distinct from the only superficially similar eoplatanistids and eurhinodelphinids. Furthermore, our consensus tree indicates an early branching of this new clade compared to other homodont odontocete lineages. Unfortunately, the results of the cladistic analysis presented here are not well supported; a reappraisal of Argyrocetus and Macrodelphinus is needed to more clearly define the new clade and bolster its phylogentic position...|$|E
