25|$|In 1827, Wheatstone {{introduced}} his 'kaleidophone', a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye. It {{consists of a}} metal rod, carrying at its end a silvered bead, which reflects a 'spot' of light. As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.|$|E
2500|$|Magnani {{worked with}} Tennessee Williams {{again for the}} 1960 film, The Fugitive Kind (originally titled, Orpheus Descending) {{directed}} by Sidney Lumet, in which she played Lady Torrance and starred with Marlon Brando. The original screenplay Orpheus Descending was another play inspired by Magnani, although she similarly did not feature in the Broadway play. In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date... She is simply a rare being who seems to have about her a little lightning-shot cloud all her own.... In a crowded room she can sit perfectly motionless and silent and still you feel the atmospheric tension of her presence, its quiver and hum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> live wire exposed, and a mood of Anna's is like the presence of royalty." ...|$|E
60|$|Then she wriggled {{her fingers}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> white butterflies, shrugged her {{shoulders}} elaborately, {{rose from the}} rail, and sat down {{beside him on the}} steps, quite matter-of-factly.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} for the song, was {{released}} on July 10, 2011. <b>In</b> it, <b>the</b> members of the band are suspended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> puppets, while singing and playing musical instruments.|$|R
60|$|Here I thought I heard a faint sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> hiss of a snake, {{but as it}} was not {{repeated}} and I could see nothing, concluded that I was mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blackbeard," [...] he {{continued}} with a grave, puzzled manner, [...] "said that this world {{on which we}} stand floats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bird, and spins round!" ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{he could}} turn to look, the cutter seemed to be blown up by a bomb. He rose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vaulter, and when he fell the light went out.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} passed, then, {{with a final}} scratch and {{splutter}} Joseph flung down his pen. With the sandbox tilted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dicer about to make his throw, {{he looked at the}} lad.|$|E
6000|$|He struck first a heavy blow on his {{inflated}} chest: and, {{throwing out}} horizontally a big arm that remained steady, extended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> limb {{of a tree}} on a windless day-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who--Edgar?" [...] said Melbury, abruptly. [...] "Matter? Nothing. What, my dear, {{and have}} you got home safe? Why, you are better already! But you {{ought not to be}} out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
5000|$|What is now Maple Street {{was once}} called Cowturd Lane, due to [...] "the smell of manure, fresh from cows walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road {{on their way}} to (pasture) and back, hanging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> swamp gas." ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{dismissal}} had dispersed the on-lookers, Lawson {{turned to}} Curtis. [...] "The old man's {{work as a}} speaker is done. Rather tragic business, don't you think? He was assailing you with the utmost bitterness. His big, right fist was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hammer when he fell; {{but it was his}} last effort." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked over}} each shoulder, {{to make sure}} that they were alone then lifted her off the ground (she was no light weight), held her up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby, and gave her a rough loud-sounding kiss on each cheek. [...] "With kind {{compliments}} from yours truly!" [...] he said--and burst out laughing, and put her down again.|$|E
60|$|Supper entered accordingly, borne in by Joceline and Phoebe, {{and after}} it, leaning {{on a huge}} knotty stick, and having his nose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> questing hound--for his {{attention}} was apparently more fixed on the good provisions that went before him, than any thing else--came Master Kerneguy, and seated himself, without much ceremony, {{at the lower end}} of the table.|$|E
6000|$|Its {{roots are}} bristling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>Like</b> some mad Earth-god's spiny hair; The loud south-wester's swell and yell Smote it at midnight, and it fell. [...] Thus ends the tree [...] Where Some One sat with me.|$|R
50|$|Overseer UAVRS-F is {{a family}} of {{unmanned}} blimps of varying sizes, mainly intended for aerial survey and photography use. Unmanned blimps can hover at fixed position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> helicopters, blimps can perform do so {{at a much lower}} cost than unmanned helicopters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{does the}} Lombardy poplar hold its {{branches}} straight up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> that, {{when all the}} other poplars hold theirs out or hang them down?" [...] interjected Peter, who had been gazing intently at the slender spire showing darkly against the fine blue eastern sky.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{he could}} turn to look, the cutter seemed to be blown up by a bomb, and he rose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vaulter; he saw the traces part, he felt the reins slip through his hands, and that was all; he seemed to fall an immeasurable depth into a black abyss.... The next that he knew was a curious soft murmur of voices, out of which a sweet, agonized girl-voice broke, {{familiar}} but unrecognized: ...|$|E
60|$|Here, helping himself {{along with}} two crotched roots, hobbled a dwarf without legs; another stalked before, one arm fixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{lightning}} rod; a third, more active than any, seal-like, flirted a pair of flippers, and went skipping along; a fourth hopped on a solitary pin, at every bound, spinning round like a top, to gaze; while still another, furnished with feelers or fins, rolled himself up in a ball, bowling over the ground in advance.|$|E
60|$|The Power of Evil sat {{looking down}} upon them, huger than {{a rock in}} the sea, or an alp with forked summits. A certain horrible majesty {{augmented}} the terrors of his aspect. His eyes reddened; his poisonous look hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comet; the mouth, as it opened {{in the midst of}} clouds of beard, seemed an abyss of darkness and blood; and out of it, as from a volcano, issued fires, and vapours, and disgust.|$|E
50|$|The flying {{gurnards}} are a family, Dactylopteridae, {{of marine}} fish notable for their greatly enlarged pectoral fins. As they cannot literally fly or glide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> (<b>like</b> flying fish), an alternative name preferred by some authors is helmet gurnards. They are <b>the</b> only family <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suborder Dactylopteroidei.|$|R
60|$|The {{strong breeze}} from astern now filling the ill-set sails, they bellied, and rocked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> balloons, while, from the novel strain upon it, every spar quivered and sprung. And thus, like a frightened gull fleeing from sea-hawks, the little Parki swooped along, and bravely breasted the brine.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Wagamese in {{his review}} criticised Bergen for {{presenting}} [...] "little of the racial tension that could be smelled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> cordite". Canadian author and critic Geoff Pevere <b>in</b> his <b>The</b> Toronto Star review criticed novel's narrative tone and mentioned that it is [...] "long on incident and short on joy".|$|R
60|$|An arrow sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> huge hornet; {{it struck}} old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades, and pierced him clean through, {{and he fell}} forward on his face among the cabbages. Hatch, with a broken cry, leapt into the air; then, stooping double, {{he ran for the}} cover of the house. And in the {{meanwhile}} Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac, and had his crossbow bent and shouldered, covering the point of the forest.|$|E
60|$|It {{developed}} that the Sioux {{were waiting for}} night. A fiery arrow, speeding from a bow in the twilight, left a curve of sparks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> falling rocket. It {{appeared to be a}} signal for demoniacal yells on all sides. Rifle-shots ceased to come from the slopes. As darkness fell gleams of little fires shot up from all around. The Sioux were preparing to shoot volleys of burning arrows down into the camp.|$|E
6000|$|But {{how would}} you be astonished, in these melancholy days, when {{children}} don't read children's books, nor believe any more in fairies, if suddenly a real benevolent fairy, in a bright brick- red gown, were to rise {{in the midst of}} the red bricks, and to tap the heap of them with her wand, and say, [...] "Bricks, bricks, to your places!" [...] and then you saw in an instant the whole heap rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swarm of red bees, and--you have been used to see bees make a honeycomb, and to think that strange enough, but now you would see the honeycomb make itself!--You want to ask something, Florrie, by the look of your eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The 1994 Stone Temple Pilots album Purple {{includes}} the hidden track [...] "My Second Album", {{which has the}} lyric, [...] "This album cover looks similar - like Johnny Mathis". That album cover features a toddler with his arm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> (<b>like</b> Mathis does on this one) as he's riding a dragon.|$|R
6000|$|... "They were a {{lot more}} nervous than we were, at the last. They sent up enough light at night from their trenches--you know, those things that burst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> {{electric}} light--we had none of that to do--they did it all for us--lit up everything. They were more nervous than we were...." ...|$|R
5000|$|A song {{based in}} wistful retrospection, [...] "In the Summertime" [...] {{is perhaps the}} most relaxed, upbeat song on the entire album. Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone opined that [...] "In the Summertime" [...] has [...] "a lovely feel to it, and Dylan's {{harmonica}} playing hangs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> scent of mimosa." ...|$|R
6000|$|Calm, resolved, steady in {{his great}} purpose, he was {{stretching}} his hand towards the pen when {{he happened to}} glance towards the bed. He rushed at it, enraged, with a mental scream: [...] "it's you, crazy fanatic, who stands in the way!" [...] He flung the pillow on the floor violently, tore the blankets aside.... Nothing there. And, turning away, he caught for an instant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vivid detail in a dissolving view of two heads, the eyes of General T--- and of Privy-Councillor Mikulin side by side fixed upon him, quite different in character, but with the same unflinching and weary and yet purposeful expression...servants of the nation! ...|$|E
60|$|But {{how would}} you be astonished, in these melancholy days, when {{children}} don't read children's books, nor believe any more in fairies, if suddenly a real benevolent fairy, in a bright brick-red gown, were to rise {{in the midst of}} the red bricks, and to tap the heap of them with her wand, and say: 'Bricks, bricks, to your places!' and then you saw in an instant the whole heap rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swarm of red bees, and--you have been used to see bees make a honeycomb, and to think that strange enough, but now you would see the honeycomb make itself!--You want to ask something, Florrie, by the look of your eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Hastily {{descending}} the mound, the {{two friends}} strode boldly towards their opponents, scorning to let them see by look or gesture that they were either fatigued or depressed. As they drew near, Erling singled out Hake, and Glumm went towards a tall, powerful man, who stood ready with a huge sword resting on his shoulder, as if eager to begin the combat. Glumm had arranged {{in his own mind}} that that man and he should die together. Beside him stood a warrior with a battle-axe, and a steel helmet on his head. Before Glumm could reach his intended victim the tall man's sword flashed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gleam of light, and the head with the steel helmet went spinning on the ground! ...|$|E
60|$|Then he towered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> an eagle, for {{his limbs}} were strong again; and he flew all night across the {{mountain}} till the day began to dawn, and rosy-fingered Eos came blushing up the sky. And then, behold, beneath {{him was the}} long green garden of Egypt and the shining stream of Nile.|$|R
60|$|His tone lingered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> almost <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tone of {{a musical}} instrument.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not blowing, at least,' said Paul, 'but {{sounding}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sea sounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shells. It was {{a beautiful}} night. When I had listened to the water for a long time, I got up and looked out. There was a boat over there, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full light of the moon; a boat with a sail.' ...|$|R
