40|$|During a XPS {{study of}} oxide growth and {{segregation}} on commercial aluminium-silicon alloys, problems were {{encountered in the}} application of C 1 <b>s</b> <b>charge</b> referencing. Using the C 1 s peak maximum as a reference, shifts were observed in the aluminium and magnesium peak positions, particularly after high temperature oxidation, which could not be accounted for. Referencing against the native oxide O 1 s peak corrected the shifts. A consequent analysis of the C 1 s spectra revealed that the hydrocarbon contamination was reacting under the conditions used to oxidise the alloys. From the XPS results it is deduced that active sites on the oxidised alloy surface are responsible for catalytic cracking and oxidation of the adventitious hydrocarbon. Parallel studies on other heat treated oxidic systems have produced similar results. It is recommended that an alternative to C 1 <b>s</b> <b>charge</b> referencing should be used when performing XPS studies on heat treated oxidic systems...|$|R

40|$|Melanin, {{the human}} skin pigment, is an {{emerging}} bioelectronic material {{due to its}} unique electrical properties aswell as being readily prepared in electronic grade thin films on the nanometer scale. These electrical properties include bistable electrical switching, broadband optical absorbance, Arrhenius-dependent conductivity, and an electron paramagnetic free-radical signal. Furthermore, melanin has other electrical properties, such as water-dependent conductivity and potential protonic conduction. However, to use melanin as a bioelectronic material, greater clarity is required on its charge transport behavior. Here we show that the current charge transport model for melanin, an amorphous semiconductor model, cannot describe melanin 2 ̆ 7 s hydration-dependent conductivity. We go on to show with a hydration-dependent muon spin resonance (μSR) experiment that melanin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charge</b> transport properties are described by a comproportionation reaction, inwhichwater self-dopes the system with extra charge carriers. This new understanding of melanin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charge</b> transport properties opens up new avenues of exploration.

40|$|Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charge</b> {{was that}} Romer is {{inconsistent}} with both {{the rule of law}} and the system of democracy. In this Comment, I join Professor Schacter and other scholars in responding to Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charge.</b> Romer subserves, rather than undermines, the rule of law in America 2 ̆ 7 s representative democracy. I make three kinds of arguments. The first argument challenges Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of 2 ̆ 2 majority-rules 2 ̆ 2 democracy as the basis for legitimate state decision making. According to the Framers 2 ̆ 7 design, which guaranteed 2 ̆ 2 republican 2 ̆ 2 governance at both the state and federal levels, majoritarianism is not the litmus test for government legitimacy. Indeed, the Framers expected law to be shaped by courts as well as by popular majorities. The second argument combines gaylegal history with a theory of courts: A key role for the judiciary is to resist Kulturkampf, and to help the political system repudiate the legacy of Kulturkampf. A third argument is representation-reinforcing. By invalidating local rules protecting openly gay people against job discrimination, the Colorado initiative impaired the ability of lesbian, gay, and bisexual citizens to exercise their political rights. Conversely, by resisting those antidiscrimination rules, the Court was in a small way helping to restore conditions needed for the effective operation of a majority-rules democratic process...|$|R

The charging decision involves an extraordinary exercise of discretionary power that is unreviewable. As a result, the decision is difficult to guide except in the broadest terms. The proposed revisions to the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s Criminal Justice Standards for the Prosecution Function attempt to address several key issues that inform the charging decision, by broadening the language of several provisions of the current Standards as well as adding several new provisions. To be sure, the proposed Standards significantly change the current Standards with respect to the proper factors and considerations affecting a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charging</b> decision. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether these Standards purport to establish ethical guidelines for prosecution, or merely guidelines for a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of judgment and policy in the charging function.

40|$|AbstractFew {{experimental}} data illuminate {{the relationship between}} the molecular structures that mediate ion conduction through voltage-dependent ion channels and the structures responsible for sensing transmembrane voltage and controlling gating. To fill this void, we have used a strongly cationic, mutated μ-conotoxin peptide, which only partially blocks current through voltage-dependent sodium channels, to study voltage-dependent activation gating in both bound and unbound channels. When the peptide binds to the ion-conducting pore, it inhibits channel opening, necessitating stronger depolarization for channel activation. We show that this activation shift could result entirely from electrostatic inhibition of the movement of the voltage-sensing <b>S</b> 4 <b>charges</b> and estimate the approximate physical distance through which the <b>S</b> 4 <b>charges</b> move...|$|R

40|$|Standards, {{including}} IEC 60479 - 1 and - 2, provide current-based {{ventricular fibrillation}} thresholds (VFT) for stimuli durations between 0. 1 ms and 10 s. It {{has been established}} {{that the amount of}} electrical charge, not the current calculated by root-mean-square, is most representative of the effects of cardiac stimulation. There are no unified models that present transthoracic charge VFTs {{for a wide range of}} stimuli durations. This work proposes a new unified charge model applicable to transthoracic stimuli durations ranging over 1 μs - 300 s. VFTs were compiled from our previous animal work and from other published reports, including from the studies that provided the raw data for IEC 60479 - 1 and - 2. Our study goal was to cover a wide range of stimuli durations, for which reliable data exists. Consistent data were found for stimuli durations covering the range of 1 μs - 300 s where VFTs were expressed as charge. The model predicted a transthoracic charge VFT of 1 mC at 1 μs duration. The charge VFT increased with stimulus duration and reached 10 C at 300 s. Presenting the first charge-based transthoracic VFT model covering stimuli durations over 1 μs - 300 s, we found 3 behavioral regions of charge VFT vs. duration. For short stimuli durations, 1 μs - 10 ms, VFTs followed a classic Weiss charge strength-duration curve. For long stimuli, longer than 5 <b>s,</b> <b>charge</b> VFTs can be approximated using a 38 mArms constant current model.
