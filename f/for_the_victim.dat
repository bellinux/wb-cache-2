5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} has {{a reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors.

25|$|A shark will {{normally}} {{make one}} swift attack and then retreat to wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> to die or weaken from shock and blood loss, {{before returning to}} feed. This protects the shark from injury from a wounded and aggressive target; however, it also allows humans {{time to get out}} of the water and survive. Shark attacks may also occur due to territorial reasons or as dominance over another shark species, resulting in an attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{body parts}} {{appear to be}} classed for {{compensation}} based on how much use they have in society. The higher the use; the higher the compensation cost. Loss of hearing, for example, as well as loss of testes and/or penis incur very high redress rates, because their loss will cause either danger or an inability to continue lineage, which was highly important in such a kin-based society. The tongue is also particularly high because, as with the ear, it would have formed the primary means of communication <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poitou {{testified that}} he and Henriet burned the bodies in the {{fireplace}} in Gilles' room. The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized. The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit, the moat, or other hiding places. The last recorded murder was of the son of Éonnet de Villeblanche and his wife Macée.

25|$|Church {{doctrine}} protected {{human life}} {{so it was}} problematic if a victim were to die, especially before they confessed. In difficult cases, when a victim would not readily confess or {{was too weak to}} continue in an uninterrupted torture session, breaks were allowed between torture sessions because Inquisition regulations only allowed one torture session per victim. That way, a torture session could resume after a break to allow time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> to recover or reconsider their opposition to confessing, and it was considered to have been the continuation of the previous torture session and not a new one.|$|E
25|$|If {{it seemed}} that the patient would recover but still needed nursing, the injurer was {{responsible}} for that. This was known as sick maintenance, rendering variously crólige, folog n-othrusa, folog, or othrus in different texts. Bretha Crólige goes into great detail about this process, describing how the injurer had to find a suitable location and move the victim. Then the injurer had to pay for food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> and a retinue—which could be considerable depending on the victim's rank. The injurer also had to provide someone to fulfill the victim's duties while he was incapacitated. He also had to pay a fine for the missed opportunity for procreation if appropriate.|$|E
25|$|While penetrative rape {{generally}} {{does not}} involve {{the use of a}} condom, in some cases a condom is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission, both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of sex workers or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning {{and the use of the}} condom as an added prop. Concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> is generally not considered a factor.|$|E

25|$|Counseling {{is another}} means of {{managing}} the effects of domestic violence. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> of abuse, counseling may include {{an assessment of the}} presence, extent and types of abuse. A lethality assessment is a tool that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle abuse in their relationship. In a study of victims of attempted domestic violence-related homicide, only about one-half of the participants recognized that their perpetrator was capable of killing them, as many domestic violence victims minimize the true seriousness of their situation. Another important component is safety planning, which allows the victim to plan for dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their decision on whether remain with their perpetrator.|$|E
