5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the <b>general</b> <b>surgery</b> ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it was just a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the <b>general</b> <b>surgery</b> ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town. He opened a private clinic in <b>general</b> <b>surgery</b> for poor people and African Americans, as blacks had very limited access to medical services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few {{hospitals}} to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center.|$|E

He dies soon thereafter, and when dealing with his effects, Donna learns that he unknowingly fathered another daughter. Though her half-sister is recently deceased, Donna meets her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell), who is being raised by her grandmother, Patti (Barbara Drennan). Within weeks, Patti also dies, and Donna decides to adopt Mia. She and her friend Maria (Phoebe Thomas) compete for a ward sister position on the <b>general</b> <b>surgery</b> ward. Although Maria is the successful applicant, she realises that Donna needs the job in order to support Mia, and withdraws her candidacy so Donna is appointed sister. Donna falls in love with agency nurse Kieran Callaghan (Barry Sloane), and is devastated when he is called to serve in Afghanistan with the Territorial Army (TA).

5|$|In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine. When Negus {{had been}} {{training}} as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology {{had been part of}} <b>general</b> <b>surgery,</b> but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons. Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was {{also a member of the}} college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma. This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the National Health Service (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS.|$|E
