5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.

5|$|Thurstan {{refused to}} accept that the new Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was his superior, and did not help with William's consecration. The dispute between the two continued, and both archbishops carried their {{complaints}} in person to Rome twice. In 1126, Pope Honorius II ruled in favour of York. The pope based his <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fact that Canterbury's supporting documents had been forged.|$|E

The only {{shopping}} centre, Swansgate, previously known as the Arndale Centre, {{was built in the}} 1970s.

5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, he {{was elected}} county judge of Bourbon County. His most notable ruling in this {{capacity}} was to nullify the apprenticeship contracts of the Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky. Hawes based this <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Bureau's powers extended only to states that {{had been part of}} the rebellion, which Kentucky had not. Hawes was also chosen master commissioner of the circuit court in 1866. In 1871, Hawes was mentioned as a possible candidate for governor of Kentucky. In 1876, he helped frame his party's response to the disputed Hayes–Tilden presidential election. Hawes died in Paris, Kentucky on May 25, 1877 and was interred in Paris Cemetery.|$|E

In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months.

5|$|In late 1164 Roger led a {{deputation}} from Henry II that {{visited the}} papal court, or curia, {{to try to}} persuade Alexander III that any <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deposition of Becket should take place in England under a papal legate, rather than in Rome. While Becket was in exile, Roger also managed to secure papal permission for archbishops of York to carry their cross in front of them anywhere in England, a right that had long been a bone of contention between Canterbury and York. Later, the pope rescinded the permission, but consistently refused to give primacy to either Canterbury or York in their struggles.|$|E

5|$|On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard {{to conduct}} {{trials of the}} anti-submarine version of the Whirlwind helicopter. They were {{successful}} enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and Perseus ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was towed to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion to be cancelled and the ship was towed to Gare Loch to await a <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship's disposition. Perseus sold for scrap in May 1958 and towed to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.|$|E
