If the timing device is a pendulum, the increased frictional forces will decrease the Q factor, increasing the resonance band, and decreasing its precision. For spring driven clocks, the <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> applied by the spring changes as the spring is unwound, following Hooke's law. For gravity driven clocks, the <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> also increases as the driving weight falls and more chain suspends the weight from the gear train; in practice, however, this effect is only seen in large public clocks, and it can be avoided by a closed-loop chain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the putter's club head has {{undergone}} radical change in the last 20-30 years, as have many club types. The putter was originally a forged iron piece very similar in shape to the irons of the day. Through attempts to lower {{the center of gravity}} of the club head, it evolved into a shorter, thicker head slightly curved from front to rear (the so-called [...] "hot dog" [...] putter). The introduction of investment casting for club heads allowed drastically different shapes to be made far more easily and cheaply than with forging, resulting in several design improvements. First of all, the majority of mass behind the clubface was placed as low as possible, resulting in an L-shaped side profile with a thin, flat club face and another thin block along the bottom of the club behind the face. Additionally, peripheral weighting, or the placing of mass as far away {{from the center of the}} clubface as possible, increases the moment of inertia of the club head, reducing twisting if the club contacts the ball slightly off-center and thus giving the club a larger [...] "sweet spot" [...] with which to contact the ball. Newer innovations include replacing the metal at the [...] "sweet spot" [...] with a softer metal or polymer compound that will give and rebound at impact, which increases the peak <b>impulse</b> (<b>force</b> x time) imparted to the ball for better distance. Putters are subdivided into mallet, peripheral weighted and blade styles. Power instability and practice/play convertibility are features embodied in the latest putter design technology.|$|E

Mixtures of propane and oxygen with nitrogen dilution of 10 %, 25 % and 50 %, were used as the combustible medium. Experiments were done at 3 stoichiometric level; 0. 75, 1 and 1. 25.

Detonation was not observed both for the case of lean mixture case as well as when the dilution of nitrogen was increased beyond 25 %. In the case where the detonation was not observed, the tube experienced less acceleration rate, resulting in reduction of the <b>impulse</b> <b>force.</b> By decreasing the amount of nitrogen and/or increasing the stoichiometric level, detonation mode of combustion wave propagation was observed and the tube experienced high acceleration rate thus increasing the <b>impulse</b> <b>force...</b>|$|E

As a measure for redundancy resolution of a mobile manipulator, an effective inertia at the end effector in the operational space is proposed and investigated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a parallel-kinematic hexapod tool driven by pneumatic actuators. It consists of six discrete linear actuators, {{each of which is}} assembled as an antagonistic setup of McKibben pneumatic muscles with pressure and position sensors. Thanks to the antagonistic principle of the units together with the inherently nonlinear behaviour of Mc-Kibben actuators, the stiffness of the hexapod can be adjusted and thus selected within a wide range. As a whole, the hexapod can be considered as a simple adjustable passive damping and uncoupling unit that can be mounted at the TCP of a serial industrial robot, for example. As second application, the unit {{can be used as a}} combined sensor/actor device with the ability to give a force feedback to the user. The unit can therefore be used as a stand-alone device where the forces applied to the hexapod’s TCP can be measured and the TCP’s position can be altered corresponding to the desired force of the respective application. The main targeted area of application is warm compact-forging assisted by industrial robots. This process is characterized by high <b>impulse</b> <b>forces.</b> In case of a conventional robot holding the workpiece in-process, these <b>force</b> <b>impulses</b> are lead from the workpiece through the endeffector and the gears into the robot’s electrical drives. Since the stiff mechanical structure of the gears is not well-designed for high <b>impulse</b> <b>forces,</b> today the parts have to be released during the process.

40|$|In CG community, {{many kinds}} of physical-based (impulse-based) {{approaches}} such as Mirtich’s and Baraff’s ones have been proposed for showing dynamic animation.

40|$|The {{superior}} hydrodynamics of circular tanks over rectangular {{tanks are}} well known by aquaculturists; yet rectangular tanks are still widely used because of their easier handling. As a consequence, several {{studies have focused on}} the hydrodynamics of rectangular tanks, where rotating flow cells are generated by injecting water tangentially to the tank wall with the outlet placed {{in the center of the}} cell. In the present work, we evaluate the hydrodynamics in a rectangular tank with 4 rotating flow cells of 1 m diameter, which is called multivortex tank. We also analyze baffle placement between two consecutive water inlets and the characteristics of the water inlet (flow rate and inlet velocity), which then allows us to determine the average velocities and the distribution uniformity of these velocities. The obtained results are compared with a circular tank having the same cell diameter and inlet configurations as the multivortex tank. Baffle placement between two consecutive water inlets in the multivortex tank helps increase the average velocity, the uniformity of velocities and the symmetry in the rotating flow cells. In configurations without baffles, the combination of low flow rate and high <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> present the lowest symmetry. Differences between intermediate and extreme cells were observed. In all configurations tested, velocities and uniformities were higher in extreme cells than in intermediate cells. In the circular tank the average velocities achieved were higher than in the multivortex tank with the same <b>impulse</b> <b>force,</b> but the uniformity of velocities were higher in the multivortex tank. Finally, the proportionality between the average velocity and the square root of the <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> for a specific tank geometry has been corroborated in commercial scale models.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how walking with T-Poles, training using T-Poles and increased walking speed would change GRF measures in elderly subjects. The magnitudes of peak force, average force, and <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> variables decreased as a result of the T-Pole use. Time during support phase increased when using T-Poles. The magnitudes of peak force, average force, and <b>impulse</b> <b>force,</b> and time variables decreased with extended training using T-Poles. However, loading rate increased with training and practice. FZ 3, AZP, and AZ showed interactions between T-Pole use and training and TP showed an interaction between T-Pole use and walking speed. The results of this investigation suggest that using T-Poles generally reduces foot-ground force interaction during walking. It is a tendency that the foot-ground interactions during walking with TPoles decreased more with the longer period of T-Pole use and significant interactions between T-Pole use and training were observed in AZ 3, AZP, and AZ. The reductions of foot-ground interaction induced by the T-Pole and practice time using T-Poles were present regardless of increased walking speed. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

In this paper, individual contributions of these two components to dynamic normal and shear stresses in a beam are investigated, and their roles {{in the development of}} cracks in a beam are briefly addressed. A cantilever beam subject to an impulse tip force of different time durations is chosen as an example to illustrate their respective effects. The contributions of the k b-component are studied in particular, since it changes its wave characteristics from evanescent to propagating when its frequency exceeds the critical frequency. For an <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> of long duration, it is shown that the k b-component is dominant in the normal stress while the k a-component is dominant in the shear stress. They would play dominant roles for Mode I and Mode II of crack propagation, respectively. For an <b>impulse</b> <b>force</b> of short duration, both normal and shear stresses are dominated by the k a-component. Therefore, the k a-component would play a dominant role for both Mode I and Mode II of crack propagation. It should be noted, however, k a- and k b-components above the critical frequency contribute almost equally to both normal and shear stresses, regardless of the duration of the force.
