5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in his Atlético Madrid career, Costa's {{physical}} {{play was}} used in support of Radamel Falcao, thus ensuring a lower goalscoring rate. After Falcao was sold in 2013, the attack was restructured around Costa by manager Diego Simeone. Simeone, who like Costa {{was known for his}} competitiveness and aggression, <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> to enhance his discipline while retaining his determination.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|Smith's metallurgists <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> of {{fabricating}} boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They {{also had}} to work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure uranium metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure uranium metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.|$|E
5|$|Walker began {{monitoring}} Riley and denying him {{access to}} liquor, but Riley <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> to evade Walker. At {{a stop at}} the Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room. He became too drunk to perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E

For example, Standard created the first synthetic competitor for beeswax and bought the company that invented and produced Vaseline, the Chesebrough Manufacturing Co., which was a Standard company only from 1908 until 1911.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Left 4 Dead {{and other}} Source Engine-based games, {{a number of}} players have {{constructed}} new maps, campaigns, and other variations for Left 4 Dead 2, supported by Valve through their software development kit for the game. With the kit, players have <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> to include the original Left 4 Dead campaigns into Left 4 Dead 2. Players have also <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> {{to increase the number}} of survivors up to 16, duplicating the graphics for the existing survivor characters as needed. In August 2010, Valve announced that it will promote selected community generated maps, one every two weeks, both by blog posts on their official site, and by offering the map on a number of their dedicated servers. Valve updated the game in January 2013 to include support for Steam Workshop, allowing users to create and share new scenarios, maps, clothing and weapons. and to create Mutation-like changes that can be applied to existing maps. A further patch in February 2013 introduced a new scripting system, Expanded Mutation System, that gives programmers more control and options to create new Mutations that can be played across any map or to customize behavior in specific campaigns; one such user-created Mutation creates an experience similar to the Zombie mode in , allowing players to buy weapons and barricades to fight off waves of zombies.|$|E
