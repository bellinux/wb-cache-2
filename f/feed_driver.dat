The antenna {{consists of an}} orthogonal coupling <b>feed</b> <b>driver</b> and stacked director array, with the overall size 50 × 50 × 160 mm 3. Dual-polarization is excited by the orthogonal coupling lines, and the director array contributes to the bidirectional radiation. Both the coupling <b>feed</b> <b>driver</b> and directors are printed on FR 4 substrate and supported by plastic pillars. The measured bandwidth of the two ports are 2. 33 – 2. 62 GHz (11. 8 %) and 2. 32 – 2. 64 GHz (13 %) under the condition of VSWR less than 2. The isolation between two ports is lower than − 20 dB. The peak gains along one radiation direction are 9. 65 dBi and 9. 30 dBi for each port, with highly symmetric bidirectional beam pattern. The proposed antenna is compact and suitable for dual-polarized bidirectional 2. 4 GHz WLAN applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in the worldwide electricity production in the coming decades, since they provide an economically attractive, reliable and low-carbon source of electricity with plenty of resources available for at least the coming hundreds of years. However, the design of nuclear reactors can be improved significantly in terms of safety, by designing reactors with fully passive safety systems, and sustainability, by making more efficient use of natural resources in so-called breeder reactors, and by reducing the radiotoxicity and storage time of the waste produced by the reactor. The application of a thorium breeder fuel cycle within a Pebble Bed High Temperature Reactor could provide such improvements. The core of a Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) consists of a helium cooled random stacking of graphite spheres, which contain many small coated fuel particles retaining radioactive fission products for temperatures below 1600 degrees Celsius. In case of a Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC), the most serious accident that can occur in a PBR, decay heat can be removed from the core by passive means without the maximum fuel temperature exceeding 1600 degrees Celsius. This is due to its relatively small core radius and low power density. Thorium fuel cycles offer several interesting advantages. Thorium is three to four times more abundant in the earth's crust than uranium. In a closed breeder cycle, thorium can significantly reduce the radiotoxicity and storage time of nuclear waste, and all natural resources mined, i. e. Th- 232 or U- 235 and U- 238, can be used for electricity production instead of roughly 1 % of the natural uranium resources consumed by current light water reactors. Furthermore, the Th/U- 233 fuel cycle has favourable nuclear properties, i. e. the neutron reproduction factor of U- 233 and the relatively high thermal neutron capture cross section of Th- 232, for use in thermal breeder reactors, like a PBR. This thesis work investigates whether it is possible to achieve a thorium breeder fuel cycle in a pebble bed reactor within a practical operating regime and without compromising passive safety. Furthermore, the reactor should also achieve a net U- 233 production within a limited time frame. Neutronics studies of the fuel design show that the conversion of thorium into U- 233 can be maximized for thorium pebbles with a large heavy metal loading of 30 g, a conservative maximum from a fuel fabrication perspective, and a standard fuel kernel radius of 0. 025 cm, preferably irradiated at low specific power to improve k-inf. Reprocessing or adding moderator pebbles is required to raise the k-inf of these pebbles above unity. Cylindrical cores, consisting of a central driver zone surrounded by a breeder zone and reflector regions, were investigated during equilibrium core design studies. 30 g thorium pebbles are inserted in the breeder zone, while a higher carbon to heavy metal ratio is used in the driver zone. Results obtained by an equilibrium core calculation scheme show that the uranium content from both the discharged driver and uranium pebbles has to be reprocessed after their final passage to achieve breeding. As a next step, coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic design studies using a coupled DALTON/THERMIX code scheme were performed to investigate whether it is possible to combine passive safety and breeding, within a practical operating regime, inside a thorium PBR. Additionally, the equilibrium core calculation scheme was extended to include the spectral influence of surrounding zones (driver, breeder and reflector) into the fuel depletion calculations. High conversion ratios (CR > 0. 96) and passive safety can be combined in a thorium PBR within a practical operating regime. Increasing the U- 233 content of the fresh driver pebbles (18 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0135) can already be achieved for a 220 cm core and 80 cm driver zone radius, but the temperature feedback is too weak to compensate the reactivity insertion due to decay of Xe- 135 during a DLOFC without scram. With a lower U- 233 content per driver pebble (10 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0036) and passive safety can be combined for a 300 cm core and 100 cm driver zone radius operating at a power of 100 MWth, but this requires a doubling of the pebble handling speed and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, which may present a challenge from an engineering perspective. The maximum fuel temperature during a DLOFC without scram was 1481 degrees Celsius, still quite a bit below the TRISO failure temperature. The maximum reactivity insertion due to water ingress is also limited (+ 1497 pcm). For this 100 MWth passively safe thorium breeder PBR design, the total control rod worth is far insufficient in the radial reflector to achieve cold reactor shutdown, requiring a worth of over 15, 000 pcm. 3 D heterogeneous KENO calculations show that 20 control rods, positioned just outside the driver zone, can provide sufficient reactivity worth. Furthermore, the insertion of a neutron absorber gas, like BF 3, can be considered as an additional emergency shutdown system. Finally, the running-in phase of the passively safe thorium breeder PBR was analysed using a simplified core depletion model, which solves the depletion equations with an axial fuel movement term for the most relevant actinides and a lumped fission product pair. Enriched uranium (U- 235 /U- 238) is used during the first 1300 days of reactor operation and U- 233 /Th fuel is used afterwards. By clever adjustment of the enrichment or U- 233 weight fraction of the <b>feed</b> <b>driver</b> fuel over time, the thorium PBR can start to breed U- 233 within 7 years after starting reactor operation. Furthermore, a basic safety analysis for the various stages of the running-in phase indicates that passive safety is also ensured during any stage of the running-in phase. This thesis work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve breeding within a passively safe thorium pebble bed reactor after a limited time (< 7 years), though the margins in terms of breeding, passive safety and practical constraints are rather small. Therefore, the passively safe thorium breeder PBR design presented requires a doubling of the fuel pebble handling speed, compared to the HTR-PM, and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, while also some other technical difficulties still have to be addressed, such as the large pumping power requirement and the modelling of the conus region and defueling chutes. However, these issues are no fundamental limitation for the application of a thorium breeder cycle within a passively safe PBR, which could offer a huge improvement in terms of safety and sustainability of nuclear power for future generations.

40|$|Introduction Biosecurity {{protocols}} {{reduce the}} introduction and spread of pathogens among swine farms. For pigs, biosecurity ensures market stability, maintains export opportunities, and controls spread {{of production and}} public health diseases. Salmonella, {{the second most common}} cause of bacterial foodborne illness, causes gastrointestinal illness. Pigs can be asymptomatic carriers of the bacteria and pork products are a known source of salmonellosis in humans. Salmonella have been isolated from pigs, boots, flies, rodents, bird feces, feed, feed-ingredients, and feed trucks. The objective was to identify management factors {{to reduce the risk of}} disease spread among swine farms through feed trucks. Materials and Methods The study was conducted in two phases - the first phase included a series of focus groups and key-informant interviews; discussions held with swine producers and feed company personnel explored the protocols currently in place that reduce the risk of disease spread through the delivery of feed. Participants were asked to identify possible management changes that could further reduce the risk, and to rate these ideas in terms of their effect on disease control, and feasibility based on implementation and economics. This information was used to structure the second phase of the study – a pilot study. The pilot study was conducted over 6 weeks in the winter of 2013, and included 40 <b>feed</b> truck <b>drivers</b> from 3 Ontario <b>feed</b> companies. Truck <b>drivers</b> filled out log sheets as they delivered feed to swine farms, and provided information about the prevalence of the identified biosecurity risks during the day-to-day delivery of <b>feed.</b> <b>Drivers</b> were randomly assigned to be in either the treatment or control groups. Drivers in the control group delivered feed as they normally do. Drivers in the treatment group were: i) asked not to enter the barn unless absolutely necessary, and ii) were provided with re-usable, washable rubber over-shoes and were asked to wear a clean pair at each farm when they felt safe doing so. Chisquared tests were used to compare the usage of clean boots between drivers in the treatment and control groups. In total, 40 drivers from 3 companies, delivering feed to 2202 farms over 6 weeks (in the winter) collected descriptive data on the factors and compared use of different boots. Results The factors followed by the proportion of farms and drivers where the factor was found were found as follows: Most farms were: keeping areas (driveway, feed bin and barnyard) clean of mud and manure (82 %), and dead-stock (91 %) was appropriately disposed of and not visible to the driver. Some farms had an outbuilding to deliver bagged feed (24 %). Other factors that were identified that producers should work on were to provide farm boots and coveralls for the driver if the driver needed to go into the barn, ordering the correct amount of feed to decrease the numbers of deliveries (or frequencies of deliveries) of feed, and notifying feed mill of a disease outbreak on the farm. <b>Feed</b> truck <b>driver</b> factors included wearing a separate pair of clean, disinfected, dried boots (25 %) and gloves (50 %) at each farm that is visited (even if the driver does not go into the barn, remaining outside the barn (92 %); washing the steering wheel (49 %), floor mat (77 %) and outside of the truck (32 %) every 24 hours. From these results, it may be advisable to increase the frequency of washing the truck. Another factor identified was for the driver to know and follow the farm biosecurity protocols. Half of the time, the <b>driver</b> left the <b>feed</b> bill outside barn (54 %). Drivers given disinfected rubber boots were more likely to wear these on farms (42 %) than plastic disposable boots (4 %) (P< 0. 05). These drivers were also more likely to wear disinfected rubber boots than the control drivers (11 %) (P< 0. 001). Conclusions and Discussion Biosecurity is a responsibility that is shared among all members of the industry. Feed personnel were encouraged to know more about disease transmission.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Eleven {{cases of}} <b>feeding</b> on <b>driver</b> ants (Dorylus sp.) by {{mountain}} gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) are described. Ant eating provides the gorillas with more animal protein {{and other nutrients}} per unit feeding time than do other forms of insectivory that contribute to their diet, {{but it is so}} rare that it is unlikely to be of real nutritional significance. Gorillas obtain ants with their hands and do not use tools. Immature individuals (except infants) ate more ants than did adult fe-males, and silverbacks were not seen to eat ants. These differences are more likely to reflect differences in individual taste and interest in novelty than differences in nutritional strategy. Not all gorillas in the Virungas population eat ants. Intra-population variability may be ecologically contingent, but ant eating appears to be a socially acquired and transmitted taste...|$|R

40|$|Top predators {{can have}} large effects on {{community}} and population dynamics {{but we still}} know relatively little about their roles in ecosystems and which biotic and abiotic factors potentially affect their behavioral patterns. Understanding the roles played by top predators is a pressing issue because many top predator populations {{around the world are}} declining rapidly yet we do not fully understand what the consequences of their potential extirpation could be for ecosystem structure and function. In addition, individual behavioral specialization is commonplace across many taxa, but studies of its prevalence, causes, and consequences in top predator populations are lacking. In this dissertation I investigated the movement, <b>feeding</b> patterns, and <b>drivers</b> and implications of individual specialization in an American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) population inhabiting a dynamic subtropical estuary. I found that alligator movement and feeding behaviors in this population were largely regulated by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors that varied seasonally. I also found that the population consisted of individuals that displayed an extremely wide range of movement and feeding behaviors, indicating that individual specialization is potentially an important determinant of the varied roles of alligators in ecosystems. Ultimately, I found that assuming top predator populations consist of individuals that all behave in similar ways in terms of their feeding, movements, and potential roles in ecosystems is likely incorrect. As climate change and ecosystem restoration and conservation activities continue to affect top predator populations worldwide, individuals will likely respond in different and possibly unexpected ways. ...|$|R
40|$|Driving is {{a complex}} dynamic task. As the car driver drives along a route they have to adjust their driving {{technique}} {{in accordance with the}} traffic level, infrastructure and environment around them. The amount of information in the environment would be overwhelming {{were it not for the}} presence of stored mental templates, accumulated through training and experience, which become active when certain features are encountered. Problems occur when the environment triggers the incorrect templates, or fails to trigger the correct templates. Problems like these can be overcome by adopting a “self-explaining” (SER) approach to road design. That is to say, purposefully designed roads which trigger correct behaviour. A concept which can help improve the theoretical robustness of the SER approach is Situation Awareness (SA). SA describes how the environment and mental templates work together to ensure drivers remain coupled to the dynamics of their situation. It is a widely researched concept in the field of Human Factors but not in the domain of Self-Explaining Roads (SER), despite the very obvious conceptual overlaps. This thesis, for the first time, blends the two approaches, SA and SER, together. From this the ability to extract cognitively salient features and ability to enhance driving behaviour and their effects on driving behaviour are sufficiently enhanced. After establishing SA as critical to driving through literature review the experiment phase started with determining the source of driver SA. Road environment was found to be of utmost importance for <b>feeding</b> into <b>driver</b> SA. This was also confirmed with the results of the on-road exploratory study. The success of the exploratory study led to large scale naturalistic study. It provided data on driver mental workload, subjective situation awareness, speed profile and endemic feature. Endemic features are unique characteristics of a road which make a road what it is. It was found that not all endemic features contribute to SA of a road system. Therefore through social network analysis list of cognitive salient features were derived. It is these cognitive salient features which hold compatible SA and facilitate SA transaction in a road system. These features were found to reduce speed variance among drivers on a road. The thesis ends by proposing a ‘road drivability tool’ which can predict potentially dangerous zones. Overall, the findings contribute to new imaginative ways road design in order to maximize safety and efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Raster {{engraving}} {{traces the}} laser {{across the surface}} in a back-and-forth slowly advancing linear pattern that will remind one of the printhead on an inkjet or similar printer. The pattern is usually optimized by the controller/computer so that areas {{to either side of}} the pattern which aren't to be engraved are ignored and the trace across the material is thus shortened for better efficiency. The amount of advance of each line is normally less than the actual dot-size of the laser; the engraved lines overlap just slightly to create a continuity of engravure. As is true of all rasterized devices, curves and diagonals can sometimes suffer if the length or position of the raster lines varies even slightly in relation to the adjacent raster scan; therefore exact positioning and repeatability are critically important to the design of the machine. The advantage of rasterizing is the near effortless [...] "fill" [...] it produces. Most images to be engraved are bold letters or have large continuously engraved areas, and these are well-rasterized. Photos are rasterized (as in printing), with dots larger than that of the laser's spot, and these also are best engraved as a raster image.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} {{focus on the}} need for collaboration between first responders and the general public. This type of collaboration requires soft skills that are not necessarily included in more traditional command and control trainings for first responders. Learning to collaborate with the general public requires different didactics than learning technical skills. It also requires different support tools; tools that let the trainees experience the engagement with the target group. These didactics and their supporting tools are developed as part of the DRIVER activities. More specifically, two separate but complementary trainings with support tools have been developed in DRIVER. These two trainings will <b>feed</b> into the <b>DRIVER</b> portfolio of solutions. The first training is an Awareness training. The Awareness training will aid professionals to become aware of the possibility to see the general public as a resource.

One scenario has been developed to help first responders practice in a digital environment facilitating the provision of immediate feedback to support efficient achievement of the Awareness training learning objectives. The second training is Psychological First Aid training. This training focuses specifically on psychosocial support from professionals to the general public. The aim is for first responders to be able to recognise and help those people that require immediate psychological first aid during the aftermath of a crisis to reduce initial psychological distress and to support short- and long-term recovery and coping thus supporting the affected people to be active survivors.

She fires four shots out of the officer's revolver into the door but is unable to see if she has struck the driver. The driver then drops a camera into the restroom via the open window. The video is of Jess being tortured with a knife; Jess then says he loves Nicole. The last shot of Jess shows him having his tongue cut out. The <b>driver</b> <b>feeds</b> a hose through the window and starts pouring gasoline into the room. Nicole tries to find an escape and is able to open a hatch in the ceiling. Realizing there is no way for her {{to get him out of}} the building the officer tells Nicole to use the two remaining bullets in his gun to kill him because he would rather die that way than be burned alive. She fails at first but eventually succeeds in the grisly task. The driver lights the gasoline and Nicole hurries to get out of the building. As Nicole is escaping she notices that the officer's body has mysteriously disappeared. Nicole is able to jump from the roof before the building explodes.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND – Certain {{pathogens}} can {{be spread}} between farms via fomites, including contaminated boots, clothing, hands, and vehicles. Additionally, feed and/or specific protocols for {{the delivery of}} feed {{have been associated with}} the transmission of swine diseases. This project allowed for the identification of economically and logically feasible management changes at the feed company and farm level that will reduce the potential for disease transmission associated with the delivery of feed. METHODOLOGY – Initially, discussions with swine producers and feed company personnel (managers, dispatchers, truck drivers) explored what current protocols are used in the industry to address the potential for disease spread via feed delivery, and to identify possible changes that could further reduce that risk. Next, a 6 -week pilot study was conducted in order to collect information about what is currently happening in the industry, to determine the frequency of some of the identified issues in the day-to-day delivery of feed, and to trial the use of reusable rubber boots. RESULTS – The pilot study included 3 feed companies, 40 <b>feed</b> truck <b>drivers,</b> and 2202 farm visits. Some key results are summarized below: More than half of the deliveries were to pig farms (59 %). The rest were to poultry (26 %), ruminant (14 %), or farms with multiple types of animals (1 %). •The majority of deliveries were for bulk feed only (84 %); the remaining deliveries were for bags only (6 %), or for bulk and bagged feed (10 %) •The truck driver didn’t enter the barn 93 % of farm visits. The rest of the time, the driver entered the office (1 %), the barn (5 %), or an area with animals (2 %) • The farm lane was clean on 82 % of farm visits. In some cases, though, the driver noticed mud and/or puddles (20 %), manure (2 %), or dead animals (1 %) • Dead stock management was adequate on 91 % of farm visits, however the driver noted dead stock where he/she had to drive or walk on 3 % of visits •The feed bin area was clean 81 % of the time, but there was spilled feed on 16 % of farm visits • Reusable rubber boots were worn on 21 % of farm visits; {{the rest of the time}} drivers wore disposable (7 %) or their own personal boots (72 %). • The boots cost between $ 6. 50 and $ 16 per pair, and the cost of cleaning boots was $ 1. 75 per pair BENEFITS TO THE SWINE INDUSTRY – This project has encouraged feed company personnel and swine producers to think about the issue of biosecurity in the feed industry. In particular, increasing awareness of biosecurity among the different players, and encouraging producers to be aware of what they can do to protect the industry as a whole. Overall, the participants appreciated our approach, and have expressed keen interest in understanding their place in this issue...|$|R
40|$|MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) {{flow sensors}} {{based on a}} thermal {{principle}} allow detection of extremely small fluid flow rates with high accuracy and resolution [1]. Recently, considerable research effort is being spent to reduce the power consumption of these devices [2], following the requirements dictated by battery-powered platforms. In this work, we propose a thermal flow sensor, with integrated readout interface, designed to obtain a very low power consumption while maintaining a high dynamic range (DR), defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum detectable flow. The device has been obtained by applying a post-processing micromachining procedure to chips fabricated with the STMicroelectronics BCD 6 s process. A photograph of the chip area is shown in Fig. 1, where the main blocks used in this work are indicated. The sensing structures are differential micro-calorimeters, consisting of two n-polysilicon/p-polysilicon thermopiles (4 mV/K sensitivity) symmetrically placed across two p-polysilicon resistive heaters (2 kW each). The sensor elements are placed on SiO 2 membranes suspended over a cavity etched into the substrate in the post-processing phase. The heater <b>driver</b> <b>feeds</b> the heaters with two currents, whose differential component can be digitally tuned (10 -bit resolution) to implement drift-free cancellation of the sensor offset [3]. The thermopile differential output voltage is amplified (gain= 200) by the integrated low-noise, low-power chopper amplifier (In-Amp and oscillator blocks in Fig. 1). A set of digital registers, which can be accessed by an embedded serial port, control the interface parameters. Selection of the sensors present on the chips occurs through an analog multiplexer. The sensing structure used in this work, indicated in Fig. 1, is optimized for low power consumption. This is obtained by reducing {{the thickness of the}} SiO 2 membranes with respect to the total dielectric stack of the process, using an improved sensor design and post-processing approach with respect to the device described in Ref. [4]. In particular, the membranes have been defined with the second metal layer (Metal 2) instead of photoresist (Fig. 2 a), exploiting the selectivity of the SiO 2 etch in CF 4 plasma towards aluminum. In this way, the metal mask is aligned during the chip design and all the dielectric layers above the Metal 2 are removed during the SiO 2 etch (Fig. 2 b) reducing the thickness of the suspended dielectric membranes with clear advantages in terms of thermal insulation. After the dielectric etch and the metal mask removal, the silicon substrate has been anisotropically etched in a TMAH solution (Fig. 2 c). The chips are glued to ceramic DIL 28 packages and a PMMA (Poly-methyl-methacrylate) gas conveyor [4] is applied to the chip surface, obtaining the structure shown in Fig. 3. Note that the sensing structure is included into a flow channel with a 0. 5 × 0. 5 mm 2 cross section. The response of the sensor to a nitrogen flow is shown in Fig. 4. The sensitivity is 13. 2 mV/sccm, while the measured peak-to-peak output noise (over a 10 Hz bandwidth) is 0. 2 mV. From these data, a resolution of 0. 015 sccm (1 mm/s gas velocity) can be estimated. Considering the range of ± 100 sccm, the DR is nearly 82 dB. The heater current was set to around 0. 3 mA, with a small differential component, applied to reduce the output offset to the same level as the output noise. The total current absorption of the chip, including the interface supply current, is 0. 8 mA, which, at a supply voltage of 3. 3 V, corresponds to a power consumption of 2. 6 mW. The resolution by power-consumption product is 2. 6 mW×mm/s, nearly three time higher (i. e. worse) than the sensors in [2], where, on the other hand, the amplifier supply current was not taken into account and a much smaller DR (26 dB) is reported...|$|R
