2500|$|The government's {{response}} and relief packages {{have generally been}} ineffective, misdirected and flawed, states Surinder Sud. It has focused on credit and loan, rather than income, productivity and farmer prosperity. Assistance in paying off outstanding principal and interest helps the money lenders, but has failed to create reliable and good sources of income for the farmer going forward. The usurious moneylenders continue to offer loans at interest rates between 24 and 50 percent, while income generating potential of the land the farmer works on has remained low and subject to weather conditions. Sud states {{that the government has}} failed to understand that debt relief just postpones the problem and a more lasting answer to farmer distress can only come from reliable income sources, higher crop yields per hectare, irrigation and other infrastructure security. Golait, in a Reserve Bank of <b>India</b> <b>paper,</b> acknowledged the positive role of crop diversification initiative announced in government's response to reports of farmer suicides. Golait added, [...] "Indian agriculture still suffers from: i) poor productivity, ii) falling water levels, iii) expensive credit, iv) a distorted market, v) many middlemen and intermediaries who increase cost but do not add much value, vi) laws that stifle private investment, vii) controlled prices, viii) poor infrastructure, and ix) inappropriate research. Thus the approach with mere emphasis on credit in isolation from the above factors will not help agriculture". Furthermore, recommended Golait, a more pro-active role in creating and maintaining reliable irrigation and other agriculture infrastructure is necessary to address farmer distress in India.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{methodology}} in measuring productivity growth by decomposing it into technical change and technical efficiency change in <b>India’s</b> <b>paper</b> industry. The prime objective of this article is to assess the impact of liberalization on productivity growth of <b>India’s</b> <b>paper</b> industry. Specifically, this study quantifies the level of technical efficiency and technical change in this particular manufacturing sector. The paper applies Malmquist Productivity Index method to different sub-sectors of <b>India’s</b> <b>Paper</b> and pulp industry at aggregate level in order to have trend in productivity growth covering a period of 28 years commencing from 1979 - 80 to 2006 - 07. Finally, regressing the log difference of the measured productivity growth on the log difference of the capacity utilization rate which is a proxy for business cycle, attempt has been made to find out capacity utilization adjusted TFP growth. The result of this study reveals decline in growth rate of TFP during post-reforms (1991 - 92 to 2006 - 07) period showing adverse impact of liberalization at aggregate level. Results also indicate that during the study period, industry also experienced regress in technological progress along with stagnation in technical efficiency. Non-responding technical efficiency change and the deteriorating technical change were the main ingredients responsible for declining productivity change in Indian paper and pulp industry. Moreover, removal of short run variations in capacity utilization from the estimated TFP growth hardly affects its overall movement but remarkably mitigates its variation because variations between sub-periods are lesser after adjusting capacity utilization as cyclical factor...|$|R

We see rich people, rich people out of motor cars, rich people beyond the dreams of avarice, going into toyshops and buying these skimpy, sickly, ridiculous pseudo-boxes of bricklets, because they do not know what to ask for, and the toyshops are just the merciless mercenary enemies of youth and happiness--so far, that is, as bricks are concerned. Their unfortunate under-parented offspring mess about with these gifts, and don't make very much of them, and put them away; and you see their consequences in after life in the weakly-conceived villas and silly suburbs that people have built all round big cities.

As this date falls between the siege of Ceul, during the alliance of the Musalman kings against the Portuguese, and the activity of the Nizamsahi troops twenty years later, it is probable that the bridge was built to facilitate the march of troops from Ahmadnagar, probably by the Koarl pass. In 1826 repairs costing Rs. 2,590 were sanctioned <b>India</b> <b>Papers,</b> III 786; Nairne's Konkan, 38.. The bridge is at present in good condition and is much used by foot travellers, bullock carts and occasionally automobiles, the approaches not admitting of the passage of two carts. Till the mid 90s it was also used by heavy vehicles but was stopped, probably due to the age of the bridge. The masonry work is repaired from time to time.|$|R
