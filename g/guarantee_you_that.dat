2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E

5000|$|In his 1979 autobiography, Kramer {{wrote that}} [...] "Rosewall was a {{backcourt}} player {{when he came}} into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net. Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Kenny wouldn't have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn't learned to serve and volley."

5000|$|Smart and Take-Two advertised that Battlecruiser 3000AD used a {{neural network}} to perform {{artificial}} intelligence tasks in the game. However, this claim has been criticised as highly improbable by other games designers. In one article {{in a computer}} games magazine, Keith Zabalaoui, former NASA programmer {{and one of the}} designers of the Close Combat series of strategy games, was quoted as saying, [...] "I have a hard time believing it's in there... the concept of training [...] to do the complex tasks required in a game is inconceivable.

That particularly bothers me, because I really try to do quality work, and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image—and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just, well, vulgar and awful. I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet.|$|E

5000|$|After Otpor! {{merged into}} the Democratic Party, Homen set about {{building}} a political career there.

Following the 10 October 2010 mass rioting by the right-wing groups in protest of the Belgrade gay pride parade, {{standing in front of}} the Democratic Party headquarters that were attacked by the rioters, Homen went on state-television airwaves, delivering a threatening message to the [...] "hooligans". Speaking to a reporter, Homen said: [...] "I can <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> they'll remember this day because the state's response to this will be chilling".

5000|$|Steve Lumbley, {{who worked}} for Tilton's {{ministry}} in 1991 when the original Primetime Live investigation took place, told {{a reporter for the}} Dallas Observer in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the 1991 Primetime Live exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the dallasobserver.com blog [...] "Unfair Park", Lumbley asserted that [...] "the mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and I can <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> was not a normal practice." [...] However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that [...] "God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{perspective}} on the serve-and-volley game {{is that it is}} less tiring than playing constantly from the backcourt. Kramer says in his autobiography that he and Pancho Segura once tried playing three matches in which they allowed the ball to bounce three times before either could approach the net. [...] "I don't believe I could have played tennis the way Segoo and I did for the three nights because it wore me out, running down all those groundstrokes. It was much more gruelling than putting a lot into a serve and following it in." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Rosewall was a backcourt player when he came into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net. Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Kenny wouldn't have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn't learned to serve and volley." ...|$|E

One of the stories I'm trying to tell is that criticism brings out the beast and fire in you. Often being criticized from my first album, I'm working on the next album like I've never worked on anything in my life before. It's going to be awesome, I can <b>guarantee</b> <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> It's going to be great."
