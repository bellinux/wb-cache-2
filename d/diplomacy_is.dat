5|$|Fragile Allegiance is an {{open-ended}} 4X real-time strategy (RTS) game from Gremlin Interactive, released in 1996 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. The game begins on May 25, 2496 as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who {{have set up}} a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million credits, the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation. <b>Diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> crucial to {{the success or failure of}} this franchise operation as the players colonies begin to encroach on one another.|$|E

25|$|<b>Diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> a {{key part}} of the game. Players — both human and AI — may trade technology, starbases, ships, planets, and trade goods (unique {{improvements}} built by one civilization that provide a bonus to those obtaining them). Negotiation skill is an important factor which varies with inherent civilization bonuses and research; it can be possible to gain a significant technological advantage through careful trading with less sophisticated civilizations.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentalism and {{political}} realism are diplomatically incompatible. It {{is believed that}} the most evident characteristic of <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> flexibility. The reason Iran’s diplomacy has encountered many shortcomings and lost numerous opportunities provided by international or regional political developments is the country’s focus on fundamental values and neglect of national interests. Fundamentalism is always accompanied with idealism while diplomacy always emphasizes realities. Therefore, the model of realistic fundamentalism will not work in the diplomatic arena.|$|E
25|$|Sasanian {{culture and}} {{military}} structure {{had a significant}} influence on Roman civilization. The structure and character of the Roman army was affected by the methods of Persian warfare. In a modified form, the Roman Imperial autocracy imitated the royal ceremonies of the Sasanian court at Ctesiphon, and those in turn had an influence on the ceremonial traditions of the courts of medieval and modern Europe. The origin of the formalities of European <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> attributed to the diplomatic relations between the Persian governments and the Roman Empire.|$|E

About two years after this book {{was first published in}} 2011, its author was elected as President of Iran on 15 June 2013. In this book, he has focused on Iran’s nuclear program and challenges created by the Western countries, especially the United States and three European countries of France, Germany and United Kingdom, during 678 days (from October 6, 2003 to August 15, 2005) when he and his team were handling Iran’s nuclear case. The history of Iran’s nuclear technology and the process of achieving complete nuclear fuel cycle are major topics of the book.|$|E
25|$|More {{and more}} Afghan tribal {{leaders have been}} {{requesting}} additional ADTs, which illustrates how important {{the use of public}} diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people. The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province {{is one of the most}} stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan. ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education, technical support, and logistics.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to critically {{examine the}} impact of the EU membership on the economic diplomacy of Slovak Republic. The research is based on the analysis of strategic documents of economic diplomacy of SR and official statements of its main representatives. The analytical part of this thesis was preceded by a theoretical section that explained and fixed the meaning of the terms such as Europeanisation and economic <b>diplomacy.</b> This <b>was</b> followed by a short introduction to the economic diplomacy of SR. In the selected documents, the changes in terms of the economic <b>diplomacy</b> of SR <b>were</b> examined on three different levels. Firstly, the exploration of the strategic level of the economic <b>diplomacy</b> <b>was</b> conducted, which elucidated the trends of the development of the economic diplomacy. Subsequently, the tasks of the economic <b>diplomacy</b> <b>were</b> clarified. Last but not least, the pressure on the institutional changes in the organisation of the country's representatives of the economic <b>diplomacy</b> <b>was</b> monitored. The thesis examined changes in the selected areas in chronological order with the emphasis on the period of the EU membership of SR. The impacts of the Europeanisation of the economic <b>diplomacy</b> of SR <b>were</b> tracked {{on the basis of the}} typology introduced by Tanja Börzel. As a result of this [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} Transformational <b>Diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> the {{emphasis}} on finding regional solutions. [...] Rice also pressed for finding transnational solutions as well, stating that [...] "in the 21st century, geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically, politically and culturally. This creates new opportunities but it also presents new challenges, especially from transnational threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation and drug smuggling and trafficking in persons and disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{cultural}} <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> {{more focused}} on the longer term and less on specific policy matters. [...] The intent is to build up influence {{over the long term}} for when it is needed by engaging people directly. [...] This influence has implications ranging from national security to increasing tourism and commercial opportunities. [...] It allows the government to create a [...] "foundation of trust" [...] and a mutual understanding that is neutral and built on people-to-people contact. [...] Another unique and important element of cultural <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> its ability to reach youth, non-elites and other audiences outside of the traditional embassy circuit. [...] In short, cultural diplomacy plants the seeds of ideals, ideas, political arguments, spiritual perceptions and a general view point of the world {{that may or may not}} flourish in a foreign nation. [...] Therefore, ideologies spread by cultural diplomacy about the values that American people believe in enables those that seek a better life to look towards the Western world where happiness and freedom are portrayed as desirable and achievable goals.|$|E
2500|$|In turn, {{cultural}} diplomacy {{can help a}} nation better understand the foreign nation it is engaged with and foster mutual understanding. [...] Cultural <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> a way of conducting international relations without expecting anything in return {{in the way that}} traditional diplomacy typically expects. Cultural exchange programs work as a medium to relay a favourable impression of the foreign country in order to gain outsiders' understanding and approval in their cultural practices and naturalize their social norms among other cultures.|$|E

2500|$|Gunboat <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{a form of}} hegemony. As the United States became a military power {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century, the Rooseveltian version of gunboat diplomacy, Big Stick Diplomacy, was partially superseded by dollar diplomacy: replacing the big stick with the [...] "juicy carrot" [...] of American private investment. However, during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, conventional gunboat diplomacy did occur, most notably in the case of the U.S. Army's occupation of Veracruz in 1914, during the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Culture {{is a set}} {{of values}} and {{practices}} that create meaning for society. [...] This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses). [...] This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. [...] It is a type of soft power, which is the [...] "ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. [...] It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies." [...] This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. [...] Cultural <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> also a component of public diplomacy. [...] Public <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to [...] "amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large". [...] It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. [...] This comes from knowledge of the other's culture." [...] Cultural diplomacy has been called the [...] "linchpin of public diplomacy" [...] because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation. [...] In this way, cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy are intimately linked.|$|E
2500|$|Gunboat <b>diplomacy</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from [...] "Defence Diplomacy", which {{is understood to}} be the peaceful application of resources from across the spectrum of defence, to achieve positive outcomes {{in the development of}} bilateral and multilateral relationships. [...] "Military diplomacy" [...] is a sub-set of this, tending to refer only to the role of military attachés and their associated activity. Defence diplomacy does not include military operations, but subsumes such other defence activity as international personnel exchanges, ship and aircraft visits, high-level engagement (e.g., ministers and senior defence personnel), training and exercises, security-sector reform, and bilateral military talks.|$|E
