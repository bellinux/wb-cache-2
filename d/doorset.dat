50|$|For example, in the United Kingdom a fire {{resisting}} <b>doorset</b> should {{be subjected to}} either a British Standard Fire Test BS 476 Part 22 1987, or a BS/EN 1634-1 2000 test. The results are recorded by the test agency and provided in a report which detail such things as constructional details, distortion data and pressure readings. The numerical fire resistance rating that is required to be installed in a particular building is provided in the Building Regulations approved Document B, or British Standards such as the BS 5588 series (e.g., 30 minutes FD30, or FD30(S) if cold smoke resistance is also required).|$|E
50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the <b>doorset</b> and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly {{the first half of the}} sweep range. Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.|$|E

This paper summarized the research status methods and distinguishing features of fireproof materials in China {{which would make}} progress to our research on fireproof materials. The Research of Fireproof Materials in China With the rapid development of social economy in recent years, many monster high-rise buildings spring {{up all over the}} country. The Chinese technologist gradually realized the importance of fireproof materials of fire accident prevention accompanied more and more fire accidents. According to the literature on fireproof materials recently, the research of fireproof materials divide into three directions approximately: the classes of fireproof materials, the principle of fireproof materials and the special applications of fireproof materials in different fields [1] 1. 1 The research on class of fireproof materials classified various materials which include HPL(Pecorative high-Pressure Lcminate), fire resistant <b>doorsets,</b> fire-resisting wood windows, fire roller shutter, Anti-fire Glass, fireproof storage box, fire-retardant coatings and fire-proof sealing materials. 1. 2 The research on the principle of fireproof materials analyzed the flameproof procedures based on principle and prevention measures for preventing even holding back fires though experimentations and theoretical analysis [2] 1. 3 The applied research of dedicated fireproof materials studied the application of fireproof materials in different situation. In accordance with different situation and different environmental needs, certain differences also existed in the selection of fireproof materials [3 - 4]. The research had revealed the particularity, advantages of various fireproof materials and different application or selection in different situation. The special research of Chinese fireproof materials in many different fields would be more professional in future...|$|R
