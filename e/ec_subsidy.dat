40|$|The {{need for}} change in the current energy policy is {{indicated}} by the following: The situation of nuclear energy, the expiration of the Century Contract for hard coal in 1995, the expiration of the <b>EC</b> <b>subsidy</b> scheme for coal subsidies in 1993, {{the threat of a}} deficit in the fund for the conversion of coal into electric energy, and the decision to reduce the CO_ 2 emissions due to energy consumption. The parliamentary party of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union pursues the following aims of energy policy: Clarity and reliability of energy policy, security of supply, economic efficiency, ecological benignity, prudent resource management. The realization of these aims forms an important basis for the economic and ecological development of a modern industrial society which stands in the midst of international competition. All energy source should meet the following requirements: International cooperation, more national and international competition, economic and efficient energy utilization. (orig. /HP) Fuer den aktuellen Handlungsbedarf in der Energiepolitik sprechen: Die Lage in der Kernenergie, das Auslaufen des Jahrhundertvertrages fuer Steinkohle im Jahre 1995 wie fuer das EG-Beihilferegime fuer Kohlehilfen 1993, das drohende Defizit beim Verstromungsfonds ferner der Beschluss zur Reduzierung der energiebedingten CO_ 2 -Emissionen. Die Ziele der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion in der Energiepolitik sind: Klarheit und Verlaesslichkeit der Energiepolitik, Versorgungssicherheit, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Umweltvertraeglichkeit, Ressourcenschonung. Die Erreichung dieser Ziele ist eine wesentliche Grundlage fuer die oekonomische und oekologische Entwicklung einer modernen Industriegesellschaft, die im internationalen Wettbewerb steht. Forderungen fuer alle Energietraeger sind internationale Zusammenarbeit, mehr Wettbewerb national und international, sparsame und rationelle Energieverwendung.

40|$|This paper uses {{regression}} analysis {{to study the}} causes and impacts of the Export Enhancement Program for wheat. We find that the overwhelming causes of the EEP, faltering export markets and swelling government stocks are primarily attributable to the overvaluation of the dollar in the 1980 s, not the increase in <b>EC</b> <b>subsidies</b> to wheat farmers in 1985. We also find that {{what had been a}} fairly robust relationship between export shares, exchange rates, and loan rates broke down after 1985, probably due to a variety of changes in farm policy. In any case, export shares did not rebound in spite of the weaker dollar and the implementation of the EEP in the post- 1985 period. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, a large range of {{biodiversity}} information {{products and services}} has become available. Some were developed with <b>EC</b> <b>subsidies,</b> some with national funds, and others as initiatives of universities, research institutes or private persons. Few, if any, were developed in the ‘commercial world’ based on a business plan. Some sponsors and funders ask for exploitation and sustainability plans after the development phase or {{at the end of}} the project. The success of these depends on whether the products meet real demands and serve actual markets. Market potential is often misjudged or overestimated and many products are developed without a prior needs or market analysis. This negatively affects the sustainability for biodiversity information services. In this paper we review the marketing of some biodiversity information products in a commercial environment, to assess demands and size of the markets...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} two decades Thailand has built up an {{intensive}} and highly profitable cassava processing and export industry, mainly due to favorable price and quota policy regimes with the European Community (EC). During the 1980 `s however, internal EC political pressure has attempted to reduce Thai pellet imports through various measures. Moreover, in 1993 internal EC grain prices were lowered substantially, thereby reducing the relative price advantages of Thai cassava as energy substitute. The subsequent pressure on the Thai cassava sector has resulted in several Thai governmenlal policy measures: (a) reduce cassava area using <b>EC</b> <b>subsidies,</b> (b) diversify cassava products and markets, and (c) reduce cassava production cost through increased varietal technology transfer. To stimulate the latter, significant private (processors) and government funds have been directed to cassava varietal technology transfer. The paper examines adoption characteristics of cassava variety RAYONG 3 (R 3) and analyzes with a logistic regression model the different factors that influence (non) adoption based on survey data of 700 cassava farm households in 9 provinces of NE and E Thailand. Results show that both the government and the private cassava sector have {{played a key role in}} the technology diffusion process. Hence, this will help to maintain the competitiveness of cassava for export markets...|$|R
50|$|The <b>EC</b> states' generous <b>subsidies</b> {{and their}} {{experience}} {{in the use of}} expensive feed grains gave their livestock industries a decided competitive advantage. As the Spanish livestock sector was increasingly concentrated in northern Spain, where minifundio agriculture predominated, many Spanish cattleraising farms were too small fully to exploit the efficiencies of modern technology. Domestic meat production failed to meet demand, making Spain a net importer of farm animals and meat products.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief outline of conditions and {{possibilities for the}} involvement of private actors in the multi-level system of subsidies regulation. Although the mechanisms for control and coordination differ on each regulatory level - the international, supranational, national and sub-national - all levels use private involvement to solve steering problems common in the control of subsidies. The paper takes the view that granting private parties substantial and procedural rights in the procedure is beneficial {{to the public for}} reasons of steering and control of subsidies. On the basis of an intra-level comparison, the paper points out administrative structures and procedural provisions, which enable private parties to have a meaningful involvement in the regulation of subsidiesLaw, <b>EC,</b> WTO, <b>Subsidies,</b> State Aid, Governance, Private Parties. ...|$|R
50|$|On 13 May 1991 Granada Television {{broadcast}} {{an episode}} of the investigative programme, World in Action with Susan O'Keeffe. The show examined the core business of Goodman International, how its operations were funded by national and European Community schemes, including export insurance and credit schemes, <b>EC</b> export <b>subsidies</b> and the variable premium paid on cattle. It claimed that the dominant position of Goodman in the Irish and British beef processing industry {{may not be in}} the best interests of consumers. It also made allegations of inappropriate political influence by Goodman. The programme featured Patrick McGuinness, a former Goodman accountant who had left the company and immigrated to Canada. The next day Opposition parties called for a full judicial inquiry into the allegations made on the programme.|$|R
40|$|Until 1989 the {{agriculture}} {{of the former}} GDR was mainly oriented toward the self-supply of the country's 16 mill. inhabitants. It was centrally planned and developed and organized to yield the highest possible returns of the natural potential. Presently, it is undergoing a fundamental change. Since {{the opening of the}} border between the two German states, the integration into the agricultural market of the EC, the economic and monetary union of July 1, 1990, agriculture has been confronted with numerous new problems. Among these are the breakdown of the East German distribution and supply networks, offensive marketing strategies of big West German suppliers and retail chains, a lack of the necessary legal, man-power oriented, technological and financial prerequisites for a conversion of the agricultural production profile toward a market orientation. Other issues include financial problems due to old debts and questions of property rights etc. Thuringia -one of the five East German states with approximately 880 000 ha of agricultural land- serves as an example. A comparison of indicators of agricultural land use for the years 1989 and 1990 / 91 reveals the rapid change taking place in the century-old agricultural regions. Thuringia has a wide array of physiographic regions. They range from wood-covered mountain ranges of an altitude up to 1000 m to loesscovered regions, well suited for agriculture (see the comprehensive three step valuation in fig. 1). The acreage for vegetables and root crops has been considerably reduced, predominantly in regions with soils of lower quality. Oil seeds, on the other hand, and especially colza reach new dimensions due to <b>EC</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Pastures tend to be enlarged, a reduction in the intensity of use of the pastures can be observed. The reduction of livestock (cattle/hogs/sheep) set in immediately after 1989, in 1990 there was for example already a reduction of 488 000 hogs. A differentiation of the stock reductions according to the three valuation classes was already noticeable in 1990. 90 000 jobs in agriculture were lost between 1989 and 1992, all parts of the state were affected in a similar way. The adaptation of {{the agriculture}} of Thuringia to market principles has begun. The polarization between regions of lower agricultural potential and regions of high valuation begins to take shape. The future development will give further contours to this tendency...|$|R
