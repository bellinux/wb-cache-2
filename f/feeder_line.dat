40|$|The {{time between}} Failures {{distribution}} observed on four selected <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the distribution}} system of Southwestern Nigeria was investigated in this study. Starting with data gathered on the selected <b>feeder</b> <b>lines,</b> the graphical representation of the time between failure distributions on each of them was presented.

The distribution parameter, failure rate denoted by, λ, obtained from the least square plot of the <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> are 0. 0054 f/h, 0. 0071 f/h, 0. 0177 f/h and 0. 026 f/h.

2500|$|In the 1870s, {{branch lines}} {{began to be}} built. Two-thirds of them were built as narrow gauge lines to reduce costs. Fifty branch lines {{were built in the}} period from 1874 to 1877, {{including}} the Gäu Railway (German: Gäubahn) between Solothurn and Olten (completed in 1876) and the Broye valley lines near Freiburg (1877), both originally planned by the SNB. [...] Also built during this period were the Emmental railway (German: Emmentalbahn) from Solothurn to Burgdorf and Langnau im Emmental (opened 1875-81) and the Wädenswil–Einsiedeln Railway ("pilgrim railway", opened 1877). Also opened between 1874 and 1881 was the Aargau Southern Railway, from Rupperswil to Rotkreuz, which later became a freight <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> to the Gotthard railway.

2500|$|After a {{supporter}} purchased for McIntire a World War II vintage wooden-hulled Navy minesweeper named Oceanic (which McIntire renamed Columbus), {{he tried to}} broadcast outside the three-mile limit near Cape May, calling the floating station [...] "Radio Free America."

2500|$|Several {{international}} shipping companies have also previously {{been implicated in}} the export of illegally harvested wood from Madagascar, although most of them immediately and unequivocally ceased such operations when confronted with the issue. Between January and April 2009, United Africa <b>Feeder</b> <b>Line</b> (UAFL), based in Mauritius, shipped 80% of the exports out of Vohémar and Delmas Shipping, based in France and a subsidiary of CMA CGM, shipped the remaining 20%. According to local sources, Spanfreight and Safmarine Container Lines N.V. have also {{been involved in the}} exports, although the EIA and Global Witness report could not substantiate the claim at the time. Other companies, such as Pacific International Lines (PIL), may also be involved or may become involved, {{but it is difficult to}} track since containers are transshipped, and effectively laundered, through nearby Réunion or Mauritius. [...] By the end of 2009, only Delmas continued to ship rosewood and other precious woods out of Madagascar, although it was beginning to come under public pressure to stop.|$|E
2500|$|The Kansas Pacific Railway (KP) was a {{historic}} railroad company that operated {{in the western}} United States in the late 19th century. It was a federally chartered railroad, backed with government land grants. At {{a time when the}} first transcontinental railroad was being constructed by the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific, it tried and failed to join the transcontinental ranks. [...] It was originally the [...] "Union Pacific, Eastern Division", although it was completely independent. The Pennsylvania railroad, working with Missouri financiers, designed it as a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> to the transcontinental system. The owners lobbied heavily in Washington for money to build a railroad from Kansas City to Colorado, and then to California. It failed to get funding to go west of Colorado. It operated many of the first long-distance lines in the state of Kansas in the 1870s, extending the national railway network westward across that state and into Colorado. Its main line furnished a principal transportation route that opened up settlement of the central Great Plains, and its link from Kansas City to Denver provided the last link in the coast-to-coast railway network in 1870. The railroad was consolidated with the Union Pacific in 1880, and its mainline continues to {{be an integral part of}} the Union Pacific network today.|$|E

The results of verification sampling show that residual contaminant concentrations do not preclude any future uses and allow for unrestricted use of shallow zone soils. The results also demonstrate that residual contaminant concentrations are protective of groundwater and the Columbia River...|$|R
