5000|$|One {{issue with}} trijets is {{positioning}} the central engine. On most trijets this is {{placed at the}} tail along the centerline, producing some technical difficulties. The most common configuration is having the central engine located in the rear fuselage and supplied with air by an S-shaped duct [...] - [...] this is used on the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Boeing 727, Tupolev Tu-154, Lockheed Tristar and, more recently, the Dassault_Falcon_7X. The S-duct design {{has the advantage of}} reduced drag, additionally since the <b>engine</b> <b>outlet</b> is located lower down, the aircraft will be easier to handle {{in the event of an}} engine failure. However, S-ducts are complicated and costly designs. Furthermore, the central engine bay would require structural changes in order accommodate future larger-diameter engines in the case of the Boeing 727 and Lockheed TriStar. The Boeing 727's central bay was only wide enough to fit a low-bypass turbofan and not the newer high-bypass turbofans which had greater output as well as being quiet enough to meet new noise regulations of the 1980s, but such a redesign was prohibitively expensive and so Boeing ended production of the 727 instead of pursuing further development. The Lockheed Tristar's S-duct cross section was too small to fit an existing double spool engine as it was designed only to accommodate the new triple spool RB211 engine, and delays in RB211 development in turn pushed back the TriStar's entry into service which affected sales. [...] The DC-10 and related MD-11 use an alternative [...] "straight" [...] layout, which allows for easier engine installation, modification, and access. However, this has inferior aerodynamic properties when compared to the S-duct designs. Also, as the <b>engine</b> <b>outlet</b> is located much higher up than the wing-mounted engines, an engine failure will produce a greater moment about the aircraft's lateral axis, making it more difficult to control.|$|E

In particular the effects of different combustion processes on PM characteristics were investigated, by comparing measurements made both under normal operating condition and under DPF regeneration mode. Exhaust gas was sampled at <b>engine</b> <b>outlet,</b> at DOC outlet and at DPF outlet, in order to fully characterize PM emissions through the whole exhaust line. After a two stage dilution system, sampled gas was analyzed {{by means of a}} TSI 3080 SMPS, in the range from 6 to 240 nm. Particle number and size distribution were evaluated at part load operating conditions, representative of urban driving. Finally, particle number and size distribution at <b>engine</b> <b>outlet</b> were also evaluated fuelling the engine with neat FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester), in order to evaluate the impact of alternative fuels on PM characteristics during normal operating conditions. Results show that under normal operating conditions the engine and DOC outlet particle number and mass size distributions appeared to be extremely similar, while the DPF exhibited high values of filtration efficiency on a particle number basis also in the nanoparticles range. Regeneration mode caused a particle number increase of an order of magnitude, with a substantial shift of the number distribution peaks towards larger diameters. The particle number across the DOC showed a remarkable reduction for particles larger than 40 nm, with one order of magnitude reduction in concentrations.

These events require sustained temperatures between 500 and 600 □C to complete the regeneration process. Engine operation during typical 65 mile/hour highway cruise conditions (1200 rpm/ 7. 6 bar) results in temperatures of approximately 350 □C, and can reach approximately 420 □C with late fuel injection. This necessitates hydrocarbon fueling of a diesel oxidation catalyst or burner located upstream of the {{diesel particulate filter}} to reach the required regeneration temperatures. These strategies require increased fuel consumption, {{and the presence of}} a fuel-dosed oxidation catalyst (or burner) between the engine and particulate filter.

The pollutant emissions were sampled at two locations along the exhaust system: at the <b>engine</b> <b>outlet</b> and downstream of the diesel oxidation catalyst, in order to characterize particles entering the DOC and the DPF respectively.

The co-generation concept is utilized in that the electric power is produced by the generator connected to the diesel engine, and heat is recovered from both combustion exhaust gases and the engine by the fin-and-tube and shell-and-tube heat exchangers, respectively. A specially designed secondary combustor is installed at the <b>engine</b> <b>outlet</b> in order to reburn the unburned fuel from the diesel engine, thereby improving the system's efficiency as well as reducing air pollution caused by exhaust gases. The main components of the secondary combustor are coiled Nichrome wires heated by the electric current and diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) housed inside a well insulated stainless steel shell. The performance tests were conducted at four water flow rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 Â L/min and five electric power outputs of 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 Â kW.

However, the efficiencies of these after-treatment systems are heavily temperature dependent. ^ Heavy-duty over-the-road trucks require periodic active diesel particulate filter regeneration to clean the filter of stored particulate matter. These events require sustained temperatures between 500 and 600 °C to complete the regeneration process.

Efficient and reliable after-treatment technologies for NOx and PM control are going to be necessary. PN emissions from a modern diesel engine were characterized by means of a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS); in addition, the performance of an Advanced Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (A-DOC), with low temperature NOx trapping capability, and a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) were assessed. PN emissions were evaluated under normal engine operating mode, as well as under DPF regeneration mode; unimodal distribution were found at both <b>engine</b> <b>outlet</b> and DOC outlet, without any effects of DOC on the emitted particles; conversely DPF reduction efficiency up to 2 orders of magnitude were observed, thus confirming the potential of DPF to be effective also on these small particles. PN emissions were found to increase during DPF regeneration, but it was shown that both DOC and DPF were effective in reducing PN under similar operating conditions. PN emissions were also evaluated during engine warm-up. A new experimental methodology, able to provide fundamental information about the soot loading process inside the DPF, was adopted to load small lab-size SiC DPF samples; advanced electron microscopy provided highly detailed images of soot deposited onto channel walls. While morphology of deposited soot and its compressibility characteristics were found in agreement with previous studies, it was shown that soot did not penetrate into channel walls, differently from what is reported in literature; conversely, a soot cake layer was taking place immediately. Finally, A-DOC technology was tested over NEDC. Reduction of NOx was found to be significantly high, especially during the urban driving; spontaneous release of stored NOx (without periodic rich regeneration such as for LNTs) was observed at high exhaust temperatures typical of extra-urban driving, highlighting the potential for a combined application with a downstream SCR system.

40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy. Diffusers are essential in gas turbine combustors, decelerating the compressor efflux prior to the combustion chamber to reduce total pressure losses. Modern, low emission, radially staged combustors require even more diffusion due to the increased flame tube depth {{of this type of}} combustor. Furthermore, these high rates of deceleration are accompanied by large adverse pressure gradients and an associated risk of flow separation. Previous studies have shown that hybrid diffusers can achieve high rates of efficient diffusion in far shorter lengths than conventional faired diffusers or dump diffuser systems, representing a potential performance gain and weight saving. Hybrid diffusers consist of a wide angle diffuser immediately downstream of a sudden expansion, with flow separation prevented by bleeding off a small amount of the mainstream flow. However, previous studies have not provided a conclusive understanding of the associated flow mechanisms leading to hybrid diffusers currently being considered high risk. Additionally definitive data does not exist on the influence of bleed gap geometry and therefore hybrid diffusers cannot, currently, be optimised for use in a modern gas turbine. Further issues also not addressed by earlier studies, but concerning the use of hybrid diffuser in gas turbine combustors, are the effect of representative inlet conditions incorporating vane wakes at diffuser inlet, the quality of the bleed air and its potential for use for component cooling, the effect of radial struts within a hybrid diffuser {{and the quality of the}} flow delivered to the combustor feed annuli (total pressure losses).

Because the pump seal leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the <b>engine</b> has an <b>outlet</b> that feeds heated water {{to the top of the}} radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running, the leaking pump seal drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. As aero gas turbine designs strive for ever greater {{efficiencies}} {{the trend is}} for engine overall pressure ratios to rise. Although this provides greater thermal efficiency it means that cycle temperatures also increase. Traditionally turbines have {{been the focus of}} cooling schemes to enable them to survive high temperatures. However, it is envisaged that the compressor delivery air will soon reach temperatures which mean they may require similar cooling strategies to the turbine. One such concept is akin to that of a turbine 'rim purge flow which ensures that hot, mainstream flow does not get ingested into rotor cavities. However, the main gas path in compressors is generally more aerodynamically sensitive than in turbines and introduction of a purge flow may be more penalizing. It is important to understand the impact such a flow may have on the primary gas path flow of a compressor and the downstream combustion system aerodynamics. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the effects of a purge flow which enters the main gas path immediately upstream of the high pressure compressor outlet guide vane (OGV) row. Initial, simplified, CFD predictions clearly demonstrated the potential of the purge flow to negatively affect the OGV/pre-diffuser and alter the inlet conditions to the combustion system. Consequently, an experimental assessment was carried out using an existing fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, <b>engine</b> relevant <b>outlet</b> guide vanes, pre-diffuser and downstream combustor geometry. Using CFD to guide the process the test rig was modified to allow a metered airflow to be introduced upstream of the outlet guide vanes. Importantly the flow was directed up the face of the rotor such that it picked up a representative swirl component prior to injection into the main gas path. The experimental data confirmed the CFD results and importantly demonstrated that the degradation in the combustor inlet flow resulted in an increased combustion system loss. At the proposed purge flow rate, equal to ∼ 1 % of the mainstream flow, these effects were small with the system loss increasing by ∼ 4 %. However, at higher purge flow rates (up to 3 %) these effects became notable and the OGV/pre-diffuser flow degraded significantly with a resultant increase in the combustion system loss of ∼ 13 %...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. The trend for higher overall {{pressure}} ratios means that turbine entry temperatures are continually increasing. Furthermore, {{the development of}} lean, low-emission combustion systems reduces the availability of cooling air and is accompanied by new problems at the combustor/turbine interface. For example, the exit temperature traverse differs from that found in traditional rich-burn combustors with increased swirl and a much flatter profile. Effectively cooling the turbine components is becoming increasingly difficult. One solution is to employ cooled cooling air (CCA) {{where some of the}} compressor efflux is diverted for additional cooling in a heat exchanger located in the by-pass duct. An example CCA system is presented which includes an off-take within the dump cavity and the addition of radial struts within the pre-diffuser through which the cooled air is returned to the engine core. This paper addresses the impact this CCA system has on the combustion system external aerodynamics. This included the development of a fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, <b>engine</b> relevant <b>outlet</b> guide vanes, pre-diffuser and combustor geometry. A datum aerodynamic performance was established for a non-CCA configuration with a clean, un-strutted prediffuser. Results for this baseline CCA system demonstrated that inclusion of a bleed in the dump cavity had limited effect on the overall flow field. However, the inclusion of struts within the pre-diffuser caused a reduction in area ratio and a notable increase in system loss. Consequently an alternative pre-diffuser was designed (using CFD) with the aim of increasing the area ratio back to that of the un-strutted datum. A so-called hybrid diffuser was designed in which the CCA bleed was moved to the pre-diffuser outer wall. The bleed was then used to re-energize the boundary layer, preventing flow separation, enabling the area ratio to be increased close to the datum value. The mechanisms of the hybrid diffuser are complex; the geometry of the off-take and its location with respect to the OGV and strut leading edge were seen to be critical. Experimental evaluation of the final design demonstrated the effective operation the hybrid diffuser with the result that the system loss returned to a level close to that of the datum. Only small differences were seen in the overall flow field...|$|R

Acoustic {{filters are}} widely used in the {{industry}} to attenuate the noise emission from exhaust machines, cooling ducts, internal combustion <b>engines,</b> inlet and <b>outlet</b> pipes of compressors and others. Reactive acoustic filters are known as mufflers and use a system of tubes and cavities to reflect part of the incident acoustic wave, resulting in a lower transmitted sound pressure than the incident sound pressure. The prediction of acoustic performance of mufflers {{can be obtained by}} analytical, experimental and numerical methods as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM). Nowadays, in order to obtain more assertive solutions which minimize implementation time and costs, only determine the acoustic performance is not enough. Consequently, optimization methods are important tools to be applied in the industry. This thesis proposes to demonstrate a numerical optimization using the Genetic Algorithm Method (GA) in two reactive mufflers: the first one is assembled with two tubes and one cavity, and the other with three tubes and two cavities. One wide frequency band was chosen for this evaluation. The numerical models were validated using experimental results for the transmission loss, wich was measured using the Two Sources Technique. The results showed FEM that simulations and GA optimization applied with a method of performance prediction in mufflers have good results in build of reactive mufflers in the desirable interest frequencies band with a relative low cost and time of development...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of the diesel engine in the passenger car, truck and bus market is due to high efficiency and lower fuel costs. This growing market share has brought with it several environmental issues for instance soot particle emission. Different technologies to remove the soot have been developed and are normally based {{on some kind of}} soot trap. In particular for automobiles the use of diesel particulate traps or filters (DPF:s) based on ceramic monolithic honeycombs are becoming a standard. This new exhaust system component will affect the acoustics and also work as a muffler. To properly design exhaust systems acoustic models for diesel particulate traps are needed. The first part of this thesis considers the modelling of sound transmission and attenuation for traps that consist of narrow channels separated by porous walls. This work has resulted in two new models an approximate 1 -D model and a more complete model based on the governing equations for a visco-thermal fluid. Both models are expressed as acoustic 2 -ports which makes them suitable for implementation in acoustic software for exhaust systems analysis. The models have been validated by experiments on clean filters at room temperature with flow and the agreement is good. In addition the developed filter models have been used to set up a model for a complete After Treatment Device (ATD) for a passenger car. The unit consisted of a chamber which contained both a diesel trap and a Catalytic Converter (CC). This complete model was also validated by experiments at room temperature. The second part of the thesis focuses on experimental techniques for plane wave decomposition in ducts with flow. Measurements in ducts with flow are difficult since flow noise (turbulence) can strongly influence the data. The difficulties are also evident from the lack of good published in-duct measurement data, e. g., muffler transmission loss data, for Mach-numbers above 0. 1 - 0. 2. The first paper {{in this part of the}} thesis investigates the effect of different microphone mountings and signal processing techniques for suppressing flow noise. The second paper investigates in particular flow noise suppression techniques in connection with the measurement of acoustic 2 -ports. Finally, the third paper suggests a general wave decomposition procedure using microphone arrays and over-determination. This procedure can be used to determine the full plane wave data, e. g., the wave amplitudes and complex wave numbers k+ and k-. The new procedure has been applied to accurately measure the sound radiation from an unflanged pipe with flow. This problem is of interest for correctly determining the radiated power from an <b>engine</b> exhaust <b>outlet.</b> The measured data for the reflection coefficient and end correction have been compared with the theory of Munt [33] and the agreement is excellent. The measurements also produced data for the damping value (imaginary part of the wavenumber) which were compared to a model suggested by Howe [13]. The agreement is good for a normalized boundary layer thickness less than 30 - 4...|$|R
