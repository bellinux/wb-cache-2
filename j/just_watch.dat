Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues.

500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and <b>just</b> <b>watch</b> {{to see if we could}} find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts that had to do with really big visual pictures.

[...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E

Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I <b>just</b> <b>watch</b> what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E

Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyoncé comes off like [...] "barely sentient" [...] but added that she remains cohesive and rational as a human being in real life. He further wrote: [...] "Her reserve of crazy is far from bottomless, and she seems to save it all for her music videos, and I love her for that [...] awesome in distressingly fragmented ways." [...] Gina Serpe of E! Online wrote that [...] "for anyone still laboring under the illusion that Beyoncé does not mean business, well, <b>just</b> <b>watch</b> this video. Described by B herself as 'futuristic', 'electronic' and 'African', the 29-year-old fused all that and more into a still remarkably cohesive music video." [...] CBS News wrote the [...] "smoking hot video [...] blowing up on the web". The Huffington Post wrote that Beyoncé largely brings back the elements that made [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"'s video a hit, citing women's empowerment and a brand new dance.

Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga".
