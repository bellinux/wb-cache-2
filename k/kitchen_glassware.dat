5000|$|In {{addition}} to their <b>kitchen</b> <b>glassware</b> products, Sneath began to make refrigeration products. Between 1933 and 1941, management secured at least six patents related to mechanical refrigerators. At one time, Sneath Glass produced almost 90 percent of the glassware used in consumer refrigerators in the United States. [...] This glassware was produced {{under the name of}} the appliance manufacturer, and included the major manufacturers of the time. Some of the consumer refrigeration products produced were defroster trays, cold water pitchers, and butter dishes. Additional products made by Sneath included sundae dishes, ink wells, fish tanks, and battery jars used by farmers' windmills.|$|E
50|$|The European {{manufacturer}} of Pyrex, Arc International, uses borosilicate glass in its Pyrex glass kitchen products; however, the U.S. {{manufacturer of}} Pyrex kitchenware uses tempered soda-lime glass. Thus Pyrex {{can refer to}} either soda-lime glass or borosilicate glass when discussing <b>kitchen</b> <b>glassware,</b> while Pyrex, Bomex, Duran, TGI and Simax all refer to borosilicate glass when discussing laboratory glassware. The real difference is the trademark and the company that owns the Pyrex name. The original Corning ware made of borosilicate glass was trademarked in capital letters (PYREX). When the kitchenware division was sold, the trademark was changed to lowercase (pyrex) and switched to low thermal-expansion soda-lime glass. The scientific division of Pyrex has always been using borosilicate glass.|$|E

Both <b>glassware</b> items feature a {{dripping}} icicle look, {{and in the case}} of Iittala's popular glassware it is said to have taken thousands of hours to develop a glassblowing technique that would produce the effect.|$|R
50|$|Hanover grew rapidly. By 1881 a jail was built, but a {{courthouse}} only came in 1897. The town had a post and telegraph office, a bank, several general dealers, {{a hotel and}} a school. Its list of tradesmen included a mason, a farrier and groom, painter, miller, dam builder, brick maker, scab inspector, carpenter, wagon maker, butcher, a post rider and carriers to the railway station 18 km away. The original farmstead is today a national monument. It houses a small cultural history museum, and on display are old bottles, clothes, <b>glassware,</b> <b>kitchen</b> utensils and implements. There is also an intriguing model of the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|R
