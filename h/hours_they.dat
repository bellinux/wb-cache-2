5|$|Long-acting {{compounds}} have a half-life of 40–250 <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> have {{a risk of}} accumulation in {{the elderly}} and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, {{but they have a}} reduced severity of rebound effects and withdrawal. Examples are diazepam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide, and flurazepam.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the series, Thomas wrote a feature film script continuing the series. Warner Bros. opted not to fund the project at the time. On March 13, 2013, Bell and Thomas launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in less than eleven <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> accumulated over $5.7million via Kickstarter. The film was released on March 14, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12–40 <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{are active}} year-round, and are most active {{at night and}} during crepuscular <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> become much more nocturnal in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, and more diurnal during winter. They may migrate {{as a result of}} food {{shortages}} or environmental conditions, but they do not migrate annually. River otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.|$|E
5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1–12 <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam, and triazolam.|$|E
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> broke into a walk again, panting from their exertions.|$|R
60|$|For half an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> {{proceeded}} {{at a fast}} walk, {{then the}} skins were taken off the horses' feet and they went on at a trot, the two Wades taking hold of Jerry's stirrup-leathers and running alongside. In half an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> entered the belt of trees, and dismounting, at once began to ascend the hill. They were some distance up when they heard a distant yell.|$|R
60|$|Together they {{hurried to}} the bootblack's stand. An <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> spent there gazing at the malformed youth.|$|R
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly <b>hours</b> <b>they</b> may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28January, the 4thDestroyer Flotilla resumed its journey south and put into Bergen. Z31 entered one of the town's docks to be {{repaired}} while Z34 and Z38 departed on the evening of 28January. The two ships were attacked from the air the next day, but did not suffer any damage and sheltered in a fjord south of Stavanger during daylight <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> put to sea again on the evening of 29January and eventually reached Kiel in Germany on 1February.|$|E
5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a {{military}} committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate {{control of the}} country. Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 <b>hours</b> <b>they</b> had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E

5|$|On April 30, 1968, Captain Jay R. Vargas, {{who was the}} {{commander}} of Company G, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade, was sent with his men to an area around the village of Dai Do where two other Marine companies were in a battle with a North Vietnamese Army regiment. Even though Company G hadn’t slept for thirty-six <b>hours,</b> <b>they</b> went ashore at about one in the afternoon. The enemy attacked his men and had one of his platoons pinned down. Vargas went to rescue his platoon with a reserve platoon and was wounded by a grenade. He {{was able to take}} out three machine guns nests by himself before leading his men in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy soldiers in the nearby village.|$|E
5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} Pelham {{ministry}} and George, {{as he continued}} to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base. The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 <b>hours</b> <b>they</b> returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E
5|$|The French tanks had heavier armour and {{armament}} {{than the}} Panzers. The Panzer IV had 30mm of armour, while the Hotchkiss had 45mm, and the Char B1 had 60mm of protection. Moreover, its main armament, one 47mm and one 75mm gun, outmatched all the German tanks. In {{an open field}} engagement, Guderian's armour stood little chance. Two-thirds of his units were equipped with Panzer I and IIs. Just 30 of the Panzer IVs were on his order of battle. However, one crucial disadvantage of the French tanks, considered as a very broad whole, was their low endurance. They needed refuelling after just two <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> were also slow in speed, complicating high tempo operations.|$|E
60|$|In half an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> met again, {{and crawled}} along for some {{distance}} {{side by side}} in silence.|$|R
60|$|For half an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> paddled {{steadily}} on. The pursuing canoes {{were now}} {{less than a}} mile behind them.|$|R
60|$|In {{about an}} <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> {{returned}} and reported deep water through the passage {{as well as}} far into the little basin.|$|R
5|$|Their next {{task was}} {{the capture of}} the road bridge {{spanning}} the Aller river {{as part of the}} 11th Armoured Division's advance on the town of Essel. The 1st Commando Brigade carried out a preliminary move across the river over a railway bridge some distance away from their objective and after forcing their way across, they removed the explosives that had been placed on the bridge and dug in on the other side. Over the course of about three-and-a-half <b>hours</b> <b>they</b> repelled a number of determined counterattacks, before No. 6 Commando, supported by Vickers machine guns fixed bayonets and charged the German marines that were defending the bridge, and inflicting heavy casualties upon them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, Armenians left at the two holding centers were {{deported}} to Ottoman Syria. Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. After waiting for ten <b>hours,</b> <b>they</b> were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian train conductor got a list of names of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison of Constantinople, did the triage. The deportees were divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three <b>hours.</b> <b>They</b> presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
60|$|Smoke made no reply, and {{for half}} an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> toiled on in silence--a silence that was again broken by Shorty.|$|R
60|$|Over such ground it was {{impossible}} to hurry, but in three-quarters of an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> reached the edge of the wood.|$|R
60|$|For an <b>hour</b> <b>they</b> {{continued}} their course south, the ground rising as they went. Then {{they reached a}} dip running west.|$|R
5|$|At 16:00 the {{regiment}} was attacked in force, but the Turks withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. But the British attack elsewhere had failed, and some units {{had been forced}} to retire, leaving {{the regiment}} exposed. They fought off attacks throughout the night, until 05:00 the next morning. Then for two <b>hours</b> <b>they</b> were harassed with sniper fire and hand grenades. Meldrum asked the brigade for reinforcements and more ammunition. There were no reserves of ammunition available and the only reinforcements were forty men from the 6th Battalion Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) who were sent to assist, but did not arrive until noon. At 14:00 Meldrum reported he could now hold out until nightfall and at 22:30 they were relieved {{by the rest of the}} Loyal Regiment and the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment. In the day's fighting the regiment, from a total of 173 all ranks, had lost forty-three dead and seventy-four wounded.|$|E
5|$|In a {{follow-up}} to Operation Goodwood on 19 July, the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German mortar fire limited their progress. Tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine-gun positions {{on either side of}} Point67. The Highlanders eventually managed to dig in, despite accurate return fire. Over the next few <b>hours,</b> <b>they</b> strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains. Against a tenacious German defense and minor infantry and tank counterattacks, the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties. Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day, with the goals of capturing both {{the eastern side of the}} Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men {{around the bend}} behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the open}} {{streambed}} to render medical assistance. Though his prominent Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed almost instantly by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early <b>hours,</b> <b>they</b> ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E
