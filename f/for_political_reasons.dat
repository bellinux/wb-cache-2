50|$|In the 20th century, the {{production}} of pulque was economically important here, with the Hacienda of San Sebastián being the major producer. A railway to connect Mexico City {{with the rest of}} the country was built through here in 1917 on what is now Alfredo del Mazo street, but was dismantled <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reason</b> in 1945.|$|R
5|$|In the historiography of this battle, {{the figures}} would be {{deliberately}} inflated or underplayed by the generals {{of both sides}} attempting to lessen the impact the figures would have on public opinion both during aftermath of the battle or, <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> later during the Soviet period.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two people}} were ever {{degraded}} – Lord Cochrane in 1813 and General Sir Eyre Coote in 1816, both <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> rather {{than any of the}} grounds given in the statute.

5|$|After {{the early}} 1950s, Chen's {{attempts}} at filmmaking were repeatedly thwarted by the PRC government <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons.</b> He worked {{as general manager}} of Tianma Film Studio before being imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution.

He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons</b> is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's men {{helped to}} cowl the populace into voting for his brother. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water often forced down their nostrils.

Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons</b> in the week leading up to the vote. In Hội An, some people were killed in election day violence.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{the couple}} {{went through a}} {{marriage}} ceremony on 15 December 1785 at her house in Park Street, Mayfair. Legally the union was void, as the King's consent was not granted (and never even requested). However, Fitzherbert believed {{that she was the}} prince's canonical and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. <b>For</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> the union remained secret and Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it.|$|E

5000|$|Born at Moliterno, Basilicata, at {{the time}} part of the Kingdom of Naples, his birth name was Ferdinando Petruccelli and he added [...] "della Gattina" [...] (name of a farm of his own) to his surname {{in order to avoid}} the Bourbon police who persecuted him <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reason.</b> His father Luigi was a {{physician}} and member of the Carbonari while his mother Maria Antonia Piccininni was a noblewoman from Marsicovetere.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, ITEC {{decided to}} invest in the 12000 lbf kN thrust TFE1088-12, which was re-designated as the TFE1042-70A <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reason</b> as well. Preliminary studies had shown that the IDF could supercruise with the new engine. At the same time, General Electric Aviation decided to enter the market with the J101/SF, a smaller version of the F404. However, after the IDF order was cut in half due to budget concerns, the TFE1088-12 engine upgrade plan ended as well.|$|R
5|$|Strategic discussions also {{occurred}} on the German side, with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> German Chancellor Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for Unternehmen Zitadelle (Operation Citadel).|$|E
5|$|While in Berlin {{organizing}} the necessary transfers, Graf {{was introduced to}} the young film actress, Jola Jobst, whom he later wed. The new assignment was then delayed for two months <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons.</b> Graf was to run one final pilot-training program: the latest draft of Spanish volunteers heading to the Eastern Front – the 4th Escudrilla Azul (4th Blue Squadron). From 18 May to 6 June 1943, the pilots received three weeks of specialized fighter pilot training for the Soviet conditions.|$|E
5|$|Although Michael VIII Palaiologos engaged {{him in a}} {{marriage}} alliance and awarded him with the high title of sebastokratōr, John remained the foremost of Palaiologos' Greek opponents throughout the latter's reign. A staunch opponent of the Union of the Churches promoted by Palaiologos <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons,</b> he provided refuge to several political opponents of the emperor, and even convoked synods that anathematized Palaiologos and the supporters of the Union. He resisted several attempts by Byzantine armies to conquer Thessaly, and allied himself with Palaiologos' Latin enemies, including the Duchy of Athens and Charles of Anjou. He died in 1289, leaving the rule of Thessaly to his sons, Constantine and Theodore.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. <b>For</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons</b> the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, <b>for</b> <b>political</b> <b>reasons.</b> Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E
5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site.
