5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

2500|$|The signal {{strength}} received on Earth from Huygens was {{comparable to that}} from the Galileo probe (the Jupiter atmospheric descent probe) as received by the VLA, and was therefore too weak to detect in real time because of the signal modulation by the (then) unknown telemetry. Instead, wide-band recordings of the probe signal were made throughout the three-hour descent. After the probe telemetry was finished being relayed from Cassini to Earth, the now-known data modulation was stripped off the recorded signal, leaving a pure carrier that could be integrated over several seconds to determine the probe frequency. It was expected that through analysis of the Doppler shifting of Huygens signal as it descended through the atmosphere of Titan, wind speed and direction could be determined {{with some degree of}} accuracy. A position of Huygens' landing site on Titan was found with precision (within one km – one km on Titan measures 1.3' latitude and longitude at the equator) using the <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> at a distance from Earth of about 1.2 billion kilometers.

The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> was the primary data source for WGS 72 (Figure 38). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970.

The storm is simulated via assimilation of reflectivity and velocity data in an initially horizontally homogeneous environment whose parameters are believed to be a close approximation to those of the Greensburg supercell inflow sector. Experiments are conducted to test analysis sensitivity to mobile radar data availability and to the mean environmental near-surface wind profile, which was changing rapidly during the simulation period. In all experiments, a supercell with similar location and evolution to the observed storm is analyzed, but the simulated storm’s characteristics differ markedly. The assimilation of mobile <b>Doppler</b> radar <b>data</b> has a much greater impact on the resulting analyses, particularly at low altitudes (# 2 km), than modifications to the near-surface environmental wind profile.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{analyzing}} multiple <b>Doppler</b> radar <b>data</b> is briefly described. A {{feature of this}} method is a new automated objective unfolding scheme which unfolds Doppler velocities for all the radars simultanceously rather than one radar at a time.

50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>Doppler</b> <b>data,</b> two points of view are possible: {{relative}} to the surface or the storm. When looking at the general motion of the rain to extract wind at different altitudes, {{it is better to}} use data relative to the radar. But when looking for rotation or wind shear under a thunderstorm, it is better to use the storm relative images that subtract the general motion of precipitation leaving the user to view the air motion as if he would be sitting on the cloud.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 the {{availability}} of new amplifiers and transmitters operating in the S-band (at 2,200 MHz) allowed the DSN {{to take advantage of}} better tracking performance at the higher frequency, and later missions were designed to use it.

These converters were removed {{at the end of the}} L-band missions. This transfer to S-band was a major enhancement of the DSN capabilities in this era; another was the introduction of rubidium frequency standards which improved the quality of radio <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> and hence improved the trajectory determinations needed for interplanetary missions.|$|E
50|$|Velocity {{estimation}} {{from conventional}} Doppler requires {{knowledge of the}} beam-to-flow angle (Inclination angle) to produce reasonable results for regular flows and does {{a poor job of}} estimating complex flow patterns, such as those due to stenosis and/or bifurcation. Volumetric flow estimation requires integrating velocity across the vessel cross-section, with assumptions about the vessel geometry, further complicating flow estimates. 2D <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> can be used to calculate the volumetric flow in certain integration plane. The integration plane is chosen to be perpendicular to the beam, and Doppler power (generated from power Doppler mode of Doppler ultrasound) can be used to differentiate between the components that are inside and outside the vessel. This method does not require prior knowledge of the Doppler angle, flow profile and vessel geometry.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether cardiac output (CO) could be accurately computed from live three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>Doppler</b> echocardiographic <b>data</b> in an acute open-chested animal preparation. BackgroundThe accurate measurement of CO is important in both patient management and research. Current methods use invasive pulmonary artery catheters or two-dimensional (2 -D) echocardiography or esophageal aortic Doppler measures, with the inherent risks and inaccuracies of these techniques. MethodsSeventeen juvenile, open-chested pigs were studied before undergoing a separate cardiopulmonary bypass procedure. Live 3 -D Doppler echocardiography images of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve were obtained by epicardial scanning, using a Philips Medical Systems (Andover, Massachusetts) Sonos 7500 Live 3 -D Echo system with a 2. 5 -MHz probe. Simultaneous CO measurements were obtained from an ultrasonic flow probe placed around the aortic root. Subsequent offline processing using custom software computed the CO from the digital 3 -D <b>Doppler</b> DICOM <b>data,</b> and this was compared to the gold standard of the aortic flow probe measurements. ResultsOne hundred forty-three individual CO measurements were taken from 16 pigs, one being excluded because of severe aortic regurgitation. There was good correlation between the 3 -D Doppler and flow probe methods of CO measurement (y = 1. 1 x − 9. 82, R 2 = 0. 93). ConclusionsIn this acute animal preparation, live 3 -D <b>Doppler</b> echocardiographic <b>data</b> allowed for accurate assessment of CO as compared to the ultrasonic flow probe measurement...|$|R
50|$|The flyby anomaly {{was first}} noticed during a careful {{inspection}} of DSN <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> {{shortly after the}} Earth flyby of the Galileo spacecraft on 8 December 1990. While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66 mHz shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92 mm/s at perigee. Investigations of this effect at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the University of Texas have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. No anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the Galileo spacecraft in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303 km. However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.|$|E

50|$|Earlier it {{was assumed}} that Rhea had a rocky core in the center. However {{measurements}} taken during a close flyby by the Cassini orbiter in 2005 (see below) cast this into doubt. In a paper published in 2007 it was claimed that the axial dimensionless moment of inertia coefficient was 0.4. Such a value indicated that Rhea had an almost homogeneous interior (with some compression of ice in the center) while the existence of a rocky core would imply a moment of inertia of about 0.34. In the same year another paper claimed the moment of inertia was about 0.37. Rhea being either partially or fully differentiated would be consistent with the observations of the Cassini probe. A year later yet another paper claimed that the moon may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium meaning that the moment of inertia can not be determined from the gravity data alone. In 2008 an author of the first paper tried to reconcile these three disparate results. He concluded that there is a systematic error in the Cassini radio <b>Doppler</b> <b>data</b> used in the analysis, but after restricting the analysis to a subset of data obtained closest to the moon, he arrived at his old result that Rhea was in hydrostatic equilibrium and had the moment inertia of about 0.4, again implying a homogeneous interior.|$|E
