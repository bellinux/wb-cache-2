THEUS {{is very similar to}} the regenerative fuel cell system located at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) but it utilizes the thermal energy from the system to improve the total system efficiency. AIST and SRNL started a collaborative research program on THEUS in 2010 under the Clean Energy Partnership Technology Program between METI and DOE.

However, for metal hydride tanks to become a viable hydrogen storage option, the dynamic performance of practical tank geometries and configurations must be understood and incorporated into fuel cell system analyses. A dynamic, axially-symmetric, multi-nodal metal <b>hydride</b> <b>tank</b> model has been created in Matlab-Simulink ® as an initial means of providing insight and analysis capabilities for the dynamic performance of commercially available metal hydride systems. Following the original work of Mayer et al. [Mayer U, Groll M, Supper W. Heat and mass transfer in metal hydride reaction beds: experimental and theoretical results. Journal of the Less-Common Metals 1987; 131 : 235 - 44], this model employs first principles heat transfer and fluid flow mechanisms together with empirically derived reaction kinetics. Energy and mass balances are solved in cylindrical polar coordinates for a cylindrically shaped tank. The model tank temperature, heat release, and storage volume have been correlated to an actual metal <b>hydride</b> <b>tank</b> for static and transient absorption and desorption processes. A sensitivity analysis of the model was accomplished to identify governing physics and to identify techniques to lessen the computational burden for ease of use in a larger system model. The sensitivity analysis reveals the basis and justification for model simplifications that are selected. Results show that the detailed and simplified models both well predict observed stand-alone metal <b>hydride</b> <b>tank</b> dynamics, and {{an example of a}} reversible fuel cell system model incorporating each tank demonstrates the need for model simplification. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy...|$|E

A three-dimensional mathematical model, validated with experimental results is utilized to simulate the dehydrogenation process of an up-scale cylindrical Mg metal <b>hydride</b> <b>tank.</b> The scope {{of this study is}} to examine the dehydrogenation kinetics of 100 g of H 2 that have been stored to the tank. Five different heat management scenarios are examined and compared to each other: a base case where the heat source for the dehydrogenation process is an external heater (external jacket) surrounding the tank. The second case examines the effect of the radiation heat transfer arising from an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to the metal <b>hydride</b> <b>tank</b> as a possible heat source for the dehydrogenation procedure. The third scenario takes into account the usage of internal heating tubes within the tank and the case of using 8 - 12 - 16 - 20 and 24 co-central tubes. For the fourth scenario, the optimum number of the co-central tubes from the previous case is used in combination with interior extended surfaces (fins). Finally, the last scenario involves the combination of the interior extended surfaces with the external jacket as a possible heat management technique. The results showed that when using the external heating jacket and the radiation heat from the SOFC the time for the hydride to release all the stored hydrogen (100 g) is greater than 15 min, while when using embedded heating tubes with oil as the flowing fluid the time is almost 7 min and when combine the embedded heating tubes with extended surfaces the time for the fully release of hydrogen can reduce more to 2 min.

This thesis describes {{an investigation into the}} use of hydrogen as a fuel for automotive use. Due to problems of backflash into the engine intake when hydrogen is used as the sole fuel, a dual-fuel system using petrol and hydrogen together was studied. Using this system, a spark-ignited engine has been run at all speeds with a wideopen throttle, and the specific fuel consumption and BTE figures indicate a greater part load efficiency than those from a throttled engine. The performance and emissions curves of the engine are presented, both at the standard compression ratio of 8. 9 : 1 and at a higher compression ratio of 11. 7 : 1. Emissions data indicate reduced levels of CO, and NOx at part load due to the very lean mixtures used. No problem of backfiring was experienced since the concentration of hydrogen was very low. A vehicle was modified to run on such a dual-fuel system, and details of this modification are also presented. A major problem with using hydrogen as an automotive fuel is its on-board storage. This is discussed in some detail, with particular reference to the use of metal hydrides as storage media. Metal <b>hydride</b> <b>tanks</b> are now commercially available, and a detailed mathematical model of such a tank has been developed to describe its behaviour under both hydriding and dehydriding conditions. In contrast to other hydride models previously reported in the literature, this model simulates an actual, commercially available containment vessel, rather than that of an abstract ideal situation. Thus the model provides a convenient means of predicting the time taken to release or absorb given amounts of hydrogen.
