By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP.

5000|$|The {{geometry}} {{required to}} make a trailerable flooding-ballast boat function is such {{that they are a}} little awkward in appearance. This is accentuated by the high freeboard and narrow beam required to meet <b>highway</b> <b>trailering</b> limits ... Such boats almost always score poorly relative to their fixed keel counterparts in both sailing performance and power to carry sail. Apart from issues of portability and low cost, the more conventional fixed-keel boats ... are superior ... in most respects.

50|$|Some {{sailboat}} {{designs for}} trailering incorporate special features. The MacGregor 26S, for {{example is a}} boat 25.82 ft in length, but that weighs 1650 lb empty and dry and carries 1200 lb of flooding water ballast in tanks which are filled when the boat is launched and drained when the boat {{is removed from the}} water, thus making the boat lighter to transport than if it used more traditional iron or lead ballast. The design also has a pivoting centreboard, plus a pivoting rudder and easily rigged mast to make getting the boat from the trailer to the water easy to accomplish. It also has a beam of 7.82 ft, under the 8.00 ft width limit for <b>highway</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|All was not {{necessarily}} lost after this incident when only four months later, the Illinois Central Gulf sold the CO&E Railroad its trackage and property altogether after they discontinued freight service along the entire route. With this new advantage in hand, the railroad's first common carrier freight services would commence soon afterwards and the first revenue train was pulled behind 2-4-2 #5 on [...] These changes in operation immediately took off successfully as freight customers started growing rapidly with CO&E's new locally owned and operated service. Piggyback service was also eventually added in [...] when a large fleet of more than 200 new flatcars and 600 <b>highway</b> <b>trailers</b> painted for the CO&E Railroad were delivered.

2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting <b>highway</b> freight <b>trailers</b> on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of {{securing}} each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|R
25|$|Shooting {{primarily}} {{occurred in}} the counties of Berkshire, Devon, Dorset, and Somerset. Most filming {{occurred in the}} town of Clevedon in Somerset, with some filming in Bristol. The production spent nearly three months filming at the University of Exeter in the city of Exeter in Devon. Extensive shooting was also done in West Bay in Dorset, where the production used the Station Road Car Park for its production <b>trailers</b> and <b>offices.</b> A car park next to the West Bay Hotel in Bridport served as the production's base camp while filming in that area, while the Rivermead Leisure Centre car park served as production headquarters in Reading, Berkshire. The John Nike Leisuresport Complex served as production headquarters in Bracknell, Berkshire.|$|R

5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no <b>trailer</b> or <b>office</b> and could not watch dailies for three weeks.

Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|R

2500|$|NS {{is a major}} {{transporter}} {{of domestic}} and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, {{as well as the}} Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the [...] "Clearfield Cluster". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are <b>highway</b> truck <b>trailers</b> with interchangeable wheel sets.|$|R
