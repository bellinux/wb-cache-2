5000|$|Initially, Honduran {{producers}} {{focused on}} growing the <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> type of <b>bananas,</b> which had important characteristics {{that made them}} easy to store and ship and appealed to consumers in North American markets. However in the early 1920s banana-producing areas began suffering from a blight known as the [...] "Panama Disease" [...] which, combined with soil exhaustion from monocrop agriculture, led to a production decline {{in many parts of}} northern Honduras. The companies sought to restore production by rerouting railroads and renegotiating concessions so to bring more virgin land into cultivation. In addition they began to replace the <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> with the Cavendish variety, which had some resistance to the disease.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a belief}} that {{artificial}} banana flavour tastes [...] "fake" [...] because {{it was intended to}} mimic the flavour of the 'Gros Michel' and not the Cavendish banana. This is due to the main chemical in banana flavoring being isoamyl acetate, the same chemical found in all bananas. Isoamyl acetate is popular due to it being a versatile and easy to work with compound. It is perceived to be closer in taste to a <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> <b>banana</b> due to that strain having a higher concentration of that chemical and fewer [...] "volatile components" [...] that are found in other bananas. The Cavendish banana has a lot more complexity in its makeup, and therefore tastes less like pure isoamyl acetate. Whether or not banana flavorings were purposely designed to taste more like Gros Michel is unknown.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 72 fungal endophytes were {{isolated}} from surface-sterilized roots of healthy 'Gros Michel' (AAA genome, <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> subgroup) <b>banana</b> plants in Turrialba, Costa Rica.

In vitro tests revealed that 22 isolates inhibited the growth of Foc. The four most effective isolates were selected for suppression of Foc under greenhouse conditions. Plants treated with the four isolates showed a significant reduction of external and internal symptoms compared with untreated plants. Based on sequence analyses of specific genome regions [elongation factor - Tefa- 1 α or Internal Transcribed Spacer - ITS], the fungi tested in the greenhouse were identified as Trichoderma asperellum. Field trials are currently underway in Costa Rica to verify the performance of T. asperellum isolates as potential biological control agents against Foc. Results indicate that certain endophytic microorganisms may play important roles in controlling Fusarium wilt in banana. A better understanding of the antagonistic mechanisms displayed by endophytes in order to provide the best conditions to optimize the antagonistic activities of beneficial strains is still required.

Pretreated banana slices were dried in a cabinet oven dryer using a completely randomized design at 60 and 70 °C and their drying {{characteristics such as}} rate of drying, moisture diffusivity, re-hydration ratio, and coefficient of re-hydration were studied.

The 5 mm thick slices at a drying air temperature of 70 dried better than the others and resulted in about 13 % savings in time. The minimum re-hydration ratio of 1. 215 was obtained for 7 mm thick slices treated with ascorbic acid and the maximum re-hydration ratio of 1. 716 was obtained for lemon juice samples.

40|$|Bananas (Musa sp.) {{serve as}} a staple diet and {{source of income for}} {{millions}} of people worldwide. The crop, however, is vulnerable to several important diseases such as Fusarium wilt, caused by the soilborne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). During the mid- 20 th century, thousands of acres of export banana plantations were lost in Central America due to Fusarium wilt. The epidemic was brought under control only by replacing the highly susceptible <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> <b>banana</b> with Cavendish cultivars. Cavendish bananas, however, are susceptible to Foe race 4, a highly virulent variant of the pathogen that also causes disease to banana varieties susceptible to Foc races 1 and 2. Only this time, no resistant replacement varieties acceptable to the commercial market exist, while cultural and/or chemical control strategies proved to be ineffective for disease control. The only sustainable solution, thus, would be the improvement of existing banana varieties that are acceptable to consumers for resistance to Fusarium wilt. An understanding of how plants defend themselves against pathogens is an imperative first step towards the development of disease-resistant plants. Two broad defence mechanisms against pathogen attack exist in plants: Constitutive defence mechanisms that are pathogen non-specific and induced plant defence responses following recognition of specific pathogen features. A primary objective {{of this study was to}} elucidate induced banana defence responses. Induced defence responses may include the induction of regulator and antifungal proteins, the production of active-oxygen species or products from the phenylpropanoid pathway. A few studies have attempted to elucidate the genetic factors involved in the banana defence response but to date no clear answer has arisen. Forward and reverse genetics encompass approached by which plant defence responses can be studied; a particular technique of interest which can be classified under both forward and reverse genetics is cDNA-Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) In a field trial conducted in an Foc-infested field in Kiepersol, South Africa, cultivars Rose and Calcutta IV proved resistant, and FHIA- 17 tolerant to Foe 'subtropical' race 4 (VCG 0120) when compared to the highly susceptible Cavendish cultivar 'Williams'. The genetic basis of defence to Foc in FHIA- 17, Rose and Calcutta IV was verified using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-RT-PCR). Catalase, POX and PAE were strongly up-regulated in the tolerant and resistant banana varieties. These genes are involved in the oxidative burst and secondary metabolism leading to the phenylpropanoid pathway and cell wall strengthening. Resistance to Foc, 'subtropical' race 4, thus seems to depend on the early recognition of the pathogen and subsequent blocking of its progress into the plant's vascular system. The response of resistant and tolerant banana varieties to Foc was elucidated by analysing the banana transcriptome 6 and 72 hours post inoculation (hpi) using cDNA-AFLP. Seventy-six differentially expressed transcript derived fragments (TDFs) were isolated, sequenced and subjected to BLASTX and BLASTN searches. Many of the sequences were not significantly similar to any other sequences in the databases, but several genes fragments showed homology to defence-related genes. TDFs representing genes such as S-adenosylmethionine synthase (SAMS) and isoflavone reductase, which are potentially involved in the production of cell wall strengthening compounds such as lignin, were identified. Expression patterns of selected TDFs as seen on the cDNA-AFLP gels were confirmed using qRT -PCR. As additional endogenous controls, two TDFs which displayed constitutive expression on the cDNA-AFLP gels, were isolated, sequenced and were optimised for use as endogenous control genes for the normalisation of the qRT-PCR data. In most cases, the expression patterns seen on the cDNA-AFLP gels were replicated by qRT-PCR. This study concludes that the tolerant (FHIA- 17) and resistant (Rose and Calcutta IV) banana varieties induced defence-related genes upon attack by Foc and that the cDNA-AFLP technique was further effective in identifying additional defence-related genes. Looking to the future, the greatest understanding of the defence responses induced during the banana/Foe interaction would be obtained by using additional molecular approaches or techniques. It is in some cases sufficient to look exclusively at transcriptomic i. e. cDNA-AFLP and microarray data to study the plant's response, however, a look at differential protein and metabolite expression would complement transcriptomic data and add insight into the fate of certain expressed genes. This would possibly speed up the identification of the defence pathways used by resistant bananas to resist infection by Foc, once identified these pathways can be manipulated in the susceptible plants and thus the generation of a Foc resistant banana could finally become a reality.

In both cultivars the delay of blackening {{was correlated with}} an increase in the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Hot water treatment in cv. <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> but not cv.

The results suggest that the rapid peel blackening of cv. <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> is related to detectable membrane degradation, whereas the membrane-associated changes might be below the detection limit in the slower blackening cv.

The delay of peel blackening in cv. <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> was associated with reduced expression of a catechol oxidase gene, which might partially explain the lower catechol oxidase activity after hot water treatment. The hot water treatment also increased the abundance of a Hsp 70 transcript. The changes in gene expression found in cv. <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> were not observed in cv. Namwa. Taken together the delay of blackening by hot water treatment in cv.

40|$|Fusarium wilt of banana, {{caused by}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), {{is one of}} the most {{destructive}} plant diseases in recorded history. The disease was first discovered in Australia in 1874 but became renowned for the severe losses it caused to export banana plantations during the 1960 s in Central America. The banana export industry was saved only by replacing <b>Gros</b> <b>Michel</b> <b>bananas,</b> the dessert banana grown for the export market, with highly resistant Cavendish banana cultivars. Despite this apparent solution, the fungus was found to attack Cavendish bananas in the sub-tropics, where plants were believed to be predisposed to the disease by the cool winter climate. Good management practices and conventional disease management strategies have not been sufficient to reduce losses and stop the disease from spreading, and today Fusarium wilt can be found in almost all banana-producing countries of the world. Since 1988, Foc has been responsible for significant losses of Cavendish bananas in tropical Asia. The only sustainable control measure, the use of resistant varieties, is not always popular as people prefer to eat locally adopted varieties that, unfortunately, are susceptible to Foc. Sustainable Fusarium wilt management in banana depends on the improvement of existing banana cultivars or the development of novel disease management strategies. Molecular biology and biotechnology provide opportunities to introduce foreign resistance genes into existing cultivars and to develop new, environmentally friendly products that can protect susceptible bananas from Foc. Better knowledge of the Fusarium wilt pathogen, its diversity, and its mechanisms of pathogenesis will contribute significantly to developing these novel approaches for control of the disease. Molecular information on the pathogenicity of Foc, however, is limited, whereas other formae speciales of F. oxysporum have been better studied. In this thesis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of (ATMT) was employed to investigate genes responsible for pathogenicity of Foc to banana. Chapter 1 provides an overview of pathogenicity in F. oxysporum. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms of the fungus are first introduced to the reader, and then the biology, epidemiology and etiology of pathogenic forms of F. oxysporum are discussed. The genetic make-up and ability of the Fusarium wilt fungus to cause disease in plants concludes the first part of the review. In recent years, there has been a noted increase in the number of techniques available to study hostpathogen interactions. The second part of the review concentrates on these techniques and their applications in studying pathogenicity of the Fusarium wilt pathogen. In Chapter 2, an ATMT and screening system for Foc was developed. Five A. tumefaciens strains were evaluated for their efficiency to transform Foc with a randomly integrating vector that confers hygromycin B resistance and expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). A small insertion mutant library of Foc was created, and a subset of transformants was characterized by determining the number of T-DNA inserts present, the location and identity of predicted genes disrupted by T-DNA insertion, and whether transformants of Foc were altered in their virulence against susceptible banana plants. In Chapter 3, the role of a known pathogenicity gene, Frp 1, of the tomato pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) was investigated in Foc. The first objective was to isolate and characterize the Frp 1 gene in Foc, and to compare it to the homologous gene in Fol. A vector containing a modified Fol Frp 1 gene was then obtained and used for targeted disruption of the gene in Foc via ATMT. Mutants in which the Frp 1 gene was disrupted were then analyzed for GFP expression, culture morphology, and alterations in pathogenicity to banana.
