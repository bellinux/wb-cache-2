I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E

With people I try more for realism, which is probably why I'm generally better with animals.|$|E
500|$|In March 1851, Lord John Russell's {{government}} was defeated over {{a bill to}} equalise the county and borough franchises, mostly because of divisions among his supporters. He resigned, and the Queen sent for Stanley, who felt that a minority government could do little and would not last long, so Russell remained in office. Disraeli regretted this, hoping for an opportunity, however brief, to show himself capable in office. Stanley, on the other hand, deprecated his inexperienced followers {{as a reason for}} not assuming office, [...] "These are not names <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> before the Queen." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now // And <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> you back there too".|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close... I've never prepared like this in my life — for anything. [...] I want to leave nothing on the table." ...|$|E

I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E

500|$|I cannot {{withhold}} my compliments {{from the}} government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It {{remains to be seen whether}} the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.|$|E

[...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece".

You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score.

500|$|Vanity Fair {{commented that}} [...] "it's {{hard to imagine}} that there was a time before Meryl Streep was the greatest-living actress". Emma Brockes of The Guardian notes that despite Streep's being [...] "one of the most famous actresses in the world", it is [...] "strangely hard to pin an image on Streep", in a career where she has [...] "laboured to {{establish}} herself as an actor whose roots lie in ordinary life". Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on and that makes it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting." [...] She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.|$|E
500|$|With the {{appearance}} of Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter One-Shot. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." [...] On his use of the theme, McCreary stated, as Carter [...] "storms in, the first violins state an elongated version of her theme soaring above an aggressive, orchestral ostinato". McCreary also introduced a new Hydra theme in the episode that represents Daniel Whitehall, and is used in scenes featuring the Obelisk and Carl Creel. About the theme, McCreary said [...] "In true bad-guy-theme fashion, the theme is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals. I build a theme like this so it can easily [...] into increasingly dissonant variations. For example, the E in the C minor chord will clash against the E minor, as will the B in the G minor chord. Building the theme in this way means that, in the future, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> this theme over any pedal tone bass note and it will always sound dissonant." ...|$|E

[...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

Smith revealed that an ongoing audit over residuals from Clerks II with The Weinstein Company was causing a delay in several key Clerks III cast and crew members, including Jeff Anderson and Scott Mosier, from coming on board until the audit was resolved. Smith also revealed {{that he would like}} to crowdsource Clerks III, either through Kickstarter or Indiegogo, with contributors receiving anything from DVDs, posters, and even roles as extras in the film. As of yet, no start date for production has been set. [...] On June 5, 2013, he changed his mind on crowdsourcing, stating [...] "I've got access to money.

"End of Time" [...] was {{conceived}} at the MSR Studios in New York City, where Knowles {{and her team}} spent a few days with the band from Fela! - a Broadway musical based on Kuti's life. As stated Jordan [...] "DJ Swivel Young, this period is accountable for the [...] "Fela [...] influence" [...] in the song; this influence is further illustrated in its instrumentation that includes horns and percussion instruments. At the beginning, the production team played music with the band as they experimented with horns, percussion, drums, guitars and keys. DJ Swivel explained: [...] "We'd be taking loops, like a section of percussion — congas for example — and then using them on a completely different record; and that record might be a completely different tempo or in a different key, so we'd literally be pitching it as we went.

Umaga also led the All Blacks to their second Northern Hemisphere Grand Slam. After playing 74 test matches for his country Tana Umaga confirmed his retirement from international rugby {{at a press conference}} on 10 January 2006. His main reason for retiring was {{to spend more time with}} his family as he had just had another child with his wife Rochelle. Tana Umaga's announcement led to Richie McCaw succeeding him as captain.

2500|$|Wealthy and {{socially}} ambitious women {{were drawn to}} Worth's showpiece creations.

Wealthy Americans travelled to Paris to have their entire wardrobe made by Worth – and that meant morning, afternoon and evening dresses {{as well as what}} were termed 'undress' items such as nightgowns and tea gowns. He would also design special occasion garments, such as wedding dresses. Alongside high society, the House of Worth also produced garments for popular stars such as Sarah Bernhardt, Lillie Langtry and Jenny Lind – who shopped there for both performance and private wear. Prices at Worth were dizzying for the time; the last bill it issued to Princess de Metternich – who had commented {{on the end of the}} 300 franc dress once Worth acquired royal patronage – was for the sum of 2,247 francs. Her purchase had been one lilac velvet dress.|$|E
