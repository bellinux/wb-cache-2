5|$|In March 1952, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record £16,000 fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons {{left the}} club {{at the start}} of the 1952–53 season and was succeeded by his {{assistant}} Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953–54 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing <b>Dear</b> <b>Old</b> Pals.|$|E

25|$|To these Three Kings I mainly owe {{the happy}} Christmas seasons of my {{childhood}} and I should have remained very grateful to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three <b>dear</b> <b>old</b> Kings of my old childhood.|$|E
500|$|Describing Dot, Brown has said, [...] "I love playing her– she's {{a strong}} character. <b>Dear</b> <b>old</b> Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd {{religious}} beliefs, but her heart's {{in the right}} place. She has that awful worried {{expression on her face}} the whole time". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state– I like it when Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is".|$|E
500|$|In the 1945 British general election, Churchill's Conservative {{party was}} soundly {{defeated}} by the Labour party of Clement Attlee. Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed, but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's [...] "high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth" [...] as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as [...] "poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them." [...] Woodrow Wyatt thought her [...] "much more pro-Conservative" [...] than {{other members of the}} royal family, but she later told him, [...] "I like the <b>dear</b> <b>old</b> Labour Party." [...] She also told the Duchess of Grafton, [...] "I love communists". After six years in office, Attlee was defeated in the 1951 British general election and Churchill returned to power.|$|E

500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I am sorry to be leaving the <b>dear</b> <b>old</b> Munster lads, but I really can't stand it any longer. I {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years. When the Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred to the 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division on 29 January 1918 Gleeson remained with the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E
500|$|Another serious {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} 14:42 that started severe {{fires in the}} hangar and blew the forward elevator [...] above the flight deck. Power to the forward half of the ship failed shortly afterward. Fletcher sent three destroyers to assist, but another major explosion at 15:25 knocked out water pressure in the hangar and forced the evacuation of the forward machinery spaces. The fire eventually forced the evacuation of all compartments below the waterline at 16:00 and Lexington eventually drifted to a halt. Evacuation of the wounded began shortly afterward and Sherman ordered [...] "abandon ship" [...] at 17:07. A series of large explosions began around 18:00 that blew the aft elevator apart and threw aircraft into the air. Sherman waited until 18:30 {{to ensure that all}} of his crewmen were off the ship before leaving himself. Some 2,770 officers and men were rescued {{by the rest of the}} task force. The destroyer [...] was ordered to sink the ship and fired a total of five torpedoes between 19:15 and 19:52. Immediately after the last torpedo hit, Lexington, down by the bow but nearly on an even keel finally sank at [...] A Lexington officer famously said [...] "There she goes.

2500|$|Most of the Drones {{short stories}} are also [...] "Eggs, Beans, and Crumpets stories", as Wodehouse divides the club members into [...] "Eggs", [...] "Beans", and [...] "Crumpets". [...] This is {{allegedly}} {{based on the}} habit they have of addressing each other as [...] "old egg", [...] "old bean", or [...] "my <b>dear</b> <b>old</b> crumpet" ... although, in fact, no character in the stories actually addresses another character by these nicknames.|$|E

2500|$|Blofeld {{has been}} a regular {{commentator}} for TMS since 1972, except for a period at BSkyB from 1991 to 1994. Blofeld's cricket commentary is characterised by his plummy voice and his idiosyncratic mention of superfluous details regarding the scene, including things such as construction cranes or numbers of pink shirts in the crowd; as well as pigeons, buses, aeroplanes and helicopters that happen to be passing by. After the tea and lunch breaks he is also known to talk for {{extended periods of time}} about the food on offer, in particular cakes, with occasional interruptions to describe the situation on the field. He also uses the phrase [...] "my <b>dear</b> <b>old</b> thing".|$|E
2500|$|The older {{generation}} of Darwin's tutors were rather negative, {{and later in}} May he told his cousin Fox that [...] "the attacks have been falling thick & heavy on my now case-hardened hide.— Sedgwick & Clarke opened regular battery on me lately at Cambridge Phil.

For Charles it was an [...] "Entomo-Mathematical expedition". Though he badly needed to catch up with his mathematics, the insect collecting predominated along with pleasant diversions such as hillwalking, boating and fly fishing. He went on daily walks with his close friend, the older student John Maurice Herbert who he dubbed [...] "Cherbury" [...] after Herbert of Cherbury, the father of English Deism. Herbert assisted with the insect collecting, but the usual outcome was that Darwin would examine Herbert's collecting bottle and say [...] "Well, old Cherbury, none of these will do." [...] In September Darwin wrote to tell [...] "My <b>dear</b> <b>old</b> Cherbury" [...] that his own catches had included [...] "some of the rarest of the British Insects, & their being found near Barmouth is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall write & inform some of the crack Entomologists."
