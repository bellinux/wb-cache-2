5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E

In utilization decisions, individuals may use a higher sunk-cost alternative with a higher intensity or just choose to utilize the paid good or service despite other preferences or alternatives. In progress decisions, individuals may commit additional resources to an initially chosen alternative, report an increased probability to allocate funds, or simply choose to continue to invest.|$|R
