40|$|Abstract: An {{explicit}} equation {{leading to a}} method for improving furnace efficiency is presented. This equation is dimensionless and {{can be applied to}} furnaces of any size and fuel type for the purposes of com-parison. The implications for current furnace design are discussed. Currently the technique most commonly used to reduce energy consumption in galvanizing furnaces is to increase burner turndown. This is shown by the analysis presented here actually to worsen the thermal efficiency of the furnace, particularly at low levels of capacity utilization. Galvanizing furnaces are different to many furnaces used within industry, as a quan-tity of material (in this case zinc) is kept molten within the furnace at all times, even outside production periods. The dimensionless analysis can, however, be applied to furnaces with the same operational function as a <b>galvanizing</b> <b>furnace,</b> such as some furnaces utilized within the glass industry...|$|E
40|$|A {{state space}} model {{discrete}} {{in time and}} space was developed for on-line and real-time computation and prediction of strip temperature in a continuous <b>galvanizing</b> annealing <b>furnace.</b> The model development was based on a combination of physical modeling and system identification. An equivalent heat transfer coefficient was introduced to simplify the physical relations of the process. Compact model expressions suitable for on-line and real-time computation were obtained using the finite difference technique. A stability analysis of the model was conducted to guide the selections of time and space steps. System identification aspects were also discussed. The model was successfully applied to industry with good performance...|$|R
