The damper consists of a short length square hollow section with a steel diaphragm plate welded inside it. It is designed to fit between floor beam and a <b>K-brace</b> such that relative movement between the connected sides of the damper produces a shearing action onto the diaphragm plate. Mechanism analysis is first described, followed by numerical investigation. Results show that diaphragm plate slenderness ratio and the SHS wall thickness influence the energy dissipation capability. Appropriate combinations of SHS and diaphragm plate will yield a good passive damper which is inexpensive to manufacture and easy to install and replace...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Multistoreyed {{buildings}} are {{most affected by}} earthquake forces in seismic prone areas. The major concern {{in the design of}} the multi-storey buildings is the structure to have enough lateral stability to resist lateral forces and to control the lateral drift of the building. The use of steel bracing systems in reinforced concrete frames is a viable solution for resisting lateral forces. Steel bracing is economical, easy to erect, occupies less space and has flexibility in design for meeting the required strength and stiffness. In the present study eighteen storeyed building is analyzed with three different types of bracings and each bracing has been provided at three different locations. The types of bracing studied are X-brace, V-brace and <b>K-brace.</b> In the first location, bracings are provided in the exterior frame at corners. In the second location, bracings are again provided in the exterior frame, but in the middle bays. Finally, in the third location, bracings are provided in the middle bays in exterior and interior frames both. In all nine different cases of braced RC frames are analyzed and compared with unbraced RC frame, using STAAD PRO- 2007 with Response Spectrum method. It has been seen that X bracing shows the best performance. Index Terms—RC frame, steel bracing, fundamental time period, base shear, lateral displacement, storey drift, axial force. I...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the increasing necessity for structural safety of drilling platforms, the need for monitoring techniques capable of detecting early damage of subsurface structural components increases. [...] The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide theoretical and laboratory experimental evidence that a predictable relationship exists between physical damage of certain structural components, and changes in the resonant frequencies of a structure measured at the deck level. To achieve this objective, experiments were carried out on a k-braced model of an offshore tower using random vibration analyses, and the results were compared to those determined from a finite element model of the structure (free vibration STRUDL II analyses). [...] Natural frequencies were determined from the intact and damaged structure and the results, experimental and analytical, were compared to measure the effects of the damaged member(s) on the resonant frequencies of the structure. By removing an inclined member in a k-braced panel to simulate damage of that member, a 22. 75 % decrease in the natural frequency of the 2 nd sway mode was measured on the transfer function of the experimental model; the theoretical results indicated a 16. 02 % decrease. Investigations into the effect of a member cracking showed a 9. 2 % decrease in the excitation frequency of the 2 nd sway mode, when a <b>k-brace</b> member was cut halfway across at one joint on the experimental model. [...] From the results obtained, it was concluded that the changes in natural frequencies clearly indicated that the structure had, in fact, undergone damage. Moreover, the theoretical results showed that the mode(s) most affected depended on the location of the damaged member(s). [...] It is recommended that although the technique appears promising, it should not be viewed as a panacea for solving the problem of early detection of subsurface structural damage with great certainty since certainty, in such a complex environment as the ocean, can rarely be assured. Nonetheless, if the structural integrity monitoring technique is applied in conjunction with conventional detection procedure, the effectiveness of early damage detection will be enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the {{effective}} length factors of latticed towers 2 ̆ 7 members have been generally focused on the cross-bracing and single bracing of angle members.

40|$|In {{the need}} for more green energy a {{prominent}} role is reserved for wind energy. Offshore wind energy in deeper waters capitalises on more efficient wind properties and increased public acceptance compared to onshore wind energy and wind farms close to shore. In the coming years the offshore wind market is expected to evolve rapidly, especially in the deeper water range of thirty to sixty meter. In a business case preceding to this study as first reference a jacket type substructure was designed for a 6 MW turbine in a water depth of sixty meter. The goal of this thesis is to reduce the cost of this reference design in total use of material and assembly. Also the transportation and installation of the substructure are taken in consideration. First a step back is taken to reconsider the structural concept of the reference design. Several substructure concepts, like tripods and straight-leg jackets, have passed the review and firstly qualitative weighed against primary criteria in a Multi Criteria Analysis and subsequently by FEM based in-place analysis. The outcome of the total substructure weight and natural frequency with respect to frequency of wave loading and turbine excitement determined the decision to further investigate a three-leg and four-leg battered jacket. Thereto a fatigue analysis was performed. The calculation method used at the original reference design to determine the total fatigue damage due to turbine and wave loading was proven to be too optimistic and therefore modified. In relation to the reference design several optimisations have been proposed, including applying a horizontal brace just above mudline level, applying double sided butt welds and adopting <b>K-bracing</b> instead of X-bracing. Here the four enclosed pictures can be placed. (number 1 upmost left, number 4 upmost right) Finally, four designs have been worked out; the reference design (without optimisations), an optimised four-leg jacket, four-leg jacket with <b>k-braces</b> and a three-leg jacket. The total assembling cost of each design is calculated by considering the handling time and the welding volume with corresponding welding time of each weld. Together with the material use the total fabrication cost is assessed. The jacket shall be transported offshore by a standard North Sea barge. The dimensions of this barge potentially enable the transportation of three four-leg jackets and four three-leg jackets. Depending on the wind farm location this may lead to reduction of one tug and transport barge case of the three-leg jacket. Further consequence of the three-leg jacket is that a foundation pile less needs to be driven. Thereto is the installation time of the three-leg jacket reduced, resulting in less installation cost. By combining fabrication, transport and installation cost it is possible to compute an overview for substructures cost in a complete wind farm. Final conclusion is that the fabrication cost are decisive compared to the installation and transport cost. The four-leg jacket with <b>K-braces</b> {{turns out to be the}} most inexpensive design, respectively followed by the thee-leg jacket, the optimised four-leg jacket and the reference design. It is expected that the four-leg jacket with <b>K-braces</b> brings total cost reduction of approximately nine percent compared to the reference design.

40|$|High-rise steel {{construction}} is increasing at an expanding scale and in modern construction stiffness {{of the structure}} has become paramount criteria as the building increases in height.

The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of different types and orientations of bracing on the frame structure in terms of lateral drift. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of ANSYS 12. 0 software has been used to model 30 -storey of 90 m height steel frame building subjected to substantial basic wind speed, or 3 -second gust, of 24 meter per second, and wind load of 0. 969 kPa.

40|$|Structures {{have always}} been {{subjected}} to the detrimental consequences of the fatigue phenomenon. The consequences due to this damaging effects leads to crack initiation and the ultimate result being complete failure. Fatigue appears on structures that has to endure fluctuating loads over a long period. The crack initiation occurs irregular geometries {{such as in the}} vicinity of welds and bolts. A structure that suffers a lot due to fatigue are road bridges. In this thesis the structure under investigation is a composite bridge with a concrete slab on top of two I-girders. The recommended lifetime of road bridges in the Eurocode is 100 years. Bridges are exposed to daily and yearly traffic loads. Also the amount of traffic and therefore the total weight shows a continuously increasing trend over the years. This tendency is under no circumstances expected to stagnate. Eurocode has based its approach to verification of fatigue on applying adversely combined traffic loads, in both directions, on the bridge. In the procedure of double I-girder composite bridges verification there is an uneven distribution of the vehicle loads and the stresses, as the bridge is behaving as an open cross-section. The concrete slab is the only apparent part that is transferring the vehicle loads to the other girder and gives therefore an unequal distribution of the loads. Because of this uneven load distribution there appears to exist some potential in finding a means to strengthen the bridge by ways of making it work as a semi-closed cross-section. This will enhance the load distribution over to the non-stressed girder. In this thesis the focus was set on the stress relation between the center web stiffener to the lower flange, with and without the strengthening, for a real case section. Assessment were done for case studies where the Rokån bridge as well as four arbitrary cross-sections were investigated in search of retrieving an increased understanding of the mechanism of stress distribution. The strengthening approach is to introduce a truss assembly, in shape of a K, in the plane between the two I-girders bottom flanges. This approach reduced the stresses in the middle position of the Rokån bridge by approximately 8. 3 %. In addition, the parametric study of the arbitrary cross-sections, with the same truss system, where made. Reductions there showed stress values in the interval of 5. 9 % and 16. 6 %. Based on this study it was found {{that it is possible to}} establish a relation between the length on the bridge and the distance, w, between the girders. With regards to this study in applying this <b>K-bracing,</b> indicates that given stress reductions can prolong the bridges technical life to about 2. 5 times. In comparison to strengthening ways available on the market, such as CFRP sheets and an additional concrete slab, there are advantages and disadvantages, such as self-weight, total cost, new fatigue details and the most important stress reduction. While the reductions tends to be quite high, there still exists a FE-model uncertainty regarding the coupling between the <b>K-bracing</b> junctions and the bottom flanges where the fusion of the elements was done with a node to node attachment. In a reality attaching the <b>K-bracing</b> onto the flange will be done by means of a bolted, welded or friction connection, which may lead to another fatigue category and increased/decreased stress concentrations at the new joints...|$|R

In such a case, the restoring force characteristics of the frame largelydepend upon the slender's ratio of the braces as following. (1) When the slender's ratio of the braces x is less than 30, the experiment of this braced frameproduces the stable hysteritic loops.

Belonging {{to the family of}} metallic dampers, the device is to be incorporated into <b>K-braced</b> moment-resisting frames. It consists of a short length square hollow section (SHS) with a diaphragm plate welded inside it. Under moderate earthquake loading, the device deforms plastically under applied shear forces, while the frame members remain essentially elastic. Subassemblies of the frame-to-device connection were designed and tested. The tests incorporate various SHS dimensions and diaphragm plate aspect ratios. Both monotonic and cyclic loadings were employed in these tests. Based on the experimental results, the device with small d/t ratios showed stable hysteretic behavior with significant energy dissipation capacity. Strain hardening was observed in the post-yield region, which further increased the device's energy absorption capacity. Thin diaphragm plates suffered from shear buckling, strength degradation and pinched hysteresis was observed. Accumulation of out-of-plane deformation after repeated inelastic load cycles led to strength degradation and subsequent failure of the device. Welds on the perimeter of the diaphragm plates did not show damage.

40|$|This Master's thesis {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} marine growth {{on the design of}} a lattice tower substructure for an offshore wind turbine. Marine growth is the unwanted colonization of marine structures by marine organisms. The current standards prescribe a thickness of 100 mm whereas in the literature, layers up to 200 mm thick have been reported for structures in the North Sea. Marine growth leads to increased wave loading on the structure. This is caused by the increased effective member diameter, as well as increased drag coefficient due to increased surface roughness. Marine growth also represents an additional non-structural mass, reducing the structural natural frequencies. Marine growth may increase flow instability and vortex shedding, but this has not been evaluated in this report. The effects of marine growth have been evaluated for the NOWITECH 10 MW reference turbine. Alteration of the natural frequencies caused dynamic amplification when structural natural frequencies approached the nP-values of the rotor. The effect was most prominent for the local-modes natural frequencies, the modes including out-of-plane deformation of the bracing. The relative importance of the increased hydrodynamic load and additional non-structural mass was investigated. It was concluded that both effects must be included in the model to describe the dynamic behaviour. The fatigue lifetime of the <b>K-braces</b> was more sensitive to marine growth thickness than that of the X-braces. The X-brace fatigue lifetime gave the design lifetime for this particular design and marine growth lead to significant reductions in the fatigue lifetime. Marine growth would increase the lifetime in certain points. Thus, it is necessary to check the design also without marine growth. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{cyclic loading}} regime {{that has been}} used in this study is based on Method B of ASTM Standard (2007), which was {{originally}} developed for ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard 16670. This loading methodology consists of one full cycle at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4  mm and three full cycles at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 and 72  mm, unless failure or a significant decrease in the load resistance occurs earlier. The mentioned lateral amplitudes correspond to 1.55, 3.125, 6.25, 9.35, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 and 225  % of the ultimate monotonic lateral displacement of the walls, which was evaluated to be equal to 32  mm. It is worth noting that Method B of ASTM E 2126 - 07 stipulates that the amplitude of cyclic displacements has to be selected based on fractions of monotonic ultimate displacement. If this was applied here, since each specimen had its own ultimate displacement, the loading regime would vary for different specimen types. However, as set out earlier, one of the current research objectives is the comparison of different types of <b>K-braced</b> configurations of the shear walls, which would necessitate using identical cyclic amplitudes for different walls. Hence, Method B is used in this study with lateral amplitude independent of monotonic testing. Moreover, although 75  mm, or 3.125  %, the inter-story drift ratio was the maximum amplitude of the actuator and was considered to be adequate, since the maximum allowable story drift ratio specified by the Standard FEMA 450 (2003) is 2.5  %. The average loading velocity was about 2  mm/s which is compatible with the ASTM E 2126 - 07 recommendation that the loading velocity must be in the range of 1 – 63  mm/s.|$|R

The devices proved easy and cheap to manufacture, fit, remove and replace. All the devices tested yielded at quite low deformations and sustained very large ductilities without failure. The load carried by the device continued to increase after yield, with a ratio of maximum force carried to yield force of around 1. 7 in most tests. While a device with a 2 mm diaphragm appeared to offer the maximum energy dissipation capacity, thinner devices were prone to buckling and to fracture under repeated large- amplitude cycling. A thickness of 3 mm (i. e. thickness to breadth ratio of 0. 03) is recommended as offering the best combination of dissipative capacity and robustness. A 3 mm device dissipated approximately 1. 3 kJ of energy when the frame in which it was fitted underwent a single displacement cycle of amplitude 30 mm. It is concluded that these devices offer a simple, cheap and robust way of dissipating significant amounts of energy in seismically loaded frames. Some improvements to the rig design and suggestions for further work are offered in section 4. 6...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{studies in the}} {{literature}} conducted {{on the subject of}} ensuring earthquake safety of reinforced concrete and steel structures using steel braced frames, but no detailed study concerning individual behavior of steel braced frames under earthquake loads and strengthening of reinforced concrete structures with outof-plane steel braced frames has been encountered. In this study, in order to evaluate behaviors of "Concentrically Steel Braced Frames" types defined in TEC- 2007 under lateral loads, dimensional analysis of Concentrically Steel Braced Frames designed with different scales and dimensions was conducted, the results were controlled according to TEC- 2007, and after conducting static pushover analysis, behavior and load capacity of the Concentrically Steel Braced Frames and hinges sequence of the elements constituting the Concentrically Steel Braced Frames were tested. Concentrically Steel Braced Frames that were tested analytically consist of 2 storey and one bay, and are formed as two groups with the scales 1 / 2 and 1 / 3. In the study, Concentrically Steel Braced Frames described in TEC- 2007 were designed, which are 7 types in total being non-braced, X-braced, V-braced, Λ-braced, braced, /-braced and <b>K-braced.</b> Furthermore, in order to verify accuracy of the analytic studies performed, the 1 / 2 scaled concentrically steel X-braced frame test element made up of box profiles and 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frame with insufficient earthquake resistance were tested individually under lateral loads, and test results were compared with the results derived from analytic studies and interpreted. Similar results were obtained from both experimental studies and pushover analyses. According to pushover analysis results, load-carrying capacity of 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frames increased up to 7, 01 times as compared to the non-braced specimen upon strengthening. Results acquired from the study revealed that reinforced concrete buildings which have inadequate seismic capacity can be strengthened quickly, easily and economically by this method without evacuating them...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} requirement for structural safety of offshore drilling platforms, the need for monitoring techniques capable of detecting damage of subsurface structural components increases. Since it is not possible, because of limited time constraints, to carry out tests on an actual operating platform in the ocean, an alternative solution is to experiment on a reduced model of an offshore structure. Very few experiments using a truly hydro-elastic model of a jacket platform have been published. [...] This treatise deals with a detailed design and construction of a hydro-elastic model of a typical four-legged jacket offshore platform to carry out structural integrity monitoring.

To obtain the necessary modal parameters (e. g., resonant frequencies, and damping ratios) from the ambient response data, the recently developed Marple algorithm was used with the very powerful Maximum Entropy Method (MEM). Regarding structural integrity monitoring, structural damage was simulated by saw cutting the member(s) under consideration. In the theoretical analyses, this was done by making the member(s) inactive in the analyses.
