5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics {{for many years in}} the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Boat.</b> It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} time and what humanity's place is within time. Life is described metaphorically as travelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> and humanity's fixation on science and future gain keeping the travellers from reaching their destination. Within the poem, Eliot invokes the image of Krishna to emphasise the need to follow the divine will instead of seeking personal gain.|$|E

5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The ground crew also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat,</b> and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E

Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.|$|E

5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen hanging around with his best friend Patrick, who lives on the same street as him. SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that he clearly loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b> He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E

Upon their return home, the child is placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E

5|$|William's feast day {{is celebrated}} on 8 June, {{the day of}} his death, {{although}} his veneration is largely localised to York. Traditional iconography and windows often depict William's crossing of the Tweed; some iconography shows him crossing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b> William's coat of arms traditionally depicts seven mascles or lozenges. St William's College, which was named for him is next to York Minster. It was established between 1465 and 1467 with the permission of King Edward IV as the home for chantry priests of the Cathedral. His remains were rediscovered in the 1960s and are now in the crypt at York Minster.|$|E
5|$|Dismasted, Defence {{was unable}} to hold any of her various opponents to a {{protracted}} duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged Républicain moving from the east. Although Républicain later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet's frigates and was aided by HMS Phaeton under Captain William Bentinck. As Impétueux passed she fired on Phaeton, to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. Invincible, the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding Queen Charlotte. Invincible's guns drove Juste onto the broadside of Queen Charlotte, where {{she was forced to}} surrender to Lieutenant Henry Blackwood <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> from Invincible. Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although HMS Impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant Robert Otway and Midshipman Charles Dashwood.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{then turns}} up mysteriously at a {{hospital}} in a coma. An out of control Mulder demands to know how she got there, and is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one can figure out how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has a living will that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to specific criteria. At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat,</b> attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in her system.|$|E

5|$|Seneb's tomb reliefs and {{the false}} {{door of his}} tomb {{indicate}} his wealth and power. Seneb is described {{as the owner of}} several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name. He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} serving Hammerfest with an airline route was {{launched}} in a government plan from 1933. It proposed that flights in Northern Norway be carried out using seaplanes, and proposed Hammerfest as one of several stops on a route from Trondheim to Vadsø. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) received the concession to operate all routes in Norway from 1935, resulting in the coastal route from Bergen to Tromsø commencing. The following year a connecting route from Tromsø via Hammerfest to Honningsvåg was subcontracted to Widerøe. The water aerodrome in Hammerfest was located at Rypefjord and consisted of a buoy where the aircraft parked; passengers were transported to the aircraft <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b> All flights were terminated in 1939 and remained so {{until the end of}} World War II in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, the {{two characters}} attempt to coordinate an escape with their fellow people. A girl appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> she constructed from wood {{used in the}} sand castle {{from the beginning of}} the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group loads onto it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had been in their own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, the man and woman spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with the man and woman, last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water. The final five frames of the comic, in which the boat is bobbing on the water, are currently rotating in an undetermined pattern for the comic on the xkcd website.|$|E
