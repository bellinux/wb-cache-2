He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
500|$|However, {{many critics}} were displeased with Minogue's lack of {{innovation}} on Aphrodite. Helen Clarke from MusicOMH gave the album an overall positive review and appreciated Minogue for [...] "just what she does, and somehow it works", but did mention that it [...] " [...] fails to quite hit the spot". Jon Parales from The New York Times found the album too {{similar to the}} work of Madonna, especially her studio albums Like a Virgin (1984) and Ray of Light (1998), and commented that [...] "No one's asking for reality in this (Minogue's) pop bubble — <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> innovation". Kitty Empire from The Observer enjoyed the album and complimented Price for [...] "lending a sleek cohesion to the whole (album)", but opined that Aphrodite [...] " [...] lacks the depth and chutzpah of some of her rivals' efforts". Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani noted it to be [...] "more stylistically coherent than the abovementioned albums" [...] and predicted that it would [...] "no doubt please longtime fans", but also criticized Price's shallow [...] "antiseptic" [...] production which he felt was not able to complement Minogue's voice.|$|E

Monica, Rachel and Phoebe each [...] "became style icons for a generation of young women." [...] According to Desiree Tolentino of Verge Campus, [...] "Rachel and Monica were THE fashion icons back in the day", writing, [...] "Monica Geller’s vivacious style and sex appeal inspires every girl to care <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> about what they wear, even if it’s moving boxes from one apartment to the other." [...] Describing Monica's wardrobe as [...] "classic and elegant," [...] Stylist observed that the character's first season bob cut was imitated by several woman, although its popularity paled in comparison to that of Aniston's iconic [...] "Rachel" [...] haircut, the widespread success of which Cox was jealous. However, Cosmopolitan identified Monica's hairstyle as [...] "Iconic in its own right", including in its list of [...] "20 iconic Friends hairstyles". Monica also became well known for accessorizing sweaters using scarves; on Cox's 51 birthday in 2015, Cosmopolitan published an article celebrating her character's best sweaters. BuzzFeed ranked Monica's wedding dress seventh on the website's list of the [...] "28 TV Show Wedding Dresses You’ll Always Envy", while Brides ranked it the ninth greatest wedding dress in television history. Us Weekly included it on their list of [...] "Celebrity Wedding Dresses: TV & Movies". Meanwhile, The Daily Telegraph cited several of Monica's outfits and hairstyles among the newspaper's list of [...] "Friends best fashion moments". According to Patricia Murphy of the Irish Independent, Monica [...] "is most definitely {{one of the most}} famous fictional telly chefs," [...] expounding, [...] "her OCD combined with her continuous strive for perfection making her a thoroughly enjoyable watch." [...] The Guardian ranked Monica fifth on the newspaper's list of [...] "The 10 best fictional chefs", while People ranked the character eighth, with author Grace Gavilanes writing, [...] "She's the best kind of chef – neurotic in the most entertaining/productive way, and always cleans up the mess in her kitchen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Loomis {{commented on}} {{the writing of the}} album: [...] "I think that with the new Nevermore, it still sounds like the band, but I think I'm giving Warrel a little bit more room this time around for more vocals rather than all the notey, kind of complex stuff and all that, so this time around it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> wide open musically for him to really be able to do {{whatever}} he wants vocally this time around.

2500|$|American {{conservative}} commentators such as National Review writers Jonah Goldberg and Mark Steyn {{have argued}} that the website's launch was a disaster that presages larger problems throughout the entire law, with Goldberg asserting that [...] "the Republicans who insisted that this monstrosity had to be delayed are looking <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> reasonable with every passing tick." [...] In a statement, the Republican National Committee (RNC) responded to President Obama's comments that the [...] "tech surge" [...] was code for a [...] "spending surge" [...] and will waste millions of dollars.

2500|$|Tapping {{sat down}} with Robert C. Cooper at the {{beginning}} of Stargate SG-1s season 7 to discuss Carter's struggle with her demons and her life choices in regards to work and family. The events of [...] "Grace" [...] are left open for interpretation, both for the audience and the actors. Grace could be Sam's child within, her hopes and dreams for having a child, the child Sam left behind when she started her career as an astrophysicist, or Carter's potential future with a family. [...] "Chimera" [...] is an offshoot of what happened in [...] "Grace", and the writers were trying to [...] "dispel the black widow curse that Carter has, and also to open her up for more experiences and to flesh her out <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> as a human being". Tapping felt out of her element doing these two episodes, as the flirty side of the character had not really been explored in the show until then. Also, Pete Shanahan does not die, which confuses Carter. According to Tapping, Carter is oblivious what lengths Shanahan is going (stalking, background checks) {{to find out more about}} her classified life, although the character is finally free to talk about her life at the end of episode.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the members}} of the 110th House of Representatives were sworn in en masse, Ellison was the first Representative {{scheduled}} to have his picture taken with the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Though the Library of Congress is directly {{across the street from the}} Capitol, Thomas Jefferson’s Quran took fifteen minutes to arrive as it was brought through [...] "a long, winding underground route via tunnels...to protect the Quran from the elements". Once inside the Capitol the Quran was placed in a rectangular box, and handled with a green felt wrapper then guards ran the book through security x-ray machines. Ellison was impressed by the two-volume set, saying [...] "Look at that. That’s something else. Oh my God. This is great." [...] A few minutes later, Nancy Pelosi arrived and photos of a ceremonial reenactment oath were taken. There were so many of Ellison’s family in attendance that the ceremony was done in two takes. Among his family was his mother Clida Ellison who thought that the controversy had a positive effect, [...] "because many people in America are going to learn what the diversity of America is all about". Clida Ellison noted that she is a practicing Roman Catholic who goes to Mass every day. Ellison expressed his satisfaction that the controversy was behind him, [...] "It was good, we did it, it's over, and now it's time to get down to business...maybe we don't have to talk about it so much anymore.
