He {{argued that the}} episode was [...] "the best season finale cliffhanger the show ever did", and compared it to the second season finale [...] "Anasazi"; he noted that while the latter episode was [...] "pretty amazing", [...] "Requiem" [...] has [...] "a finality" [...] to it and a [...] "sense that nothing will ever be the same" [...] that made its cliffhanger ending work. VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that [...] "the truth is The X-Files has been a show like no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly {{is a place for}} magic and beauty and love on the small screen and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>delighted</b> to have witnessed it for seven seasons now." [...] Kessenich later named the episode one of the [...] "Top 25 Episode of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, ranking it at number 20.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2005, Howarth {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with League One club Bradford City. He was signed to provide competition for Donovan Ricketts, manager Colin Todd saying: [...] "It was a position we needed filling badly. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>delighted</b> to {{have got a}} keeper of Russell's calibre". Despite having the chance to affirm himself in pre-season with Ricketts away on international duty, it was Ricketts who started 2005–06 as first-choice goalkeeper. Howarth made his debut away to Rotherham United on 20 August 2005, coming on as a 27th-minute substitute after Ricketts was injured. The match finished a 1–1 draw. He made his first start in the subsequent 5–0 away victory over League Two club Rochdale in the League Cup first round on 23 August 2005. These were the first two appearances of a 12-match run in the team, before being dropped after nearly two months when Ricketts returned from injury against Port Vale on 15 October 2005. His last two appearances for Bradford that season, which came when Ricketts was suspended, were a 5–3 defeat at home to Barnsley in an FA Cup second-round replay on 13 December 2005 and a 2–1 defeat at home to Rotherham four days later. Howarth finished his first season at Bradford with a career-record 15 appearances.|$|E
500|$|James Stillman owned a {{small farm}} on Pleasantville Road {{since at least}} 1886.

500|$|Stevenage's league {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{a typically}} patchy start; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season. Following a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009, the team went on a 17-game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009, propelling the club into the top two. Unlike in previous seasons, the club were performing strongly away from home, and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town. A 4–1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top-spot {{for the first time in}} the season. However, two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight–point lead going into March 2010. The team responded well, winning eight games on the bounce; including an important 1–0 victory over Oxford United in late March, subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table. Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town, securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal, and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures. Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games, winning the league by 11 points, with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division. The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history, as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career. Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final; this time losing 2–1 after extra-time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium. At the end of the season, Westley signed a new two-year contract; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012. On signing the new deal, Westley said [...] "I am grateful for all the support that we have all been given in the past two years. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>delighted</b> to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League". In his first two seasons back at the club, from May 2008 to May 2010, Westley has been in charge for 114 games, winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61.40%.|$|E

After seeking psychological help, he experienced catharsis when he scored Spain's match-winning goal in the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, which he dedicated to Jarque by revealing the message [...] "Dani Jarque, always with us" [...] written on his undershirt.
