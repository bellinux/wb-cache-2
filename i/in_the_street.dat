5000|$|A {{play that}} has {{influenced}} {{the style of}} scene-to-scene stories of Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> is La Ronde. La Ronde was written by German playwright, Arthur Schnitzler. It is set in 1890's Vienna, and is a dramatically structured play consisting of ten interlocking scenes between pairs of lovers. Each of its ten characters appears in two consecutive scenes, with the Whore appearing twice. Lion <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Streets</b> is similar to this play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way it is set up. From each scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets,</b> one character moves along to he next scene. The difference between La Ronde and Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> is firstly that Lion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Streets</b> isn't strictly about lovers (one people with something in common, i.e. Relationships.), also {{that there is one}} character (Isobel) who is a [...] "Main Character" [...] and follows each consecutive scene.|$|R

5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) and Esther Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a machine minder and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|E
