40|$|We {{consider}} a discrete time system with packets arriving randomly at rate lambda per slot to a fading point-to-point link, {{for which the}} transmitter can control the number of packets served in a slot by varying the transmit power. We provide an asymptotic characterization of the minimum average delay of the packets, when average transmitter power is a small positive quantity V more than the minimum average power required for queue stability. We show that the minimum average delay will grow either as log (1 /V) or 1 /V when V down arrow 0, for certain sets of values of lambda. These sets {{are determined by the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> gain, the maximum number of packets which can be transmitted in a slot, and the assumed transmit power function, {{as a function of the}} fading gain and the number of packets transmitted. We identify a case where the above behaviour of the tradeoff differs from that obtained from a previously considered model, in which the random queue length process is assumed to evolve on the non-negative real line...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} level {{crossing}} rate (LCR) {{and the average}} fade duration of the output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in generalized switched diversity systems. By using a common approach, we study these higher order statistics for two different kinds of configurations: (1) Colocated diversity, i. e. receiver equipped with multiple antennas, and (2) Distributed diversity, i. e. relaying link with multiple single-antenna threshold-based decode-and-forward (DF) relays. In both cases, we consider the switched diversity combining strategies Selection Combining and Switch & Stay Combining (SSC). Whenever using threshold-based techniques such as DF or SSC, the output SNR is a discontinuous random process and hence classic Rice approach to calculate the LCR is not applicable. Thus, we use an alternative formulation {{in terms of the}} one and two-dimensional cumulative distribution functions of the output SNR. Our results are general, and hold for any arbitrary <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> at the different diversity branches. Moreover, we develop a general asymptotic framework to calculate these higher order statistics in high mean SNR environments which only needs of the univariate probability density function...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a fading point-to-point link with packets arriving randomly at rate λ per slot to the transmitter queue. We {{assume that the}} transmitter can control the number of packets served in a slot by varying the transmit power for the slot. We restrict to transmitter scheduling policies that are monotone and stationary, i. e., the number of packets served is a non-decreasing function of the queue length {{at the beginning of}} the slot for every slot fade state. For such policies, we obtain asymptotic lower bounds for the minimum average delay of the packets, when average transmitter power is a small positive quantity V more than the minimum average power required for transmitter queue stability. We show that the minimum average delay grows either to a finite value or as Ω(1 /V) or Ω 1 /V when V ↓ 0, for certain sets of values of λ. These sets are determined by the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> gain, the maximum number of packets which can be transmitted in a slot, and the transmit power function of the fading gain and the number of packets transmitted that is assumed. We identify a case where the above behaviour of the tradeoff differs from that obtained from a previously considered approximate model, in which the random queue length process is assumed to evolve on the non-negative real line, and the transmit power function is strictly convex. We also {{consider a}} fading point-to-point link, where the transmitter, in addition to controlling the number of packets served, can also control the number of packets admitted in every slot. Our approach, which uses bounds on the stationary probability distribution of the queue length, also leads to an intuitive explanation of the asymptotic behaviour of average delay in the regime where V ↓ 0...|$|E

It is observed that both CP and XP channels exhibit distributed lognormal shadowing and Nakagami multipath fading.

Then we have compared the experimental distributions to those predicted by the Synthetic Storm Technique with strictly concurrent measurements of rain rate time series.

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{models for}} tropospheric scintillation on earth-satellite paths from Karasawa, Yamada, and Allnutt and ITU-R are compared with measurement results from satellite links in Europe, the United States, and Japan at frequencies from 7 to 30 GHz and elevation angles of 3 to 33 °. The existing prediction models relate the long-term average scintillation intensity to the wet term of refractivity at ground level. The comparison {{shows that the}} seasonal variation of scintillation intensity is well predicted by this relation, but for the annual average some additional meteorological information is needed. A much better agreement with measurement results is found when a parameter representing the average water content of heavy clouds is incorporated. This confirms the assumption that scintillation is, at least partly, associated with turbulence inside clouds. The asymmetry between the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>fade</b> and enhancement can also be explained by turbulence inside clouds. The asymmetry depends on {{the intensity of the}} scintillation, which is consistent with the theory assuming a thin layer of cloudy turbulence. A new model based on this theory predicts the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>fade</b> and enhancement significantly better. © 1999 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the major {{characteristics of a}} simulation package capable of performing a complete narrow and wideband analysis of the mobile satellite communication channel in urban environments for any given orbital configuration. The wavelength-to-average urban geometrical dimension ratio has required {{the use of the}} Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD). For the RF frequency range, the model has been designed to be (1 up to 60 GHz) extended to include effects of non-perfect conductivity and surface roughness. Taking advantage of the inherent capabilities of such a high frequency method, we are able to provide a complete description of the electromagnetic field at the mobile terminal.

40|$|Recently, {{wireless}} caching {{techniques have}} been studied to satisfy lower delay requirements and offload traffic from peak periods. By storing parts of the popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested files in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case, when a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device (D 2 D) communication is enabled. D 2 D communication underlaid with cellular networks is also a new paradigm for the upcoming 5 G wireless systems. By allowing a pair of adjacent D 2 D users to communicate directly, D 2 D communication can achieve higher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay. In this work, we propose a very efficient caching algorithm for D 2 D-enabled cellular networks to minimize the average transmission delay. Instead of searching over all possible solutions, our algorithm finds out the best pairs, which provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy with very low transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also extended to address a more general scenario, in which the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over time.
