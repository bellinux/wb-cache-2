5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken place. One of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. The deceased had several items of shell jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September 1940, No. 605 {{moved on}} {{rotation}} to Croydon Aerodrome {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Walter Churchill. McKellar scored a further four victories in a single mission on 9 September. McKellar attacked with the sun at <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his Squadron, save for one Section which was left to provide top cover against Bf 109s. The attack was made head-on to break up the German bomber formation which consisted of a large mass of He 111s. He destroyed three He 111s with a single, 12–second burst. The first He 111 exploded. It damaged a second which rolled over and dived down into the ground. McKellar then moved his fire to a third. Its port wing snapped off. He then destroyed a Bf 109 in the afternoon giving him a fourth success.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of the Black Gate {{was filmed}} in April at the Rangipo Desert, a former minefield. New Zealand {{soldiers}} were hired as extras while guides {{were on the}} lookout for unexploded mines. Also a cause for concern were Monaghan and Boyd's scale doubles during a charge sequence. In the meantime, Wood, Astin and Serkis filmed at Mount Ruapehu for the Mount Doom exteriors. In particular, they spent two hours shooting Sam lifting Frodo on to <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> cross-camera coverage.|$|E
25|$|Görgei, who {{before the}} battle taught that his army will face only the besieging army corps led by Simunich, after {{the arrival of}} Schlik's III. corps, taught that the whole {{imperial}} main army will attack. So this is why he decided to face the enemy behind the siege trenches, in <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the fortress, the latter still having enough ammunition (while as mentioned before, the ammunition of his field army fighting in the battlefield, and the captured siege artillery {{had run out of}} it before), with which he hoped to resist to such a powerful attack. He did not knew that Welden sent the corps led by Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelačić to Southern Hungary to help the Serbian insurgents, allied with the Austrians who were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem, and the II. corps to Sopron through Veszprém and Pápa.|$|E

25|$|On 10 December 1941, Richter was hanged at Wandsworth Prison. A {{procedure}} that normally took around 15 seconds, took over 17 minutes. When Albert Pierrepoint, the executioner, entered Richter's cell to bind his wrists, Richter charged at the cell wall headfirst. After a struggle, Pierrepoint succeeded in binding Richter's wrists behind <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a leather strap, but Richter's ferocious strength {{was so great}} that he split the leather strap and was free again. Four warders eventually subdued Richter and bundled him into the gallows chamber where a strap was fastened around his ankles, a hood placed over his head and the noose placed around his neck. Richter continued to fight and just as Pierrepoint pulled the lever that would open the trapdoors beneath Richter's feet, the condemned man jumped in the air. The noose slipped and almost came off Richter's head but caught under his nose. Richter had died instantly but not without a struggle.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed {{to enter into the}} Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|Burial 5 was {{an elite}} burial interred in a stucco-coated chamber under the rear {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). The tomb had already been looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, with a looters trench cutting through the bench and floor of the shrine chamber above. The burial chamber measured [...] (NS by EW) and was [...] high. The chamber contained the bones of an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old. Although the bones had been disturbed by the looters, {{it is likely that}} he had been laid out on <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a north-south orientation. A few broken ceramic remains among the looters' debris dated the tomb to the late 8th century AD.|$|E

500|$|The band rescheduled European tour {{dates in}} the {{aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks. [...] "After the attacks the world kind of went into freeze mode and we didn't know whether to carry on with things or not... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," [...] said Hoppus shortly thereafter. The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> <b>With</b> time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was", and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed. The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.|$|E

500|$|Wisden {{said that}} as a bowler, Peel had a [...] "fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin", which meant that he [...] "was often a match-winner". Peel {{consistently}} bowled a good length and varied the flight of the ball to deceive batsmen. He also bowled a quicker ball which, in contrast to his usual delivery, travelled {{in a straight line}} instead of turning. On a pitch affected by rain, batsmen found him very difficult to face, and he was very successful in these conditions. When bowling on pitches where the ball came more slowly off the surface, Peel often bowled faster; this pace made it difficult for batsmen to score runs against him even when conditions were in their favour. After he delivered the ball, the spin he imparted often made it curve in the air before it reached the batsman. According to Woodhouse, when bowling, [...] "Peel brought his arm behind <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a peculiar flourish-like action and then 'whipped the ball down. He generally opened the bowling, including when he played for England. At the time, it was general practice to open the bowling with a fast bowler and a left-arm spinner.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. [...] "They are going to get me this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN.
