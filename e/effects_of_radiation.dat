5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than {{human beings can}} be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and {{returned}} to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic physics led to {{an interest in the}} health <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in health physics. At the Health Physics Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which was only five years old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in health physics, teaching and advising graduate fellows in health physics from 1949.|$|E
50|$|Integral {{quantities}} (like radiant flux) {{describe the}} total <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>of</b> all wavelengths or frequencies, while spectral quantities (like spectral power) describe the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>of</b> a single wavelength λ or frequency ν. To each integral quantity there are corresponding spectral quantities, {{for example the}} radiant flux Φe corresponds to the spectral power Φe,λ and Φe,ν.|$|R

40|$|Hoyle-Lyttleton type {{accretion}} is investigated, {{by taking}} account {{of not only}} the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> pressure but the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> drag. We calculate the trajectories of particles for three cases: only the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> gravity is considered (case A); the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> pressure is taken into account (case B); the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> drag as well as radiation pressure is taken into account (case C). The accretion radii for former two cases are 2 GM/v 2 ∞ for case A and 2 GM(1 − Γ) /v 2 ∞ for case B, where M is {{the mass of the}} accreted object, v ∞ the relative velocity, and Γ the normalized luminosity of the accreted object. We found that the accretion radius for case C is in between those of cases A and B under the present approximation; i. e., the accretion radius decreases due to radiation pressure while it increases due to radiation drag. In addition, the accretion radius for case C becomes larger as the incident velocity becomes fast. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> drag becomes more and more important when the velocity of the incident particle is comparable to the light speed.

5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> sickness.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{facilities}} for medical research were limited, but some {{research was conducted}} into the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation,</b> and the absorption and toxic effects of metals, particularly plutonium and beryllium, mainly {{as a result of}} accidents. The Health Group began conducting urine tests of laboratory workers in early 1945, and many of these revealed dangerous levels of plutonium. Work on the Water Boiler also occasionally exposed workers to dangerous fission products. There were 24 fatal accidents at Los Alamos between its opening in 1943 and September 1946. Most involved construction workers. Four scientists died, including Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin in criticality accidents involving the demon core.|$|E

5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known {{due to the}} experience of the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project {{into the}} Manhattan Project, and {{established}} the Combined Policy Committee {{to control the}} Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the Americans would assist {{with the construction of}} a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it out for themselves. A sticking point was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not work well with the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|She {{entered the}} Neutrality Patrol at the {{beginning}} of World War II, and served as a convoy escort for ships to Iceland and Great Britain in the early phase of the war. She saw her first combat against coastal artillery during Operation Torch around Casablanca in North Africa, and later became a training ship. Late in the war, she moved to the Pacific, and provided naval gunfire support for the invasion of Iwo Jima and later the invasion of Okinawa. Returning to Pearl Harbor for repairs {{until the end of the}} war, she was classified obsolete and was chosen to take part in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. She survived both explosions and the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> on the ship were studied for several years. She was eventually sunk as a target in 1948. She received three battle stars for her service.|$|E

5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E
5|$|While {{some aspects}} of {{cooperation}} resumed quickly, it took longer to finalize the details {{with respect to the}} Montreal Laboratory. Brigadier General Leslie Groves (the director of the Manhattan Project), Chadwick (now the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project), and Mackenzie negotiated recommendations, which were approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 13 April 1944. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May. Under it, the Americans would assist with the construction of a heavy water reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium or plutonium chemistry, although irradiated uranium slugs would be made available for the British to work it out for themselves. The Americans had already built their own heavy water reactor, Chicago Pile-3, which went critical in May 1944. The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the impact <b>of</b> photoionization and <b>radiation</b> pressure on a dusty starforming cloud using one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, which include absorption and re-emission of photons by dust.

The importance <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> pressure increases with increasing star formation efficiency or an increasing dust-to-gas mass ratio. The net <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> feedback, however, becomes smaller with the increasing dust-to-gas mass ratio, since the absorption of ultraviolet photons by dust grains suppresses photoionization and hence photoheating...|$|R

40|$|We {{described}} previously {{a screening}} protocol in Drosophila melanogaster {{that allows us}} to identify small molecules that increase the killing <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> in vivo in a multicellular context. The ability of this screen to identify agents that enhance the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> in human cancer models has been validated in published proof-of-concept studies. Here we describe an agent, identified by screening through two National Cancer Institute (NCI) small molecule libraries in Drosophila, that increases the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> This agent, Bouvardin (NSC 259968), inhibits the elongation step of protein synthesis. We find that Bouvardin enhances the killing <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> X-rays in both Drosophila larvae and in human cancer cells. More detailed analysis showed that Bouvardin also increases the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> in clonogenic assays and in human cancer xenografts in mice. Finally, we present data that Bouvardin can also increase the efficacy of taxol. Regulation of translation is important to cancer biology. Current therapies target every aspect of cancer cell proliferation from growth factor signaling to cell division, with the exception of translation elongation. Our identification of Bouvardin as an enhancer of radio- and chemo-therapeutic agents suggests that targeting this niche has the potential to improve existing cancer therapies...|$|R
25|$|Radiation {{chemistry}} is a subdivision of nuclear chemistry {{which is the}} study of the chemical <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> on matter; this is very different from radiochemistry as no radioactivity needs to be present in the material which is being chemically changed by the radiation.
