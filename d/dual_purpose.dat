40|$|Abstract:-This paper {{describes}} {{a new type}} of bituminous concrete with frame–separation in steel-structure bridge deck pavement, the lower layer of which is designed to have a frame-separation structure with bituminous concrete units dependent from each other, while the upper layer is paved with fiber bituminous concrete. Pavement with this new structure has been successfully applied to a bridge with double decks for <b>dual</b> <b>purposes</b> of highway and railway use, which is able to restrain the pavement deformation caused by vibration within an acceptable limit and therefore can settle the maintenance and repair problem of the deck pavement of the bridge for <b>dual</b> <b>purposes</b> of highway and railway use...|$|R

5|$|Key figures {{mentioned}} in inscriptions {{from rural areas}} were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas. The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas). They served the <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> of representing the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are {{mentioned in}} inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties.|$|E
5|$|The {{table of}} {{characteristics}} provided by Lt. Jurrien S. Noot for the 19 April 1940 design {{does not give}} any armament specifics, as these likely remained unaltered from the earlier 16 February 1940 drawing. This drawing provided the following: a main armament of nine 283mm guns, a secondary armament of twelve 120mm <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> guns, and an anti-aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40mmguns and eight Oerlikon 20mmcannons.|$|E
5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, {{is one of the}} very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this <b>dual</b> <b>purpose.</b> It has been substantially altered since it was built.

5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a <b>dual</b> <b>purpose.</b> They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is in the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese erroneously {{announced}} that Maryland had been sunk, but on 30 December, the damaged ship entered Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs just behind Tennessee. Two {{of the original}} twelve 5 in/51 cal guns were removed and the 5in/25 cal guns were replaced by {{an equal number of}} 5 in/38 cal <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> guns. Over {{the course of the next}} two months, she was repaired and overhauled, receiving new fighting equipment. Repairs were complete on 26 February 1942. She then underwent a series of shakedown cruises to West Coast ports and the Christmas Islands.

5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this <b>dual</b> <b>purpose.</b> It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM {{had been}} {{designed}} by the team of Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. To develop the Mark 1 {{they were joined by}} two research students, D.B.G.Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1– known as the Intermediary Version– was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store, which had to be done by halting the machine and manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by GEC were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the SSEM.|$|E

5|$|The guns {{proved to}} be too {{powerful}} for Furious light hull, and they became available for other uses during 1917, after trials showed the ship could not handle the stress of firing. Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol, conceived a plan to mount two guns inside the shell of the Palace Hotel in Westende from where they could bombard the naval facilities at Zeebrugge and Bruges, provided that the hotel was captured during the upcoming Battle of Passchendaele. He planned to transport the guns across the English Channel lashed to the torpedo bulges of monitors. He also thought {{that they could be}} used on the decks of monitors and as such a <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> carriage was designed for the guns, which could be used both afloat and ashore. Only a limited amount of traverse was required for either role, but elevation had to be increased to 45° to maximize range. The concept was approved 23 September 1917, and Elswick was ordered to design the new 'B CD' mounts for delivery in five months.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August, the {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious sailed from Singapore with her two escorting destroyers, HMS Caesar and HMS Cavendish, bound for Fremantle in Western Australia. The genuine purpose of the voyage is still disputed, but {{it is probable that}} the carrier group was passing through as a show of strength to Indonesia {{in the wake of the}} Pontian landings as well as the routine 'goodwill visit' that the vessel was purportedly making to Britain's ally. The task force was surprisingly met by very little Indonesian response as it passed through their territorial waters, the carrier reporting only a single Tupolev Tu-16 aircraft making a flyover as the warships passed through the Sunda Strait the following day. The ownership of the Strait itself was complex, as Indonesia claimed it despite British assertions that it was an international waterway that her warships could pass through at any time. Following standard British procedure in such a situation, the British Military Attache in Jakarta had telephoned ahead to the Indonesian Director of Naval Intelligence that the squadron would be passing through Indonesian territory without seeking their clearance, a precedent set the last time Britain had used the Straits in October 1963. This policy, engineered by the Foreign Office, had the <b>dual</b> <b>purpose</b> of notifying the Indonesians of a possibly provocative action without recognizing what they thought to be exaggerated claims on international waters. The return date to Singapore was not set exactly at the time of sailing but was to be sometime in mid-September.|$|E
