25|$|Glycophorin C (GPC) is {{a single}} {{polypeptide}} chain of 128 amino acids and is encoded by a gene on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q14-q21). The gene was first cloned in 1989 by High et al. The GPC gene is organized in four exons distributed over 13.5 <b>kilobase</b> <b>pairs</b> of DNA. Exon 1 encodes residues 1-16, exon 2 residues 17-35, exon 3 residues 36-63 and exon 4 residues 64-128. Exons 2 and 3 are highly homologous, with less than 5% nucleotide divergence. These exons also differ by a 9 amino acid insert at the 3' end of exon 3. The direct repeated segments containing these exons is 3.4 <b>kilobase</b> <b>pairs</b> long and may be derived from a recent duplication of a single ancestral domain. Exons 1, 2 and most of exon 3 encode the N-terminal extracellular domain while the remainder of exon 3 and exon 4 encode transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.|$|E

25|$|Glycophorin C and D encode the Gerbich (Ge) antigens. There {{are four}} alleles, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3 (Leach phenotype), Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. A 3.4 <b>kilobase</b> <b>pair</b> {{deletion}} within the gene, which probably arose because of {{unequal crossing over}} between the two repeated domains, {{is responsible for the}} formation of the Ge-2,-3 genotype. The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deletion of exon 3. This mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger RNA with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on Ge-2,-3 red cells. A second 3.4 <b>kilobase</b> <b>pair</b> deletion within the glycophorin C gene eliminates only exon 2 by a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on Ge-2,+3 erythrocytes.|$|R

30|$|In 2004, 37 recombinants {{between two}} DNA markers, 93 * 14.1 and S 13714, were {{selected}} from 2, 100 F 2 plants from the same cross combination. Among them, 33 recombinants were crossed to Jamaica to determine each genotype for the HWC 2 locus. This means {{that the number of}} F 2 plants in 2004 was equivalent to 1, 873 (= 2, 100 [*]×[*] 33 / 37). Nine recombinants were found in the three-way cross population consisting of 890 plants. Consequently, the HWC 2 locus was located between dG 264 H and RM 5473; the target region was narrowed down to 150  kb. As for the HWC 1 locus, the area of interest was narrowed to 60  kb using 883 F 2 plants (Ichitani et al. 2007). Therefore, we inferred that crossover events were suppressed around the HWC 2 locus in this cross combination. In Fig.  1 b, recombination events per <b>kilobase</b> <b>pair</b> of 50 recombinants between 93 * 14.1 and S 13714 were calculated for each pair of neighboring DNA markers. We observed the tendency that recombination events per <b>kilobase</b> <b>pair</b> were smaller for the DNA marker pairs that were closer to the HWC 2 locus, supporting the inference presented above.|$|R
