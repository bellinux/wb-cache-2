5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite <b>electric</b> <b>furnaces</b> to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
25|$|The {{illustration}} is {{the interior}} of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, <b>electric</b> <b>furnaces,</b> electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some <b>electric</b> <b>furnaces)</b> or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.|$|E

25|$|Some {{programmable}} thermostats {{are available}} to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control {{rather than relying on}} the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (<b>electric</b> <b>furnaces,</b> wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.|$|E
25|$|As {{an ongoing}} tradition, royal {{funerals}} have undergone changes and adaptations throughout the years. As mentioned above, {{much of the}} ceremony has been simplified since the funeral of King Chulalongkorn, {{and the development of}} embalming has changed the body-handling process. Recent developments introduced {{in the late twentieth century}} include live television broadcasts of the ceremony, as well as increased public participation. The public was first allowed to symbolically participate in the royal bathing ceremony in front of royal portraits during the funeral of Princess Mother Srinagarindra, and was allowed to co-host the funeral rites in the funeral of Princess Galyani Vadhana in 2008. The phra kot chan of recent cremations (since the Princess Mother's) have also been preserved, instead of being burnt in the pyre. <b>Electric</b> <b>furnaces</b> were introduced in the cremation ceremony of Princess Galyani Vadhana.|$|E
