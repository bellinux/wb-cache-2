5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E
5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was one {{means by which the}} government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by the owner of a New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, <b>fifty</b> <b>cents,</b> twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E
50|$|On March 10, 2012, {{en route}} in the Pacific off South America, three {{passengers}} from Star Princess spotted {{a small boat}} drifting with waving seamen, apparently in distress. They notified the crew. Star Princess, however, did not change course to investigate.On March 19, the Ecuadorean coast guard rescued the Panamanian fishing boat <b>Fifty</b> <b>Cent</b> with one survivor on board. Subsequent communication between the survivor, a reporter, and the Star Princess passengers led to allegations that the small boat sighted nine days prior {{was in fact the}} <b>Fifty</b> <b>Cent,</b> and that Star Princess had failed to stop and render aid.|$|R

The union felt justified, for <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> a day had been cut from the miners' wages during the depression of 1893. Negotiations broke down and 968 miners walked out. Mine owners, who had formed a Mine Owners' Association with a secret anti-union agreement, locked out another 1,332 mine workers.|$|E

After 30 months of construction, the Narrows was bridged again.|$|E
25|$|Eight private boxes, four on {{each side}} of the stage and each {{accommodating}} six people, rounded out the seating, the box seats furnishing the most elegant and expensive accommodations in the house.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the ships anchored at Hampton Roads, the exposition provided a campground sufficient to house five thousand troops. Military and “semi-military” men in uniform were admitted {{for the price of}} a single day’s admission, <b>fifty</b> <b>cents,</b> and were permitted to come and go after that, as long as they were encamped at the exposition grounds and drilled regularly on the parade ground. This accounts for many of the 43% of people tallied entering the fair daily who did not pay admission. The organizers felt the troops provided informal entertainment and were an attraction to the exposition.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{description}} of sex between women in the first poem, the book was never legally challenged; the passage seems explicit now, but {{at a time when}} lesbianism was virtually invisible in American culture, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice may not have understood its imagery. Others were not as naïve, and Bruno was able {{to cash in on the}} book's reputation by raising the price from fifteen to <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> and pocketing the difference. Twenty years later she used him as one of the models for Felix Volkbein in Nightwood, caricaturing his pretensions to nobility and his habit of bowing down before anyone titled or important.|$|E
25|$|In the post-Reconstruction era South, lynching {{photographs}} were printed for various purposes, including postcards, newspapers and event mementos. Typically these images depicted an African-American lynching victim and {{all or part}} of the crowd in attendance. Spectators often included women and children. The perpetrators of lynchings were not identified. At one particular lynching, it is said that nearly 15,000 people were in attendance. Often lynchings were advertised in newspapers prior to the event in order to give photographers time to arrive early and prepare their camera equipment. After the lynching, photographers would sell their pictures as-is or as postcards, sometimes costing as much as <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> a piece, or $, as of 2016.|$|E
50|$|The Immigration Act of 1882 found {{immigrants}} who {{were unable to}} take care of themselves without becoming a public charge unsuitable for American citizenship and therefore denied their entry.

50|$|Starting in {{the autumn}} of 2008, the Royal Canadian Mint created six <b>fifty</b> <b>cent</b> coins {{embedded}} in a plastic sports card.

All coins had a retail price of $9.95 each.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Business Before Honesty was subject to {{restrictions}} and cuts by city and state film censorship boards.

25|$|The 1900 Carnival {{would see}} the debut of the Rossland Ladies Hockey Team (women could join the team for <b>fifty</b> <b>cents,</b> while men would be given an honorary {{membership}} for the same fee). Rossland played a ladies team from Nelson and won the game by a score of 4–0. One of Rossland's most notable players was Eva Blackman. She would play numerous positions over the year including goaltender. At the 1905 Carnival, no one would challenge Rossland, so the team split into two teams and played each other. The teams were known as the Reds and the Blues. Rossland's biggest upset came in 1917 when the club were defeated a ladies team from Grand Forks for the West Kootenay Championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in production costs between the Philippines and other manufacturing {{countries such as}} China are a huge factor in {{the decline of the}} textile industry in the Philippines. A Manila based company selling materials and clothing to the Gap brand costs up to <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> more in production costs compared to if the garment was manufactured in China. Many of the former Filipino workers in the textile industry left to work in other manufacturing or service industries. Some workers decided to focus on making clothes, garments, and textiles for domestic markets, although the instability of these markets has weakened their potential income. As for supervisors and factory managers, some have found employment in other countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka where {{there is a need for}} supervisors and factory managers. Government initiatives such as the Save Our Industries Act offer potential solutions to the failing industry, such as sending American textiles to the Philippines and repurposing them as garments made from the Philippines, but also has many uncertainties as the bill lacks bipartisan support within the U.S. Congress.|$|E
500|$|The couple put {{together}} an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. [...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only <b>fifty</b> <b>cents.</b> [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked. [...] He then spent their <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. [...] By selling their products for <b>fifty</b> <b>cents</b> each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.|$|E
50|$|The Newfoundland <b>fifty</b> <b>cent</b> {{piece was}} the last {{denomination}} {{to be added to}} the Victorian coinage. Its first year of issue was 1870. The laureate portrait is stylistically unlike anything used for the rest of British North America. The denomination became very popular and assumed importance after the failure of the Commercial and Union Banks of Newfoundland during the financial crisis of 1894.|$|R
50|$|The round <b>fifty</b> <b>cent</b> coin was the highest-denomination {{and largest}} {{diameter}} coin of the Australian dollar's decimal coins, introduced in 1966. Due to large amounts made in 1966 {{and the rising}} cost of silver, it was not made in any other year. It was replaced by a dodecagonal 50 cent coin in 1969, which retained its reverse of the Australian Coat of Arms.|$|R

As supporting evidence, the cruise line made public the results of a drift analysis and a photographic investigation they had commissioned.|$|R
