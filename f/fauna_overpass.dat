50|$|Karawatha Forest is {{the reserve}} {{with the highest}} number of species and has five {{different}} species of glider possums. It also has a <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass</b> constructed over the four lane road, along with underpasses, rope ladders and exclusion funnelling fencing. The project was undertaken by The Griffith University Fauna Unit and Dr Darryl Jones.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the south}} of the reserve {{wildlife}} movement infrastructure consisting of a land-bridge over Compton Road has been a success. The Compton Road <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass</b> is the most intensively studied in the country. [...] It links the forest to the northern Kuraby bushland. The corridor also included two fauna underpasses, three rope ladders and a line of glider poles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{ecological}} impact of roads and traffic is now widely acknowledged, {{with a variety}} of mitigation strategies such as purpose designed fauna underpasses and overpasses commonly installed to facilitate animal movement. Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass</b> which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass</b> by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass</b> at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road...|$|E

Although vegetated fauna overpasses have not traditionally been considered as beneficial for microbats, these structures {{have recently been}} identified as a potential solution for assisting microbat communities. In Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the Compton Road <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass</b> traverses a fourâ€“lane road, facilitating connectivity for mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians between two forest reserves. This study examined patterns of activity and species richness of microbat assemblages in relation to the Compton Road <b>fauna</b> <b>overpass.</b> Call recordings made over 7 months identified nine species and two species groups (groups of species unable to be differentiated), all of which were recorded using the overpass. Bat activity on the overpass was higher than in the adjoining forest, with higher detectability. Species richness and activity at the roadside where the overpass was present was also higher than the unvegetated roadside. Activity patterns based on feeding behaviors suggest that forest species such as Nyctophilus and Myotis spp. were using the overpass, alongside more generalist species. The vegetation on the overpass {{is likely to be the}} key factor encouraging microbat activity. The Compton Road overpass appears to lessen the impact of road presence and may facilitate permeability of a major road, suggesting potential for enhancing habitat connectivity and facilitating crossings. This study is the first indication that vegetated fauna overpasses can facilitate activity and provide natural habitat continuity for diverse Australian microbat communities...|$|E
