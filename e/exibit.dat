The erudite lapidary, Jayme Ferrer, in the letter written to Columbus in 1495, at the command of the sovereigns, observes: [...] "I see in this a great mystery: the divine and infallible Providence sent the great St. Thomas from the west into the east, to manifest in India our holy and Catholic faith; and you, Señor, he sent in an opposite direction, from the east into the west, until you have arrived in the Orient, into the extreme part of Upper India, that the people may hear that which their ancestors neglected of the preaching of St. Thomas. Thus shall be accomplished what was written, in omnem terram <b>exibit</b> sonus eorum." ... And again, [...] "The office which you hold, Señor, places you {{in the light of}} an apostle and ambassador of God, sent by his divine judgment, to make known his holy name in unknown lands."--Letra de Mossen, Jayme Ferrer, Navarrete, Coleccion, tom. ii. decad. 68.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the behaviour of variety of pretreated/activated anodes, viz, Ti, expanded Ti, Ti/RuO 2 -TiO 2, Ti/MnO 2 during deposition of EMD from sulphate and chloride electrolyte and compared with that of conventional ones, ie, graphite, bare Ti and platinum with special refernce to energy consumption and cell voltage. It is found that cell voltage increases with increase in sulphuric acid concentration in the bath, indicating the passivation of substrate. Ti/RuO 2 -TiO 2 anode <b>exibits</b> a lower voltage than bare Ti or Ti/MnO 2 due to lower contact drop between the deposit and the substrate. The employment of expanded Ti/MnO 2 <b>exibits</b> a cell voltage comparable to that of Ti/RuO 2 -TiO 2. In chloride electrolytes, in general Ti/RuO 2 -TiO 2 behaves similar to Ti/MnO 2 except that it <b>exibits</b> a lower cell voltage by about 400 - 500 mV. Smooth platinum performs poorly due to lower overpotential for chlorine evolution.
