5|$|Born in Croydon, Victoria, Stanley James Goble {{was one of}} {{four sons}} to an Australian father, George, and an English mother, Ann. He {{apparently}} received little schooling, and began his working life as a clerk with the Victorian Railways at the age of sixteen. By twenty-three <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> his father, a stationmaster.|$|E
5|$|He {{was given}} to {{sketching}} and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, when he turned sixteen and {{wanted to go to}} Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, {{he was one of the}} 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he was too young to be accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a needlewoman Who deftly on a sable hem Stitches in gleaming jewels; Or, haply, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a hero, Whose bright deeds on {{the long}} journey Are beacons on our way.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{service to}} him, too! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> his sister. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> very <b>like</b> his sister. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> devilish <b>like</b> his sister," [...] says Mr. George, laying {{a great and}} not {{altogether}} complimentary stress on his last adjective.|$|R

5|$|The fourth Playford, {{father of}} Sir Thomas, {{was born in}} 1861. Unlike his own father and grandfather, who had led lives as soldiers, churchmen and politicians, he became a simple farmer at the Norton Summit {{property}} and was dominated by his wife, Elizabeth. <b>He</b> <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> his forebears, a regular churchgoer, and only once was involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council. In comparison, Elizabeth was the local correspondent of The Advertiser, treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church, and a teacher. Four children were born to the couple; three daughters and one son, Sir Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced that he understood the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, bottom-up approach. For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had little to say about the emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning only that the emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E

25|$|In the 2003 movie American Splendor, Crumb {{was portrayed}} by James Urbaniak. Crumb's wife Aline {{was quoted as}} saying she hated the {{interpretation}} and never would have married Robert if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> that.|$|E
25|$|Frey {{took the}} kingdom after Njord, and was called drot by the Swedes, and they paid taxes to him. <b>He</b> <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> his father, {{fortunate}} in friends {{and in good}} seasons. Frey built a great temple at Uppsala, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods. Then began the Upsal domains, which have remained ever since.|$|E
25|$|I made {{a mistake}} going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|E

25|$|Kiss {{started the}} European {{leg of the}} Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour in May 2010. Tragedy struck Kiss {{for a third time}} when former manager Aucoin died of cancer on June 28, 2010, at the age of 66. Stanley and Simmons said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the fifth member of Kiss. The tour {{included}} their first UK arena shows in 11 years and their first visit to Slovakia. Kiss later played at two dates in US cities Cheyenne, Wyoming and the North Dakota State Fair in Minot, North Dakota in July 2010. They also played at the Indiana State Fair in August and the Minnesota State Fair in September. They also made a brief appearance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga, New York on August 17, 2010. On July 23, Kiss started The Hottest Show on Earth Tour in the United States. The tour saw the band play numerous shows throughout the US, Canada and Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Superman of pre-Crisis Earth-17 was the {{original}} Overman, created by the government as were the other heroes of this Earth. Likewise, all other heroes that were created were modified clones of Overman's cell scrapings, such as versions of Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern. Some time later, Overman went on a homicidal rampage (due to an STD which had affected his mind) and murdered everyone on the planet before he decided to commit suicide and destroy the planet {{at the same time}} with a doomsday bomb. This world was destroyed, and Overman was wiped out by the Crisis, until the Psycho-Pirate began bringing back characters which the Crisis had killed in Animal Man #23, Overman and bomb included, despite trying not to remember him. Overman fought against Ultraman and Animal Man, before Overman was dragged out of the comic book panels and wiped out by a closing panel, ranting that it wasn't his fault <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> that before Animal Man disarmed the bomb. In The New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-17 is the world of the Atomic Knights and lacks a known Superman analogue.|$|E

I was like listen, {{there is no}} way this [...] be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'Really, you think so?' I was like c'mon man we got to stop {{treating}} rap like oh it came out it's dead. When it's good, we have to make people love it and digest it. We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] was {{originally}} written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008. The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained [...] "My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, ‘Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?’ And I was like, ‘Nope!’ Basically <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> ‘Why don’t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R voice.’ <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> ‘Let’s {{get together and}} see what we can develop." [...] Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, [...] "It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind of what we were going for with her sound." [...] Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it [...] "just kind of fell by the wayside". Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.|$|E

500|$|... 'Don't Forget About Us' was a {{song that}} Jermaine [...] and I started writing and didn't finish, and L.A. Reid heard it.
