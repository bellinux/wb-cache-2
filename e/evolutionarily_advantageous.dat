25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for conversion disorder {{is that the}} symptoms may have been <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> during warfare. A non-combatant with these symptoms signals non-verbally, possibly to someone speaking a different language, that she or he is not dangerous as a combatant and also may be carrying some form of dangerous infectious disease. This can explain that conversion disorder may develop following a threatening situation, {{that there may be}} a group effect with many people simultaneously developing similar symptoms (as in mass psychogenic illness), and the gender difference in prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Social animals need {{an alarm}} system to alert others {{to defend against}} {{potential}} threats or to recruit others to attack prey. In Eciton burchellii, along with other large-colony ant species, the alarm pheromone is produced in mandible glands. This is <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> because the mandible has a large surface area for pheromone's evaporation, the pheromone is released whenever the mandible is opened for biting, and the pheromone is rapidly released when the ant's head is crushed. The specific pheromone used by the Eciton burchellii species is 4-methyl-3-heptanone, which produces an intense, but short-lived, behavioral response by others in the colony.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} questions in evolution is how organisms exhibit suitable phenotypic variation to rapidly adapt in novel selective environments which is crucial for evolvability. Recent work showed that when selective environments vary in a systematic manner, it is possible that development can constrain the phenotypic space in regions that are <b>evolutionarily</b> more <b>advantageous.</b> Yet, the underlying mechanism that enables the spontaneous emergence of such adaptive developmental constraints is poorly understood. How can natural selection, given its myopic and conservative nature, favour developmental organisations that facilitate adaptive evolution in future previously unseen environments? Such capacity suggests a form of foresight facilitated by the ability of evolution to accumulate and exploit information not only about the particular phenotypes selected in the past, but regularities in the environment that are also relevant to future environments. Here we argue that the ability of evolution to discover such regularities is analogous to the ability of learning systems to generalise from past experience. Conversely, the canalisation of evolved developmental processes to past selective environments and failure of natural selection to enhance evolvability in future selective environments is directly analogous to the problem of over-fitting and failure to generalise in machine learning. We show that this analogy arises from an underlying mechanistic equivalence by showing that conditions corresponding to those that alleviate over-fitting in machine learning enhance the evolution of generalised developmental organisations under natural selection. This equivalence provides access to a well-developed theoretical framework that enables us to characterise the conditions where natural selection will find general rather than particular solutions to environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) has {{recently}} gained recognition {{as an important}} contributor to some eukaryote proteomes, but the mechanisms of acquisition and fixation in eukaryotic genomes are still uncertain. A previously defined norm for LGTs in microbial eukaryotes states that the majority are genes involved in metabolism, the LGTs are typically localized one by one, surrounded by vertically inherited genes on the chromosome, and phylogenetics shows that a broad collection of bacterial lineages {{have contributed to the}} transferome. Results: A unique 34 kbp long fragment with 27 clustered genes (TvLF) of prokaryote origin was identified in the sequenced genome of the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. Using a PCR based approach we confirmed the presence of the orthologous fragment in four additional T. vaginalis strains. Detailed sequence analyses unambiguously suggest that TvLF is the result of one single, recent LGT event. The proposed donor is a close relative to the firmicute bacterium Peptoniphilus harei. High nucleotide sequence similarity between T. vaginalis strains, as well as to P. harei, and the absence of homologs in other Trichomonas species, suggests that the transfer event took place after the radiation of the genus Trichomonas. Some genes have undergone pseudogenization and degradation, indicating that they may not be retained in the future. Functional annotations reveal that genes involved in informational processes are particularly prone to degradation. Conclusions: We conclude that, although the majority of eukaryote LGTs are single gene occurrences, they may be acquired in clusters of several genes that are subsequently cleansed of <b>evolutionarily</b> less <b>advantageous</b> genes...|$|R

50|$|Glory Season (1993) by David Brin {{is set on}} {{the planet}} Stratos, {{inhabited}} by a strain of human beings designed to conceive clones in winter, and normal children in summer. All clones are female, because males cannot reproduce themselves individually. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity; women are sexually receptive in winter, and men in summer.

It has been suggested that it would be <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> for a mother to lay her eggs elsewhere if she had the opportunity to do so. Thus, a mother will gain advantage by replacing her daughter’s eggs with her own eggs, which diverts her resources from producing grand-offspring to producing more of her own offspring. Finally, a mother will eat her daughter’s eggs to gain more nutrients, which increase her longevity and fecundity.|$|E

50|$|The {{fourth of}} these {{principle}}s, {{the principle of}} maximum power efficiency, takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems. The fourth principle suggests that the most <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system. The further the environmental load is from matching the internal resistance, the further the system is away from its sustainable steady state. Therefore, the systems ecologist engages in a task of resistance and impedance matching in ecological engineering, just as the electronic engineer would do.|$|E

50|$|Ergosterol (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a sterol {{found in}} fungi, and named for ergot, the common name {{of members of}} the fungal genus Claviceps from which {{ergosterol}} was first isolated. Ergosterol is a component of yeast and other fungal cell membranes, serving many of the same functions that cholesterol serves in animal cells.Its specificity in higher fungi is thought {{to be related to the}} climatic instabilities (highly varying humidity and moisture conditions) encountered by these organisms in their typical ecological niches (plant and animal surfaces, soil). Thus, despite the added energy requirements of ergosterol synthesis (if compared to cholesterol), ergosterol is thought to have evolved as a nearly ubiquitous, <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> fungal alternative to cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of mutual aid, originally identified by Peter Kropotkin as arising from natural law, {{is that since}} evolution occurs in groupsnot individualsit is <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> for members of a community to assist each other. The anarchist approach to building powerand structuring power relationshipsis derived from this evolutionary and biological imperative. In a nutshell {{the argument is that}} since individuals require the assistance of groups to self-actualize, individuals have a strong self-interest in the good of the community to which they belong. It follows that (freely associating) collectives of individuals working for mutual improvement and mutual goals must form the basis of any anarchist society, thus providing the sociological and economic imperative for the creation of social contracts capable of binding these self-selecting groups together.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of the colonial queen, or gyne, is to lay eggs within the brood cells housed in the combs. They also {{play a vital role}} in the {{establishment}} of new colonies. Using their attractive senses, queen bees are able to lead a swarm of workers and the occasional dwarf queen to new locations. Until fairly recently, it was hypothesized that these dwarf, or miniature, queens were the result of developmental mistakes. However, through Tom Wenseleers' [...] "Caste Conflict Hypothesis," [...] it is believed that dwarf queens are <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> in that they develop in order to avoid becoming a worker bee. Their role was found to become the head of a colony in the absence of viable, full-sized queens.|$|E
5000|$|This Is Your Brain on Music {{describes}} {{the components of}} music, such as timbre, rhythm, pitch, and harmony and ties them to neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, cognitive psychology, and evolution, while also making these topics accessible to nonexpert readers by avoiding the use of scientific jargon.

The book challenges Steven Pinker's [...] "auditory cheesecake" [...] assertion that music was an incidental by-product of evolution, arguing instead that music served as an indicator of cognitive, emotional and physical health, and was <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> as a force that led to social bonding and increased fitness, citing the arguments of Charles Darwin, Geoffrey Miller and others.|$|E
50|$|Another {{temporal}} illusion, possibly {{related to}} the oddball effect, occurs when a person perceives a potential threat or mate (See Fight-or-flight response). For example, research suggests that time seems to slow down when a person skydives or bungee jumps, or when a person suddenly and unexpectedly senses {{the presence of a}} potential predator or mate. This reported slowing in temporal perception may have been <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> because it may have enhanced our ability to intelligibly make quick decisions in moments that were of critical importance to our survival. However, even though observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during these events, it is unknown whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion of remembering an emotionally salient event.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that ovulating {{heterosexual}} women prefer faces with masculine traits associated with increased exposure to testosterone during key developmental stages, such as a broad forehead, relatively longer lower face, prominent chin and brow, chiseled jaw and defined cheekbones. [...] The degree of differences {{between male and female}} anatomical traits is called sexual dimorphism. Female respondents in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle {{were significantly more likely to}} choose a masculine face than those in menses and luteal phases, (or in those taking hormonal contraception). This distinction supports the sexy son hypothesis, which posits that it is <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> for women to select potential fathers who are more genetically attractive, rather than the best caregivers. However, women's likeliness to exert effort to view male faces does not seem to depend on their masculinity, but to a general increase with women's testosterone levels.|$|E
5000|$|At {{first it}} might seem that a {{criticism}} could be made from a biological standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would seem not to be beneficial to the species that holds it. A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will {{be seen in the}} long term as <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous,</b> given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether - in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in either direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts.It might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems. We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for [...] "dog with 1,000,000 hairs", [...] "dog with 1,000,001 hairs" [...] and so on. But conceptual vagueness is not metaphysical indeterminacy.|$|E
5000|$|Beling {{was able}} to show that bees have an {{astonishing}} memory of time. She found that this time memory is both rigorous (the bees consistently show up at the expected time) and flexible (the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day, even {{two or three times a}} day). Beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours. This 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous,</b> helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day. The bees' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day, the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response. [...] Beling’s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a Zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments.|$|E
5000|$|A strong {{indicator}} of physical beauty is [...] "averageness". When images of human faces are averaged {{together to form}} a composite image, they become progressively closer to the [...] "ideal" [...] image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals {{to see if there was}} a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images. Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces. It is argued that it is <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features, because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects. There is also evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy, and is probably innate, [...] and that the rules by which attractiveness is established are similar across different genders and cultures.|$|E
5000|$|Neurons exhibit {{high-frequency}} fluctuations of firing-rates {{which could}} be noise or could carry information. Rate coding models suggest that these irregularities are noise, while temporal coding models suggest that they encode information. If the nervous system only used rate codes to convey information, a more consistent, regular firing rate would have been <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous,</b> and neurons would have utilized this code over other less robust options. Temporal coding supplies an alternate explanation for the “noise," [...] suggesting that it actually encodes information and affects neural processing. To model this idea, binary symbols {{can be used to}} mark the spikes: 1 for a spike, 0 for no spike. Temporal coding allows the sequence 000111000111 to mean something different from 001100110011, even though the mean firing rate is the same for both sequences, at 6 spikes/10 ms. Until recently, scientists had put the most emphasis on rate encoding as an explanation for post-synaptic potential patterns. However, functions of the brain are more temporally precise than the use of only rate encoding seems to allow. In other words, essential information could be lost due to the inability of the rate code to capture all the available information of the spike train. In addition, responses are different enough between similar (but not identical) stimuli to suggest that the distinct patterns of spikes contain a higher volume of information than is possible to include in a rate code.|$|E
50|$|Jablonski asserts head {{hair was}} <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> for pre-humans to retain because it {{protected}} the scalp {{as they walked}} upright in the intense African (equatorial) UV light. While some might argue that, by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions, {{the protection of the}} head, the seat of the brain that enabled humanity {{to become one of the}} most successful species on the planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the gradual process by which Homo erectus began a transition from furry skin to the naked skin expressed by Homo sapiens, hair texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair (the condition of most mammals, including humanity's closest cousins—chimpanzees) to Afro-textured hair or 'kinky' (i.e. tightly coiled). This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids living at the equator). It is substantiated by Iyengar's (1998) findings that UV light can enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when kinked or sharply curved or coiled). In this sense, when hominids (i.e. Homo Erectus) were gradually losing their straight body hair and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability. By inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-protected skin to paler skin.|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{directed}} motion of protocells {{during the early stages}} of evolution was discussed. The expenditures for movement, space orientation, and reception of information about the environment were taken into consideration, and it was shown that directed movement is <b>evolutionarily</b> <b>advantageous</b> in the following cases: when opposite gradients of different resources (for example, matter and energy) are great enough and when there is a rapid change in environmental parameters. It was also shown that the advantage of directed movement strategies depends greatly on how information about the environment is obtained by a protocell. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.
