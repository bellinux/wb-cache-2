25|$|Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains {{signs of}} having {{its origins in}} wooden architecture. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of a flat timber plate {{across the top of}} a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, {{while at the same time}} {{reinforcing}} the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright. The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a flat band or fillet between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four but there may be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called torus, and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the abacus.|$|E
2500|$|When two {{boats are}} used (pair trawling), the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> {{of the net}} is {{provided}} by the boats, with one {{or in the case of}} pelagic trawling two [...] attached to each boat. However, single-boat trawling is more common. Here, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of the net is provided by trawl doors (also known as [...] "otter boards"). Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread.</b> As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5–4.0 knots.|$|E

50|$|Genji, {{full name}} Genji Shimada, is a Japanese cyborg ninja offense {{character}} whose agile, melee-oriented playstyle {{is difficult to}} learn, yet popular among new players who like his ninja design. His main attack method is to throw three Shurikens, either in quick succession or simultaneously in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread.</b> His abilities are Swift Strike, a quick dashing lunge with good range, and Deflect, a defensive stance that briefly ricochets projectiles back at enemies. His Cyber-Agility allows him to double-jump and run up walls. Genji's ultimate ability is Dragonblade, which temporarily replaces his shurikens with powerful, sweeping melee attacks.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Two gravity-driven tectonic {{processes}} {{are common in}} orogenic belts, such as the Scandinavian Caledonides. (1) The rise of buoyant granitoid basement {{in the form of}} domes and diapirs into the column of geosynclinal metasediments and metalavas. In the Scandinavian Caledonides some of the nappes also acted as a buoyancy-inducing overburden. This is particularly true for the heavy Seve nappe. (2) The gravitational collapse of the pile of supracrustals and nappes. The collapse is associated with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading</b> which contri-butes to the horizontal displacement of the thrust sheets. In the Scandinavian Caledonides there are numerous examples of basement diapirism, particularly among the ‘Nordland granites’, but also within the huge More-gneiss complex in SW Norway. Closer to {{the eastern edge of the}} chain the basement was less hot and plastic during the orogenesis, and cataclastic conditions prevailed during the rise of the row of peripheral uplifts extending parallel to the belt. Evidence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading</b> and vertical shortening of some of the nappes is found in the form of boudinage, mineral lineation and prevailing horizontal schistosity over large regions within the nappes. The collapse-spreading process has been treated theoretically and experimentally, but experimental results are only briefly mentioned...|$|R
50|$|True hickories such as mockernut {{develop a}} long taproot with few laterals. The species is windfirm. Early root growth is {{primarily}} into the taproot, which typically reaches {{a depth of}} 30 to 91 cm during the first year. Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of 122 cm, and the laterals grow rapidly. After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of the roots is about double that of the crown. By age 10, the height is 4 times {{the depth of the}} taproot.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} DTL, {{this is a}} popular trap {{shooting}} discipline. Targets are thrown to a distance of 45 to 50 metres at a fixed height of approximately 2.75 m and with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of up to 22 degrees {{either side of the}} centre line. Each competitor shoots at a single target in turn, but without moving from the stand until all have shot five targets. Then they all move one place to the right, and continue to do so until they have all completed a standard round of 25 birds. Scoring of each target is 3 points for a first barrel kill, 2 points for a second barrel kill and 0 for a miss (maximum 75 points per round). Variations of this discipline are single barrel, double rise, and handicap-by-distance.|$|E

5000|$|Vaccination is {{the only}} known method to prevent the {{development}} of tumors when chickens are infected with the virus. However, administration of vaccines does not prevent transmission of the virus, i.e., the vaccine is not sterilizing. [...] However, it does {{reduce the amount of}} virus shed in the dander, hence reduces <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> of the disease. Marek's disease does not spread vertically. The vaccine was introduced in 1970 and the scientist credited with its development is Dr. Ben Roy Burmester and Dr. Frank J Siccardi. [...] Before that, Marek's disease caused substantial revenue loss in the poultry industries of the United States and the United Kingdom. The vaccine can be administered to one-day-old chicks through subcutaneous inoculation or by in ovo vaccination when the eggs are transferred from the incubator to the hatcher. In ovo vaccination is the preferred method, as it does not require handling of the chicks and can be done rapidly by automated methods. Immunity develops within two weeks.|$|E

The results presented show the behaviour of wall confluent jets in the form of velocity profiles, the spreading rate of jets on the surface, jets decay, etc. The empirical equations derived are compared with other types of air jets. In addition, the flow in wall confluent jets is compared with the flow in displacement ventilation supply, with regards to the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading</b> on the floor. It is concluded that the jet momentum of wall confluent jets can be more conserved than other jets. Thus, wall confluent jets have a greater spread over the floor than displacement flow...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{gravimetric}} {{moisture content}} of peat {{is the main}} factor limiting the ignition and spread propagation of smouldering fires. Our aim is to use controlled laboratory experiments to better understand how the spread of smouldering fires is influenced in natural landscape conditions where the moisture content of the top peat layer is not homogeneous. In this paper, we study {{for the first time}} the spread of peat fires across a spatial matrix of two moisture contents (dry/wet) in the laboratory. The experiments were undertaken using an open-top insulated box (22 × 18 × 6 cm) filled with milled peat. The peat was ignited at one side of the box initiating smouldering and <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread.</b> Measurements of the peak temperature inside the peat, fire duration and longwave thermal radiation from the burning samples revealed important local changes of the smouldering behaviour in response to sharp gradients in moisture content. Both, peak temperatures and radiation in wetter peat (after the moisture gradient) were sensitive to the drier moisture condition (preceding the moisture gradient). Drier peat conditions before the moisture gradient led to higher temperatures and higher radiation flux from the fire during the first 6 cm of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> into a wet peat patch. The total spread distance into a wet peat patch was affected by the moisture content gradient. We predicted that in most peat moisture gradients of relevance to natural ecosystems the fire self-extinguishes within the first 10 cm of <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> into a wet peat patch. Spread distances of more than 10 cm are limited to wet peat patches below 160 % moisture content (mass of water per mass of dry peat). We found that spatial gradients of moisture content have important local effects on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>spread</b> and should be considered in field and modelling studies...|$|E

30|$|It is {{not unusual}} for {{different}} dynamics to lead to common shapes. For example, electrochemical deposition, lightning and viscous fingering involve different physical phenomena but all produce similar patterns and are described by the same mathematical model. Similarly there are complex structures and complex organizations that resemble one another and are described by the same scientific model, for example cells, biological organisms, economies, factories and cities. Such commonalities also occur for the structure found in Experiment B. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>spreading,</b> together with the resource distribution network and the structures that grow vertically from it visually resemble a metropolis. While it is possible that this visual similarity is a coincidence, it seems more probable that the similarity follows from some universal laws that control the growth of structures in these systems.|$|R
