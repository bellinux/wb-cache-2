25|$|The primary break rate of {{sparking}} Tesla coils is slow {{compared to}} the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over {{a short period of}} time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the <b>input</b> <b>line</b> voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} for BEAM-based neurons is a capacitor that has one lead as an input, {{and the other}} going into the <b>input</b> <b>line</b> of an inverter. That inverter's output is {{the output of the}} neuron. The capacitor lead that is inputting into the inverter is pulled to ground with a resistor. The neuron functions because when an input is received (positive power on the <b>input</b> <b>line),</b> it charges the capacitor. Once the input is lost (negative power on the <b>input</b> <b>line),</b> the capacitor discharges into the inverter, causing the inverter to produce an output that is passed to the next neuron. The rate that the capacitor discharges is tied to the resistor that is pulling the input to the inverter to the negative. The larger the resistor, the longer it will take for the capacitor to fully discharge, and the longer it will take for that neuron to completely fire.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Internet Center, the only source for University of Evansville Men's {{basketball}} coverage was local sources inside Evansville, particularly Adam Alexander on WKDQ. Evansville basketball was not broadcast anywhere outside of the area. WUEV did not air UE basketball through their terrestrial signal at that time, either. But, they could carry basketball on the internet. A DR-10 telephone switcher was purchased and wired into the Internet Center by Bailey, so that Clark and the field broadcast team could call the UE toll-free number, reach the proper extension, and switch the internet broadcast signal from the control room's <b>input</b> <b>line</b> to a Marti or Comdex <b>input</b> <b>line.</b> Listeners could now [...] "tune in" [...] to the internet broadcast.
