Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler.

25|$|Dr Maressa Orzack {{studied at}} Columbia University, {{where she worked}} as an {{experimental}} psychologist. From there, in the late 1950s she worked with Agnes N. O'Connel on setting up a research arm at the Wisconsin Central Colony and Training School, under a job share arrangement. It is understood that her later work involved experience with impulse control disorders such as eating disorders and <b>gambling</b> <b>addiction.</b> Her research into computer addiction started at around 1994 while she was treating patients for <b>gambling</b> <b>addiction</b> and substance abuse at McLean Hospital. From discussions with her colleagues and patients referred to her, in 1996. Orzack went on to found and coordinate computer addiction services and a study centre at the hospital. When the clinic first opened Orzack would see at most two patients a week, but later expanded to dozens a week. After that time, Orzack expanded her research from online sex to computer <b>gambling</b> <b>addiction,</b> through to computer game addiction.|$|E

50|$|Unpredictability is the Core Drive of {{constantly}} being engaged because you don't {{know what is}} going to happen next. When something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks into high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary Core Drive behind <b>gambling</b> <b>addictions,</b> but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results.|$|R

30|$|Client {{engagement}} strategies To {{engage with}} the client and to discuss their concerns about counselling, practitioners at ACA decided to involve close members of the gambler’s family in both the treatment and recovery processes. While this approach does not align fully with the Western principle of protecting the client’s privacy, it does lead to longer contact and engagement with the client. This is supported by research conducted by the Centre for Gambling Research which showed that members of ethnic cultural groups in Canberra who were facing <b>gambling</b> <b>addictions</b> turned most often to families and friends, or to other generic agencies for help (McMillen et al. 2004).|$|R
25|$|Before {{her first}} {{appearance}} on the show, Taylor dated Storm Logan (Ethan Wayne) in high school. Her father is Jack Hamilton (Chris Robinson), {{and she has a}} younger brother, Zachary. Taylor's mother, Sharon, died {{when she was a child}} which led to Jack's <b>gambling</b> <b>addiction.</b> Her chaotic childhood led to Taylor becoming a psychiatrist. She was in an abusive relationship with Blake Hayes (Peter Brown) who also stalked her.|$|E

Like Paulie, events from past episodes and sketches sometimes occur again at a later date.|$|E
30|$|Superstitious beliefs Another factor {{within the}} {{cultural}} {{beliefs of the}} Arabic client with <b>gambling</b> <b>addictions,</b> and which impacts on the initiation, maintenance {{and the likelihood of}} the increase of gambling activity is the use of assistive superstitious elements and rituals leading to risk-taking behaviours (Moussa 2015; Mazbouh-Moussa and Ohtsuka 2016). For example, some clients reported avoiding gaming venues on a Wednesday due to this day being a jinx. Other clients reported carrying a hamsa to bring luck and to protect against the evil eye (Arab Council Australia 2016). Explanations for this risk-taking behaviour may stem from the concept that these rituals and superstitious beliefs provide imaginary secondary control facing uncontrollable situations (Gmelch 2006; Malinowski 1954).|$|R

30|$|Gambling and {{comorbidity}} issues Many gamblers counselled at ACA {{presented with}} comorbidities {{of mental health}} issues specific to migrants and refugees, such as Post Traumatic and Stress Disorder (PTSD) (American Psychiatric Association 2013) and migration stress. These clients were subjected to threats of prosecution, to witnessing the deaths of close family members or had lived stressful war experiences and internal and external migrations before they finally settled in Australia. Counsellors and practitioners at ACA are specially trained to assist people with <b>gambling</b> <b>addictions</b> and who also require trauma treatments and interventions. Arab women, in particular, may have experienced extreme violence such as rape and torture during the war (Hamdan 2009) as well as sectarian violence {{in the country of}} origin and refugee camps.|$|R
