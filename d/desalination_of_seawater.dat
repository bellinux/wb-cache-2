For over 20 years, a major desalination plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment.

25|$|The Syrian {{government}} has {{at various times}} considered two alternative mega-projects to bring additional water to the Greater Damascus area. One plan consisted in the transfer {{of water from the}} coastal region over a distance of at least 225km and a cumulated difference in altitude of about 1000m. The water sources considered were two reservoirs in the coastal basin and even offshore springs in the Mediterranean or <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> <b>seawater</b> at a total cost of more than US$1 per cubic meter including its transfer. By 2010 this plan was considered to have been abandoned. The other plan consists in building a pipeline from the Euphrates River. In 2006 Syrian officials said they were “pressing ahead” with a feasibility study by a Swiss company to transfer water from the Euphrates to Damascus at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. The project would involve conveying water from Lake Assad, some 441 kilometers away with pumping over an altitude of 712 meters. A capacity of 850 million m3 per annum has been envisaged, about twice the current water deficit in Greater Damascus. The cost for bulk water before distribution losses would be more than US$0.50 per cubic meter.|$|E

In this thesis we will resolve the problem of water provision in Porto S. Stefano, the most important seaside resort on the Costa d’Argento in Grosseto (Tuscany).

25|$|Drinking {{water is}} often {{collected}} at springs, extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places {{is thus a}} possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes. Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes. Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis. <b>Desalination</b> <b>of</b> abundant <b>seawater</b> is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{from the}} sea {{constitutes}} the 'blue' type of the renewable energy sources (RES). During the last decades, a number of devices for electric energy production from sea waves and currents are in implementation. Depending on their location and the technologies, different types of those devices were developed. Concerning the highest mean wave power worldwide, this varies from 20 to 70 kW/m at the coasts of West Europe, Canada, USA, south coasts of Australia and Latin America. In the Mediterranean Sea the wave power varies between 4 and 11 kW/m. Regarding the the currents energy, the main exploitable type is the tidal currents mainly at West Europe and North America East coasts. Many countries of the afore-mentioned areas have exploited the energy from sea {{before the end of}} the previous millennium. Other countries, with low sea energy potential, are at the level of theoretical investigation. A special case of profitable exploitation of the 'marine' energy, especially when this energy potential is low, is the construction and operation of structures or devices which, apart from their main role (the protection of a harbour or <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seawater),</b> have also the additional role of the sea energy exploitation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to prepare a thin film nanofibrous {{composite}} membrane utilized for nanofiltration technologies. The composite membrane consists of a three-layer system including a nonwoven part as the supporting material, a nanofibrous scaffold as the porous surface, and an active layer. The nonwoven part and the nanofibrous scaffold were laminated together to improve the mechanical properties of the complete membrane. Active layer formations were done successfully via interfacial polymerization. A filtration test was carried out using solutions of MgSO 4, NaCl, Na 2 SO 4, CaCl 2, and real seawater using the dead-end filtration method. The results indicated that the piperazine-based membrane exhibited higher rejection of divalent salt ions (> 98 %) with high flux. In addition, the m-phenylenediamine-based membrane exhibited higher rejection of divalent and monovalent salt ions (> 98 % divalent and > 96 % monovalent) with reasonable flux. The <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> real <b>seawater</b> results showed that thin film nanofibrous composite membranes were able to retain 98 % of salt ions from highly saline seawater without showing any fouling.

For comparison purposes, the performance of the FO process was improved to minimize the impact of concentration polarization and optimize the concentration of draw solution. Model calculations revealed that FO-RO was more energy efficient than RO when no Energy Recovery Device was employed. However, results showed {{there was no significant difference}} in the power consumption between the FO-RO system and the RO unit at high seawater salinities, particularly when a high efficiency ERD was installed. Moreover, the FO-RO system required more membrane area than conventional a RO unit which may further compromise the FO-RO desalination cost...|$|R
40|$|Disinfection of {{drinking}} water by chlorine produces several disinfection byproducts (DBPs) including the well documented trihalomethanes (THMs). As some of these compounds are harmful to health, stringent limits have been imposed by regulatory bodies on their permissible levels in potable water. Several alternative biocides such as ozone, chloramine, chlorine dioxide, etc., {{had been used to}} reduce the THM levels in drinking water. Ozonation is becoming increasingly popular in Europe as well as in North America. Both ozone and chloramine are reported to produce low levels of THMs in surface water treatments. In <b>seawater</b> <b>desalination,</b> disinfection <b>of</b> <b>seawater</b> and product water is mostly carried out by chlorination and very few studies have been reported on the use of alternative disinfectants in this field. Water samples from seawater desalination differs from those originating from natural sources such as rivers and lakes in one important aspect which is relevant to THM formation, i. e., its bromide content. High bromide content in <b>seawater</b> and possibility <b>of</b> carry over of bromine and brominated THMs into the desalinated water may alter both the quantity and species distribution of THMs. This paper describes the results of a detailed comparative study on the formation of THMs by three disinfectants, i. e., chlorine, ozone and chloramine in synthetic water samples containing Cl-, Br- and humic acid (HA) and in samples <b>of</b> <b>seawater</b> and distillates from MSF plants and well water used for blending purpose.

Mekorot supplies 1.5 billion cubic meters of water in an average year, 70% of Israel's entire [...] water supply and 80% of its drinking water. It supplies water to about 4,800 intermediary water providers, including municipalities, regional associations, agricultural settlements and industrial consumers. It also operates 31 desalination plants treating nearly a million cubic meters of seawater and brackish water every day. The company's eight wastewater treatment plants, including the Dan Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, treat 40% of all Israel's wastewater. Its nine reclamation plants enable 70% of the treated effluent to be reused for agriculture. In 2007 the structure of Mekorot has been changed.

Second objective of this work; is to increase the pH levels to 10 in the permeate <b>of</b> the first <b>desalination</b> pass in order to promote dissociation of boric acid (B(OH) (3)) to borate (B(OH) (4) (-)). Negatively charged borate can easily be removed by membrane systems because of the charge repulsion. Oxidation efficiency of ozone under pH 10 conditions and the buffer effect of borate were also focused on in this study. Double pass nanofiltration/reverse osmosis (NF/RO) membrane filtration systems were used for the <b>desalination</b> <b>of</b> model <b>seawater.</b> Permeate <b>of</b> the first membrane filtration was adjusted to pH 10 and oxidized with ozone for 30 mins. Oxidized permeate was then fed to the second membrane filtration in order to investigate boron removal and bromate formation and removal. Boron removal was improved effectively by all tested membranes at pH 10. Boron removal rates for NE 70, NE 90 and FL membranes increased from 4 % to 7 %, 11 % to 28 % and 37 % to 84 % respectively.

40|$|Several {{water quality}} indexes have been {{developed}} and used for may years to indicate non-aggressive nature of water. Most widely used {{among them is the}} Langelier Index (LI) based on CaCO 3 saturation in water. But the application and limitations of LI as well as all other indexes are incompletely understood and controversial. The effect predicted by the indexes do not always conform to the expectations.

The objective of the present review is to study the potential contamination, transport, fate, effect and control of blistering chemical warfare agents (CWAs), in the Kuwaiti desalination industry. In general, all the environmental factors involved in the aquatic degradation of CWAs in Kuwait marine environment except for the high salin-ity in case of blistering agents such as sulphur mustard, are in favor of a fast degrada-tion process. In case of massive releases of CWAs near the Kuwaiti shorelines, turbulence resulting from tidal cycles and high temperature will affect the dissolution process and extend the toxicity of the insoluble agent.
