50|$|In {{microprocessor}} design, <b>gate</b> <b>count</b> {{refers to}} the number of gates build with transistor and other electronic devices, that are needed to implement a design. Even with today's process technology providing what was formerly considered impossible numbers of gates on a single chip, gate counts remain {{one of the most important}} overall factors in the end price of a chip. Designs with fewer gates will typically cost less, and for this reason <b>gate</b> <b>count</b> remains a commonly used metric in the industry.|$|E
40|$|Objective – To {{provide an}} {{analysis}} of the impact of expenditures on electronic resourcesand <b>gate</b> <b>counts</b> on the increase or decrease in reference transactions. Design – Analysis of results of existing survey data from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) 2006 Academic Library Survey(ALS). Setting – Academic libraries in the United States. Subjects – 3925 academic library respondents. Methods – The author chose to use survey data collected from the 2006 ALS conducted bythe NCES. The survey included data on various topics related to academic libraries, {{but in the case of}} this study, the author chose to analyze three of the 193 variables included. The three variables: electronic books expenditure, computer hardware and software, and expenditures on bibliographic utilities, were combined into one variable called electronic resource expenditure. <b>Gate</b> <b>counts</b> were also considered as a variable. Electronic resource expenditure was also split as a variable into three groups: low, medium, and high. Multiple regression analysis and general linear modeling, along with tests of reliability, were employed. Main Results – The author determined that low, medium, and high spenders with regard to electronic resources exhibited differences in <b>gate</b> <b>counts,</b> and <b>gate</b> <b>counts</b> have an effect on reference transactions in any given week. <b>Gate</b> <b>counts</b> tend to not have much of an effect on reference transactions for the higher spenders, and higher spenders tend to have a higher number of reference transactions overall. Low spenders have lower <b>gate</b> <b>counts</b> and also a lower amount of reference transactions. Conclusion – The findings from this study show that academic libraries spending more on electronic resources also tend to have an increase with regard to reference transactions. The author also concludes that library spaces are no longer the determining factor with regard to number of reference transactions. Spending more on electronic resources is also important to increase both in-person and electronic reference transactions...|$|R

40|$|Implementation of an {{iterative}} QR decomposition (QRD) (IQRD) architecture {{based on}} the modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) algorithm is proposed in this paper.

In addition, the TSA architecture can be modified into an iterative architecture that is called IQRD for reducing hardware cost. The IQRD hardware is constructed by the diagonal and the triangular process with fewer <b>gate</b> <b>counts</b> and lower power consumption than TSAQRD. For a 4 4 matrix, the hardware area of the proposed IQRD can reduce about 41 % of the <b>gate</b> <b>counts</b> in TSAQRD.

40|$|Uniformly {{controlled}} one-qubit gates are quantum gates {{which can}} be represented as direct sums of two-dimensional unitary operators acting on a single qubit. We present a quantum gate array which implements any n-qubit gate of this type using at most 2 ^{n- 1 } - 1 controlled-NOT gates, 2 ^{n- 1 } one-qubit gates and a single diagonal n-qubit gate. The circuit {{is based on the}} so-called quantum multiplexor, for which we provide a modified construction.

Moreover, we study their implementation using only nearest-neighbor gates. We give upper bounds for the one-qubit and controlled-NOT <b>gate</b> <b>counts</b> for all the aforementioned applications.
