50|$|Kwoiek Creek Hydroelectric Project: The Kwoiek Creek Hydroelectric Project is a 49.9 MW, run-of-river project {{located on}} the lower reaches of Kwoiek Creek, a {{tributary}} to the Fraser River, approximately 14 km south of Lytton, British Columbia. The Project will include a water diversion and <b>intake</b> <b>facilities,</b> a buried penstock and a powerhouse located on Kanaka Bar Indian Band's Whyeek IR No. 4 near Lytton. The Project will also include an approximately 80 km long, 138-kV transmission line to transmit electricity generated by the Project to the BC Hydro substation at Highland Valley.|$|R
50|$|Some {{small scale}} {{desalination}} units use 'beach wells'; {{they are usually}} drilled on the seashore in close vicinity to the ocean. These <b>intake</b> <b>facilities</b> are relatively simple to build and the seawater they collect is pretreated via slow filtration through the subsurface sand/seabed formations {{in the area of}} source water extraction. Raw seawater collected using beach wells is often of better quality in terms of solids, silt, oil and grease, natural organic contamination and aquatic microorganisms, compared to open seawater intakes. Sometimes, beach intakes may also yield source water of lower salinity.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} {{is known for}} its medieval kahrezes (qanat), a system of underground water channels and <b>intake</b> <b>facilities.</b> These deep channels are located 50-60m from each other. There are 5 kahrezes in Shvanidzor. Four of them were constructed in the 12th-14th centuries, even before the village was founded. The fifth kahrez was constructed in 2005. Potable water runs through I, II and V kahrezes. Kahrez III and IV are in quite poor condition. In summer, especially in July and August, the amount of water reaches its minimum, creating critical situation in the water supply system.|$|R
50|$|The prison, {{a maximum}} {{security}} facility, opened in May 1998. It {{serves as an}} <b>intake</b> <b>facility.</b> It includes the state death row for men.

50|$|One flight {{down from}} the control room a door to the {{northwest}} opens onto external metal stairs which lead {{down to the river}} <b>intake</b> <b>facility.</b> The river <b>intake</b> <b>facility</b> is housed below the pumping station beneath a concrete platform {{at the edge of the}} river. Metal grille screens run across the inlet. A block and tackle is fitted to the hook on the steel frame at the end of the concrete platform to pull the screens up for cleaning. The intake draws water from the river and through the pumping station by a series of valve controlled pipes power by electric motors housed in the basement level from where it is pumped via two mains to the water treatment plant in Monaro Drive, Petrie or into the Lake Kurwongbah dam. Water is also pumped from the dam to the water treatment plant.|$|E

50|$|The Water Fix {{proposal}} {{includes two}} categories of construction: the north tunnels and the main tunnels. The north tunnels are three separate tunnels, each about 14 miles long, which connect the three <b>intake</b> <b>facilities</b> to the Intermediate Forebay (IF). The main tunnels are intended to connect the Intermediate Forebay to the Clifton Court Forebay. These twin tunnels, depicted in the adjacent image, will be about 30 miles long. The main tunnels are {{also known as the}} twin tunnels, but are different from the Peripheral Canals proposed in 1982. The Water Fix is intended to make conveyance of water for the State Water Project and Central Valley Project more reliable while relieving environmental pressure on the Delta area.|$|R

40|$|Feed intake is {{the single}} most {{critical}} factor of dairy production, and performance of dairy cattle can be enhanced or hindered by environmental factors that affect it. These environmental factors can by divided into physical and climatic conditions. On modern dairies, the physical factors may be of more concern. Modern facilities provide the cow with protection from the natural elements. However, these same facilities can enhance or hinder dry matter <b>intake.</b> <b>Facilities</b> should provide adequate access to feed and water, a comfortable resting area, and adequate protection from the natural elements. Critical areas of facility design related to feed intake include access to feed and water, stall design and surface, supplemental lighting, ventilation, and cow cooling.

It {{is important to remember that}} choices made during construction of a facility will affect the performance of animals for the life of the facility, which is generally 20 to 30 yr.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} some of the grass root problems that tend to frustrate municipal water supply efforts of the Lagos State Water Corporation. This was achieved by understudying three water withdrawal points, namely Iju, Isashi and Adiyan water <b>intake</b> <b>facilities</b> through physical observation, administration of questionnaires and Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis of data obtained through questionnaire. The correlation coefficient analysis of the location of intake against water source gave value ranges of 0. 530, 0. 545 and 0. 586 for Iju, Adiyan and Isashi Intakes respectively. The correlation analysis of the hydraulic properties of the intake structure against water quality also revealed value ranges of 0. 260, 0. 236 and- 0. 453 respectively while the correlation analysis of intake location and water quality gave value ranges of- 0. 246,- 0. 602 and- 0. 827 respectively.

50|$|Born Isiah Courtney Smith on September 15, 1922 in a {{log cabin}} near Lake Helen, Florida, a small town near Sanford, and known to most who knew him as I.C., Smith walked eight miles to {{elementary}} school because “The city had a school bus for the whites, all our friends, {{and we had to}} walk.” Consequently, his father bought land and eventually moved the family next to the black school. In 1940, he graduated from Euclid High School in Deland and enrolled at then Florida A&M College.

The State of Nevada constructed the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Facility {{in conjunction with the}} first stage. The first stage system has the capacity to deliver 132, 200 acre-feet per year. The second stage consists of five new pumping plants, modifications to four existing first stage pumping plants, a 2. 5 -mile-long second barrel to the main aqueduct installed beside the first stage, and 30 miles of new aqueduct and pipelines with a capacity of 166, 800 acre-feet per year. The State of Nevada plans a major expansion of the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Facility in conjunction with the second stage. The second stage will cause a slight deterioration in the water quality of return flows from the Las Vegas area to Lake Mead. It will temporarily disturb 188 acres of vegetation and wildlife habitat and eliminate 12 acres. The project will employ about 100 people for construction and 20 people for the operation and maintenance. Operation of the second stage will require a maximum annual power supply of 280 million kWh.
