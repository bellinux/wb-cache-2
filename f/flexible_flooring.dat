40|$|During {{the last}} several decades, {{stronger}} and lighter materials have been developed {{with the aim of}} optimizing performance and building costs. These technological advances have given rise to thin <b>flexible</b> <b>flooring</b> systems with natural frequencies that lie within the frequency range of vibrations produced by human activity. Human occupants can cause changes in the dynamic properties of the structure and structural vibrations can cause discomfort to the occupants, who not only perceive the vibrations but also interact dynamically with the structure. This paper presents the results of the characterization of the effect of human-structure interaction (HSI) in three flooring systems commonly used in the Colombian building industry. The methodology consisted in the characterization of the dynamic response of the flooring systems due to different coordinated human activities. Based on the results, the authors recommend that future building codes account for human-structure interaction effects in flooring systems...|$|E

40|$|A seismic {{performance}} {{assessment of}} the three-storey masonry building from Ljubljana, is presented. It was assessed by using computer software 3 Muri. Firstly, different failure mechanisms of masonry walls, i. e. flexural mechanism, the sliding shear mechanism and shear mechanism due to formation of diagonal cracks, are presented and discussed. Described is a simplified non-linear method for seismic performance assessment - N 2 method. It {{can be used in}} order to predict damage in the structural elements and consequently locate parts of the structure which have to be strengthened. Some strengthening techniques used for reducing the seismic risk due to weak masonry buildings are described. In practical part of the Thesis the three-storey building is described and its earthquake- resistance is assessed by using 3 Muri, which enables elastic static analysis of vertical load, modal analysis and use of the N 2 method. Nine structural models have been prepared in order to study the impact of different material characteristics, <b>flexible</b> <b>floors,</b> and the strengthening techniques on the earthquake resistance of the building. Material strength significantly affects the earthquake-resistance and even the collapse mechanism of the masonry wall and the entire structure. It is therefore recommended to perform sensitivity analysis for different material strengths on the earthquake- resistance of the structure. The use of the non-linear static analysis on structures with <b>flexible</b> <b>floors</b> is limited and it would be reasonable to develop new methods for assessment of such structures or to employ non-linear dynamic analysis.

The assessment was addressed to the global seismic response of the building, mainly governed by the in-plane capacity of the masonry walls, and to the local response, related to the activation of out-of-plane mechanisms of parts of the building. The global behaviour was determined by non-linear static analyses and the effects of some relevant modelling options were considered; in particular, parametric analyses were carried out taking into account the strength capacity of spandrel beams and the influence of the degree of connection between walls. The local behaviour was determined with limit non-linear kinematic analysis. The seismic performance-based assessment was set by the comparison of the structural capacity, with reference to various limit states (as proposed in Eurocode 8), with the seismic demand for Lisbon, related to different return periods.

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{building}} stock in seismic-prone areas worldwide are masonry structures that have been designed without seismic design considerations. Proper seismic assessment of such structures is quite a challenge, particularly so if their response well into the inelastic range, up to local or global failure, has to be predicted, as typically required in fragility analysis. A critical issue in this respect is the absence of rigid diaphragm action (due to the presence of relatively <b>flexible</b> <b>floors),</b> which renders particularly cumbersome the application of popular and convenient nonlinear analysis methods like the static pushover analysis. These issues are addressed in this paper that focusses on a masonry building representative of Southern European practice, which is analysed in both its pristine condition and after applying retrofitting schemes typical of those implemented in pre-earthquake strengthening programmes. Nonlinear behaviour is evaluated using dynamic response-history analysis, which is found to be more effective and even easier to apply in this type of building wherein critical modes are of a local nature, due to the absence of diaphragm action. Fragility curves are then derived for both the initial and the strengthened building, exploring alternative definitions of seismic damage states, including some proposals originating from recent international research programmes...|$|R
