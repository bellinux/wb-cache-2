5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas were predominantly rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster. Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation. Preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities {{were linked to}} the hurricane <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly, including one during evacuations. Total damage {{was estimated to be}} in excess of 5.4billion pesos (US$323.3million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses. Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US$52.5million in damage across Southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly elected head of state.|$|E

In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.|$|E

Approximately 44% of the population was covered <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly through an employer.|$|E
5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal.

5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly.

The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
