5|$|Development of The Lion King {{began in}} 1988 {{during a meeting}} between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider while {{promoting}} Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas <b>Disch</b> wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical {{and was replaced by}} Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence.|$|E

25|$|Early {{production}} of The Lion King began in late 1988, {{with the film}} originally being titled King of the Kalahari and later King of the Jungle. The treatment, inspired by Hamlet, was written by Thomas M. <b>Disch</b> (author of The Brave Little Toaster) as work-for-hire; <b>Disch</b> received no credit or royalties. Production {{took place at the}} Walt Disney Animation Studios in Glendale, California. Also, nearly 20 minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios. Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.|$|E
25|$|Along with Dana Gioia, Tom <b>Disch,</b> Charles Martin, and others, Bawer {{was one of}} {{the leading}} figures of the New Formalism {{movement}} in poetry.

25|$|For instance, Romansh is {{the only}} Romance {{language}} in which indirect speech is formed using the subjunctive mood, as in Sursilvan El di ch'el seigi malsauns, Putèr El <b>disch</b> ch'el saja amalo, 'He {{says that he is}} sick', as compared to Italian Dice che è malato or French Il dit qu'il est malade. Ricarda Liver attributes this to the influence of German. Limited to Sursilvan is the insertion of entire phrases between auxiliary verbs and participles as in Cun Mariano Tschuor ha Augustin Beeli discurriu 'Mariano Tschuor has spoken with Augustin Beeli' as compared to Engadinese Cun Rudolf Gasser ha discurrü Gion Peider Mischol 'Rudolf Gasser has spoken with Gion Peider Mischol'.|$|E

5000|$|In 1964, Playboy {{magazine}} approached several {{science fiction}} writers to create short-short stories {{based on a}} photograph of a clay head without ears. The selected stories — Arthur C.

500|$|Many writers {{now found}} New Worlds to be {{a market in}} which they could publish {{experimental}} material. Charles Platt, David I. Masson, and Barrington Bayley were among the British writers in this group, and Moorcock also attracted work from US writers such as John Sladek, Roger Zelazny and Thomas M. <b>Disch.</b> [...] Zelazny's contributions included [...] "For a Breath I Tarry" [...] in March 1966, and <b>Disch</b> published several short stories and the novel Echo Round His Bones, which was serialized starting in the December 1966 and January 1967 issues. [...] <b>Disch</b> commented that he had been unable to find a publisher for the novel in the US.|$|E
500|$|While [...] "The Last of the Masters" [...] {{was little}} {{noticed in the}} years {{immediately}} following its publication, it was reviewed after its 1980 publication in The Golden Man collection. Fellow science fiction writer Thomas M. <b>Disch</b> reviewed Dick's The Golden Man collection among other works in [...] "Fluff and Fizzles", an essay dated to 1979, but published in a 1980 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. While celebrating several stories in the collection, and proclaiming to readers the [...] "categorical imperative" [...] of buying a copy, he nonetheless derided most of its contents as [...] "turkeys", citing specifically [...] "The Last of the Masters" [...] as an example. Referring to the story as [...] "a hyperkinetic foray into hairy-chested-style hugger-mugger", <b>Disch</b> also mocked its [...] "action-packed denouement" [...] involving Edward Tolby as an example of [...] "bogus machismo".|$|E
500|$|Other {{big name}} SF authors {{approached}} LGBT themes in individual works: In Time Enough for Love (1973) by Robert A. Heinlein, {{the main character}} argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex {{for the purpose of}} procreation remains held as the ideal. The female bisexuality in Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a [...] "wrongness" [...] deserving pity. Heinlein's use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled [...] "The Embarrassments of Science Fiction" [...] by SF writer Thomas <b>Disch.</b> <b>Disch</b> was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel On Wings of Song (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his mosaic novel 334, gay people are referred to as [...] "republicans" [...] in contrast to the straight [...] "democrats". However, he did not try to write to a particular community: [...] "I'm gay myself, but I don't write 'gay' literature." ...|$|E
5000|$|Published in {{the summer}} of 1984 and marketed by Harper & Row as an {{entertaining}} summer read, The Businessman was favorably reviewed by Time and Newsweek, among other periodicals, although Marion Zimmer Bradley disliked it. [...] It failed to sell well, and there was no paperback edition until <b>Disch's</b> next novel, The M.D.: A Horror Story (1991), became a bestseller.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Reese {{illustrated}} Thomas <b>Disch's</b> [...] "The Roaches" [...] for {{the black-and-white}} horror-comics magazine Monsters Unleashed, published by Marvel's Curtis Magazines imprint, {{and the following}} year, he continued {{in a similar vein}} with art for Gerry Conway's story, [...] "The Rats" [...] in Haunt of Horror. With these two stories, featuring extreme close-up drawings of roaches and rats, Reese depicted horror lurking in real-life vermin, and both stories had several reprints.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being a text adventure, the game's major innovation was simulating life in Manhattan. <b>Disch's</b> model covered every block and street corner south of 110th Street. A hard-copy map of the streets and subways of Manhattan was included in the packaging. Players moved from place to place on foot, and had to reach destinations at the correct time of day to initiate plot developments. Stores opened and closed at the correct times, street lights went on, and other aspects of New York City life were simulated. Almost 4000 separate Manhattan locations, including 650 streets, were part of the game. In this aspect, along with the player's freedom of movement (most of the time), Amnesia {{can be seen as a}} forerunner of the sandbox game.|$|R
500|$|When Moorcock {{took over}} {{publication}} of New Worlds from Roberts & Vinter {{he changed the}} format from digest to a larger size with good quality paper that allowed better use of artwork. [...] The first issue in this format, July 1967, contained part one of Disch's Camp Concentration, a novel which <b>Disch</b> {{had been unable to}} sell in the U.S. because of the explicitness of the language used by the protagonist. [...] <b>Disch</b> afterwards recalled that some of the experimental language in the book was written in the knowledge that New Worlds was available as a market for unconventional fiction. [...] Other new writers who appeared in the magazine include M. John Harrison and Robert Holdstock, both of whom appeared in the November 1968 issue. [...] The December 1968 issue included Samuel R. Delany's [...] "Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones", and Harlan Ellison's [...] "A Boy and His Dog" [...] appeared in April 1969; Ellison won a Nebula Award, and Delany both a Nebula and a Hugo, though {{it was not until the}} stories were reprinted in book form that they were widely noticed.|$|E
500|$|In September 1960 Amazing {{began to}} carry Sam Moskowitz's series of author profiles, which {{had begun in}} Fantastic, the sister magazine. The {{following}} month the cover and logo were redesigned. In April 1961, the 35th anniversary of the first issue, Goldsmith ran several reprints, including stories by Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, {{rather than trying to}} conform to a notion of what science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time. She published the first stories of Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, Piers Anthony and Thomas M. <b>Disch,</b> among many others. Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith's editorship include Zelazny's [...] "He Who Shapes", a story about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a Nebula Award, an annual award voted on by science fiction writers. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that [...] "Most of anything I have learned was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections". <b>Disch</b> and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith's tastes {{were too}} diverse for Fantastic {{to be limited}} to genre fantasy, however, and her {{willingness}} to buy fiction she liked, regardless of genre expectations, allowed many new writers to flourish on the pages of both Amazing and Fantastic. [...] Writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny and Thomas M. <b>Disch</b> sold regularly to her at the start of their careers [...] Le Guin later commented that Goldsmith was [...] "as enterprising and perceptive an editor as the science fiction magazines ever had". [...] Not all Goldsmith's choices were universally popular with the magazine's subscribers: she regularly published fiction by David R. Bunch, for example, to mixed reviews from the readership.|$|E
5000|$|A {{review in}} Computer Gaming World {{described}} {{the game as}} being [...] "too much like a novel", giving as example the need {{to answer the phone}} in the hotel room. The review also noted the main character would collapse after an unrealistically short amount of time if he didn't eat or sleep frequently. Another writer for the magazine, however, called Amnesia [...] "a brilliant, witty, and intriguing story", and stated that [...] "the text is so rich and the story so interesting that one hardly notices that this is probably the least interactive piece of interactive fiction ever made". Compute! stated that the combination of <b>Disch's</b> writing and Electronic Arts' software [...] "makes Amnesia a text adventure well worth exploring".|$|R
5000|$|The Genocides was {{positively}} received. Brian W. Aldiss singled {{it out for}} praise in a long review in SF Impulse, noting in particular that <b>Disch's</b> treatment of the Plants as [...] "majestic indeed [...] [...] [...] as credible a menace as I ever came on." [...] Algis Budrys, noting sharply divided opinion in the sf community over its merits, concluded that The Genocides, [...] "in being so unflaggingly derivative of an emerging mode sf, regarding human significance, and in having been effective nevertheless {{to have so much}} good opinion behind it, [...] [...] [...] demonstrates the vitality and strength of that mode {{whether you like it or}} not."The novel was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1965, but did not receive one.|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1957, he worked a summer job as a trainee steel draftsman, {{just one of the many}} jobs on his path to {{becoming}} a writer. Saving enough to move to New York City at the age of 17, he found a Manhattan apartment and began to cast his energies in many directions. He worked as an extra at the Metropolitan Opera House in productions of Spartacus for the Bolshoi Ballet, Swan Lake for the Royal Ballet, and Don Giovanni, Tosca and others for the Met. He found work at a bookstore, then at a newspaper. At the age of 18, a penniless, friendless, gay teenager, he attempted suicide by gas oven, but survived. [...] Later that year, he enlisted in the army. <b>Dischs</b> incompatibility with the armed forces quickly resulted in a nearly three-month commitment to a mental hospital.|$|R
500|$|After Wrzos's departure, Harrison and Malzberg {{had little}} {{opportunity}} {{to reshape the}} magazine as between them they only took responsibility {{for a handful of}} issues before Ted White took over. [...] However, Harrison did print James Tiptree's first sale, [...] "Fault", in the August 1968 issue; again the slow schedule meant that this was not Tiptree's first appearance in print. [...] Harrison added a science column by Leon Stover, but was unable to change Cohen's position on the reprints, and so could not print much new fiction. [...] When Malzberg took over from Harrison he published John Sladek, Thomas M. <b>Disch,</b> and James Sallis, all of whom were associated with New Wave science fiction, but his tenure was too short for him to {{have a significant impact on}} the magazine.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the artists}} who had {{provided}} covers for early issues of F, including Chesley Bonestell, Ed Emshwiller, and Alex Schomburg, were still contributing their work into the late 1970s, {{and many of the}} regular writers from the early years, such as Reginald Bretnor, Ron Goulart, and Hilbert Schenck, continued to appear in F into the 1980s. [...] A newer group, including Joanna Russ and R.A. Lafferty, had become regulars more recently. [...] Some established writers such as Thomas <b>Disch</b> published their more unusual work in F, and there were also writers such as Felix C. Gotschalk, whose unusual stories were described by Ferman as [...] "a step ahead of most SF writers (or perhaps he's marching in a different direction)". [...] In Ashley's opinion, Ferman managed to [...] "balance the work of these eccentric writers so that they never distorted the contents yet kept the magazine on the edge".|$|E
500|$|New Worlds was {{acquired}} by Roberts & Vinter in 1964, when Michael Moorcock became editor. By the end of 1966 financial problems led Roberts & Vinter to abandon New Worlds, but {{with the aid of}} an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss, Moorcock was able to publish the magazine independently. He featured a good deal of experimental and avant-garde material, and New Worlds became the focus of the [...] "New Wave" [...] of science fiction. Reaction among the science fiction community was mixed, with partisans and opponents of the New Wave debating the merits of New Worlds in the columns of critical journals such as Speculation. Several of the regular contributors during this period, including Brian Aldiss, J. G. Ballard and Thomas M. <b>Disch,</b> became major names in the field. By 1970 Moorcock was too deeply in debt to be able to continue with the magazine, and it ceased publication with issue 200. The title has been revived multiple times, with Moorcock's direct involvement or approval; as of 2012, 22 additional issues have appeared in various formats, including several anthologies.|$|E
5000|$|Many modern {{writers of}} horror (or indeed {{other types of}} fiction) exhibit {{considerable}} Gothic sensibilities—examples include the works of Anne Rice, Stella Coulson, Susan Hill, Poppy Z. Brite and Neil Gaiman {{as well as some}} of the sensationalist works of Stephen King Thomas M. <b>Disch's</b> novel The Priest (1994) was subtitledA Gothic Romance, and was partly modelled on Matthew Lewis' The Monk. [...] The Romantic strand of Gothic was taken up in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938) which is considered by some to be in many respects a reworking of Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre. Other books by du Maurier, such as Jamaica Inn (1936), also display Gothic tendencies. Du Maurier's work inspired a substantial body of [...] "female Gothics", concerning heroines alternately swooning over or being terrified by scowling Byronic men in possession of acres of prime real estate and the appertaining droit du seigneur.|$|R
5000|$|The Brave Little Toaster was {{followed}} by two sequels a decade later: The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue (1999) and The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars (1998). The former {{is based on the}} sequel to <b>Disch's</b> novella while the latter is a brand new story. While reuniting most of the cast, they had a new director and crew, and were released out of chronological order. Rees noted that the original film was made out of pure love and not thought of as a kid's film or a product, and that he had heard the new approach was a more commercial venture. Deanna Oliver felt that despite Ramirez being a talented director who handled the franchise with care, instead of [...] "film" [...] and [...] "character driven", the project seemed more about getting it done because it could be made. Neither Rees nor Oliver have watched the finished sequels. Waterman Entertainment is currently {{in the process of developing}} a remake.|$|R

500|$|Gernsback's initial {{editorial}} {{approach was}} to blend instruction with entertainment; he believed science fiction could educate readers. His audience rapidly showed {{a preference for}} implausible adventures, however, and the movement away from Gernsback's idealism accelerated when the magazine changed hands in 1929. Despite this, Gernsback had {{an enormous impact on}} the field: the creation of a specialist magazine for science fiction spawned an entire genre publishing industry. The letter columns in Amazing, where fans could make contact with each other, {{led to the formation of}} science fiction fandom, which in turn had a strong influence on the development of the field. Writers whose first story was published in the magazine include John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Howard Fast, Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, and Thomas M. <b>Disch.</b> Overall, though, Amazing itself was rarely an influential magazine within the genre after the 1920s. Some critics have commented that by [...] "ghettoizing" [...] science fiction, Gernsback in fact did harm to its literary growth, but this viewpoint has been countered by the argument that science fiction needed an independent market to develop in to reach its potential.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began {{to reflect the}} changes {{prompted}} by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. [...] Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called [...] "the New Wave," [...] a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in [...] "inner space" [...] instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential New Worlds), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace. The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s. In the 1970s, lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. <b>Disch</b> and Samuel R. Delany.|$|E

40|$|To give {{future generations}} {{the ability to}} meet their own needs, our built {{environment}} needs to excel rather than endure. The need for continual improvement calls for fewer passive houses and more active houses - buildings that adopt a responsible and sustainable attitude as not just zero energy consumers but net energy producers, reaching a positive energy balance over time. Materiality is a fundamental element of such a discussion, and wood an obvious protagonist as a carbon store that substitutes for fossil fuel-intensive alternatives such as steel and concrete. Prefabricated timber claddings can be treated or finished or furnished or devised with different products and features that assist with turning the building into a net energy producer, and aligning the study with Rolf <b>Disch's</b> concept of the PlusEnergy solar house allows for a conceptual toolbox of sustainability objectives that can be translated into our innovative wooden cladding systems.

500|$|At the World Science Fiction Convention in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several {{well-known}} {{writers to}} appear in an [...] "all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of 'sacrifice. The issue in question {{was the first one}} under the new title of Impulse, in March 1966; it included fiction by James Blish, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, and Keith Roberts, who contributed [...] "The Signaller", the first story in his Pavane sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another Pavane story and a short story by John Brunner from his [...] "Traveller in Black" [...] series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley's opinion, the twelve issues of Impulse contained [...] "some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines". Christopher Priest's first story, [...] "The Run", appeared in the May 1966 issue, and Chris Boyce's second story, [...] "George", was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in Impulse, both well-received: Harry Harrison's Make Room! Make Room! (later made into the movie Soylent Green), and Moorcock's The Ice Schooner. Other notable stories listed by Ashley include Thomas <b>Disch's</b> [...] "The Roaches" [...] and [...] "The Number You Have Just Reached", and Aldiss's [...] "The Eyes of the Blind King". Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.|$|R
500|$|The Lion King {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1988. The film was eventually pitched to Disney executives, {{one of whom}} {{was among the first to}} observe similarities between author Thomas M. <b>Disch's</b> treatment and William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. Although first citing these similarities as initially unintentional, director Rob Minkoff always felt that it was essential [...] "to anchor [...] with something familiar". As directors, Minkoff and Roger Allers aspired to create [...] "an animal picture based in a more natural setting," [...] describing the film as [...] "More true-life adventure than mythical epic." [...] Although not the first Disney film to have been inspired by Shakespeare's work, The Lion King remains the studio's most prominent example due to close parallels between its characters and Hamlet, while both stories revolve around main characters who struggle to come to terms with the reality that they must confront their treacherous uncles and avenge their fathers' deaths. Scar is based on King Claudius, the antagonist of Hamlet. According to Slate, while Claudius is mostly [...] "a second-rate schemer... consumed by anxiety and guilt," [...] Scar very much [...] "delight in his monstrosity;" [...] both characters are motivated by jealousy. Meanwhile, The Week observed that although both characters ultimately die, Claudius is killed by protagonist Hamlet while Scar dies [...] "at the hand of his former hyena minions, and not Simba himself." [...] Additionally, the character shares similarities with Iago from Shakespeare's play Othello; both antagonists are skilled in exploiting their victims' fears.|$|R
