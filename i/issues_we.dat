It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E

500|$|Cold Feets {{cast and}} crew were {{frequently}} praised for their depiction of real-life social issues on the series.

[...] The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives; in the left-wing New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to La Ronde and, despite the sex-talk, being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce". The right-wing tabloid Daily Mails critic wrote that the episode [...] "veered a little too close last night towards the category of 'adult entertainment', with all its connotations of sleaze and smut" [...] and [...] "we found ourselves immersed in their sex lives on a level of embarrassing intimacy which most people would share only with their doctor". A complaint was made by a viewer to the Independent Television Commission—the commercial television regulator—about the depiction of sex, but it was not upheld.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six <b>issues.</b> <b>We</b> were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E

Based on a coupled hidden Markov chain, the transition graph is trained with example motions. For the last <b>issue,</b> <b>we</b> propose a scheme for synthesizing a novel sequence of coupled movements guided by the transition graph.

2500|$|Doubts {{have been}} cast by some experts from US or Israeli-affiliated think tanks {{on either the}} {{existence}} of fatwa, its authenticity, impact, or whether only political statements that lack the authority of a religiously binding fatwa have been made. James Risen of The New York Times noted that Khamenei said “that {{it was a mistake}} for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya to give up his nuclear weapons program.” Some analysts raised the possibility that Khamenei might be lying, utilizing taqiyya, or religious dissembling. In 2015, an open letter to then president Barack Obama posted on Iranian.com, reportedly from a nephew of Ali Khamenei, stated that Khamenei is practicing the Shia doctrine of taqiya with regard to the fatwa. On November 1, 2015, The Jerusalem Post also noted that the fatwa came after the period when President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani admitted the nuclear option was explored, referring to the interview. However afterwards, according to the Iranian nuclear hope website, where Rafsanjani's interview was initially published, it was [...] "skewed by Zionist media," [...] and Rafsanjani said: [...] "there was no reason to go toward the military aspect of nuclear <b>issues,</b> <b>we</b> did not want to build nuclear weapons." ...|$|E

Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I look at it that way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field <b>issues</b> <b>we</b> are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles."

60|$|To {{go back to}} {{the point}} of the registers, some may be shocked at the idea of a {{religious}} register at all, a register framed on the principle of religious belief. We may wish--we do wish--that it were otherwise. We hope that time, with careful and impartial statesmanship, will make things otherwise. Only let us not forget that the difference between Mahomedanism and Hinduism is not a mere difference of articles of religious faith or dogma. It is a difference in life, in tradition, in history, in all the social things as well as articles of belief, that constitute a community.
