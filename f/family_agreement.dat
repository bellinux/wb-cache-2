To {{the world at}} large he was Lord Hampstead,--to his friends in general he was Hampstead; to his stepmother he was especially Hampstead,--as would have been her own eldest son the moment he was born had he been born to such good luck. To his father he had become Hampstead lately. In early days there had been some secret <b>family</b> <b>agreement</b> that in spite of conventionalities he should be John among them. The Marquis had latterly suggested that increasing years made this foolish; but the son himself attributed the change to step-maternal influences. But still he was John to his sister, and John to some half-dozen sympathising friends,--and among others to the Post Office clerk.|$|E

40|$|A family {{business}} {{is comprised of}} two or more interlinking systems that determine its performance (McCollum, 1988). Using a sample of 632 small {{family business}}es, this thesis investigated the relationship between conflict factors (family, interrole, work, and couple) to the proposed proxy of balance between the family and the business: a <b>family</b> business <b>agreement.</b> A variable that had a positive impact on a <b>family</b> business <b>agreement</b> was total experience of the business owner. Further, three variables increased the probability of having a family business agreement: separation of family and family business, perception that family comes first, and conflict that arises when decisions are in favor of the family versus the family business. The variable that had a negative impact on a <b>family</b> business <b>agreement</b> was division of ownership. Moreover, tension due to unresolved conflict decreased the probability of having a <b>family</b> business <b>agreement.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Muhammad bin Abdulaziz was Crown Prince {{during the}} first few months (November 1964 - March 1965) of the reign of his elder {{half-brother}} King Faisal. He then voluntarily stepped aside from the succession to allow his younger and only full brother, Prince Khalid, to become heir apparent to the Saudi throne. Due to this event, he was called king maker. He is said to have stepped aside in order to comply with a general <b>family</b> <b>agreement.</b> That agreement had been negotiated during the period of internal crisis which saw the abdication, in late 1964, of the profligate King Saud, in favour of another half-brother, King Faisal. Prince Muhammad's renunciation, therefore, helped to defuse that crisis and facilitated the takeover of power by King Faisal.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 Chambord was sequestered by the French {{government}} as alien property, since Elias held a commission in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Liquidation proceedings were started in 1919 in {{application of the}} Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which gave the Allies {{the right to keep}} such property. Elias' half-brothers, Sixtus and Xavier took Elias to court to obtain a greater share of their father's estate. They claimed that the 1910 <b>family</b> <b>agreement</b> violated the French law which mandated equal division between siblings. In 1925 the French courts determined that Sixtus and Xavier should have a larger share, but in 1928 this judgement was overturned on appeal. In 1932 the court of cassation upheld the appeal on the grounds that there was a valid agreement between the siblings to an unequal division. Elias' rights to the château de Chambord were thereby recognised - but the wartime confiscation was upheld and Elias was financially compensated with 11 million francs.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the number of multicultural persons in the United States (Hardy 2 ̆ 6 Laszloffy, 1992), there is relatively little research with multicultural families in the family therapy literature. A related problem has been the underutilization of family therapy among multicultural families. ^ There are four aspects to the present study: (1) to determine if the factor structure of the Family Functioning Scale (FFS) obtained in previous studies using non-minority families is replicated on a multicultural sample; (2) to determine if there are any differences on the FFS subscales between a multicultural and non-multicultural sample; (3) to determine if within-family agreement on the FFS can be replicated on a multicultural sample; and (4) to examine attitudes toward family counseling/therapy among multicultural families. ^ Results indicated that construct validity of the FFS was demonstrated insofar as the general component structure of the FFS was replicated using a multicultural sample. When compared to a previous sample of non-minority subjects, the present sample differed on the FFS in a number of understandable ways. The sample of non-minority triads scored higher on the following scales: Family Rituals, Communication, and Positive Family Affect. The multicultural sample scored higher on the Worries subscale. The two samples did not differ on the Conflict subscale. ^ A replication of a previous study (Lubiner, 1989) which found high within-family agreement on the FFS using a non-minority sample yielded similar results for the present sample. Although multivariate analyses showed significant differences on family members 2 ̆ 7 scores due to gender and generation, there were high levels of within <b>family</b> <b>agreement</b> for multicultural populations. Thus, one family member can adequately represent family consensus on the FFS. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 Attitudes Toward Family Counseling Questionnaire 2 ̆ 2 qualitatively explored possible obstacles to seeking treatment.

40|$|Family {{businesses}} have acquired {{a very specific}} gravity in the economy of occidental countries, generating most of the employment and the richness for the last ages. In Spain Family Businesses represent the 65 % about the total of enterprises with 1, 5 million companies. They give employment to 8 million people, the 80 % of the private employment and develop the 65 % of the Spanish GNP (Gross National Product). Otherwise, the family business needs a complete law regulation that gives satisfaction to their own necessities and challenges. These companies {{have to deal with}} national or international economic scene to assure their permanency and competitiveness. In fact, the statistics about family companies have a medium life of 35 years. European family businesses success their successor process between a 10 and 25 %. Itâs said: first generation makes, second generation stays, third generation distributes. In that sense, the Recommendation of the European Commission of December 7 Âº 1994 about the succession of the small and medium companies has reformed European internal orders according to make easier successor process and to introduce practices of family companiesâ good government.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Oregon {{residents}} with a terminal illness {{have had the}} option to use aid-in-dying under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act (DWDA) since 1997. The DWDA allows terminally ill Oregonians to make a request for lethal dosages of medication, prescribed by physicians {{for the purpose of}} self-administering to end one's life. Many studies have been published on patient motivations for seeking hastened death, experiences of physicians, nurses, and hospice workers with persons who have died using aid-in-dying, and attitudes of the general public, medically ill persons, and healthcare professionals toward aid-in-dying, yet virtually no research has explored the experience of family members who have had a relative seek or use aid-in-dying. This qualitative study explored the bereavement experiences of persons who had a family member die using aid-in-dying during the past three years. Twenty-two participants were interviewed about their bereavement experiences using a structured interview. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Grounded Theory methods. Themes that emerged from the data revealed that aid-in-dying allows for the opportunity to say goodbye to one's loved one, and to plan and prepare for the death. Grief was eased by knowing that aid-in-dying was the loved one's choice, that the mode of death was legal, and that love ones avoided prolonged suffering. Personal and <b>family</b> <b>agreement</b> with loved ones decision to use aid-in-dying also eased grief. Conflict arose from mixed feelings or disagreement with loved ones decision to use aid-in-dying. Grief reconciliation from conflict included expressing feelings to others, religious support for aid-in-dying, thoughts that the loved one's death was imminent, thoughts that using aid-in-dying was what the loved one wanted, and thoughts that the timing was appropriate because had loved one's health further declined they may have risked being able to meet the law's requirement to self-administer the prescription and {{would not have been able}} to die using aid-in-dying...|$|E

40|$|VCR {{ownership}} {{is growing at}} a fast pace in the US, yet {{little is known about}} its impact upon the family. The impact of the VCR may be analyzed in terms of three interrelated aspects of family life, decision making, normative development and media choices. Believing that VCR 2 ̆ 7 s impact upon the family might vary according to status, role, sex, age and education of its members, a random telephone survey of parents and children in the City of Ames, Iowa, was designed to measure the differences of parent and child perceptions and their agreement of disagreement {{about the impact of the}} VCR upon family decisions, rules and choices. The resulting data were treated in four ways: firstly, a global view of parent 2 ̆ 7 s and children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions was obtained through summary statistics; secondly, variables were crosstabulated, controlling for status, sex and grade in order to make comparisons between classes; thirdly, paired parent/child responses were crosstabulated to determine how much agreement there was in families; fourthly, associations between decision making, normative development and media choice variables were tested. Relationships between parents 2 ̆ 7 and childrens 2 ̆ 7 perceptions were tested by means of Pearson correlation coefficients and the Lambda statistic; agreement between parent/child pairs was tested by means of Scheaffer 2 ̆ 7 s confidence interval formula and Dale 2 ̆ 7 s agreement scale. Associations between decision making, normative development and media choice variable were tested with Pearson correlations, chi-square tests and the gamma statistic. Analysis shows that parents 2 ̆ 7 and childrens 2 ̆ 7 perceptions are often polarized and vary according to different aspects of decision making, normative development and media choices within the <b>family.</b> <b>Agreement</b> between paired parents and children also varies in strength according to decisions, rules and choices. What similarities and agreements there are, are most evident in media choices but less so in decision making and normative development. Though many families have developed norms of television use, the use of the VCR is either subsumed under them or free of regulation in most families. Analysis of data outlined above has been strongly influenced by the insights of coorientation and convergence theory. Perspectives of exchange theory and field theory have been used to discuss the implications of the research findings...|$|E
