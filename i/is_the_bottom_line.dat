He did not discuss in any detail the difference between distributed and undistributed profit, or tax requirements, and how this might affect profit statements. His discussion was limited to physical capital and labour employed, abstracting from ancillary costs and incomes unrelated to production which enterprises usually have (including tax imposts and subsidies), asset transactions, and changes in market prices.|$|E

After a 42-13 homecoming loss to Missouri, some Gator fans called for Muschamp {{to be fired}} immediately. However, Foley refused {{to do so and}} allowed Muschamp to coach the annual Florida-Georgia football game. Florida, a 10-point underdog came in starting true freshman Treon Harris with throwing the ball only six times the Gators compiled 428 yards rushing to upset the 11th ranked Bulldogs 38-20. However, after a 23-20 overtime home loss to South Carolina 2 weeks later on November 16, 2014, Foley announced that Muschamp would be stepping down following the conclusion of the 2014 regular season, citing the season's high number of losses. Muschamp remarked, [...] "I was given every opportunity to get it done here and I simply didn't win enough games—that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b> I'm disappointed that I didn't get it done and it is my responsibility to get it done." ...|$|E

Jeffrey is resistant at first, but after Celeste gives him {{advice on how to}} approach her and break the ice, the conversation leads to Celeste and Jeffrey embracing. Just when it seems the two are about to reconcile, Montana interrupts them and claims that she and Jeffrey slept together the previous night. Disgusted, Celeste storms off, leaving the situation between her and Jeffrey even worse than before. The dilemma is further inflamed when Rose—who by now is no longer angry with Celeste—shows her a tabloid newspaper proclaiming that Montana is pregnant with Jeffrey's child. After an explosive exchange between the three of them takes place over this, Celeste, Jeffrey and Lori go {{to the head of the}} network with their concerns and demand that some action must be taken to solve the problem. But it's Lori who delivers an ultimatum stating, [...] "It's them or me--that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> here! They go or I go!" ...|$|E
5000|$|However, the Monkees {{had been}} {{complaining}} that the music publishing company would {{not allow them to}} play their own instruments on their records, or to use more of their own material. These complaints intensified when Kirshner moved track recording from California to New York, leaving the band out of the musical process until they were called upon to add their vocals to the completed tracks. This campaign eventually forced Kirshner to let the group have more participation in the recording process. Dolenz's initial reaction, mentioned in the 2006 Rhino CD reissue of More of the Monkees, was [...] "To me, these were the soundtrack albums to the show, and it wasn't my job. My job was to be an actor and to come in and to sing the stuff when I was asked to do so.

[...] Nesmith, when asked about the situation, in Rolling Stone magazine, said, [...] "[...] [...] We were confused, especially me. But all of us shared the desire to play the songs we were singing.

5000|$|Professor Robert S. Wistrich, {{head of the}} Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is the {{originator}} of Marcus's second view of anti-Zionism (that anti-Zionism and antisemitism merged post-1948) {{argues that}} much contemporary anti-Zionism, particularly forms that compare Zionism and Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich, has become a form of antisemitism:Anti-Zionism {{has become the most}} dangerous and effective form of anti-Semitism in our time, through its systematic delegitimization, defamation, and demonization of Israel. Although not a priori anti-Semitic, the calls to dismantle the Jewish state, whether they come from Muslims, the Left, or the radical Right, increasingly rely on an anti-Semitic stereotypization of classic themes, such as the manipulative [...] "Jewish lobby", the Jewish/Zionist [...] "world conspiracy", and Jewish/Israeli [...] "warmongers".Nevertheless, I believe that the more radical forms of anti-Zionism that have emerged with renewed force in recent years do display unmistakable analogies to European anti-Semitism immediately preceding the Holocaust.... For example, [...] "anti-Zionists" [...] who insist on comparing Zionism and the Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich appear unmistakably to be de facto anti-Semites, even if they vehemently deny the fact! This is largely because they knowingly exploit the reality that Nazism in the postwar world has become the defining metaphor of absolute evil. For if Zionists are [...] "Nazis" [...] and if Sharon really is Hitler, then it becomes a moral obligation to wage war against Israel. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> of much contemporary anti-Zionism. In practice, this has become the most potent form of contemporary anti-Semitism.... Anti-Zionism is not only the historic heir of earlier forms of anti-Semitism. Today, it is also the lowest common denominator and the bridge between the Left, the Right, and the militant Muslims; between the elites (including the media) and the masses; between the churches and the mosques; between an increasingly anti-American Europe and an endemically anti-Western Arab-Muslim Middle East; a point of convergence between conservatives and radicals and a connecting link between fathers and sons.|$|E

30|$|In {{a broader}} policy context, the German success story {{over the last}} decade—i.e., the country’s remarkably quick turn from “the sick man of the Euro” into “Europe’s engine”—raises the {{question}} of what other countries can learn from this process.

For example, measures that increase the overall functioning of the labor market, e.g., only implementing ALMP measures that prove effective as well as improving the overall efficiency of public employment services, should be considered by other countries. However, one should resist the temptation of believing in a one-size-fits-all solution.

40|$|The {{fields of}} machine {{learning}} and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems {{lie at the}} heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semidefinite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning.
