50|$|In World War II, combat {{engineers}} used satchel {{charges to}} demolish heavy stationary targets such as rails, obstacles, blockhouses, bunkers, caves, and bridges. The World War II-era United States Army M37 <b>Demolition</b> <b>Kit</b> contained eight blocks of high explosive, with 2 priming assemblies, in a canvas {{bag with a}} shoulder strap. Part or all of this charge could be placed against a structure or slung into an opening. It was usually detonated with a pull igniter. When used as an anti-tank weapon, charges were sufficient to severely damage the tracks. 4 kg charges were enough to destroy medium tanks.|$|E
