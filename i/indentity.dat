40|$|It is {{important}} to know body measurement because it could be used to estimate body weight as well as to differentiate the chrateristic of body measurement and shape of animal due to different breed or environment. This research was carried out to study morphometric characteristic of body size and body shape from 78 of Garut sheep (GG), 29 HG sheep crossbred between St. Croix (HH) and Garut sheep (GG), 36 MG sheep crossbred between Mouton Charollais (MM) and Garut sheep (GG), 62 MHG sheep (MG x HG) and 38 HMG sheep (HG x MG). Body part measured were wither height (X 1), rump height (x 2), body length (X 3), chest width (X 4), chest depth (X 5), hip width (X 6), chest girth (X 7), cannon circumference (X 8) and hip length (X 9). Data obeserved were analised using t test and Principle Components Analysis (PCA). Based on PCA it was showen that chest girth was the primary identity for body measurement on males and females of Garut, HG, MG, MHG and HMG with its Eigenvector value 0. 689; 0. 709; 0. 689 and 0. 681 respectively. The primary <b>indentity</b> for body shape of Garut sheep were chest girth and hip heigth with Eigenvector value - 0. 600 and 0. 551 respectively. The primary <b>indentity</b> for body shape of HG sheep were body length with Eigenvector value - 0. 725. The primary <b>indentity</b> for body shape of MG sheep were chest girth, rump heigth, and wither heigth with Eigenvectors value: - 0. 600; 0. 558 and 0. 555 respectively. The primary <b>indentity</b> for body shape of MHG sheep was wither height with Eigenvector value 0. 608. The primary <b>indentity</b> for body shape of HMG was body length with Eigenvector value 0. 764. Body shape of HG and MG sheep is different than that of Garut sheep, but the body shape of MHG and HMG were close to Garut body shape. This result indicated that the adaptability to environment of HMG and MHG is close to that of Garut sheep. ...|$|E

The male partner of 1 in 10 couples tests positive for sperm bound antibodies with immunoglobulins of the IgG class being found in all patients and IgA to a lower extent.

CRISP 1 was shown to be involved in sperm-egg binding, as polyclonal anti-CRISP 1 antibodies blocked mouse ova fertilization in vitro. MVDP, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, was revealed to function in the detoxification of acrolein, a reactive aldehyde produced by the catabolism of the polyamines, spermine and spermidine, which are abundant in seminal plasma.

40|$|In {{ducted fan}} engine noise research, {{there is a}} need for {{defining}} a simple and easy to use acoustic energy conservation law to help in quantification of noise control techniques. There is a well known conservation law relating acoustic energy and acoustic energy flux in the case of an isentropic irrotational flow. Several different approaches have been taken to generalize this conservation law. For example, Morfey finds an identity by separating out the irrotational part of the perturbed flow. Myers is able to find a series of <b>indentities</b> by observing an algebraic relationship between the basic conservation of energy equation for a background flow and the underlying equations of motion. In an approximate sense, this algebraic relationship is preserved under perturbation. A third approach which seems to have not been pursued in the literature is a result known as Noether's theorem. There is a Lagrangian formulation for the Euler equation of fluid mechanics. Noether's theorem says that any group action that leaves the Lagrangian action invariant leads to a conserved quantity. This presentation will include a survey of current results regarding acoustic energy and preliminary results on the symmetries of the Lagrangian...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a program of}} research that investigated whether women's perceptions of intergroup conflict {{between men and women}} impact upon their interpersonal relationships with men. A series of three studies focus on two groups of women: women who perceive a high amount of gender-based discrimination and women who perceive relatively little gender-based discrimination. Unexpectedly, despite {{significant differences between the two}} groups in terms of their social <b>indentities</b> as women and their gender ideologies, there were no differences between them with respect to the nature and extent of their work, platonic, and intimate relationships with men. Two psychological mechanisms that may enable a woman to prevent perceptions of intergroup discrimination from impacting upon her intimate relationships are examined: the exceptional case and dissociative mechanisms. Although no support was found for the dissociative mechanism, strong support was found for the exceptional case mechanism. Women who perceive a high amount of discrimination, compared to those who perceived relatively little, are more likely to view their partners as exceptional in terms of their support of women's issues. Moreover, it was demonstrated in Study 3 that the male partners of these women are actually exceptional in terms of their support, as well as their negotiation, of women's issues...|$|R

According to symbolic interactionism the gender emerges by performative repetition (Butler 1993), which means that the wearing of certain style of clothing represents one of the ways by which gender is determined. On the other hand, it refuses the idea, that person would be able to attack the gender categories in subversive manner by himself. Feminity and masculinity represent cultural construct, which is nourished by the notion, that men and women have different innermost foundations, with what Butler fundamentally disagrees. The confusion of categories male/female is to great extent noticeable in fashion. The boundaries between female and male fashion are constantly crossed from both sides. Female and male joins together in androgynous fashion, which appears from the onset as possible escape from repressive power of regulative ideal, but it is questionable to what extent it is really hermaphrodite or gender-unloaded, and to what extent it follows the traditional [...] ...|$|R
