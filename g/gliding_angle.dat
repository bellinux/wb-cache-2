50|$|Five {{years later}} a version {{known as the}} IS-13a was flown. This had a metal wing of greater (16 m) span, giving it a much {{improved}} <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> of 35:1. It had a shorter fuselage than either the IS-12 or IS-13, but its method of construction is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The {{air flow}} into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest, so the frontmost ropes tow against the airflow. When gliding, however, the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow meets the parafoil head on. This makes it {{difficult}} to achieve an optimum <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> without the parafoil deflating.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of tests conducted in the N. A. C. A. full-scale wind tunnel on a Fairchild F- 22 airplane equipped with a special wing having split trailing-edge flaps. The flaps extended over the outer 90 percent of the wing span, and were of the fixed-hinge type having a width equal to 20 percent of the wing chord. The results show that with a flap setting of 59 degrees the maximum lift of the wing was increased 42 percent, and that the flaps increased the range of available <b>gliding</b> <b>angles</b> from 2. 7 degrees to 7. 0 degrees. Deflection of the split flaps did not increase the stalling angle or seriously affect the longitudinal balance of the airplane. With flaps down the landing speed of the airplane is decreased, but the calculated climb and level-flight performance is inferior to that with the normal wing. Calculations indicate that the take-off distance required to clear an obstacle 100 feet high is not affected by flap settings from 0 degrees to 20 degrees but is greatly increased by larger flap angles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Underwater gliders carried {{acoustic}} velocity meters can realize ocean profile {{observations of the}} {{acoustic velocity}} for long duration and large scale. This paper mainly studies the kinematics and hydrodynamics of the Slocum underwater glider carrying a acoustic velocity meter MINOS•X with length 565 mm and diameter 76 mm. Thus, theory reference for optimal design parameters of the underwater glider is proposed. By establishing the kinematic equations and giving some related parameters, variations with time of the steady-state <b>gliding</b> velocity, pitch <b>angle,</b> <b>gliding</b> path and attack angle are simulated by using Matlab software; The simulation calculations of the hydro-drag and lift are completed by using Fluent software.

40|$|Underwater gliders are novel {{underwater}} sensing platforms with mobility, controllability {{and long}} endurance {{that are essential}} for data collection for oceanographic research. In this paper, the basic gliding model of an underwater glider developed by the Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is established, and a class of control strategies are investigated. We first establish a motion model by studying the steady state gliding motion in the vertical motion plane based on Graver, 2005. We then compute the minimum <b>gliding</b> path <b>angle</b> and the maximum horizontal speed. To identify the fundamental motion parameters of the underwater glider such as the drag coefficients, we compute the hydrodynamic drag force, lift force and toque as functions of attacking angles using the CFX hydrodynamic computing software. Furthermore, we compute the optimal <b>gliding</b> path <b>angle</b> to achieve the maximum gliding range given battery capacity. We then propose a scheduling strategy to reduce energy consumption in sensors. This scheduling strategy automatically adjusts sampling frequency based on the profile data collected. We also propose two practical strategies that help the glider to cross strong steady flow. The first strategy aims for minimum time and the second aims for the shortest distance reaching the next waypoint, and real-time estimated current are used in both strategies.

5000|$|It {{may seem}} counter-intuitive, but pilots put water ballast into {{compartments}} {{in the wings}} to make their planes heavier. Modern gliders can take large quantities of water (a Nimbus-3 can hold 272 kg). The objective {{is to increase the}} gliding speed, while maintaining the same <b>gliding</b> <b>angle.</b> The downside is that the glider will climb more slowly in thermals. However in the right conditions, the time lost in climbing more slowly is more than recouped by the increased speed to the next thermal.|$|E
5000|$|German mooring methods {{differed}} significantly from those {{adopted by the}} British. To quote Pugsley (1981): [...] "the Germans, originally for ease of transport and for economy, developed a system using much lower masts. The nose of the ship was tethered as before to the mast head, which was only a little higher than the semi-diameter of the ship's hull. The lower fin at the stern was then fixed to a heavy carriage running on a circular railway track around the mast, and this carriage was powered {{so as to be}} able to move around the track to keep the ship head on to the wind. In the most sophisticated form, used by the Hindenburg, the rail system was linked to rails running from the mast straight into the airship shed, and the mast was powered so that the ship could be moved mechanically into the shed, complete with mast and stern carriage".The following account of landing the German airship Graf Zeppelin is abridged from Dick and Robinson (1985):Before attempting a landing, contact was made by radio or flag signals with the ground crew to determine the ground temperature and wind conditions. For a normal calm weather landing the ship was trimmed very slightly nose down, as this gave a better <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> and the ship almost flew herself down. A smoky fire was started on the ground to show the wind direction. The ship then made a long approach with a rate of fall of 100 feet per minute, and the lines were dropped when she was over the landing flag. When conditions were unusual, as in gusty and bumpy weather, the Graf was weighed off a little light, and the approach had to be fast and preferably long and low.When the airship was over the field the engines had to be reversed for some time to stop her, and this also helped to get the nose down. Yaw lines dropped from the ship's nose were drawn out to Port and Starboard by thirty men each, while twenty more on each side pulled the ship down with spider lines (so called because twenty short lines radiated like the legs of a spider from a block). When the airship reached the ground, fifty men held the control car rails and twenty held those of the after car. With thirty men in reserve, the ground crew totalled two hundred men.The ground crew would then walk the Graf to a short, or ‘stub’, mast, to which the nose of the airship would be attached. The airship would then rest on the ground with its rear gondola attached to a movable weighted carriage that enabled the airship to swing around the mast with the wind. In some places the stub mast was mounted on rails and could be drawn into the airship hangar, guiding the nose of the ship while the tail was controlled by the carriage attached to the rear gondola. Airships designed for landing on the ground had pneumatic bumper bags or undercarriage wheels under the main and rear gondolas (or tail fin).Dick states that the Germans never used mooring masts until the Graf Zeppelin entered service in 1928, and never moored to high masts. To some extent this probably reflects the conservatism of the Zeppelin company operations. Long experience in handling airships in all sorts of conditions was valued and innovations or significant changes in practice were unlikely to be adopted unless clear advantages were apparent.|$|E

The D. V. L. <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> control (design, Hubner) permits a local interruption of the lift distribution along the span and consequently an increased induced drag. The mechanism comprises two wing rudders operated by lever from the pilot's cockpit. Said rudders are fitted on the top side of the wing near the leading edge. The displacement of these rudders results in a separation of the air flow on the top side of the wing...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} maximum gliding range {{problems}} of subsonic unpowered gliding vehicles and proposes an approximate optimal maximum range guidance scheme. First, the <b>gliding</b> flight path <b>angle</b> corresponding to constant dynamic pressure is derived. A lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) {{inversely proportional to}} the dynamic pressure is then proven. On this basis, the calculation method of an optimal dynamic pressure (ODP) profile with a maximum L/D throughout the flight is presented. A guidance scheme for tracking the ODP profile, which uses the flight path angle as control variable, is then designed. The maximum ranges of the unpowered gliding vehicle obtained by the proposed guidance scheme and pseudospectral method are compared. Results show that the guidance scheme provides an accurate approximation of the optimal results, and the errors are less than 2 %. The proposed guidance scheme is easy to implement and is not influenced by wind compared with numerical schemes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cableway masts {{are often}} built in slopes exposed to snow pressure. In areas with large snow depths and low ground {{roughness}} the creeping and gliding snow cover can exert huge static loads (> 100 kN m- 1) {{on a narrow}} mast. Three case studies are examined where masts from cableways were completely destroyed by snow pressure forces. The snow pressure equations applied in practical use are explained and illustrated with examples. The equations {{are based on the}} snow pressure theory given in the Swiss guidelines for the design of snow supporting structures. The snow pressure depends mainly on the snow depth, snow density, slope <b>angle,</b> <b>gliding</b> factor and efficiency factor. The efficiency factor describes the ratio of the real snow pressure to that on an infinitely long plane. To prevent damage the mast can either be designed to the expected snow pressure or the gliding of the snow pack can be prevented by increasing the ground roughness by structural measures e. g. by narrowly spaced poles. Finally, we discuss possibilities for verifying and improving the presented design approach...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} factors in evaluating performance of gliders are minimum sinking speed and minimum <b>gliding</b> <b>angle.</b> To assure their optimum value the energy necessary for flight, that is, the energy of lift and friction must be kept very low, or in other words, weight and total drag which have a decisive effect on the sinking speed and on the <b>gliding</b> <b>angle,</b> must be kept to a minimum.

40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that the speed of underwater glider is the function of buoyancy and <b>gliding</b> <b>angle.</b> However, the buoyancy and <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> are adjustable, which makes the speed of underwater glider within an adjustable range, however, it is usually taken as a constant in current documentations. Considering the path planning in ocean currents, if the maximum speed of a glider can find a path that connects the start point and the target point, then it can decrease its consumption by adjusting its speed in current field of some regions to fit the favorable currents and overcome the influence of adverse currents. Based on the above facts, the paper presents a new path planning method of adjustable speed glider in currents, and the simulation result is shown. According to the result: compared with the path planning method in constant speed, the adjustable speed glider can utilize the current {{in a better way}} and save the consumption of energy in a further way.

40|$|Two {{manoeuvres}} in bats are described: rolls through 1800, in Nyctalus noctula, and {{a series}} of sideslips in Otomops martiensseni. These manoeuvres cause a rapid loss of height. They are initiated by pronation of one wing and supination of the other. After the roll, when the bat is in an upside down position, the lift force of the wings is directed downwards, causing a tight turn downwards (apparently for insect catching). During sideslip the body drag of the bat is increased. This reduces the total lift/drag ratio, thus steepening the equilibrium <b>gliding</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E

Like extant condors and vultures, Argentavis would have extracted energy from the atmosphere for flight, relying on thermals present on the Argentinean pampas to provide power for soaring, and it probably used slope soaring over the windward slopes of the Andes.

40|$|Underwater gliders are {{buoyancy}} propelled vehicle {{which make}} use of buoyancy for vertical movement and wings to propel the glider in forward direction. Autonomous underwater gliders are a patented technology and are manufactured and marketed by corporations. In this study, we validate the experimental lift and drag characteristics of a glider from the literature using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. This approach is then used {{for the assessment of}} the steady state characteristics of a laboratory glider designed at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Flow behaviour and lift and drag force distribution at different angles of attack are studied for Reynolds numbers varying from 105 to 106 for NACA 0012 wing configurations. The state variables of the glider are the velocity, <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> and angle of attack which are simulated by making use of the hydrodynamic drag and lift coefficients obtained from CFD. The effect of the variable buoyancy is examined in terms of the <b>gliding</b> <b>angle,</b> velocity and angle of attack. Laboratory model of glider is developed from the final design asserted by CFD. This model is used for determination of static and dynamic properties of an underwater glider which were validated against an equivalent CAD model and simulation results obtained from equations of motion of glider in vertical plane respectively. In the literature, only empirical approach has been adopted to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of the AUG that are required for its trajectory simulation. In this work, a CFD approach has been proposed to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients and validated with experimental data. A two-mass variable buoyancy engine has been designed and implemented. The equations of motion for this two-mass engine have been obtained by modifying the single mass version of the equations described in the literature. The objectives of the present study are to understand the glider dynamics adopting a CFD approach, fabricate the glider and its variable buoyancy engine and test its trajectory in water and compare it with numerically obtained trajectory in the vertical plane...|$|E
40|$|Hunting kestrels were {{observed}} to hang, almost without wing-flapping, in fixed positions over a sea dike. The height and position {{with respect to}} the dike profile, the wind direction and velocity and the percentage of hunting time without wing beating were recorded in 429 cases. The vertical wind angle, 6, the wind speed and its horizontal direction were measured at 13 heights up to 8. 8 m above the windward slope, the top and the leeward slope of the dike under various wind conditions in 225 cases. These wind profile measurements were used to estimate 6 and wind speed near the hanging birds. Kestrels hanging more than 90 % of the hunting time preferred a position 6. 5 ± 1. 5 m (S. D.) over the windward slope with sea winds blowing at 8. 7 ± 1. 5 ms~ 1 (S. D.) perpendicular (± 30 °) to the longitudinal dike axis. For these birds angle 6 was approximately 6 - 7 °. These angles are larger than expected from aerodynamic models and wind-tunnel measurements. The minimum <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> for a kestrel under steady conditions is estimated to be 5 °.

40|$|Tapejara wellnhoferi, a small azhdarchoid pterodactyloid {{from the}} Early Cretaceous Santana Formation of Brazil, {{provides}} critical {{information about the}} aerodynamic function of its spectacular head crest. The cranial crests in pterodactyloids were sexually dimorphic and {{are thought to have}} evolved in adult males in response to female mate choice. However, the location of cranial crests in front of the center of gravity would create instability in the yaw axis during flight and may seem like a handicap. Vertically aligned webbed feet probably suppressed the yawing rotations and instability from the crest. Here we show that the crest functioned as a front rudder to make agile turn and mediate flight control. A computer simulation model suggests that Tapejara had a large excess of muscle power available above the power required for continuous flapping flight. It could easily takeoff from a perch, ground, or water surface and land safely on the ground. It was an excellent glider with a <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> close to 40 and a cruising speed of 27 km/h. Tapejara could soar efficiently on the windward side of cliffs or circle on rising thermals over tropical waters for efficient long-distance flight.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of dynamic pressure behind a Harris ' hawk's wing was sampled using a wake rake consisting of 15 pitot tubes and one static tube. The hawk was {{holding on to}} a perch, but at an air speed and <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> at which it was capable of gliding. The perch was instrumented, so that the lift developed by the wing was known and the lift coefficient could be calculated. The mean of 92 estimates of profile drag coefficient was 0. 0207, with standard deviation 0. 0079. Lift coef-ficients ranged from 0. 51 to 1. 08. Reynolds numbers were nearly all in the range 143000 - 194000. The estimates of profile drag coefficient were reconcilable with previous estimates of the wing profile drag of the same bird, obtained by the subtractive method, and also with values predicted by the 'Airfoil-ii ' program for designing aerofoils, based on a digitized wing profile from the ulnar region of the wing. The thickness of the wake suggested that the boundary layer was mostly or fully turbulent in most observations and separated in some, possibly as an active means of creating drag for control purposes. It appears that the bird could momentarily either increase or decrease the profile drag of specific parts of the wing, by active changes of shape, and it appeared to use the carpo-metacarpal region especially for such control movements. Further investigation in a low-turbulence wind tunnel would help to resolve doubts about the possible influence of airstream turbulence on the behaviour of the boundary layer...|$|E
30|$|The {{formation}} of hybrid underwater gliders has advantages in sustained ocean observation with high resolution and more adaptation for complicated ocean tasks. However, the current work mostly {{focused on the}} traditional gliders and AUVs. The research on control strategy and energy consumption minimization for the hybrid gliders is necessary both in methodology and experiment. A multi-layer coordinate control strategy is developed for the fleet of hybrid underwater gliders to control the gliders’ motion and formation geometry with optimized energy consumption. The inner layer integrated in the onboard controller and the outer layer integrated in the ground control center or the deck controller are designed. A coordinate control model is proposed based on multibody theory through adoption of artificial potential fields. Considering the existence of ocean flow, a hybrid motion energy consumption model is constructed and an optimization method is designed to obtain the heading angle, net buoyancy, <b>gliding</b> <b>angle</b> and the rotate speed of screw propeller to minimize the motion energy with consideration of the ocean flow. The feasibility of the coordinate control system and motion optimization method has been verified both by simulation and sea trials. Simulation results show the regularity of energy consumption with the control variables. The fleet of three Petrel-II gliders developed by Tianjin University is deployed in the South China Sea. The trajectory error of each glider is less than 2.5  km, the formation shape error between each glider is less than 2  km, {{and the difference between}} actual energy consumption and the simulated energy consumption is less than 24 % actual energy. The results of simulation and the sea trial prove the feasibility of the proposed coordinate control strategy and energy optimization method. In conclusion, a coordinate control system and a motion optimization method is studied, which can be used for reference in theoretical research and practical fleet operation for both the traditional gliders and hybrid gliders.|$|E
