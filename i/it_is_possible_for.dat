5|$|In {{the acute}} phase of an attack, {{administration}} of potassium will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost {{but not quite}} species specific, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a few closely related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid, {{as long as the}} bees are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a {{particle}} to travel through a medium {{faster than the}} phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c).

40|$|Abstract: In this article, I {{address some}} of what I {{consider}} the inaccuracies and false assumptions {{in a recent article}} in this Journal entitled "Corroboration of the Dentures Anecdote Involving Veridical Perception in a Near-Death Experience" (Smit, 2008). I provide a medical explanation of how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the man reporting this remarkable NDE to have survived his period of cardiac arrest and how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> him to have undergone an NDE. More importantly, I discuss how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> this man to have undergone the truly unusual perceptions of feeling pain in his chest due to cardiac massage {{at the same time as}} his consciousness was displaced out of his body during an out-of-body experience...|$|R
5|$|Just as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> {{a circle}} to be {{surrounded}} by six congruent circles that touch it, it is also possible to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|Over {{longer periods}} of time, new series of transits will start and old series will end. Unlike the saros series for lunar eclipses, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a transit series to restart after a hiatus. The transit series also vary much more in length than the saros series.|$|E
5|$|With the {{differentiation}} {{of legal and}} physical custody, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a court to make separate determinations of whether to grant joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or both. In many states, the determination {{of whether or not}} to grant joint or sole custody is made separately for legal and physical custody.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award, the prize is {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one right fielder. It is also possible for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E

5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} {{that a variety of}} {{different}} coins were minted by Edmund's moneyers during his reign. The letters AN, standing for 'Anglia', only appear on the coins of Edmund and Æthelstan of East Anglia: they appear on Edmund's coins as part of the phrase + EADMUND REX AN. Later specimens read + EADMUND REX and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> his coins to be divided chronologically. Otherwise, no chronology for his coins has been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue that the need for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|E
