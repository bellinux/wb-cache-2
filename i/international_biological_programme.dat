40|$|The main {{activities}} in <b>international</b> <b>biological</b> standardization during the 18 {{years that followed}} the first <b>international</b> <b>biological</b> standardization meeting in London in 1921 were concerned with expressing the potencies of test preparations in comparison with reference materials.
