The researchers found that children learned from the shows, that the show's appeal was high, and that children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, they found that, although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered when there were only humans on screen. The producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused, and had recommended that human actors and Muppets not be shown together. As {{a result of this}} decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than they would have liked, so the show's producers knew they needed to make significant changes, including defying the recommendations of their advisers and show the human and Muppet characters together. Lesser called this decision [...] "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street". [...] Muppet creator Jim Henson and his coworkers created Muppets for Sesame Street that could interact with the human actors, and many segments were re-shot.|$|E

Results: the nutritional status of children attended <b>in</b> the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centers was better than children of the same community receiving other types of daily care (OR = 0. 48; CI 95 % = 0. 36 - 0. 65; P < 0. 0001), the improvement was related to more than 1 year of enrollment <b>in</b> the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> (OR = 0. 74; CI 95 % = 0. 57 - 0. 96; P = 0. 02).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{performance}} management <b>in</b> the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> area and its {{importance for the}} educators’ motivation. Performance management is widely used <b>in</b> the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> area and the theory points the possible negative consequences for the employees. Due to this fact {{we would like to}} examine how and why performance management in Lyngby-Taarbæk Kommune affects the educators’ motivation. We will examine the problem through qualitative interviews with 10 employees <b>in</b> three <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centres <b>in</b> our case Lyngby-Taarbæk Kommune. We find that the educators possess internal motivation, which is the joy of the work itself and a wish to benefit the common good. This internal motivation is supported overall by the performance management system even though the educators experience a lack of time. The explanation may be that the performance management system follows researcher Hans de Bruijn’s strategies for handling performance management, and that the educators see the management tools as targets, which are difficult but not unachievable and thereby seem motivating...|$|R
