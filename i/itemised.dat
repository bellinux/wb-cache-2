5|$|Three other towers {{still stand}} on the east, north and south sides of the inner bailey's curtain wall. Built in the mid-13th century, they each had three floors which were {{accessed}} through separate entrances on each level. Lighting was provided by arrow-slits, and the upper room in each tower, which {{was the only one}} to have a fireplace, was probably used as a lodging area. A latrine was also provided. Only the north tower is known to have been completed; however, its vaulted basement was mostly destroyed around 1317 when the roof and floors of the tower collapsed into it. It is not clear whether the south and east towers were ever completed. An estimate written in 1317 reveals that the towers were thatched, lacking castellations and a proper lead roof, but it is not known whether the work <b>itemised</b> in the estimate was ever carried out. The interiors of the towers were substantially modified in 1940.|$|E
25|$|In the 1720s, Peper Harow was {{the seat}} of Alan Brodrick, 1st Viscount Midleton who was succeeded by his son Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton in the viscountcy on 29 August 1728. Before succeeding, the latter made his mark as a cricket patron by {{arranging}} major matches against his friend Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond. Records have survived of two such games {{that took place in}} the 1727 season. These two games are highly significant because Richmond and Brodrick drew up Articles of Agreement beforehand to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. These were <b>itemised</b> in sixteen points. It is believed that this was the first time that rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. The first full codification of the Laws of Cricket was done in 1744.|$|E

Essentially the articles of agreement were around residential qualifications and ensuring that there was no dissent by any player other than the two captains.|$|E

500|$|In 2013 a Channel 4 {{documentary}} used forensic examiners who digitised {{the original}} nitrate film {{from the three}} cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag {{around the neck of}} a horse or attach it to the horse's bridle. A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian and author of a history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. Sotheby's, the auction house who sold it, describe it as a sash that was [...] "reputed" [...] to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course {{on the day of the}} Derby was Henry Dorling. When the police listed Davison's possessions, they <b>itemised</b> the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to the inside of her jacket. They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30cm).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{strengths}} and weaknesses of three widely-discussed egalitarian standards of interpersonal comparison: welfare, resource, and capability. We argue that welfare egalitarianism is beset by numerous serious problems, and should be rejected. Capability and resourcist standards conform with egalitarian convictions more closely, but each faces distinctive problems. We <b>itemise</b> a set of desiderata which a fully adequate account of interpersonal comparison would satisfy. We conclude that the choice between capability and resourcist standards turns on the relative importance of such an account being able to accommodate reasonable pluralism and identify inequality in a publicly verifiable manner...|$|R
