While juggling professional basketball duties and coursework as an NBA rookie/student-athlete, he continued to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> for charity work and hospital visits. His humanitarian works included a Stay in School Jam for 6,500 local area students that he participated in along with several teammates and R artist Usher.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E

5|$|The Torchwood team {{become aware}} of the bizarre death and realises through CCTV that the gas has taken over Carys. Gwen feels guilty at having caused the man's death, but team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) assures her that {{everybody}} makes mistakes. Gwen also learns that she is the only team member who's in a relationship, as the others are too busy working to <b>find</b> <b>time.</b> They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-season}} saw no new signings as the young, mostly local squad {{that had}} {{finished second in}} the 1952–53 campaign was enough for manager Freddie Steele. Steele signed a three-year contract following his success the previous season. He considered signing Stoke City goalkeeper Dennis Herod, and the two parties held talks before he was instead sold to Stockport County for £500. Alf Jones was given his first professional contract, whilst Selwyn Whalley (who was training to become teacher), Harry Oliver and John Poole (both engineering apprentices) all were given part-time professional contracts. Don Bould and Ron Fitzgerald returned from national service to become full-time professionals. This gave the club a total of 21 full-time professionals, six part-time players and ten players aged 17–21 who could only play and train if they could <b>find</b> <b>time</b> off from their compulsory two-year national service. The strip was a traditional white shirt with black shorts, whilst the change kit of red and white stripes were donated by a friend of one of the club's directors, who was a Sunderland supporter.|$|E
5|$|While {{on holiday}} with Jay and their friends, Abi thinks {{she could be}} pregnant. Jay hopes to be a father, while Abi would prefer to have an abortion. She is not pregnant, but ends their relationship, believing that they want {{different}} things. However, they soon reconcile. Max is framed for causing a car crash that leaves Phil hospitalised. Abi and Lauren, who returns from rehabilitation, struggle to pay Max's legal costs, {{as well as their}} bills.

Abi decides to continue studying, but when Max goes to prison for a while she has to take a job, and struggles to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> for her studies. However, Max is proven innocent, and returns home to support his family. In an argument between Jay and Dexter, Abi discovers that on their holiday Jay kissed a barmaid while they were arguing over the suspected pregnancy.

25|$|Since that time, Laird {{has been}} able to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to pursue some other comic book work, {{including}} publishing Stupid Heroes, and the graphic novel trilogy, Planet Racers, with Jim Lawson.

25|$|Zico {{retired from}} {{professional}} football during the 1994 season but received {{an invitation to}} play beach soccer, winning the Beach Soccer World Cup 1995. Scoring 12 goals, he was the top scorer and was named the best player of the tournament. He returned to Kashima to become the Antlers' technical adviser in 1995, splitting his time between Japan and Brazil – where he still managed to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to play beach soccer. One year later, in 1996, he founded CFZ (Zico Football Centre) in Rio de Janeiro. Zico founded another club, named CFZ de Brasília, in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Before {{recording}} {{their next}} album, the band {{decided to take}} a break to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to focus on other projects. Nicke Andersson worked on his side project The Solution with Scott Morgan, releasing the album Communicate! in 2004; he also contributed backing vocals for The Cardigans album Long Gone Before Daylight. Dahlqvist started a side project called Thunder Express and also recorded the album Fula Gubben Hitler with Swedish singer/songwriter Stefan Sundström; Dahlqvist was pictured on the album's cover suspended on a cross. Dahlqvist also toured along with former Hellacopters member Mattias Hellberg in support of the album.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} three seasons Foster could spare no time for cricket, apart from August 1905 (when he scored 246 on his first appearance), but in 1907 {{he was able to}} <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to play regularly from the beginning of June. His batting was as good as ever in a summer of appalling wickets and helped Worcestershire (fourteenth of sixteen counties in 1906) to rise to equal second with Yorkshire. He captained England in the three-match series against South Africa in 1907, winning one match and drawing two. Offered the captaincy of the MCC for the 1907/1908 Ashes tour, Foster declined because business commitments were monopolising his attention.|$|E
25|$|After further delays, Revolution {{announced}} on 5 November {{that the game}} will be released as a two-part episodic title, with the first episode coming on 4 December 2013, and the second one in Q1 2014. Initial releases would be for desktop platforms, and other releases would follow shortly after. Cecil explained that the game became much larger than they had anticipated, with enough content for two full-fledged games. This meant that the title would not be fully completed {{by the end of}} 2013, but Revolution had promised a 2013 release, and so came the decision to split the game in two. Cecil also added that sometimes games are too long, and players don't <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to finish it, and saw that a split would also benefit in this field. He compared the length of a single episode to that of The Smoking Mirror.|$|E

25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E
25|$|The {{training}} of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence {{and in front of}} a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the Magical Mystery Tour film, Evans wrote about his work duties: [...] "I would get {{requests}} from {{the four of them}} to do six different things at one time, and it was always a case of relying on instinct and experience in awarding priorities.

The family is materially well-off, with a plush home and a Mercedes, but justifiably so—Perowne and his wife work hard. McEwan tells of his success rate and keeping cool under pressure; there is a trade off, {{as he and his}} wife work long hours and need to put their diaries side by side to <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to spend together.|$|E
