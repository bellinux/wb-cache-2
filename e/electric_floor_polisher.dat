5000|$|In European music after 1900, {{an example}} of an {{overture}} displaying a connection with the traditional form is Dmitri Shostakovich's Festive Overture, Op. 96 (1954), which is in two linked sections, [...] "Allegretto" [...] and [...] "Presto" [...] (Temperely 2001). Malcolm Arnold's A Grand, Grand Overture, Op. 57 (1956), is a 20th-century parody of the late 19th century concert overture, scored for an enormous orchestra with organ, additional brass instruments, and obbligato parts for four rifles, three Hoover vacuum cleaners (two uprights in B, one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an <b>electric</b> <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> in E; it is dedicated [...] "to President Hoover".|$|E

They hear a sound coming from a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> that Ernest is trying to turn on for operation - he works as a night custodian at the bank - and dreams that he would be a clerk, but he ends up making a mess in the bank and he becomes magnetic from a mishap with the <b>floor</b> <b>polisher.</b> The next day, bank president Oscar Pendlesmythe's assistant, Charlotte Sparrow requires him to clean up his supernatural mess. Pendlesmythe wants to terminate Ernest's employment at the bank, but Charlotte has a soft heart for misfits and stray dogs, so she argues on his behalf. Ernest takes a bath at home in a tumble dry washing machine and uses a blow dryer with a windtunnel force for his evening dinner with Charlotte in a restaurant. He later receives in the mail a summons to jury duty in court and tells the two watchmen about it. During the trial Dracup Maximum Security Prison convict Rubin Bartlett notices that death row inmate Felix Nash is a dead ringer for Ernest. Rubin's lawyer convinces the jury to tour the prison, where Ernest is kidnapped by Nash and another inmate named Lyle and forced to switch places with Nash. Even though he tries to tell the guards he is not Nash, they refuse to believe him. Ernest also does not know that he has a death sentence which is for Nash.|$|R

50|$|In 1962 Georgiy Daneliya invited Shpalikov for a joint effort, and {{together}} they wrote a comedy film Walking the Streets of Moscow. Similar to Ilyich's Gate in tone and message, it seemed suspicious to the Artistic Council at first as they saw it as another movie about «young people wandering around the city doing nothing». But after Daneliya assured one of the head officials at the State Committee for Cinematography that they had nothing tricky on their minds, the work became «easy, fast and fun». When the film was ready, the Council was still unsure {{what to make of}} it. Daneliya and Shaplikov then came up with a «meaningful» episode (a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> who works at the house of a big writer and criticizes beginning writers on this account). According to Daneliya, the pun was obvious, but the Council «was smarter than we thought and pretended they didn't notice anything».|$|R

Under his administration the White House had resumed its fine colonial character. At his direction Mead and McKim had restored it to the noble simplicity of Madison's time. They had cleared out the business offices and removed the absurd mixture of political machinery and household furniture which had accumulated under the rule of his predecessors, most of whom (coming from small inland towns) knew nothing of any art but government, and in some cases not too much of that. On this particular visit I recall the fact that repairs were going on, for the President invited me to take luncheon with his family, and we ate in a small room {{on the front of the}} house for the reason that the dining-room was in process of being restored and the howl of the <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> was resounding through the hall.|$|R

To avoid censorship, Danelia {{paid a visit to}} Vladimir Baskakov, one of the head officials at the State Committee for Cinematography, and assured him they had nothing tricky on their minds. After that the work became «easy, fast and fun». They ended up with a movie Walking the Streets of Moscow inspired by the French New Wave, similar to Ilyich's Gate in style and mood. This alarmed the Artistic Council, an executive body responsible for pre-production and post-production. They saw no point in the movie. Daneliya and Shaplikov then came up with a «meaningful» episode (a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> who works at the house of a big writer and criticizes beginning writers on this account), mocking the Council along the way, and a new genre of [...] "lyric (or sad) comedy" [...] which became Daneliya's trademark.|$|R

40|$|The {{computerized}} database {{is fundamentally}} changing society. From communication, to government, transport, shopping, friendship, health, education, narrative {{and even the}} way we watch film, the database is radically transforming our lives. And yet we are only barely aware of its existence, we don't really know what a database is : like electricity, it's pervasive and all around us, but we cannot actually see it. Digital media artists YOHA set about making the database visible. Working with Bristol City Council in England, they use local government expenditure to explore {{the relationship between the}} database, power and expenditure. Turning the pounds sterling of expenditure into the pounds per square inch of pneumatic pressure, they make a suite of engineered mechanical contraptions : a Potato Cannon, an Old People Pneumatic <b>Floor</b> <b>Polisher,</b> an Expenditure Riding Saddle and a Library Book Stabber. But as they tour these contraptions around Bristol, they become embroiled in the more visceral realities of the city, {{in the form of the}} Royal Wedding, local anti Tesco riots and the censorship of a local outdoor cinema. "Invisible Airs" is very much a story of our time, of our obsessions with the virtual world and its uneasy relationship to the physical world that we actually inhabit.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we look at}} the problem of peak power {{reduction}} for buildings with <b>electric</b> radiant <b>floor</b> heating systems. Uncoordinated operation of a multi-zone radiant floor heating system can result in temporally correlated electricity demand surges or peaks in the building’s electricity consumption. As peak power prices are 200 - 400 times that of the nominal rate, this uncoordinated activity can result in high electricity costs and expensive system operation. We have previously presented green scheduling as an approach for reducing the aggregate peak power consumption in buildings while ensuring that indoor thermal comfort is always maintained. This report extends the theoretical results for general affine dynamical systems and applies them to <b>electric</b> radiant <b>floor</b> heating systems. The potential of the proposed method in reducing the peak power demand is demonstrated for a small-scale system through simulation in EnergyPlus and for a large-scale system through simulation in Matlab...|$|R
25|$|Arnold was a {{relatively}} conservative composer of tonal works, but a prolific and popular one. He acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, alongside Gustav Mahler, Béla Bartók and jazz. Several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold's most significant works are {{generally considered to be}} his nine symphonies. He also wrote a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, one for cello for Julian Lloyd Webber, two for clarinet for Frederick Thurston and Benny Goodman respectively, one for harmonica for Larry Adler and one – enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 Proms – for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick. His sets of dances — comprising two sets of English Dances (Opp. 27 and 33), along with one set each of Scottish Dances (Op. 59), Cornish Dances (Op. 91), Irish Dances (Op. 126), and Welsh Dances (Op. 138) — are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later wind and brass band arrangements. The English Dances also form the basis for Kenneth MacMillan's short ballet Solitaire, {{and one of them is}} used as the theme music for the British television programme What the Papers Say (the Cornish Dances provide the theme music for the television programmes of the cook Rick Stein). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures, including Beckus the Dandipratt (an important stepping stone in his early career), the strikingly scored Tam o' Shanter (based on the famous Robert Burns poem), the rollicking A Grand Grand Overture (written for a Hoffnung Festival and featuring three vacuum cleaners and a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher,</b> all in turn polished off by a firing squad in uproarious mock 1812 manner), and the dramatic Peterloo Overture (commissioned by the Trades Union Congress to commemorate the historic massacre of protesting workers in Manchester). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for brass band.|$|R

Astral became a wholly owned subsidiary. George Wansbrough was the company {{chairman}} from 1944-54. In 1949, it produced its first automatic toaster which used a bi-metallic strip. It also produced the Simon <b>electric</b> <b>floor</b> scrubber. In 1953, it produced its first hairdryer and claimed to have 90% of the market six years later, as it sold very well. In 1954 it introduced a steam iron; these were still comparatively revolutionary twenty years later. At {{the same time it}} introduced electrical convector heaters and panel heaters (ceramic heaters). By 1957, it was the UK's leading provider of electric blankets, had produced its 10 millionth electric iron, and was producing 60% of the toasters made in the UK. It had bought Yelsen Ltd, a manufacturer of electric blankets at Ruxley in Kent, on 16 June 1957 for £112,000, which became a subsidiary. Also in June, new factories opened at the main site and Dundee. 40% of products were exported and overseas subsidiaries had been established. Morphy did not like the huge expansion of the company, but Richards thought it was too slow. Sir Patrick Bishop became chairman in 1957.|$|R
5000|$|Caffeine {{has been}} shown to have {{negative}} effects on long-term memory. In a study with mice, a step-through passive-avoidance task was used, and the ability to remember the task was assessed. Caffeine was given before the task in varying doses, with low doses to start (11.55 mg/kg) and higher doses in the end (92.4 mg/kg). (To put that in perspective, one 8 oz cup of coffee contains 95-200 mg of caffeine.) [...] An apparatus including a box with a light was connected to a dark box with an <b>electric</b> <b>floor.</b> When the mice entered the dark box, a shock was released from the floor. The next day, the mice entered the apparatus again and completed the same task. Subjects that did not enter the dark box for 180 seconds were thought to have put the task in long-term memory, remembering the assignment from the previous day. However, caffeine administered at higher doses resulted in decreased retention time of the task from 180 seconds to 105 seconds. Lower doses of caffeine had little to no effect on retention time. Therefore, in this study, linear regression analysis showed that higher doses of caffeine impaired long-term memory, suggesting a dose-response relationship between caffeine intake and retention time. Ultimately, long-term memory and caffeine intake display varying results, in human as well as animal subjects.|$|R

One of the methods frequently used to achieve this is to maintain a low room air temperature and provide protection to the piglets by covering the creep area in different ways. However, only limited information is found in literature on the specific thermal consequences of different cover designs. An experiment was conducted with a 0. 6 m by 1. 0 m creep area surrounded by 4 different constructions, each covered with 3 different materials. The tested model {{was placed in a}} draft free room, where the air temperature was maintained at 21 °C, and heated with 140 W <b>electric</b> <b>floor</b> panel with dimensions equal to the creep floor area. Air temperature and black-globe temperature were measured in 9 positions in the creep. Floor panel surface temperature was measured in 2 positions. The results showed that a creep area surrounded only with walls (without roof) created better thermal conditions than 3 walls with roof and open front, what was unexpected. 50 %-covered front improved thermal conditions two times, and 90 %-covered front four times in comparison to cover with open front. The obtained results indicated that the not only thermo-insulating properties of cover material, must be considerate but, above all, we must focus on the material surface. It should be smooth, monolithic and not absorb the thermal radiation but reflect it...|$|R
