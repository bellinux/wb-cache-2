40|$|We {{propose to}} combine a passive sampler for polar organic {{compounds}} (POS) {{with a specific}} bioassay for phytotoxicity to assess the hazard of herbicidal compounds in surface waters. The POS consisted of an Empore (TM) disk coated with styrenedivinylbenzene deployed in a Teflon housing, which has relatively high sampling rates (e. g., approximately 1 L d (- 1) for diuron). POS were deployed for 5 days in a small- scale field study in South East Queensland, Australia, in a relatively pristine environment and an urban environment to explore sensitivity towards herbicides and potential influences of non- herbicidal pollutants. Besides chemical analysis of 8 herbicides, a novel bioassay (Maxi- Imaging- PAM, IPAM) was employed to assess the phytotoxic effects of water samples and POS extracts. The IPAM allows rapid assessment of photosynthetic quantum yields {{of a large number}} of samples via chlorophyll-fluorescence imaging and the saturation pulse method. Sampling rates for several herbicides from laboratory calibrations were found to be applicable under field conditions. Toxic <b>equivalent</b> <b>concentrations</b> (with reference to the herbicide diuron) were computed from the concentrations determined by chemical analysis and the relative potency (also termed toxic equivalence factor) of the detected herbicides.

40|$|Many {{investigations}} have highlighted the bioaccumulation of dioxins in animals, but {{little is known}} about the trophodynamics of dioxins in the food web. In this study, the trophic transfer of nine dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) congeners, eleven dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners, and twelve non-, mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyl (non- and mono-ortho PCBs) congeners in a marine food web were determined. The concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non- and mono-ortho PCBs were analyzed in phytoplankton/seston, zooplankton, three invertebrate species, six fish species, and one seabirds species collected from Bohai Bay, representing approximately 4 trophic levels based on stable nitrogen isotope values. Positive relationships were found between trophic levels and lipid <b>equivalent</b> <b>concentrations</b> of non- and mono-ortho PCBs except for PCB- 77, PCB- 81, PCB- 126, PCB- 156, and PCB- 167, indicating bioaccumulation of these compounds in this food web. But lipid <b>equivalent</b> <b>concentrations</b> of low chlorinated 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted-PCDD/Fs did not exhibit statistically significant trends with trophic levels. And lipid <b>equivalent</b> <b>concentrations</b> of high chlorinated 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted-PCDD/Fs and three non- 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted-PCDD/Fs declined significantly with increasing trophic levels providing that these isomers undergo trophic dilution. The similarity in log K-ow values for non-, mono-ortho PCBs, non- 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted-PCDD/Fs, and some 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted-PCDD/Fs suggests that the difference of trophic transfer is mainly due to their different metabolic transformation rates...|$|R

30|$|For {{measurements}} in {{the yeast}} estrogen screen (YES), the yeast androgen screen (YAS), the yeast dioxin screen (YDS) and the microtox assay, native water samples were solid-phase extracted (SPE) according to Giebner et al.

No. 516 - 0885, 90  mm, particle retention: 1.0  µm, Darmstadt, Germany), 1000  mL {{of the water}} sample from each sampling site were passed through conditioned Oasis HLB cartridges (200  mg, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The cartridges were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and afterwards eluted according to Giebner et al. [35]. This resulted in a 0.1  mL DMSO extract which was 10, 000 -fold enriched. Extracts were analyzed in the YES and YAS as described in Giebner et al. [35], {{as well as in}} the YDS according to Stalter et al. [45]. The measured activities were expressed as <b>equivalent</b> <b>concentrations</b> for 17 β-estradiol (YES), testosterone (YAS), 4 -hydroxytamoxifen (YAES), flutamide (YAAS) and β-naphthoflavone (YDS) and were corrected regarding dilution and enrichment so that <b>equivalent</b> <b>concentrations</b> relate back to the native water sample.|$|R

Microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life.
