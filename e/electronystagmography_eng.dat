Objectives: The aim of this work was to assess the balance and vestibular system in children with otitis media with effusion prior to and after treatment. Methods: Fifty children with bilateral OME (5 – 11  years old, 28 females and 22 males) were involved as a study group. The control group consisted of 30 healthy children age- and sex-matched (12 females/ 18 males).

40|$|This study {{correlates}} ENG and MRI {{findings in}} six patients with cerebellar eye move-ments.

30|$|<b>Electronystagmography</b> (<b>ENG)</b> and scleral {{search coil}} systems (SSCSs) {{were used to}} collect eye {{movement}} signals [8, 9]. ENG measures movements of the eye by attaching electrodes around the nose, while ENG has the advantages {{of being able to}} make measurements while the eyes are closed; ENG has disadvantages of artifacts being caused by eye blinking, perspiration, or light, and difficulty in measuring vertical eye movement. Additionally, SSCS requires subjects to attach an annular contact lens to their eyes; although having a high accuracy and sampling rate, it can be worn for only 40  min and has a tendency to slip [10, 11]. With advances in computer vision technology, videonystagmography (VNG) has been used generally, although ENG data are still valuable [12]. VNG is a technology that can test whether dizziness is caused by inner ear disease; it uses an infrared camera to track the pupil in the dark. Advantages of VNG are its high accuracy and non-invasive nature, making its use common, although with high cost.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sudden {{hearing loss}} (SHL) is an ENT {{emergency}} defined as {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SNHL) > 30 dB HL affecting at least 3 consecutive tonal frequencies, showing a sudden onset, and occurring within 3 days. In cases of SHL, a detailed investigation should be performed {{in order to determine}} the etiology and provide the best treatment. Otoacoustic emission (OAE) analysis, <b>electronystagmography</b> (<b>ENG),</b> bithermal caloric test (BCT), and vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) assessments may be used in addition to a number of auxiliary methods to determine the topographic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of OAE analysis, BCT, VEMP assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the topographic diagnosis of SHL. METHOD: Cross-sectional and retrospective studies of 21 patients with SHL, as defined above, were performed. The patients underwent the following exams: audiometry, tympanometry, OAE analysis, BCT, VEMP assessment, and MRI. Sex, affected side, degree of hearing loss, and cochleovestibular test results were described and correlated with MRI findings. Student's t-test was used for analysis of qualitative variables (p < 0. 05). RESULTS: The mean age of the 21 patients assessed was 52. 5 ± 15. 3 years; 13 (61. 9 %) were women and 8 (38. 1 %) were men. Most (55 %) had severe hearing loss. MRI changes were found in 20 % of the cases. When the audiovestibular test results were added to the MRI findings, the topographic SHL diagnosis rate increased from 20 % to 45 %. CONCLUSION: Only combined analysis via several examinations provides a precise topographic diagnosis. Isolated data do not provide sufficient evidence to establish the extent of involvement and, hence, a possible etiology...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{estimates}} of the accuracy with which <b>electronystagmography</b> (<b>ENG)</b> can provide eye movement records have been published by Shackel (1960). His data described horizontal eye movements over a fairly large displacement, as did data from trials com-paring this technique with eye movement films described by Hoffman, Wellman, and Carmichael (I 939) and Michael and Melvill Jones (I 966). Elsewhere, Shackel and Davis (1960) demonstrated that monocular vertical potentials were only about 6 o per cent. {{of the magnitude of}} binocular horizontal potentials, which inferred that a vertical eye movement may yield a signal with a poorer signal-to-noise ratio than a comparable horizontal one. In the opinion of Miles (939), who presented no supporting data, this vertical potential may possibly be enlarged if the eyes are closed. Vertical fixation movements could still be particularly difficult to measure accurately, however, because of an eyelid artefact which can confuse the vertical eye movement record (Barry and MIelvill Jones, I 965). The aim of the present investigation was to perform a test-retest reliability examination of ENG records, when such records were made from small vertical eye movements. A comparison between the eye open- eye closed case was also included. Subjects 32 subjects participated, nine of them female. Most had normal binocular visual acuity, none poorer than 6 /I 2 corrected (as tested by the Snellen chart). None had any visible or known eye abnormality. Their ages ranged from 17 - 4 to 50. 3 years, but only eight were in fact over 30 years old. All were known to the experimenter and none was unduly anxious about the experimental situation, as far as could be seen. Equipment ENG signals were obtained from suction-cup electrodes (described by Shackel, 1958) and delivered to d. c. amplification equipment. This equipment was of high input impedance (differential input) and low drift, and had gains, available by switching, from x 1, 000 to x ilo,oo. The output was- 3 db down at 6 Hz, and- 44 db at 50 Hz. (A secondary output, flat to 6 o Hz, could be introduced as an occasional check that such steep filtering was not misleading.) The amplified signals were delivered to an ultra-violet trace recorder...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{surgical}} intervention, orbital floor fractures {{are associated}} with risks of persisting sensibility disturbances, enophthalmos and diplopia. Cheek asymmetry and trismus may result when the zygoma is dislocated. In evaluating the surgical results patients’ experiences of the outcomes have to be investigated. To investigate sequelae a questionnaire was sent to 107 patients previously treated for an orbital floor fracture (Paper I). Visual analogue scales (VASs) were used in a prospective study (Papers II and III) to assess patients’ experiences of persisting signs and symptoms. The possibility of using <b>electronystagmography</b> (<b>ENG)</b> equipment, normally employed in vestibular testing in ENT practice, for measuring bilateral vertical eye motility was investigated in a methodological study (Paper IV). Fractures were mainly due to assaults and falls. Sequelae were common (83 %). A high frequency of diplopia (36 %) was associated with antral packing. When stable floor implants replaced this technique, the subsequent prospective study revealed absence of severe cases of diplopia {{as well as a}} lower occurrence of diplopia (9. 5 %). Patients and doctors agreed on the presence of ‘objective’ signs (affected physical appearance and diplopia). Sensibility disturbances and reduced mouth opening capacity were not sufficiently reflected by the diagnostic assessment methods used, and these symptoms were underestimated by the clinicians. Surgery of the internal orbit involves risks. For this reason, operations for purely diagnostic purposes must be avoided. However, 21 % of the orbital floor operations {{in the present study were}} performed for purely diagnostic purposes. Surgeons did not apprehend the CT scans as being representative of the fracture. No test is at present available that can objectively establish entrapment of soft tissues as a cause of diplopia, although this is an absolute indication for surgery. However, vertical electro-oculography (vEOG) was shown to (i) objectively measure vertical eye motility; (ii) detect and verify mechanical restriction of vertical eye motility; and (iii) distinguish patients experiencing vertical diplopia from healthy test subjects with ‘normal’ eye motility. Both recognition of patients’ experiences and prolonged follow-ups in selected cases are important for treatment feedback, and are prerequisites for improvement of future surgical outcomes. Current diagnostic methods appear to be insufficient. Vertical electro-oculography is suggested as a simple, objective and noninvasive eye motility test with the potential of helping predict which patients will benefit or not benefit from orbital floor surgery...|$|E
40|$|Positional {{nystagmus}} (PN) {{is a type}} of nystagmus {{that occurs}} {{as a result of the}} head or the head and body being moved from one position to another and then statically maintained in the critical position. Until recently, PN was always considered as an abnormal finding regardless of its character. However, with emergence of the highly sensitive technique of videonystagmography (VNG) it has become apparent that PN does occur frequently in healthy individuals. Since the present criteria for determining pathological PN have been based on <b>electronystagmography</b> (<b>ENG),</b> which provides less sensitive measure of vertical eye movements than VNG, there have been attempts to outline new criteria based on the VNG method. However, to date, no new explicit criteria have been agreed on by scientists. Further to this, a number of factors have been found to affect results of static position testing, including mental alerting, response repeatability, and the number of head and body positions tested, and these factors all need to be examined. Apart from investigating prevalence of PN in healthy normal individuals, this experiment examined three variables: the effects of mental alerting, within session repeatability of PN, and the prevalence of PN across different head and body positions. Eighteen participants (13 female, 5 male) aged 22 to 76 years with no history of balance disorder were tested in four identical sets of static positional testing using VNG. Each test set included 11 head and body positions. Two of these test sets were conducted with mental alerting and two sets without mental alerting. Gathered data were analysed with respect to presence of PN, direction of PN, and peak slow phase velocity (SPV). In total 66. 7 % of the participants developed persistent PN in at least one test position in at least one of the four test sets. Three main types of PN were found in this study: vertical, horizontal, and oblique. The most common type of PN across the entire study was vertical up-beating (VUB) PN (45. 6 %); however, the most common type of PN across individual participants was horizontal PN (75 %). Oblique PN had the greatest mean peak SPV. Mental alerting had significant effect on prevalence of PN, but it did not increase the magnitude of the SPV. The prevalence of PN was only modestly repeatable within the paired mental alerting and non-mental alerting test sets, and the repeatability was greater for the test sets with mental alerting. There were no significant differences between the SPV magnitudes within the paired test sets, suggesting good within-session repeatability of the SPV magnitudes. The „supine with head straight? (SHS) and „supine with head turned right? (SHR) positions provoked the highest rates of PN; however, there was no one position that would not provoke PN in at least one participant and at least one test set. Overall 22. 2 % of the participants did not fit the current criteria for „normality? based on ENG, indicating the need for refinement of those criteria using VNG...|$|E
40|$|Deadness, {{the lack}} of ability to hear, is the most {{prevalent}} sensory deficit in human populations (Mckusick, 1992). It {{can be divided into}} two groups; namely syndromic and nonsyndromic on the basis of associated phenotype other than deafness. To date, 123 loci and 37 of the corresponding genes for nonsyndromic deafness have been identified. Receive and dominant mutant alleles of above 14 genes have been reported to cause hoth syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness. Considering the intricacy of hearing process, {{it has been estimated that}} at least 300 human genes are involved in the hearing process (Friedman and Griffith 2003). Thus, search for new deafness loci/genes is indispensable for a better understanding of genetic and molecular basis of auditory functions and allied syndromes. The ratio of recessively inherited is 1. 6 per 1000 in the Pakistan population, which in higher than worldâ€™s average due to high consanguinity (Hussain and Bittles 1998, jabber et al. 1998). The present study has two basic objectives; firstly to determine genotype/phenotype correlation for of the grevalent loci, DFNB 2 /USHIB, and secondly to identify new loci/genes involved in hearing impairment in Pakistani population. Fifty consanguineous families segregating deafness were identified and enrolled from different cities of Pakistan while twenty of them were selected for further molecular studies. All the families had three or more deaf individuals and showed recessive mode of inheritance. Clinical histories were obtained and pure one audiometry tests for air and bone conduction were performed at frequencies 250 to 8, 000 hz on affected and unaffected members of these families. Vestibular function was evaluated by testing tandem gait ability, Romberg test and <b>electronystagmography</b> (<b>ENG).</b> Ocular funduscopy and electroretinography (ERG) was performed to detect the presence of retinopathy. Written informed consents were obtained and genomic DNA was isolated after collecting blood samples from affected, normal individuals, their parents, grandparents if alive, and other family members of related sibships. Previously, recessive and dominant mutant alleles of MYO 74 A were reported be associated with both syndromic (USHIB) and ninsyndromic (DFNB 2,DFNA 11) deafness (Liu et al. 1997 a; Liu et al. 1997; weal et al. 1997). However, clinical re-evaluation of all the reported DFNB 2 families concluded that there is no polished evidence of mutations of MYO 7 A associated with nonsyndromic deafness DFNB 2 (Zina et al. 2001, Astute et al. 2002). For the first objective and to eliminate the chaos about DFNB 2, 270 families (20 enrolled + 250 families from CEMB repository) were screened for linkage to DFNB 2 /USHIB markers and as a result 11 families were found linked. Mutational analysis of DFNB 2 /USHIB linked families led to identification of 9 novel mutations in MYO 7 A gene. Amongst them, a novel mutation E 1716 del of MYO 7 A was found to be associated withDFNB 2. This is the first clinically well documented example of MYO 7 A mutant allele associated with nonsyndromic deafness DFNB 2. Furthermore, it is the first report describing mutation spectrum of MYO 7 A associated with USHIB and DFNB 2 in Pakistan population. The results of these studies are being written up for publication. To study the second objective seventeen families (remaining of twenty families) were analyzed for linkage by typing at least three STR markers for all the known recessive deafness loci (except DFNB 2 / USHIB). Consequently, four families showed linkage to DFNB 4 /PDS and DFNB 12 / USHID while thirteen remained unlinked. Mutational studies of SLC 26 A 4 gene revealed a known mutation V 239 D (park el al. 2003) and a novel mutation Q 446 R in two families linked to DFNB 4. The fact that a large number of families remained unlinked to known loci further supports the notion that still a large number of loci/genes remain undiscovered and instigate to identify more novel loci/genes associated with deafness. Genome with was performed on seven selected unlinked families by using ABIPRISMÂ® linked mapping set version 2. 5 having 411 fluorescent dye-labeled micro satellites markers spaced at an average distance of 10 cm across the human the human genomic. Genome. Genome wide linkage analysis studies led to mapping of two novel nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness loci â€œDFNB 51 â€� and â€œDFNB 56 â€� as designated by human genome organization(HUGO) committee. DFNB 51 and DFNB 51 and DFFNB 56 were mapped to chromosome 11 p 13 -p 12 and 3 q 13. 3 -q 21 on two set of families (PKDF 240, PKDF 407 and pkkf 637, pkdf 223) segregating recessively inherited, profound congenital deafness respectively. Moreover, sequencing of three candidate genes (SLCIA 2, RAMP, and TRAF 6), percent in the critical linked region of DFNB 51 was done but no potentially causative variant was identified (SHAIKH et al. 2005). Localization of DFNB 51 and DFNB 56 is the first step toward the identification of novel genes that will help to further reveal the genetics deafness...|$|E
