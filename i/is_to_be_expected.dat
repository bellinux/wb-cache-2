5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> considering a companion is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E

25|$|In most larger {{samplings}} of data, {{some data}} points will be {{further away from}} the sample mean than what is deemed reasonable.

Outlier points can therefore indicate faulty data, erroneous procedures, or areas where a certain theory might not be valid.

Goodrem felt that the songs on her new album lent themselves to a smaller, more intimate setting. She announced 9 dates in 7 different cities, but has since announced more shows due to a high volume of ticket sales. To date she will perform 14 shows in 8 cities. Goodrem was quoted as saying what viewers saw at the AFI Awards, regarding her remixed song and dance performance of Believe Again, in 2007, is only a taste of what <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from her new tour.|$|E
25|$|On 30 September 2011, the Japanese Ministry of Education and Science {{published}} {{the results of}} a plutonium fallout survey, for which in June and July 50 soil samples were collected from a radius of slightly more than 80km around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plutonium was found in all samples, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> since plutonium from the nuclear weapon tests of the 1950s and '60s is found everywhere on the planet. The highest levels found (of Pu-239 and Pu-240 combined) were 15becquerels per square meters in Fukushima prefecture and 9.4Bq in Ibaraki prefecture, compared to a global average of 0.4 to 3.7 bq / kg from atomic bomb tests. Earlier in June, university researchers detected smaller amounts of plutonium in soil outside the plant after they collected samples during filming by NHK.|$|E

25|$|In {{a speech}} at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq’s Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, {{included}} the following statement: Partition imposed against the will {{of the majority of the}} people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab-Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred.|$|E
25|$|In the Testament of Levi, Levi is {{described}} as having had two visions. The first vision covered eschatological issues, portraying the seven heavens, the Jewish Messiah, and Judgement Day. The second vision portrays seven angels bringing Levi seven insignia signifying priesthood, prophecy, and judgement; in the vision, after the angels anoint Levi, and initiate him as a priest, they tell him {{of the future of}} his descendants, mentioning Moses, the Aaronid priesthood, and a time when there would be priest-kings; this latter point was of particular interest to the Maccabean period of John Hyrcanus, who was both a high priest, and warrior-king. According to some textual scholars this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> since the Testament of Levi {{is believed to have been}} written during Maccabean rule, between 153BC and 107BC, and closer to the latter date. The Book of Jubilees similarly has Isaac telling Levi of the future of his descendants, again predicting priesthood, prophets, and political power, and additionally describes Jacob as entrusting Levi with the secrets of the ancients, so that they would be known only to the Levites; however, like the Testament of Levi, the Book of Jubilees is regarded as a Maccabean-era document by some scholars.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} with the earlier article shows that {{the reconstruction of the}} vicariate is not an organic continuation of the former condition but that an entirely new organization has been created. There is in this change an evident effort to organize the official bodies as servants of the public and to do this {{on the basis of the}} modern method of carrying on business, as it is found everywhere in countries that lead in civilization and in well-organized central boards of authorities. Formerly the administration was a cumbrous one, impeded by traditional obstacles; it may perhaps be said to have regarded itself as the primary object and the public which it should serve as of subordinate consideration. This state of things is now past, thanks to the energy of the reigning pope, which overcame all obstacles. Now, anyone who has business with the vicariate knows exactly to which department, which official, he must go in order to have the matter in question speedily settled. It <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> that in the course of time the third department owing to the test of practical working may undergo slight changes, as it is not probable that all ordinances will prove capable of permanent execution. The characteristics of the new organization are division of work and rigid separation of the judiciary from the executive administration, together with an ample supply of officials for the different departments. In the reorganization customs that had become historical were taken into consideration only insofar as they could be combined without difficulty with modern methods of business.|$|E
