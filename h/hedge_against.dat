The French built a series of forts and outposts in Indiana as a <b>hedge</b> <b>against</b> the westward expansion of the British colonies from {{the east coast of}} North America and to encourage trade with the native tribes. The tribes were able to procure metal tools, cooking utensils, and other manufactured items in exchange for animal pelts. The French built Fort Miamis in the Miami town of Kekionga (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana). France assigned Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, as the first agent to the Miami at Kekionga.|$|E

Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely.

The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones.

5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to <b>hedge</b> <b>against</b> exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is satisfied {{without the use}} of a forward contract to <b>hedge</b> <b>against</b> exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be uncovered.

5|$|Beginning in 1915, Bayer set up {{a number}} of shell {{corporations}} and subsidiaries in the United States, to <b>hedge</b> <b>against</b> the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, alien property custodian A. Mitchell Palmer began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon {{turned his attention to}} Bayer. To avoid having to surrender all profits and assets to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the Trading with the Enemy Act was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and trademarks, including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, Sterling Products, Inc.. The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.|$|E

40|$|In September 1997, the U. S. Treasury {{developed}} the TIPS market {{in order to}} achieve three important policy objectives: (1) to provide consumers with a class of assets that allows for <b>hedging</b> <b>against</b> real interest rate risk, (2) to provide holders of nominal contracts a means of <b>hedging</b> <b>against</b> inflation risk, and (3) to provide everyone with a reliable indicator of the term structure of expected inflation. This paper evaluates progress toward the achievement of these objectives and analyzes prospective ways to better meet these objectives in the future, by, for example, extending the maturity of TIPS and/or the use of inflation indexes suited to particular geographic regions or demographics. We conclude by arguing that while it is tempting to consider completing markets by introducing more TIPS-like securities indexed to inflation rates more tailored to particular demographics, our analysis suggests that TIPS indexed to CPI do, in fact, facilitate good synthetic <b>hedges</b> <b>against</b> unexpected changes in inflation for many different investors, since the various inflation measures are very highly correlated.

40|$|Bond issuers {{frequently}} immunize/hedge {{their interest}} rate exposure {{by means of}} interest rate swaps (IRS). The receiving leg matches all bond cash-flows, while the pay leg requires floating rate coupon payments of form LIBOR + a spread. The goal of <b>hedging</b> <b>against</b> interest rate risk is only achieved in full if {{the present value of}} this spread is zero. Using market data we show that under a traditional IRS hedging strategy an investor could still experience significant cash flow losses given a 1 % shift in the underlying benchmark yield curve. We consider the instantaneous interest-rate risk of a bond portfolio that allows for general changes in interest rates. We make two contributions. The paper analyzes the size of hedging imperfections arising from the widening of the floating rate spread in a traditional swap contract and subsequently proposes two new practical, effective and analytically tractable swap structures; Structure 1 : An Improved Parallel <b>Hedge</b> Swap, <b>hedges</b> <b>against</b> parallel shifts of the yield curve and Structure 2 : An Improved Non-Parallel <b>Hedge</b> Swap, <b>hedges</b> <b>against</b> any movement of the swap curve.
