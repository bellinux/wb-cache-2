The extruded starches crystallized in the V-H polymorph with crystallinities between 33 and 41 % and crystallite sizes of up to 35 nm. An increase in crystallite size was found for all starches (sometimes a doubling) with increasing extruder middle zone temperatures from 120 up to 210 degreesC. For extruded potato and maize starches a steep rise in strength and modulus and a drop in elongation was observed about 190 degreesC. Purified amylopectin from maize showed after extrusion the crystalline A-type and small amounts of B polymorph with small crystallites (up to 3 nm) and the best mechanical performance with strengths and moduli of about 20 MPa and 1500 MPa, respectively, for the present extrusion conditions.

It has been shown via these two techniques that crystallinity increases with exposure time. The reason of these morphological changes is relevant to photooxidative reactions leading to crosslinking in the beginning and to chain scissions for an advanced stage of ageing. The short chain segments resulting from scission reactions increase the crystallinity of the film via a chemocristallisation process...|$|R

The effect of time, formulation and processing method on the rheological, barrier and physical properties of the experimental films were investigated. Rheological properties of selected commercial films were evaluated for the purpose of comparison. Stress relaxation technique (tension) allowed characterization of the rheological behavior of the experimental and evaluated films. Experimental data were fitted to 3, 5 and 7 -parameter Maxwell model as well as the Peleg and Normand's model. A five-parameter Maxwell model provided the best description of the stress relaxation behavior of all evaluated films.

40|$|Polyethylene is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used polymer material in food packaging today. The polymer is often processed by film extrusion and extrusion coating between 250 °C and 325 °C. Although polyethylene has high thermal stability some degradation takes place and the degradation products formed will migrate to the packed food, which will give food off-flavour tastes when consumed. With an increase in extrusion temperature the risk of detecting off-flavour in the packed product would increase. Additives in the polyethylene might reduce degradation but the effects are unclear and probably depend on the additive’s stability to the high processing temperatures used in extrusion coating. The aim of this research was to understand the behaviour of polyethylene and polyethylene degradation products, from the inlet of the extruder to the final packaging film and the packed product. The degradation is initiated in the extruder during the melting and metering of the polymer. The polymer degradation starts with chain scission reactions forming radicals, and via auto-oxidative process the oxygen dissolved in the polymer forms peroxides and other products. Some of the radicals are combined resulting in higher molar mass and an increase in the viscosity of the melt. At an extrusion temperature of below 300 °C cross-link reactions predominate while at higher process temperatures chain scission reactions predominate. When the melt exits the die orifice the radicals react with the oxygen present in the atmosphere nearest to the melt surface leading to an auto-oxidative degradation. The low molar mass degradation products will evaporate from the melt forming “extruder smoke”. Higher molar mass degradation products will remain at the film surface as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters depending on the temperature of the melt, the exposure time to the atmosphere and the oxygen concentration in air-gap gas. This makes the passage through the air-gap the most critical processing step from degradation point of view. The oxidative degradation products are shown to give the highest off-flavour, the aldehydes and ketones being the most prominent ones. The presence of carboxylic acids seems to be necessary to carry the hydrophobic carbonyl compounds into the product and to generate off-flavour when reaching the mouth. There are clear synergistic effects between aldehydes and ketones and between aldehydes and carboxylic acids. The most off-flavour giving products present in the <b>extruded</b> <b>film</b> are C 7 -C 9 ketones and C 5 -C 8 aldehydes together with the carboxylic acids. Different types of additives can be used as scavengers to adsorb degradation products or radicals as well as antioxidants to stabilise the radicals, which slows down the degradation reaction rates. It is important to select the additive from extrusion process temperature because different additives have different thermal stability. It is possible to control the off-flavour of the polyethylene films when controlling the extrusion temperatures and exposure time and oxygen content in the air-gap or by using selected additives...|$|E

As the material for the shell of the recommended developed by the Voronezh branch of the FSUE "NIISK" high-styrene block copolymers Styrotep- 65. The aim of this work was the development of technologies for films, protective shells of TEC and estimation of their technical parameters. As a benchmark comparison was tested <b>extruded</b> <b>film</b> Styrotep- 65. The orientation of the macromolecules of the polymer along the sleeve during extraction provided the anisotropy of the properties of the film along and across the sleeves. In the study of properties of solutions of thermoplastic elastomer is established that the increase in solution viscosity provides greater film thickness in a single dunking them in forms. We investigated the effect of the concentration of a solution Styrotep- 65 in toluene and the speed of rotation of a spindle of a Brookfield viscometer PV-E on their viscosity. With increasing concentration of the polymer solution with 19, 0 to 26. 8 % of the mass. the level of viscosity was increased from 104 to 330 MPa•S. In the interval of increasing the rotational speed of the spindle from 2. 0 to 10. 0 rpm viscosity solutions is not dependent on the concentration increased due to manifestations of thixotropy. A further increase in the speed of rotation of the spindle 10 to 100 rpm did not affect the viscosity of the solutions. This is true for ideal fluids. Film cast on a horizontal surface of the cellophane from a 10 % toluene solution, was characterized by lower strength than extruded, but with a large elongation at break. Determined the impact of the multiplicity of dipping forms in solution and polymer solution concentration, layer thickness and nature of the substrate on the elastic strength properties of the films.
