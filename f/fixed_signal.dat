50|$|Spin-scan {{systems can}} {{eliminate}} the signal from extended sources like sunlight reflecting from clouds or hot desert sand. To do this, the reticle is modified by making {{one half of}} the plate be covered not with stripes but a 50% transmission color. The output from such a system is a sine wave for half of the rotation and a constant signal for the other half. The fixed output varies with the overall illumination of the sky. An extended target that spans several segments, like a cloud, will cause a <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> as well, and any signal that approximates the <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> is filtered out.|$|E

50|$|The System 100 {{is still}} sought-after {{due to its}} filter, {{sequencer}} and patching capabilities, though the oscillators can be unstable at the lower frequencies, and the keyboard is prone to mis-triggering and double-triggering if not used regularly. Generally, however, it is a robust and reliable system. The SH-5 and SH-7 are similar in styling, but both have <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> paths, {{as opposed to the}} semi-modular System 100.|$|E
50|$|The first railway {{semaphore}} {{was erected}} by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the Brighton) at New Cross, southeast London, {{in the winter}} of 1842-1843 on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway. The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as a <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> throughout Britain, superseding all other types in most uses by 1870. Such signals were widely adopted in the U.S. after 1908.|$|E
50|$|After {{the opening}} of the Warrington and Newton Railway four policemen were placed {{constantly}} on duty at Newton Junction, at the potentially dangerous points where the two lines met. Initially a gilt arrow was used to point towards Warrington to indicate that the points were set in that direction, with a green lamp visible from the L&MR line being used to indicate this at night. Later a <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> was used, with red and white chequered boards on 12 foot high posts being turned to face trains from one direction if another train was ahead.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal box}} at Drouin was closed in February 1988, with the block post abolished, all <b>fixed</b> <b>signals</b> covered and lights extinguished. The {{interlocked}} signal frame was also abolished.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} led to {{the fitting}} of air brakes to rolling stock and improved signalling. Only the locomotives (Ub) had been fitted with air brakes, with hand-operated brakes in the guard’s van at the rear, and Rakaia station had no <b>fixed</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|There were no <b>fixed</b> <b>signals,</b> {{and trains}} were {{despatched}} under the time interval system. {{the absence of}} telegraph communication, collisions were intended to be avoided by holding trains back until a specified time interval had elapsed since {{the departure of the}} previous train.|$|R
50|$|The {{system works}} on <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> blocks (a section of track {{that can be}} {{occupied}} by a train), with lit aspects indicating whether it is safe for a train to proceed into the next fixed block. Interlocking signals or protected signals are used where track features such as crossovers and pocket tracks exist where {{it is possible to}} route trains in either direction. The signals are directly connected to a trip arm that has the ability to stop a train if it violates a signal (runs a red light). This safety method is identical to that of the New York City Subway system.|$|E
50|$|The {{line into}} London Bridge became {{increasingly}} congested so at Corbetts Lane a white disc was installed, {{to be operated}} by the pointsman. If the disc was face on, or a red light at night, the route was set for Croydon; edge on or a white light, the junction was set for Greenwich. It is believed that this was first <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> used to control a junction. Greenwich trains ran every 15 minutes, Croydon trains were hourly. The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the railway at New Cross, about 1842.|$|E
50|$|Kew {{station was}} located {{to the south}} of Wellington Street in a cutting, 1.5 km beyond the Lilydale line. A single {{platform}} was provided on the western side of the line, with a run around loop provided, as well as a third dead end siding road with a dead end extension. A fourth road was also existed behind the station platform, having a low platform for goods traffic provided on the western side, and staff lock on the main line connection. An interlocking frame was provided on the platform, for control of three <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> and the up end points for the yard and run around.|$|E
5000|$|In 1874, Spagnoletti's {{views on}} {{contemporary}} signalling developments were recorded during {{a discussion of}} a paper, [...] "On the <b>fixed</b> <b>signals</b> of railways" [...] by R.C. Rapier read before members of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 31 March of that year: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{train was}} {{supposed}} to swap track, due to maintenance work on the northbound track. A special speed limitation of 30 km/h had been enforced {{by means of an}} M40 mandatory alert, but the <b>fixed</b> <b>signals</b> reported condition normal and the train failed to slow down.|$|R
50|$|Historically, many signals {{were given}} (and {{can still be}} given) by hand, e.g. with a lamp or a staff, or the train drivers follow verbal or written orders. Optimization led to the {{installation}} of <b>fixed</b> <b>signals,</b> requiring less personnel and improving safety, {{and the use of}} telephones and train radio (today: GSM-R).|$|R
50|$|A {{stop signal}} {{is one that}} is {{equipped}} to show a 'danger' aspect, which commands an approaching train to stop. Its function is to prevent conflict with other trains and to indicate that moveable infrastructure features are in the correct position. Depending on {{the manner in which they}} are used, and the nomenclature favoured by the railway administration concerned, stop signals may be further categorised as 'home signals' or 'starting signals', for example. Some stop signals are in the form of a <b>fixed</b> <b>signal,</b> generally a white board with a red solid circle. There is usually a panel underneath with instructions to the driver as to what circumstances he may pass the signal. Examples of such signals were used on lines signaled by the radio electronic token block system.|$|E
50|$|Just west of {{the station}} lay Queensferry Junction where the line from Dalmeny via Kirkliston (now lifted) joined from the north. A train from Dalmeny came to a stand {{opposite}} the junction signalbox. The signalman had intended to keep it there until the 16:18 express from Edinburgh to Glasgow had passed. However he did not inform the driver {{and there was no}} <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> to hold him, instead a system of hand-signals was in use. The engine uncoupled and began to move towards the main line without his instructions. He put the main line signals to danger and blew his whistle but was unable to attract the driver's attention in the stormy conditions. The express, headed by NBR H class locomotive 874 Dunedin, was heavily laden with people returning from their New Year's holiday including many soldiers. It collided with the light engine at a speed of 30 mph, telescoping the first coach and derailing the second, killing 12 people and seriously injuring 46 more.|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} developed traffic signal control strategy known as traffic-responsive urban control (TUC) requires {{availability of a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> plan that is sufficiently efficient under undersaturated traffic conditions. To drop this requirement, the well-known Webster procedure for fixed-signal control derivation at isolated junctions is appropriately employed for real-time operation based on measured flows. It is demonstrated via simulation experiments and field application that the following hold: 1) The developed real-time demand-based approach is a viable real-time signal control strategy for undersaturated traffic conditions. 2) It can indeed be used within TUC to drop the requirement for a prespecified <b>fixed</b> <b>signal</b> plan. 3) It may, under certain conditions, contribute to more efficient results, compared with the original TUC method...|$|E
500|$|Within the tunnel, {{two lines}} were laid with a [...] gap between. To {{accommodate}} both the standard gauge trains of the GNR and the broad gauge trains of the GWR, the track was three-rail mixed gauge, the rail nearest the platforms being shared by both gauges. Signalling {{was on the}} absolute block method, using electric Spagnoletti block instruments and <b>fixed</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>signals</b> {{are only}} present at interlockings. They show a red over red aspect for “stop and stay,” a lunar (white) aspect for “proceed,” and a {{flashing}} lunar aspect for “proceed on diverging route” (only present on newer interlockings; older interlockings are being updated with signals that show this aspect). Tracks {{are divided into}} block sections, {{which can only be}} occupied by one train at a time, a method to protect against collisions used by most railway systems worldwide, but there are generally no <b>fixed</b> <b>signals</b> to protect block sections (signals tend to be only at beginning/end of route and just before track switches). Virtual signal aspects are transmitted to the train by a cab signaling system and displayed to the operator in the cab, as well as transmitted to the ATC system. Entry into an occupied block is prevented by an automatic train protection system (ATP), which supervises both manual and ATC operation and stops the train well before it would enter an occupied block.|$|R
50|$|Technological {{advances}} including mechanical <b>fixed</b> <b>signals</b> in the 1840s, {{the electric}} telegraph and block {{working in the}} 1850s, and proper mechanical interlocking from 1856, allowed safer, more expeditious train working, and more complicated track layouts to be controlled single-handedly. The advent of such technological advances gradually led to the provision of an enclosed workspace known as a signal box, signal cabin or interlocking tower.|$|R
