This study aims to describe the population that these data represent and compares the birthweight obtained from <b>health</b> <b>cards</b> with maternal recall data {{in terms of its}} socioeconomic patterning and as a risk factor for childhood growth failure. Methodology/Principal Findings: The analytic sample consisted of children aged 0 to 59 months with birthweight data obtained from <b>health</b> <b>cards</b> (n = 3227) and maternal recall (n = 16787). The difference between the card sample and the maternal recall sample in the distribution across household wealth, parental education, caste, religion, gender, and urban residence was compared using multilevel models.

The survey contains birthweight data from a majority of household wealth categories (. 5 % in every category for recall), both genders, all age groups, all caste groups, all religion groups, and urban and rural dwellers. However, children from the lowest quintile of household wealth were under-represented (4. 73 % in card and 8. 62 % in recall samples).

There were 36 million poor people covered by the program at the first semester. The study design was cross-sectional with collection of qualitative and quantitative data to describe the implementation program at Puskesmas. The total samples were 800 respondents with <b>health</b> <b>cards</b> chosen randomly from 4 districts/city in 4 provinces with different level of development (based on Indonesian Human Development Index).
