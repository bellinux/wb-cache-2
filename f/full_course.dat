5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the <b>full</b> <b>course</b> were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E

5|$|The final {{practice}} {{was held on}} a dry race track which allowed for faster lap times. Lotterer set the quickest time of the weekend so far at 1:57.368 recorded in the session's final minute, and was 0.011 seconds faster than the second-fastest car of Hülkenberg. Jani was a further five-tenths of a second behind in third place, and was narrowly faster than teammate Hartley in fourth. Sam Bird was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing car {{with a time of}} 2:08.415, four-tenths ahead of Matthew Howson's KCMG Oreca. Toni Vilander recorded the quickest LMGTE Pro time ahead of Fernando Rees in the No. 97 Aston Martin, while Pedro Lamy, driving the British marque's No. 98 car, was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am. A brief <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow flag was displayed when Bachler's back-end collided with the Pouhon corner tyre barrier, while Turner avoided going into the Les Combes wall and was temporarily beached in the turn's gravel trap. Both drivers returned to the track and continued.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's bodywork, but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain in his garage for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first <b>full</b> <b>course</b> caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E
5|$|Briscoe {{passed the}} Chip Ganassi Racing drivers {{after they were}} held up by slower cars to move into second place on lap 29. Green-flag pit stops began four laps later. Wilson spun {{at the end of}} the backstretch while braking for turn ten on the 36th lap after his right-rear shock {{absorber}} failed and drove slowly to his pit box to repair damage to his vehicle. Danica Patrick attempted to pass Baugette around the inside on lap 39, but lost control of her car and ran wide into the infield grass section and rejoined the track in 17th without damaging to her suspension. Andretti's front wing came apart on lap 46 while holding up four cars, and Scheckter ran wide as the four cars passed Andretti. The first <b>full</b> <b>course</b> caution of the event was necessitated on the following lap when Alex Lloyd spun into the grass and stalled his engine. Andretti made a pit stop for a replacement front wing during the caution. Racing resumed at the start of lap 51 with Power leading Castroneves, Briscoe and Dixon. Shortly afterward, de Silvestro was hit from behind by Viso who overheated his brakes, and went into the turn one tyre barrier, causing the second caution. Viso avoided making contact with teammate Tracy (who took avoiding action) on the same lap.|$|E

5|$|In March 1935 {{the threat}} from Nazi Germany {{prompted}} a series of expansion schemes which pushed the number of squadrons up to 163 (as per Expansion Scheme M, the last before the outbreak of war) {{and the number of}} aircraft to 2,549. But it was never fully implemented, and Scheme F, 124 Squadrons and 1,736 aircraft, was the only scheme that ran its <b>full</b> <b>course.</b> It did produce modern aircraft and it made adequate provision for reserves (75 percent), but again, the bomber forces received no less than 50 percent which averaged 57 percent over all schemes. Maritime air units never made up more than 12 per cent of British air strength. From a pre-expansion strength of just five squadrons, four of which were flying boats, the figure of maritime squadrons rose to 18 by September 1939, with a strength of just 176 aircraft. Some 16 of these were allocated to trade defence, but given Trenchard's policy (which was still in place after his retirement) of developing bombers for the maritime arm which could bolster the air offensive, most were not specialised ASW aircraft, and the Air Ministry was thoroughly uninterested in any aircraft which fell outside the bomber function.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of one minute and 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval in the No. 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven gravel trap, and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow flag. He was extracted from the gravel trap and drove back to the pit lane for car repairs. Jonny Kane in the No. 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of one minute and 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, while Carroll's Gulf Racing car was fastest in LMGTE Am, despite driving off the track in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the <b>full</b> <b>course</b> of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} allowed Jani to {{move into}} the lead but di Grassi stopped at Farm Curve with a motor generator unit problem shortly afterwards. His team's mechanics were allowed to tend to the Audi after travelling via a course car, extending the <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow as it was tended to. Di Grassi's race ended prematurely and one of the mechanics used a fire extinguisher to extinguish smoke bellowing from his car. The race resumed after 23 minutes with Tréluyer attacking Lieb, and upon being delayed by the No. 13 Rebellion Racing car, passed him {{to move into}} the lead on the approach to Maggots corner and pulled away on the Hangar straight. Rast stopped at the entrance of Maggots corner with a fuel pump pressure failure, causing him to lose the LMP2 lead to Watts and rejoined the field in third place in class. Rast recovered and passed Senna for second in LMP2 by using the grass at Stowe corner. Tréluyer was blocked by slower traffic allowing Lieb to close up to him on the Wellington straight. Lieb could not overtake because he was delayed by a pack of LMP2 cars. Rast closed up to Watts and overtook him to retake the LMP2 lead. Tréluyer and Lieb ran closely between each other before the former pulled away from Lieb.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, the No. 5 Toyota {{increased}} its lead over the No. 8 Audi to 38.778 seconds, {{while the first}} Audi moved into 12th position. The No. 1 Porsche returned to the pit lane {{for a change of}} front axel and fell down the order in LMP1 because of different tyre speeds of the vehicle's front wheels. G-Drive's No. 38 entry was issued with a two-minute stop-and-go penalty for its role in the collision with the No. 95 Aston Martin. Fässler nearly placed Davidson into the grass at Stavelot while lapping Extreme Speed Motorsports's Ligier. Fässler entered the pit lane for replacement front bodywork. Gulf's Porsche entry spun after contact with Emmanuel Collard's Ferrari at Rivage. The second <b>full</b> <b>course</b> caution was later necessitated when debris was located on three sections of the track. Davidson remained the leader at the restart, ahead of Duval, and immediately increased his advantage over the Audi driver. The No. 7 car hit the No. 36 Alpine at La Source, causing the latter to spin. The third round of pit stops commenced shortly afterwards when Audi and Toyota made their stops for fuel and driver changes. Kraihamer's No. 13 Rebellion Racing vehicle hit the LMP2 leader Tor Graves in the No. 44 Manor Oreca and his car was beached on La Source's apex {{for a long period of}} time before rejoining the event.|$|E
5|$|While {{coming across}} the Piquet and Rossiter battle Lotterer moved in front of {{teammate}} Jarvis to claim second place. Rusinov entered the pit lane from the LMP2 lead for left-rear bodywork repairs and Rast was handed the No. 26 Oreca. Piquet was able to pass Rossiter for eighth position overall while Turner moved ahead of the other Ford car to run in third in LMGTE Pro. The second round of pit stops began one minute later when Jarvis entered the pit lane and {{the remainder of the}} LMP1 field followed in response for driver changes. Benoît Tréluyer pushed hard and lost control of his car's back-end at Vale corner, allowing Jani to move into second position. Christensen's right-front tyre was punctured at Becketts corner and he made a pit stop for a replacement wheel which promoted Turner to second in the class. After changing drivers in the No. 42 Strakka Racing Gibson, Danny Watts overtook González at Brooklands corner for second position in LMP2. Hartley went to the outside of Wainwright driving through Farm Curve and his car's right-front quarter made contact with Wainwright's left-rear section. Hartley went over the bonnet of the No. 86 Porsche but avoided flipping over; both cars went off the track, skidding across the gravel trap, and into the barriers {{at the end of the}} Complex. Both Hartley and Wainwright retired from the event and a <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow flag was necessitated to allow the cars to be extracted from the track.|$|E

5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the inside for fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's vehicle stopped at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. By then, he had dropped {{to the back of}} the field, and later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been backed into Buemi, and moved in front of him at the start of the 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He braked late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E

Christian Ried overtook Yutaka Yamagishi for the LMGTE Am lead in the first corner before Mathias Lauda was able to claim the position on the following lap. Brundle drove slowly with a gearbox problem and made a pit stop from the LMP2 lead before being pushed into his garage to retire. The overall leading drivers made pit stops after two hours and 30 minutes which saw the deployment of the second <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow when one of the Toyota's dive planes was located in the sixth corner. Racing resumed four minutes later with Jani leading the field, ahead of teammate Bernhard and di Grassi. Jani held a ten-second lead over Bernhard as the race entered its halfway mark and the chance of rain decreased significantly. Webb stopped his car at the outside of the eleventh turn with smoke bellowing from his car and retired, prompting the third <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow.

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap Rosenqvist led from Bird, Vergne, Heidfeld, Gasly, Engel, Turvey, Dillmann, di Grassi, Evans, Prost, Sarrazin, d'Ambrosio, Félix da Costa, Duval, Carroll, Lynn, Piquet, Frijns and Abt. Bird was close behind Rosenqvist in the opening laps, while Heidfeld drew closer to both drivers. After {{starting}} ninth, Di Grassi was running in seventh place by the seventh lap. Engel went into the barriers lining the circuit, and drove to pit lane where his team made repairs to his car and set himself the objective of setting the race's fastest lap. However he did not achieve this as Abt recorded the race's fastest lap on his seventh lap. Abt completed a circuit in one minute and 3.898 seconds to earn one point. After locking his right-front brake, Evans ran wide, and stopped his car near the pit lane entry after lightly hitting the wall two laps later. Evans had difficulty reversing out of the barrier, prompting the event's first <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow flag. Gasly was the first driver to notice the <b>full</b> <b>course</b> yellow's deployment, slowing in turn ten, and fell back from the leading three runners.
