5|$|Following another Royal Commission {{investigation}} 1911, {{there were}} some rapid changes in prison policy. A new superintendent with outside experience, Hugh Hann, was appointed, {{and supported by the}} newly elected Labor government interested in penal reform. Fremantle Prison was partially used as a military gaol during both world wars. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942, which remained opened after the war. Pardelup Prison Farm was another prison outstation established in 1927 to reduce overcrowding at Fremantle. Both facilities were part of reforms made to the prison system, but significant changes to the operation of Fremantle Prison did not begin until the 1960s. Comptroller <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> Campbell introduced expedient prisoner assessments, officer training, work release programs, and social workers and welfare officers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1993 Aspin began to tell the White House that the five-year Defense budget, {{reflecting}} {{the results of the}} bottom-up review, would exceed the more than $1 trillion projected by the Clinton administration. In December 1993 he put the anticipated shortfall at no less than $50 billion, the consequence of inaccurate inflation estimates, a military pay raise, and failure to account for other Pentagon costs, including peacekeeping operations. The size of the force needed to meet the two regional wars scenario contributed to the projected budget shortfall. Furthermore, Aspin was on record as favoring the use of U.S. troops in regional conflicts, as opposed to other decisionmakers, including <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> Powell, chairman of the JCS. Aspin's departure from office early in 1994 left further decisions on the Defense budget to his successor.

40|$|The Military Intelligence (Research) Department of the British War Office was tasked in 1940 with {{encouraging}} and supporting armed resistance in occupied Europe and the Axis-controlled Middle East. The major contention {{of this paper}} is that, in doing so, MI(R) performed a key role in British strategy in 1940 - 42 and in the development of what are now known as covert operations. MI(R) developed an organic, but coherent doctrine for such activity which was influential upon the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and its own sub-branch, G(R), which applied this doctrine in practice in East Africa and the Middle East in 1940 - 41. It was also here that a number of key figures in the development of covert operations and special forces first cut their teeth, the most notable being Major <b>Generals</b> <b>Colin</b> Gubbins and Orde Wingate...|$|R

500|$|Initially, Operation Desert Shield {{involved}} a sea interdiction campaign that saw international warships detaining and inspecting tankers from Iraq. As the buildup continued, Schwarzkopf was occupied with planning an offensive operation against the Iraqi units along the border, sometimes working 18-hour days in planning, assisted by a close group of aides. He frequently met with subordinates and Saudi commanders. Schwarzkopf planned counters both for Iraq's large armored forces and air forces, {{as well as}} its elite Republican Guard forces. While planning, Schwarzkopf remained in frequent contact with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <b>General</b> <b>Colin</b> Powell (both Vietnam veterans) concerning Schwarzkopf's plans for the offensive. Schwarzkopf devised an operational plan, dubbed [...] "Operation Desert Storm," [...] to be based on overwhelming force and strong infantry attacks supported by artillery and armor. It incorporated the desert warfare strategies used by British commander Bernard Montgomery in his defeat of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel at the Second Battle of El Alamein in World War II. By November 8, Bush agreed to commit 400,000 U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia at Schwarzkopf's insistence. Schwarzkopf believed larger numbers of troops would reduce the likelihood of high casualties. He planned a strategic bombing campaign to precede an offensive into Kuwait, simultaneously striking the forward Iraqi forces and their supply lines. In the meantime, diplomatic solutions began to break down, and the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, January 15, 1991, passed without a solution.|$|E
