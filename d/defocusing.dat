Methods: Twenty-eight young adult subjects (14 myopes and 14 emmetropes) had eye biometrics measured before and then 30 and 60 minutes after exposure to monocular (right eye) <b>defocus.</b> Four different monocular <b>defocus</b> conditions were tested, each on a separate day: control (no <b>defocus),</b> myopic (+ 3 D <b>defocus),</b> hyperopic (- 3 D <b>defocus)</b> and diffuse (0. 2 density Bangerter filter) <b>defocus.</b> The fellow eye was optimally corrected (no <b>defocus).</b> Results: Imposed <b>defocus</b> caused small but significant changes in optical axial length (p< 0. 0001). A significant increase in optical axial length (mean change + 8 ± 14 μm, p= 0. 03) occurred following hyperopic <b>defocus,</b> and {{a significant reduction in}} optical axial length (mean change - 13 ± 14 μm, p= 0. 0001) was found following myopic <b>defocus.</b> A small increase in optical axial length was observed following diffuse <b>defocus</b> (mean change + 6 ± 13 μm, p= 0. 053). Choroidal thickness also exhibited some significant changes with certain <b>defocus</b> conditions. No significant difference was found between myopes and emmetropes in the changes in optical axial length or choroidal thickness with <b>defocus.</b> Conclusions: Significant changes in optical axial length occur in human subjects following 60 minutes of monocular <b>defocus.</b> The bi-directional optical axial length changes observed in response to <b>defocus</b> implies the human visual system is capable of detecting the presence and sign of <b>defocus</b> and altering optical axial length to move the retina towards the image plane...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the short-term changes in human axial length (AxL) {{in response to}} continuous and competing episodes of myopic and hyperopic <b>defocus.</b> Methods The right eye of 16 young adults was exposed to 60 min episodes of either continuous or competing myopic and hyperopic <b>defocus</b> (+ 3 D & - 3 D), with the left eye optimally corrected to maintain far accommodation. During competing <b>defocus,</b> the eye was exposed to either 30 min or 15 min of alternating cycles of myopic and hyperopic <b>defocus,</b> with the order of lens wear reversed in separate sessions to assess the effects of <b>defocus</b> order. During each 60 min trial, the subjects watched a movie at 6 m in low photopic conditions. The right eye’s AxL was measured at baseline and then at 15 min intervals using Lenstar optical biometry. A binocular beam splitter periscope system was used to maintain distance fixation (left eye) and <b>defocus</b> exposure (right eye) during measurements. Results AxL underwent a greater magnitude of change during continuous <b>defocus</b> than during competing <b>defocus.</b> The maximum AxL change observed during continuous hyperopic <b>defocus</b> was + 7 ± 2 µm of elongation (p = 0. 015) and during continuous myopic <b>defocus</b> was - 8 ± 2 µm of reduction in AxL (p = 0. 07). When the eye was exposed to 30 min cycles of competing myopic and hyperopic <b>defocus</b> of equal duration, the opposing blur sessions cancelled {{each other and the}} eye was at near baseline levels following the final <b>defocus</b> session (final change from baseline, both p > 0. 05). When the frequency of alternating cycles was 15 min, there was a slight AxL reduction after 60 min of myopic then hyperopic <b>defocus,</b> and hyperopic then myopic <b>defocus,</b> and were - 3 ± 2 µm and - 4 ± 2 µm, respectively (final change from baseline, both p > 0. 05) (Figure 1). Conclusions In the human eye, the AxL changes within minutes in response to short-term imposed myopic and hyperopic <b>defocus.</b> With competing <b>defocus,</b> at 30 min exposure frequencies, the effects of myopic and hyperopic blur largely cancel each other. At higher frequencies (15 min of alternating exposure), the effect on AxL of myopic <b>defocus</b> appears to be slightly more potent than hyperopic <b>defocus...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{intrinsic}} property of real aperture imaging {{has been that}} the observations tend to be <b>defocused.</b> This artifact has been used in an innovative manner by researchers for depth estimation, since the amount of <b>defocus</b> varies with varying depth in the scene. There have been various methods to model the <b>defocus</b> blur. We model the <b>defocus</b> process using the model of diffusion of heat. The diffusion process has been traditionally used in low level vision problems like smoothing, segmentation and edge detection. In this paper a novel application of the diffusion principle is made for generating the <b>defocus</b> space of the scene. The <b>defocus</b> space is the set of all possible observations for a given scene that can be captured using a physical lens system. Using the notion of <b>defocus</b> space we estimate the depth in the scene and also generate the corresponding fully focused equivalent pin-hole image. The algorithm described here also brings out the equivalence of the two modalities, viz. depth from focus and depth from <b>defocus</b> for structure recovery. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
