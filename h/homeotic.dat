5|$|Embryologists {{study how}} bodies develop, and the {{abnormalities}} {{when things go}} wrong, such as <b>homeotic</b> variants when one body part is changed into another (for instance, a fruit fly antenna becomes a leg with the Antennapedia mutant).|$|E
5|$|Bill McGinnis quickly {{discovered}} <b>homeotic</b> gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later {{also found in}} fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of <b>homeotic</b> genes that regulate development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|Drosophila melanogaster – Edward Lewis {{discovered}} the Drosophila Bithorax complex of <b>homeotic</b> genes.|$|E
25|$|Manatees are unusual amongst mammals in {{possessing}} {{just six}} cervical vertebrae, {{which may be}} due to mutations in the <b>homeotic</b> genes. All other mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, other than the two-toed and three-toed sloths.|$|E
25|$|Cloning {{studies have}} been carried out on DNA in the genes {{associated}} with the affected <b>homeotic</b> functions in the mutants discussed above. These studies used serial analysis of gene expression throughout floral development to show patterns of tissue expression, which, in general, correspond with the predictions of the ABC model.|$|E
25|$|Double-flower forms often {{arise when}} {{some or all}} of the stamens in a flower are {{replaced}} by petals. These types of mutations, where one organ in a developing organism is replaced with another, are known as <b>homeotic</b> mutations. They are usually recessive, although the double flower mutation in carnations exhibits incomplete dominance.|$|E
25|$|The {{methodology}} for studying flower development involves two steps. Firstly, {{the identification of}} the exact genes required for determining the identity of the floral meristem. In A. thaliana these include APETALA1 (AP1) and LEAFY (LFY). Secondly, genetic analysis is carried out on the aberrant phenotypes for the relative characteristics of the flowers, which allows the characterization of the <b>homeotic</b> genes implicated in the process.|$|E
25|$|In A. thaliana the type-B {{function}} mainly {{arises from}} two genes, APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI), {{both of which}} are MADS-box genes. A mutation of either of these genes causes the <b>homeotic</b> conversion of petals into sepals and of stamens into carpels. This also occurs in its orthologs in A. majus, which are DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO) respectively. For both species the active form of binding with DNA is that derived from the heterodimer: AP3 and PI, or DEF and GLO, dimerize. This is the form in which they are able to function.|$|E
25|$|Observations of <b>homeotic</b> {{mutations}} led to {{the formulation}} of the ABC model of flower development by E. Coen and E. Meyerowitz. According to this model, floral organ identity genes are divided into three classes: class A genes (which affect sepals and petals), class B genes (which affect petals and stamens), and class C genes (which affect stamens and carpels). These genes code for transcription factors that combine to cause tissue specification in their respective regions during development. Although developed through study of A. thaliana flowers, this model is generally applicable to other flowering plants.|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied {{as a model for}} flower development. The developing flower has four basic organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (which go on to form pistils). These organs are arranged in a series of whorls: four sepals on the outer whorl, followed by four petals inside this, six stamens, and a central carpel region. <b>Homeotic</b> mutations in A. thaliana result in the change of one organ to another — {{in the case of the}} agamous mutation, for example, stamens become petals and carpels are replaced with a new flower, resulting in a recursively repeated sepal-petal-petal pattern.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{recombinant}} DNA technology enabled biologists {{to start}} to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered <b>homeotic</b> genes, showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed {{that some of the}} regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the Pax6 gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} these <b>homeotic</b> genes {{determine}} an organ’s identity becomes evident when a gene that represents a particular function, for example the A gene, is not expressed. In Arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. This method for studying gene function uses reverse genetics techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through RNA interference. In other studies, using forward genetics techniques such as genetic mapping, it is {{the analysis of the}} phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest. The flowers may possess a non-functional or over expressed allele for the gene being studied.|$|E
25|$|The ABC {{model of}} flower {{development}} was first formulated by George Haughn and Chris Somerville in 1988. It {{was first used}} as a model to describe the collection of genetic mechanisms that establish floral organ identity in the Rosids, as exemplified by Arabidopsis thaliana, and the Asterids, as demonstrated by Antirrhinum majus. Both species have four verticils (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), which are defined by the differential expression {{of a number of}} <b>homeotic</b> genes present in each verticil. This means that the sepals are solely characterized by the expression of A genes, while the petals are characterized by the co-expression of A and B genes. The B and C genes establish the identity of the stamens and the carpels only require C genes to be active. It should be noted that type A and C genes are reciprocally antagonistic.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the floral}} organs of eudicotyledonous angiosperms {{are arranged in}} 4 different verticils, containing the sepals, petals, stamen and carpels. The ABC model states that the identity of these organs {{is determined by the}} <b>homeotic</b> genes A, A+B, B+C and C, respectively. In contrast with the sepal and petal verticils of the eudicots, the perigone of many plants of the Liliaceae family have two nearly identical external petaloid verticils (the tepals). In order to explain the floral morphology of the Liliaceae, van Tunen et al. proposed a modified ABC model in 1993. This model suggests that class B genes are not only expressed in verticils 2 and 3, but also in 1. It therefore follows that the organs of verticils 1 and 2 express class A and B genes and this is how they have a petaloid structure. This theoretical model has been experimentally proven through the cloning and characterization of homologs of the Antirrhinum genes GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS in a Liliaceae, the tulip Tulipa gesneriana. These genes are expressed in verticils 1,2 and 3.|$|E
500|$|This led to {{a second}} synthesis, at last {{including}} embryology as well as molecular genetics, phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo. In 1978, Edward B. Lewis discovered <b>homeotic</b> genes that regulate embryonic development in Drosophila fruit flies, which like all insects are arthropods, {{one of the major}} phyla of invertebrate animals.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{mutations}} that affect floral morphology, although the analysis of these mutants is a recent development. Supporting evidence {{for the existence of}} these mutations {{comes from the fact that}} a large number affect the identity of floral organs. For example, some organs develop in a location where others should develop. This is called <b>homeotic</b> mutation, which is analogous to HOX gene mutations found in Drosophila. In Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, the two taxa on which models are based, these mutations always affect adjacent verticils. This allows the characterization of three classes of mutation, according to which verticils are affected: ...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the terms}} being {{commonly}} interchanged, not all <b>homeotic</b> genes are Hox genes; the MADS-box genes are <b>homeotic</b> but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox genes {{are a subset}} of <b>homeotic</b> genes.|$|E
50|$|Much {{research}} has been done on <b>homeotic</b> genes in different organisms, ranging from basic understanding of how the molecules work to mutations to how <b>homeotic</b> genes affect the human body. Changing the expression levels of <b>homeotic</b> genes can negatively impact the organism. For example, in one study, a pathogenic phytoplasma caused <b>homeotic</b> genes in a flowering plant to either be significantly upregulated or downregulated. This led to severe phenotypic changes including dwarfing, defects in the pistils, hypopigmentation, and the development of leaf-like structures on most floral organs. In another study, {{it was found that the}} <b>homeotic</b> gene Cdx2 acts as a tumor suppressor. In normal expression levels, the gene prevents tumorgenesis and colorectal cancer when exposed to carcinogens; however, when Cdx2 was not well expressed, carcinogens caused tumor development. These studies, along with many others, show the importance of <b>homeotic</b> genes even after development.|$|E
50|$|<b>Homeotic</b> {{selector}} genes confer segment {{identity in}} Drosophila. They encode homeodomain proteins which interact with Hox and other <b>homeotic</b> genes to initiate segment-specific gene regulation. Homeodomain proteins are transcription factors that share a DNA-binding domain called the homeodomain. Changes in the expression {{and function of}} <b>homeotic</b> genes {{are responsible for the}} changes in the morphology of the limbs of arthropods {{as well as in the}} axial skeletons of vertebrates. Mutations in <b>homeotic</b> selector genes do not lead to elimination of a segment or pattern, but instead cause the segment to develop incorrectly.|$|E
50|$|Multicellular {{systems are}} {{composed}} {{of more than one}} <b>homeotic</b> gene. Each <b>homeotic</b> gene in this system puts together a different combination of sub-expression trees or ADFs, creating multiple cells or main programs.|$|E
50|$|Deﬁnitive {{evidence}} for a genetic basis of some <b>homeotic</b> transformations was obtained by isolating <b>homeotic</b> mutants. The ﬁrst <b>homeotic</b> mutant was found by Calvin Bridges in Thomas Hunt Morgan's laboratory in 1915. This mutant shows a partial duplication of the thorax and was therefore named Bithorax (bx). It transforms the third thoracic segment (T3) toward the second (T2). Bithorax arose spontaneously in the laboratory and has been maintained continuously as a laboratory stock ever since.|$|E
50|$|While the {{segmentation}} genes can {{specify the}} number, size, and polarity of segments, <b>homeotic</b> genes can specify {{the identity of}} the segment. The <b>homeotic</b> genes are activated by gap genes and pair-rule genes. The Antennapedia complex and the bithorax complex on the third chromosome contain the major <b>homeotic</b> genes required for specifying segmental identity (actually parasegmental identity). These genes are transcription factors and are expressed in overlapping regions that correlate with their position along the chromosome. These transcription factors regulate other transcription factors, cell surface molecules with roles in cell adhesion, and other cell signals. Later during development, <b>homeotic</b> genes are expressed in the nervous system in a similar anterior/posterior pattern. <b>Homeotic</b> genes are maintained throughout development through the modification of the condensation state of their chromatin. Polycomb genes maintain the chromatin in an inactive conformation while trithorax genes maintain chromatin in an active conformation.|$|E
50|$|Some MADS-box {{genes of}} {{flowering}} plants have <b>homeotic</b> functions like the HOX genes of animals. The floral <b>homeotic</b> MADS-box genes (such as AGAMOUS and DEFICIENS) {{participate in the}} determination of floral organ identity according to the ABC model of flower development.|$|E
5000|$|The homeotic-function {{of certain}} {{proteins}} was first postulated {{to be that}} of a [...] "selector" [...] as proposed by Antonio Garcia-Bellido. By definition selectors were imagined to be (transcription factor) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a tissue. While most animal <b>homeotic</b> functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all <b>homeotic</b> proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with <b>homeotic</b> functions or (mutant) phenotypes.The concept of <b>homeotic</b> selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by Michael Akam in a so-called [...] "post-selector gene" [...] model that incorporated additional findings and [...] "walked back" [...] the [...] "orthodoxy" [...] of selector-dependent stable binary switches.|$|E
50|$|In {{evolutionary}} developmental biology, <b>homeotic</b> {{genes are}} genes which regulate {{the development of}} anatomical structures in various organisms such as echinoderms, insects, mammals, and plants. This regulation is done via the programming of various transcription factors by the <b>homeotic</b> genes, and these factors affect genes through regulatory genetic pathways.|$|E
50|$|The {{transcription}} {{factors that}} are coded for by segmentation genes regulate yet another family of developmental control genes, the <b>homeotic</b> selector genes. These genes exist in two ordered groups on Drosophila chromosome 3. The order of the genes on the chromosome reflects the order that they are expressed along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing embryo. The Antennapedia group of <b>homeotic</b> selector genes includes labial, antennapedia, sex combs reduced, deformed, and proboscipedia. Labial and Deformed proteins are expressed in head segments where they activate the genes that define head features. Sex-combs-reduced and Antennapedia specify the properties of thoracic segments. The bithorax group of <b>homeotic</b> selector genes control the specializations of the third thoracic segment and the abdominal segments. Mutations in some <b>homeotic</b> genes can often be lethal and the cycle of life will end at embryogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} tissue {{compartments}} is deeply {{intertwined with the}} selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's body plan.In this context, newer insights into <b>homeotic</b> mechanisms were found by Albert Erives and colleagues by focusing on enhancer DNAs that are co-targeted by <b>homeotic</b> selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the transcription factors that function as <b>homeotic</b> selectors versus the transcription factors that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the Notch signaling pathway and the BMP signaling pathway.This work proposes that <b>homeotic</b> selectors function to [...] "license" [...] enhancer DNAs in a restricted tissue compartment so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via polyglutamine-mediated aggregation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a member}} of the EGF-like family of <b>homeotic</b> proteins.|$|E
50|$|Drosophila melanogaster - Edward Lewis {{discovered}} the Drosophila Bithorax complex of <b>homeotic</b> genes.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the complex}} {{multicellularity}} seen in animals, the multicellularity of land plants is developmentally organized into tissue and organ units via transcription factor genes with <b>homeotic</b> effects.While plants do have homeobox-containing genes, plant <b>homeotic</b> factors tend to possess MADS-box DNA binding domains.Interestingly, animal genomes also possess {{a small number}} MADS-box factors.Thus, in the independent evolution of multicellularity in plants and animals, different eukaryotic transcription factor families were co-opted to serve <b>homeotic</b> functions. MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by Michael Akam.|$|E
5000|$|The Hox {{genes are}} {{so named because}} {{mutations}} in them cause <b>homeotic</b> transformations. <b>Homeotic</b> transformations were first identified and studied by William Bateson in 1894, who coined the term [...] "homeosis". After the rediscovery of Mendel's genetic principles, Bateson and others realized that some examples of homeosis in ﬂoral organs and animal skeletons {{could be attributed to}} variation in genes.|$|E
50|$|AGAMOUS (AG) is a <b>homeotic</b> {{gene and}} MADS-box {{transcription}} factor from Arabidopsis thaliana. The TAIR AGI number is AT4G18960.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>homeotic</b> gene cluster, the bithorax complex, was {{discovered}} by Edward B. Lewis in 1978. Similar mutations in the complex were found to cluster together, leading Lewis to propose that these <b>homeotic</b> genes arose through a duplication mechanism which would conserve the clusters through evolution.The independent discoveries of the homeobox in the 1983 by Walter Gehring's laboratory at the University of Basel, Switzerland, and Thomas Kaufman's laboratory at Indiana University confirmed Lewis's theory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Homeotic</b> mutants in {{angiosperms}} {{are thought}} to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant Clarkia (Onagraceae), <b>homeotic</b> mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene. The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.|$|E
50|$|All <b>homeotic</b> genes share {{a segment}} of protein with a similar {{sequence}} and structure called the homeodomain (the DNA sequence is called the homeobox). This region of the <b>homeotic</b> proteins binds DNA. This domain was found in other developmental regulatory proteins, such as bicoid, as well in other animals including humans. Molecular mapping revealed that the HOX gene cluster has been inherited intact from a common ancestor of flies and mammals which indicates {{that it is a}} fundamental developmental regulatory system.|$|E
