40|$|The syntheses of difurfuryl {{diisocyanate}}s [e. g., ethylidenebis (2, 5 -furandiylmethyl-ene) diisocyanate (EDFI) ] {{have been}} reported in the literature. Difurfuryl diisocyanates are structurally similar to diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), which has proven to be an excellent adhesive for bonding wood composites. The MDI resin is synthesized from petroleum-derived chemicals, the EDFI resin is synthesized from biomass-derived chemicals. In this study, the mechanical properties of aspen <b>flakeboards</b> bonded with MDI and EDFI are compared. In general, results show that the strength properties of flakehoards bonded with MDI are only marginally better than those bonded with EDFI. Because EDFI is more viscous than is MDI, less than optimum atomization of the EDFI resin during spraying of the flakes is believed to he largely responsible for the differences in strength property values. The dry internal bond strength values of flakehoards bonded with MDI (1. 33 MPa; 193 lb/in. 2) and EDFI (0. 97 MPa; 140 lb/in 2) at 3 % resin content are significantly greater than the 0. 41 MPa (80 1 b/in. 2) required by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI/A 208. 1) for type- 2 medium-density particleboard. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ...|$|R
40|$|Ien resins, {{each with}} two replicates, were {{formulated}} from soy flour hydrolyzates and prepared with two hydrolyzation variables: phenol-to-soy flour ratios (w/w) of 4 / 4, 3 / 4, 2 / 4, l/ 4, and O/ 4 and sodium hydroxide-to-soy flour ratios (w/w) of 0. 39 and 0. 78. In addition, two commercially available phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins {{were used in}} the study as controls. The most ‘interesting result in the study of resin properties was gel time. When soy flour was hydrolyzed in the presence of phenol, the gel times were consistently longer with low caustic hydrolysis than that of high caustic hydrolysis. When soy flour was hydrolyzed without phenol, however, the gel times were longer with high caustic hydrolysis than that of low caustic hydrolysis. The internal bond (IB) strengths of oriented strandboard panels made with co-reacted soy hydrolyzate resins were highly comparable with boards made with the two phenolic control resins. When soy flour is hydrolyzed under high caustic conditions in the presence of phenol, acceptable co-reacted resins resulted; while under low caustic hydrolysis conditions with low phenol or no phenol at all, the best IB strengths were achieved. The overall high performance of the co-reacted resin prepared with phenol-to-soy flour ratio of l/ 4 under low caustic hydrolysis was the most interesting. It not only yielded the highest IB, attained one of the best dimensional stability results among all the co-reacted resins, and ranked high in modulus of elasticity. It also is significant that it was able to hydrolyze soy flour at low caustic content while maintaining a workableviscosity. With a 30 -percent phenol substitution with soy flour hydrolyzate, a co-reacted soy hydrolyzate resin system as developed in the study could result in more than 20 percent saving in material cost as compared to a conventional 2 /l ratio (F/P) phenolic resin system used for bonding structural <b>flakeboards...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{substantial}} increase in resin costs due to the recent energy crisis, increased public awareness {{to the problem of}} free formaldehyde from boards bonded with urea-formaldehyde resins, and a projected increase in the production of exterior board have emphasized the need for new and substitute adhesive systems. One new development is the use of lignosulfonates in combination with conventional phenol-formaldehyde resins for the production of particleboard. An experiment was carried out to test the applicability of such a substituted adhesive system. A commercial phenol-formaldehyde resin and six ammoniated-lignosulfonate-phenol-formaldehyde resins of varying viscosity were used in the fabrication of randomly oriented oak <b>flakeboards.</b> Resin application rates of 3, 4 1 / 2, and 6 percent were employed in combination with nominal board densities of 40 and 45 lbs/cu. ft. Test results indicated similar properties (internal bond, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, linear expansion, thickness swell, and weight gain) between the commercial phenolic resin and the substituted resins. Internal bond strength increased with increasing resin viscosity in the range studied, while modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, thickness swel 1, and weight gain properties generally decreased. Increasing resin application rate and board density resulted in an increase in board strength properties. In a second study, resin wetting and resin molecular weight properties were related to internal bond and modulus of rupture strength values. Contact angle measurements were used as indicators of resin wetting properties. Measurements were taken at 5, 30, 60, 300, and 600 second intervals. Resin molecular weight distributions were broken into low, medium, and high fractional molecular weight areas. No significant relationships were found between wetting properties and bond strength (IB, NOR). Wetting alone was not sufficient for the formation of a strong adhesive bond. Significant relationships were found, however, between fractional areas under the molecular weight distribution curve and internal bond strength. IB values were negatively related to low and medium molecular weight resin molecules, while high molecular weight resin molecules were positively related to IB values. Medium molecular weight area exhibited the highest degree of correlation. No correlation was found between resin molecular weight distribution and modulus of rupture values.

Low-fat soy and peanut flours and blood meal were hydrolyzed in an alkaline state, and PF-cross-linked protein resins were formulated by reacting the protein hydrolyzates with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) in solid-tosolid ratios ranging from 70 % to 50 % hydrolyzates and 30 % to 50 % PF. Physical properties of medium density fiberboard (MDF) bonded with protein-based phenolic resins were compared to those of boards bonded with ureaformaldehyde (UF) and PF resins, and <b>flakeboard</b> bonded with soy protein-based phenolic resin was compared to PF-bonded board.

This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the adhesive properties of crosslinked soy flour and/or soy hydrolyzate with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins for use in structural panels. Neutral phenolic soy (NPS) and alkaline phenolic soy (APS) resins were prepared and used to bond southern pine plywood. Adhesive bond quality of the soybean-based phenolic resins was evaluated by glueline shear test following the procedure detailed in Product Standard PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. Within the range of variable levels investigated, the following conditions produced higher wet wood failure than a control glue mix. For NPS resins best results were obtained with a 160 cps PF, a 30 minute assembly time, and no extender. For APS resins best results were obtained with a 50 cps PF, a 200 °C press temperature, 19 % corn-cob powder, and a 60 minute assembly time. Comparable results were obtained with either a 40 % or 50 % PF level in the resins. Under these conditions, the wet wood failure of plywood bonded with both resins approached the requirement of PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. The APS resins were also used to fabricate homogeneous hybrid poplar flakeboards with different resin solid levels (5 %, 7 %, and 9 %), press temperatures (175 and 200 °C), and press times of 8 and 10 minutes. Internal bond strength, wet modulus of rupture, and dimensional stabilities of <b>flakeboard</b> improved with increased press time, press temperature, and PF level in the resins. In particular, increased press time can be used to offset the poor internal bonding associated with high resin content and the excessive moisture present in the mat. However, APS resin-bonded flakeboards provided higher mechanical and better dimensional stability properties compared to the Canadian Standard Association O 437 standard, except for modulus of elasticity, which could be easily improved by flake alignment. Optimum production condition for <b>flakeboard</b> bonded with the APS resins are a 5 % resin level, a 50 % PF level, a 200 °C press temperature, and an 8 minute press time.
