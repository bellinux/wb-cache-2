25|$|During World War II, the U.S. needed greater {{aluminum}} {{supplies to}} build airplanes. Aluminum plants required {{huge amounts of}} electricity. To provide the power, TVA engaged {{in one of the}} largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the U.S. By early in 1942, when the effort reached its peak, 12 hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time, and design and construction employment reached a total of 28,000. The largest project of this period was the Fontana Dam. After negotiations led by Vice-President Harry Truman ("I want aluminum.

25|$|An imprisoned Billy then meets Juan Mendoza, {{for whom}} the bandits work. He reveals he is Billy's father. He {{explains}} Marisa was his woman, but she left him for Thomas McCall, and that the medallion she took from him {{is the key to}} the location of the Gold of Juarez. He sent his men to Hope to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> her, but when they found she didn't have it, they killed her and Thomas. Billy explains he lost the medallion in the river, but Mendoza doesn't believe him, and sends him into the desert, giving him one hour to find the gold, or he will kill Molly. Using his memory of the shape of the medallion and his mother's story, Billy is able to locate the Gold in a hidden underground passage. However, Mendoza has followed him, and attempts to kill him. Billy flees, and is rescued by Ray, who tells him to get to safety as he returns to Mendoza's alcazar to rescue Molly. Ray then reveals his own backstory; he and Thomas were running cattle over the Mexican border when they met Marisa. They both fell in love with her, although she was Mendoza's woman, and she chose Thomas over Ray. They fled to the caverns in which the Gold was hidden, but Ray tracked them. There, he confronted Thomas. Their younger brother, William, a priest, attempted to intervene, but Ray killed him. On that day, Ray renounced violence and embraced God. Believing the gold to be cursed, he, Marisa and Thomas agreed to leave it behind and seal the cavern.|$|E

500|$|The version {{used for}} the first test {{screening}} featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it. The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] if he can <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as {{they are about to}} escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the [...] "theft" [...] of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.|$|E

500|$|The network had {{initially}} planned to place Star Trek in the 7:30pm Monday-night time slot freed up by The Man from U.N.C.L.E. completing its run. Instead, the enraged George Schlatter forced the network to insert Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In into the slot, and Roddenberry's series {{was moved to}} 10:00pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: [...] "I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure not going to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the profits of Star Trek." [...] Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him [...] "the opportunity {{to become the first}} chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series." [...] Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as [...] "AMT", which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.|$|E

2500|$|Yang {{states that}} people's democracy, unlike {{parliamentary}} democracy, realises {{the principle of}} [...] "popular sovereignty". The basis for {{the argument is that}} in a parliamentary democracy, a system in which ordinary people can vote for different parties, the parties available are in the pockets of the bourgeoisie. Parties can only win, Yang claims, if they have enough money—when parties have money, they <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the bourgeoisie. This relationship turns the political parties contesting the election to subservient tools of the bourgeoisie, and makes them govern in their interest. While a system with multi-party elections, rotational government and parliaments looks more democratic, it is in fact beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not the people. In contrast, the people's democratic system with People's Congresses realises popular sovereignty through a mixture electoral and consultative democracy. Unlike in parliamentary democracies Yang adds, people standing for elections for seats in people's congresses are financed state, thus giving every candidate an equal chance of getting elected. Yang claims that;All political parties [...] bear the trust of the people, all implement their duties according to the law and under the leadership of the Communist Party, and serve the people.|$|E
