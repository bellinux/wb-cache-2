Between 1953 and 1956, there were intermittent clashes along all of Israel's borders as Arab terrorism and breaches of the ceasefire resulted in Israeli counter-raids. Palestinian fedayeen attacks, often organized and sponsored by the Egyptians, were made from (Egyptian occupied) Gaza. Fedayeen attacks led to a <b>growing</b> <b>cycle</b> of violence as Israel launched reprisal attacks against Gaza. In 1954 the Uzi submachine gun first entered use by the Israel Defense Forces. In 1955 the Egyptian government began recruiting former Nazi rocket scientists for a missile program.|$|E
500|$|The 1971 Iraq poison grain {{disaster}} was a mass {{methylmercury poisoning}} incident {{that began in}} late 1971. Grain treated with a methylmercury fungicide and never {{intended for human consumption}} was imported into Iraq as seed grain from Mexico and the United States. Due to a number of factors, including foreign-language labelling and late distribution within the <b>growing</b> <b>cycle,</b> this toxic grain was consumed as food by Iraqi residents in rural areas. People suffered from paresthesia (numbness of skin), ataxia (lack of coordination of muscle movements) and vision loss, symptoms similar to those seen when Minamata disease affected Japan. The recorded death toll was 459 people, but figures at least ten times greater have been suggested. [...] The 1971 poisoning was the largest mercury poisoning disaster when it occurred, with cases peaking in January and February 1972 and stopping by the end of March.|$|E

40|$|Regional {{distributions}} of crop diversity {{are important to}} take into account for the spatial design of in situ, farmer-participatory interventions in crop genetic management. Regional seed flows are an important factor in shaping geographical {{distributions of}} crop diversity. This study contributes to the insight in these seed flows, focusing on maize (Zea mays L.) in Chimaltenango, an area in the western highlands of Guatemala. A social survey of 257 households on different aspects of seed management produced information on cultivar naming, seed sources, reasons and causes of the discontinuation of seed lots, and important explanatory variables associated with different seed sources. A small portion of the reported seed lots originated from regional seed sources. The main motivation of regional seed exchange and the discontinuation of seed lots was to achieve change in plant characteristics of the crop, especially to obtain lower plants and shorter <b>growing</b> <b>cycles.</b> It is argued that farmer selection fails to achieve such change, and in fact leads to an equilibrium with high plants and long <b>growing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Seed exchange functions as an escape to this trend. Other factors of influence on seed exchange are altitude and ethnicity. The study also highlights the issue of geographical directionality in seed exchange patterns...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{and water}} balance {{parameters}} were measured in two commercial vineyards in the semiarid {{region of the}} São Francisco river basin, Brazil. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) was acquired with the Bowen ratio surface energy balance method. The ratio of the latent heat flux to the available energy, or evaporative fraction (EF), was 81 % on average for two <b>growing</b> <b>cycles</b> in wine grape and 88 % for two growing seasons in table grape. Energy partitioning in this last vineyard was higher due to microsprinkler irrigation conditions and greater soil cover promoted by the overhead horizontal trellis systems. The accumulated ET from pruning to harvest in wine grape was 438 and 517 mm {{for the first and}} second <b>growing</b> <b>cycles,</b> respectively. Table grape consumed less water than wine grape (393 and 352 mm for the first and second growing seasons, respectively) due to shorter crop stages. Beneficial transpiration (T) was 89 and 81 % of total ET for wine and table grape, respectively. Brazilian semiarid climate allows 2. 5 production cycles per year for vineyards. The yield was in average of 6183 kg ha¿ 1 for two cycles of wine grape and 11, 200 kg ha¿ 1 for one short growing season of table grape, corresponding to a bio-physical water productivity per unit ET of 1. 06 kg m¿ 3 (or 1. 02 L wine m¿ 3) and 3. 18 kg m¿ 3, respectively. Table grape showed a significantly higher economic water productivity (US$ 6. 51 m¿ 3) than wine grape (US$ 0. 93 m¿ 3). These values are much favorable than for staple crops...|$|R
