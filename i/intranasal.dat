5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice {{have been shown to}} be susceptible to poliovirus infection through <b>intranasal</b> inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{states that}} zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also {{observed}} in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based <b>intranasal</b> cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and <b>intranasal</b> midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of <b>intranasal</b> fentanyl {{is about}} 70–90%, {{but with some}} imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, <b>intranasal</b> fentanyl is available in doses of 50, 100, and 200 µg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of <b>intranasal</b> fentanyl with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900 out-of-hospital patients.|$|E
25|$|In children, <b>intranasal</b> {{fentanyl}} {{is useful}} {{for the treatment of}} moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{was under}} {{development}} by Winston Pharmaceuticals in an <b>intranasal</b> formulation {{for the treatment}} of headache. As of August 2015, it was in phase II clinical trials for this indication.|$|E
25|$|To {{help with}} breastfeeding: Oxytocin is {{sometimes}} prescribed for mothers to stimulate breast milk production {{to help with}} feeding their baby. However, women receiving <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin per day before breastfeeding produced only slightly more milk after two days.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone can be {{administered}} orally, intranasally, via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection, or rectally. The bioavailability of oral administration of oxycodone averages 60–87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; <b>intranasal</b> varies between {{individuals with a}} mean of 46%.|$|E
25|$|Micronized estradiol, via {{the oral}} route, was first {{evaluated}} in 1972, {{and this was}} followed by the evaluation of vaginal and <b>intranasal</b> micronized estradiol in 1977. Oral micronized estradiol was first approved in the United States under the brand name Estrace in 1975.|$|E
25|$|A vaccine {{administration}} may be oral, by injection (intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous), by puncture, transdermal or <b>intranasal.</b> Several recent {{clinical trials}} {{have aimed to}} deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up-taken by the common mucosal immunity system, thus avoiding the need for injections.|$|E
25|$|For {{unconfirmed}} acute sinusitis, <b>intranasal</b> corticosteroids {{have not}} {{been found to be}} better than a placebo either alone or in combination with antibiotics. For cases confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy, treatment with corticosteroids alone or in combination with antibiotics is supported. The benefit, however, is small.|$|E
25|$|Affecting {{generosity}} {{by increasing}} empathy during perspective taking: In a neuroeconomics experiment, <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin increased generosity in the Ultimatum Game by 80%, {{but had no}} effect in the Dictator Game that measures altruism. Perspective-taking is not required in the Dictator Game, but the researchers in this experiment explicitly induced perspective-taking in the Ultimatum Game by not identifying to participants into which role they would be placed. Serious methodological questions have arisen, however, {{with regard to the}} role of oxytocin in trust and generosity. Empathy in healthy males {{has been shown to be}} increased after <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin This is most likely due to the effect of oxytocin in enhancing eye gaze. There is some discussion about which aspect of empathy oxytocin might alter – for example, cognitive vs. emotional empathy.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{learning}} and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can impair memory retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks. However, oxytocin {{does seem to}} facilitate {{learning and}} memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces.|$|E
25|$|Some {{preparations}} such as nasal sprays and inhalers {{may result}} in a rapid response, but the fast onset of high blood levels may compromise safety. In addition, the expense of some of these appliances may greatly reduce their cost-effectiveness. In children it is unclear if <b>intranasal</b> fentanyl is as good as or the same as morphine.|$|E
25|$|Direct nose-to-brain drug {{delivery}} is being explored {{as a means}} to achieve higher, and hopefully more effective, drug concentrations in the brain. A clinical phase I/II study with glioblastoma patients in Brazil investigated the natural compound perillyl alcohol for <b>intranasal</b> delivery as an aerosol. The results were encouraging and as of 2016 a similar trial has been initiated in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Perforated septum – The {{reconstruction}} of a saddle nose {{caused by a}} (collapsed) perforated septum, or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), sarcoidosis, {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA), relapsing polychondritis, by <b>intranasal</b> drug use, and by excessive nasal aerosol use. The saddle nose deformity resulting from lost dorsum support is reconstructed using autologous bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts.|$|E
25|$|Nasal administration: Oxytocin is a peptide that is {{effectively}} {{distributed to the}} brain when administered intranasally via a nasal spray, after which it reliably crosses the blood–brain barrier and exhibits psychoactive effects in humans. No serious adverse effects with short-term application of oxytocin with 18~40nbsp&IU (36-80nbsp&mcg) have been recorded. <b>Intranasal</b> oxytocin has a central duration of at least 2.25nbsp&hours {{and as long as}} 4nbsp&hours.|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac was {{developed}} in 1989 by Syntex Corp. (now part of Roche). It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. The eye-drop formulation {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1992. An <b>intranasal</b> formulation was approved by the FDA in 2010 for short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. As of 2015, the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is less than US$25.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with vWD type 1 and vWD type 2A, desmopressin is available as different preparations, recommended {{for use in}} cases of minor trauma, or in preparation for dental or minor surgical procedures. Desmopressin stimulates the release of vWF from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the levels of vWF (as well as coagulant factor VIII) three- to five-fold. Desmopressin is also available as a preparation for <b>intranasal</b> administration (Stimate) and as a preparation for intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|Nasally {{administered}} oxytocin {{has been}} reported to reduce fear, possibly by inhibiting the amygdala (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses). Indeed, studies in rodents have shown oxytocin can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala. Some researchers have argued oxytocin has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since <b>intranasal</b> administration of oxytocin also increases envy and Schadenfreude. Individuals who receive an <b>intranasal</b> dose of oxytocin identify facial expressions of disgust faster than individuals who do not receive oxytocin. Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, oxytocin increases the salience of cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of oxytocin, individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo. Oxytocin modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats that are genetically modified to have a surplus of oxytocin receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. Oxytocin enhances the aversive social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the aversive stimulus is encountered again.|$|E
25|$|Insulin also {{influences}} {{other body}} functions, such as vascular compliance and cognition. Once insulin enters the human brain, it enhances learning and memory and benefits verbal memory in particular. Enhancing brain insulin signaling {{by means of}} <b>intranasal</b> insulin administration also enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that central nervous insulin contributes to the co-ordination {{of a wide variety}} of homeostatic or regulatory processes in the human body. Insulin also has stimulatory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, thus favoring fertility.|$|E
25|$|Routes of {{administration}} that progesterone {{has been used}} by include oral, <b>intranasal,</b> transdermal/topical, vaginal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous injection. Oral progesterone {{has been found to be}} inferior to vaginal and intramuscular progesterone in terms of absorption (low) and clearance rate (rapid). Intravaginal progesterone is available in the forms of progesterone gel, rings, and suppositories or pessaries. Advantages of intravaginal progesterone over oral administration include high bioavailability, rapid absorption, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, sustained plasma concentrations, and a local endometrial effect, while advantages of intravaginal progesterone relative to intramuscular injection include greater convenience and lack of local injection site pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intranasal</b> {{progesterone}} as a {{nasal spray}} {{has been found}} to be effective in achieving therapeutic levels, and was not associated with nasal irritation, but was associated with an unpleasant taste of the spray. Rectal, intramuscular, and intravenous routes may be inconvenient, especially for long-term treatment. Plasma levels of progesterone are similar after vaginal and rectal administration in spite of the different routes of administration, and rectal administration is an alternative to vaginal progesterone in conditions of vaginal infection, cystitis, recent childbirth, or when barrier contraception methods are used. Intramuscular injection of progesterone may achieve much higher levels of progesterone than normal luteal phase concentrations and levels achieved with other routes.|$|E
25|$|MPyV is {{primarily}} spread among mice via the <b>intranasal</b> route and is shed in urine. Genetic susceptibility to MPyV infection among mice varies significantly, {{and not all}} MPyV strains are oncogenic. In general, only newborns and immunosuppressed mice (usually transgenic) develop tumors upon infection; although originally observed {{as a cause of}} parotid gland tumors, the virus may induce solid tumors {{in a wide variety of}} tissue types of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin. Although viruses in circulation among feral mice can be tumorigenic, under natural conditions the virus does not cause tumors; maternal antibodies have been shown to be critical in protecting neonates. It has been described as rare in modern laboratory mouse research colonies.|$|E
25|$|Training {{problems}} under previous fire chiefs {{became apparent}} under Ellerbe as well. In 2011, the firefighters' union criticized the chief for {{cutting back on}} training, which it said had seen {{a sharp drop in}} the past year. The issue arose again in August 2012. Five firefighters were injured during a fire at 48th Place NE in April 2011, and a 500-page investigation of the incident found that training was poor, equipment old or insufficient, and firefighting protocols lax or inadequate. Additionally, the report urged the department to establish a database of abandoned buildings, buy more thermal imaging cameras, and add oral and <b>intranasal</b> pain-killing medications to ambulances. Most of the recommendations in the report had been suggested previously, but never implemented.|$|E
25|$|In {{reconstructive}} rhinoplasty, the {{defects and}} deformities that the plastic surgeon encounters, and must restore to normal function, form, and appearance include broken and displaced nasal bones; disrupted and displaced nasal cartilages; a collapsed {{bridge of the}} nose; congenital defect, trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), autoimmune disorder, cancer, <b>intranasal</b> drug-abuse damages, and failed primary rhinoplasty outcomes. Rhinoplasty reduces bony humps, and re-aligns the nasal bones after they are cut (dissected, resected). When cartilage is disrupted, suturing for re-suspension (structural support), {{or the use of}} cartilage grafts to camouflage a depression allow the re-establishment of the normal nasal contour of the nose for the patient. When the bridge of the nose is collapsed, rib-cartilage, ear-cartilage, or cranial-bone grafts can be used to restore its anatomic integrity, and thus the aesthetic continuity of the nose. For augmenting the nasal dorsum, autologous cartilage and bone grafts are preferred to (artificial) prostheses, because of the reduced incidence of histologic rejection and medical complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} {{principles for}} the surgical reconstruction of a nose {{derive from the}} essential operative principles of plastic surgery: that the applied procedure and technique(s) yield the most satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcome. Hence, the rhinoplastic reconstruction of a new nasal subunit, of virtually normal appearance, {{can be done in}} a few procedural stages, using <b>intranasal</b> tissues to correct defects of the mucosa; cartilage battens to brace against tissue contraction and depression (topographic collapse); axial skin flaps designed from three-dimensional (3-D) templates derived from the topographic subunits of the nose; and the refinement of the resultant correction with the subcutaneous sculpting of bone, cartilage, and flesh. Nonetheless, the physician-surgeon and the rhinoplasty patient must abide the fact that the reconstructed nasal subunit is not a nose proper, but a collagen-glued collage—of forehead skin, cheek skin, mucosa, vestibular lining, nasal septum, and fragments of ear cartilage—which is perceived as a nose only because its contour, skin color, and skin texture are true to the original nose.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent <b>intranasal</b> irritation.|$|E
500|$|Recently, {{a fourth}} TgPVR mouse model was developed. These [...] "cPVR" [...] mice carry hPVR cDNA, {{driven by a}} β-actin promoter, and have proven {{susceptible}} to poliovirus through intracerebral, intramuscular, and <b>intranasal</b> routes. In addition, these mice are capable of developing the bulbar form of polio after <b>intranasal</b> inoculation.|$|E
500|$|Treatments {{that may}} help with {{symptoms}} include simple pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). It, however, is not clear if acetaminophen helps with symptoms. [...] It is not known if over the counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children {{due to a lack}} of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. <b>Intranasal</b> corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.|$|E
2500|$|Trust is {{increased}} by oxytocin. Disclosure of emotional events {{is a sign}} of trust in humans. When recounting a negative event, humans who receive <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin share more emotional details and stories with more emotional significance. Humans also find faces more trustworthy after receiving <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin. In a study, participants who received <b>intranasal</b> oxytocin viewed photographs of human faces with neutral expressions and found them to be more trustworthy {{than those who did not}} receive oxytocin. This may be because oxytocin reduces the fear of social betrayal in humans. Even after experiencing social alienation by being excluded from a conversation, humans who received oxytocin scored higher in trust on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. [...] Moreover, in a risky investment game, experimental subjects given nasally administered oxytocin displayed [...] "the highest level of trust" [...] twice as often as the control group. Subjects who were told they were interacting with a computer showed no such reaction, leading to the conclusion that oxytocin was not merely affecting risk aversion. When there is a reason to be distrustful, such as experiencing betrayal, differing reactions are associated with oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) differences. Those with the CT haplotype experience a stronger reaction, in the form of anger, to betrayal.|$|E
2500|$|Central DI and gestational DI {{respond to}} {{desmopressin}} which is given as <b>intranasal</b> or oral tablets. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsive medication, {{has also had}} some success {{in this type of}} DI. Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own four to six weeks following labor, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies. [...] In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is not usually an option.|$|E
2500|$|Free base bufotenin taken sublingually {{was found}} to be {{identical}} to <b>intranasal</b> use. The potency, duration, and psychedelic action was the same. Ott found vaporized free base bufotenin active from 2–8mg with 8mg producing [...] "ring-like, swirling, colored patterns with eyes closed". He noted that the visual effects of insufflated bufotenine were verified by one colleague, and those of vaporized bufotenine by several volunteers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{surgical}} approaches {{can be used}} to access the sinuses and these have generally shifted from external/extranasal approaches to <b>intranasal</b> endoscopic ones. [...] The benefit of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is its ability to allow for a more targeted approach to the affected sinuses, reducing tissue disruption, and minimizing post-operative complications. The use of drug eluting stents such as propel mometasone furoate implant may help in recovery after surgery.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{ethnobotanist}} Jonathan Ott {{published the}} results [...] {{of a study}} in which he self-administered free base bufotenine via insufflation (5–100mg), sublingually (50mg), intrarectally (30mg), orally (100mg) and via vaporization (2–8mg). Ott reported “visionary effects" [...] of <b>intranasal</b> bufotenine and that the [...] "visionary threshold dose" [...] by this route was 40mg, with smaller doses eliciting perceptibly psychoactive effects. He reported that [...] "intranasal bufotenine is throughout quite physically relaxing; in no case was there facial rubescence, nor any discomfort nor disesteeming side effects".|$|E
2500|$|EMT is {{the next}} level of EMS. [...] The {{procedures}} and skills allowed at this level include all EMR skills as well as nasopharyngeal airway, pulse oximetry, glucometry, splinting, use of a cervical collar, traction splinting, complicated childbirth delivery, and medication administration (such as epinephrine auto-injectors, oral glucose gel, aspirin (ASA), nitroglycerin, and albuterol). Some areas may add to the scope of practice for EMT's, including <b>intranasal</b> nalaxone administration, use of mechanical CPR devices, administration of intramuscular epinephrine and glucagon, insertion of additional airway devices, and CPAP. [...] Training requirements and treatment protocols vary from area to area.|$|E
