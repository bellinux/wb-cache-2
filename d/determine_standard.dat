Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers to <b>determine</b> <b>standard</b> base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result, the front surface curve is more standardized and the characteristics that generate a person's unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry of the back surface of the lens.|$|E

This paper reports on the initial phase of a project that involved collecting and analysing assessment tasks across all subjects in a Bachelor of Education (Primary) program at a regional university in order to determine the range of task types. The findings of this project indicate that student teachers would be better equipped to meet assessment demands if provided with more support as they strive to respond to assessment tasks.

Metonymic names are to be treated differently to improve performance of geographic information retrieval (GIR).

The evaluation of this method is two-fold: First, we use a memory based learner to train a classifier and <b>determine</b> <b>standard</b> evaluation measures such as F-score and accuracy. Second, we perform retrieval experiments based on the Geo-CLEF data (newspaper article corpus and queries) from 2005.

Evaluation results indicate that, using a large annotated corpus of location names, a classifier based on shallow features achieves adequate performance, and removing metonymic senses from a database index yields a higher performance for GIR...|$|E
