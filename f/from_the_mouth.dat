5|$|The {{following}} {{lists are}} ordered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> {{of the river}} to its source.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores have no brain {{or central}} nervous system, but instead have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) that forms a ring round {{the mouth and}} is densest near {{structures}} such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (if present) and the sensory complex furthest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{can take}} a long time. The food moves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial {{digestion}} occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{is limited}} to the lower reaches of the river. Hatchery Chinook salmon and summer and winter steelhead are {{sometimes}} caught near the confluence with the Sandy River, and catch and release fishing for wild trout is allowed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the river {{to the edge of the}} Bull Run watershed reserve.|$|E
5|$|Monument 67 is a badly eroded Olmec-style {{sculpture}} {{showing a}} figure emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of a jaguar, {{with one hand}} raised and gripping a staff. Traces of a helmet are visible. It is located {{to the west of}} Structure 12 and dates to the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to rough}} surf from the {{precursor}} low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory {{for much of}} the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued {{for much of the}} South Carolina coastline.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{flanked by}} areas prone to {{flooding}} during a 100 year flood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Negro Hollow upstream to its headwaters. Negro Hollow and its unnamed tributaries are also surrounded by areas prone to flooding during a 100-year flood for much of their length. Both of the unnamed tributaries of Messers Run are surrounded by such areas {{for the majority of}} their length.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Altamaha River in Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina. The next day, the watch {{was replaced with}} a tropical storm warning, which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in Corolla, North Carolina before the storm moved ashore. In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties.|$|E

40|$|Chamelea gallina clams {{collected}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> {{of rivers}} along the Adriatic Sea (central Italy) {{were found to}} harbor Cryptosporidium parvum (genotype 2), which is the lineage involved in zoonotic transmission. The clams were collected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> of rivers near whose banks ruminants are brought to graze. This paper reports the environmental spread of C. parvum in Italy and highlights the fact that genotyping of seaborne Cryptosporidium isolates is a powerful tool with which to investigate the transmission patterns and epidemiology of this microorganis...|$|R
5|$|Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a {{rubble masonry}} stone arch bridge over Plunketts Creek in Plunketts Creek Township, Lycoming County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It was built between 1840 and 1875, {{probably}} closer to 1840, when the road along the creek between the unincorporated villages of Barbours and Proctor was constructed. Going upstream <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{the bridge was}} the third to cross the creek, hence its name.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the body}} of many species is almost {{radially}} symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to the opposite end). However, since {{only two of the}} canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have rotational symmetry, in other words if the animal rotates in a half-circle it looks the same as when it started.|$|E
5|$|The First Fork is {{the second}} largest {{tributary}} and has its source in Cummings Township. It flows south-southeast passing to the southwest of Little Round Top and Puterbaugh Mountain, then leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau at Fishery Point. It then enters Mifflin Township, where it joins Larrys Creek just south of Salladasburg, 4.2 miles (6.8km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Historically, much of the First Fork was protected {{as part of the}} Ogontz Lodge, a private hunting and fishing club.|$|E

5|$|The Thalassocalycida, only {{discovered}} in 1978 and known from only one species, are medusa-like, with bodies that are shortened in the oral-aboral direction, and short comb-rows {{on the surface}} furthest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> originating from near the aboral pole. They capture prey by movements of the bell and possibly by using two short tentacles.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{was first}} scientifically {{described}} by Thomas Say, a naturalist, in September 1819 {{on the site}} of Lewis and Clark's Council Bluffs, 15 miles up the Missouri River <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Platte during a government-sponsored expedition with Major Stephen Long. He had the first edition of the Lewis and Clark journals in hand, which contained Biddle's edited version of Lewis's observations dated May 5, 1805. His account was published in 1823.|$|E
5|$|The final {{preliminary}} {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus Booker T. After Booker T backed Angle {{into the ring}} ropes and executed a shoulder charge, Angle began to bleed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> The match saw exchange offense from both Angle and Booker T. The match {{came to an end}} when Angle attempted an Angle Slam, but Booker T grabbed Angle's leg and rolled him into a pinfall victory.|$|E
40|$|From swabs {{obtained}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> of 59 captive macropods and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic {{bacteria and}} fungi, {{the most frequent}} isolates were streptococci and aerobic Gram-negative rods. Other isolates, in order of diminishing frequency, were Gram-positive non-sporulating rods and filaments, staphylococci/micrococci, aerobic Gram-negative cocci, fungi, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, anaerobic Gram-negative rods and filaments, species of Bacillus and Clostridium, {{and members of the}} Simonsiellaceae. No anaerobic Gram-negative cocci were isolated, and spirochaetes were seen only in one animal with periodontal pockets. Smears of material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> of 5 wild wallabies showed organisms resembling those found in the captive animals...|$|R

5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Mississippi River to Pensacola, Florida. Sixhours later, the warning was extended westward to Morgan City, Louisiana. The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana, and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs. Officials advised small craft to remain at port from Port O'Connor, Texas to Pensacola, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate to feed them. Indeed, behaviours of mouth to mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E
