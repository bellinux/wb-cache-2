5|$|On 14 June 1999, Kouao and Climbié met Carl Manning (born 31 October 1972) {{on a bus}} {{which he}} was <b>driving.</b> <b>This</b> {{was the start of}} Kouao and Manning's {{relationship}} which ended {{at the time of their}} arrest eight months later. She was his first girlfriend. The relationship developed quickly and on 6 July 1999, Kouao and Climbié moved into Manning's one-bedroom flat at Somerset Gardens in Tottenham, in the London Borough of Haringey. There is evidence that Climbié's abuse increased soon after moving into Manning's flat.|$|E

However, the particular study notes that the mechanism <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> differentiation is not clear, and the variance could be in response to the soil physiochemical environment, plant community, or both (3.5.a). Other studies offer evidence to strengthen the idea that EcM communities are indeed affected by soil environment both in the field and in the lab.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, Volkswagen of America issued two recalls of DSG-equipped vehicles. The first {{involved}} 13,500 vehicles, and was {{to address}} unplanned shifts to the neutral gear, {{while the second}} involved similar problems (by then attributed to faulty temperature sensors) and applied to 53,300 vehicles.

25|$|Various engine {{configurations}} were available, initially {{ranging from}} the top of the line 103kW SOHC 6-cylinder turbo L20ET to the 4-cylinder Z18S and 6-cylinder LD28 diesel versions at the other end of the scale. The all-new 16-valve DOHC FJ20 engine debuted in late 1981, and was the first four-cylinder engine from any Japanese manufacturer to employ more than two valves per cylinder (see below). Some of the top spec models featured adjustable suspension dampers that could be adjusted while <b>driving,</b> <b>this</b> was another first for mass-produced JDM vehicles. Nissan Glorias and Laurels also used the L series engines, as well as some diesel (Laurel only) variants.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, {{concern of}} nuclear weapons {{proliferation}} (especially after India demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology) led President Gerald Ford to issue a Presidential directive to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the U.S. On 7 April 1977, President Jimmy Carter banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel. The key issue <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> policy was the risk {{of nuclear weapons}} proliferation by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle, and to encourage other nations to follow the USA lead. After that, only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but did not provide the substantial subsidy {{that would have been}} necessary to start up commercial reprocessing.|$|E
25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients {{to determine whether they}} were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in <b>driving</b> (<b>this</b> includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E

500|$|The {{impedance}} of {{a loudspeaker}} is not constant across all frequencies. [...] In a typical loudspeaker the impedance will rise {{with increasing frequency}} from its DC value, {{as shown in the}} diagram, until it reaches a point of its mechanical resonance. [...] Following resonance, the impedance falls to a minimum and then begins to rise again. [...] Speakers are usually designed to operate at frequencies above their resonance, and for this reason it is the usual practice to define nominal impedance at this minimum and then round to the nearest standard value. [...] The ratio of the peak resonant frequency to the nominal impedance can be as much as 4:1. [...] It is, however, still perfectly possible for the low frequency impedance to actually be lower than the nominal impedance. [...] A given audio amplifier may not be capable of <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> low frequency impedance even though it is capable of driving the nominal impedance, a problem that can be solved either with the use of crossover filters or underrating the amplifier supplied.|$|E
500|$|The top GC {{men in the}} peloton and the {{specialist}} climbers formed a chase group that overhauled Voigt in the final [...] The attacks of Colombian climber Mauricio Soler had been responsible for <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> group to catch {{the remnants of the}} breakaway, and he attacked again in the final , quickly getting a gap over the competition and appearing poised for the stage win. As Soler had been the one who caused the crash that kept Mark Cavendish from potentially defending the pink jersey the day before, his combativeness on this stage was described as his [...] "redemption". 2007 Giro d'Italia winner Danilo Di Luca timed his sprint to the line just right and overtook Soler for the victory. Sixteen riders finished with the same time as Di Luca, ten more were six seconds back, and a further 26 were inside a minute of his winning time. Thomas Lövkvist, who finished in the same group as Di Luca, took a narrow lead in the overall classification after the stage. However, Di Luca later tested positive for EPO and was stripped of his victory. The stage win was subsequently awarded to Stefano Garzelli, the runner-up.|$|E
500|$|Horner {{thought he}} had found the {{mechanism}} <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the [...] high proto-Rocky Mountains. During the Bearpaw Transgression sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their coastal habitat from about [...] This led to stronger selection pressures, the severest for Achelousaurus that lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck, making rapid evolution possible. Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the adult phase did they begin to differ. According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related.|$|E

In 1847, Crampton became a founder {{member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and in 1848, Crampton set up in business as a Civil Engineer in London. In 1850, a Crampton locomotive was exhibited at Birmingham which had balance weights on the <b>driving</b> wheels. <b>This</b> feature was commented upon by William Stroudley. In 1851, Crampton started the Broadstairs Gasworks, overseeing the construction and financing much of the works.|$|R
500|$|While {{the number}} of storms in the Atlantic has {{increased}} since 1995, there is no obvious global trend. The annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87±10. However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins {{is limited by the}} lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. In spite of that, {{there is some evidence that}} the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. In 2006, Kerry Emanuel stated, [...] "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime." [...] At the time, Emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> trend, however, some argue that Emanuel's own research in 2008 refuted this theory. Others contend that the trend does not exist at all, but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s-era measurement equipment. Vecchi and Knutson (2008) found a weakly positive, although not statistically-significant trend in {{the number of}} North Atlantic tropical cyclones for 1878–2006, but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period.|$|E
500|$|Consistent with {{a role in}} male-male aggression, {{adult male}} mice secrete {{significantly}} more Mups into their urine than females, juveniles or castrated male mice. The precise mechanism <b>driving</b> <b>this</b> difference between the sexes is complex, but at least three hormones—testosterone, growth hormone and thyroxine—are known to positively influence the production of Mups in mice. Wild house mouse urine contains variable combinations of four to seven distinct Mup proteins per mouse. Some inbred laboratory mouse strains, such as BALB/c and C57BL/6, also have different proteins expressed in their urine. However, unlike wild mice, different individuals from the same strain express the same protein pattern, an artifact of many generations of inbreeding. One unusual Mup is less variable than the others: it is consistently produced by {{a high proportion of}} wild male mice and is almost never found in female urine. When this Mup was made in bacteria and used in behavioural testing, it was found to attract female mice. Other Mups were tested but they did not have the same attractive qualities, suggesting the male-specific Mup acts as a sex pheromone. Scientists named this Mup darcin as a humorous reference to Fitzwilliam Darcy, the romantic hero from Pride and Prejudice. Taken together, the complex patterns of Mups produced has the potential to provide a range information about the donor animal, such as gender, fertility, social dominance, age, genetic diversity or kinship. Wild mice (unlike laboratory mice that are genetically identical and which therefore also have identical patterns of Mups in the urine) have individual patterns of Mup expression in their urine that act as a [...] "barcode" [...] to uniquely identify the owner of a scent mark.|$|E
