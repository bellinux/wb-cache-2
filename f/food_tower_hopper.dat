40|$|Working {{memory in}} a cat was {{examined}} {{in the present study}} using a spatial memory task. One female domestic cat was placed in a room with six <b>food</b> <b>towers</b> baited with tuna. Novel <b>food</b> <b>tower</b> choices in the first 6 choices and total number of <b>food</b> <b>towers</b> reached were recorded. The results were somewhat inconsistent but with slight changes in method and apparatus, future results can be promising. It is apparent that an animal 2 ̆ 7 s ability to forage has been evolutionarily passed down, and spatial working memory is one of the cognitive abilities which enables successful foraging...|$|R

40|$|The present {{objective}} was to find further evidence of cat 2 ̆ 7 s use of abstracted geometrical patterns while navigating. It was expected that within a 4 x 4 <b>food</b> <b>tower</b> matrix, the one naive male Felis silvestris catus would make more moves to towers that would conform to the abstracted 2 x 2 post pattern, than to those that would not conform to this pattern. The results revealed that the cat 2 ̆ 7 s moves were not more likely {{to conform to the}} abstracted 2 x 2 pattern. Such findings may help reveal how different situational demands require different navigational strategies...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to examine food intake and food attitudes of 285 Korean female students attending {{a high school in}} Seoul. Food intake was assessed using a food frequency based on the Korean <b>Food</b> <b>Tower</b> consisting of five food groups, i. e., grain products, vegetables and fruits, meat, milk, and fats and sweets. The food attitude scale consisted of 22 items that were categorized into five factors with items about conscious choice of food, health concerns, economics and time influence, interest in foods, and foods that energize in regard to each of the five food groups;An analysis of the food frequency indicated that the participants ate rice, cabbage kimchi, radish, and soybean or red pepper paste most frequently along with milk, ice cream, tea, and seasonal fruits such as citrus fruit, apple, watermelon, and grapes. The mean serving frequency for each food group was 10 to 77...|$|R

40|$|Background If the {{development}} of an ecosystem is driven by competition, why doesn’t a single spe-cies outcompetes all others and becomes the dominant, if not the only surviving one? Why don’t we always have food chains and <b>food</b> <b>towers</b> instead of <b>food</b> webs and food pyramids? Ecological models that describe the resource competition between different species help to understand biodiversity (Levin 2012). Models that show how and why in some situations several species can coexist, while in slightly different situations one may prevail over others, can explain observations of invasion and succession processes in real life environments. Even very simple models can exhibit such complicated behaviour, but unfortunately also the mathematics behind such simple models can become com-plicated (Edelstein-Keshet 2005). Graphical analysis tools and numerical simulations do enhance accessibility of these models, but cannot replace the in depth insight obtained from mathematical analysis. In fact, for a full understanding of the dynamics of the tran-sition of a system from one situation to another, mathematical analysis is indispensable.

50|$|Chez Panisse {{was founded}} in 1971 by U.C. Berkeley film studies {{professor}} Paul Aratow, and Alice Waters {{who had been a}} student of the French language, a political activist, and a world traveler. The restaurant opened in an Arts and Crafts-style home on Shattuck Avenue, and featured French-style dinners but made with locally grown ingredients. Waters very actively promoted the idea of an alternate network of food suppliers working together to create flavorful meals. At first, Waters used ingredients bought at the Berkeley Co-op and at smaller markets around Berkeley. The staff foraged for ingredients such as wild blackberries, and neighbors brought produce grown in their backyards. David Lance Goines, Waters' boyfriend and a skilled artist, created posters for the restaurant and other Gourmet Ghetto businesses. With her friends including film scholars Aratow and Tom Luddy, Waters effectively ran a culinary salon at Chez Panisse, to advocate social change with the goal of making locally sourced food economically viable. In February 1973, Waters hired Jeremiah Tower as head chef. Tower increased the focus on salads and local <b>food.</b> <b>Tower</b> says that {{a turning point in the}} focus on locally sourced food came in October 1976 when he prepared a regional menu including cream corn soup made in a Mendocino style, oysters from Tomales Bay, cheese from Sonoma, and California-grown fruits and nuts purchased at a farmer's market in San Francisco.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{investigate}} cue competition in rat foraging. Rats were placed in a <b>food</b> <b>tower</b> maze comprised of 25 towers arranged in a 5 x 5 matrix. Four towers within the maze were baited and arranged in a diamond spatial pattern. The rat’s objective during each trial was to find each baited tower. The rats in the Visual + Pattern (V+P) condition had an additional, visual cue in the form of striped sleeves placed on all four baited towers. There were 80 trials in total, split into two phases of 40 trials. Rats in the V+P group had the baited towers marked with stripes during Phase 1 and these visual cues were removed during Phase 2. Rats in the Pattern Only (PO) group had no visual cues identifying baited towers in either Phase 1 or Phase 2. Results of the experiment indicated that the V+P group significantly outperformed the PO group during Phase 1 in terms of choices required to find the fourth baited tower. During Phase 2, both groups of rats decreased in performance. However, there was {{no significant differences between the}} two groups of rats during Phase 2. Thus, the V+P rats learned the pattern in spite of the visual cues, demonstrating that salient visual cues did not overshadow less-salient pattern cues...|$|R

Ecological models that describe the resource competition between different species help to understand biodiversity (Levin 2012).

Graphical analysis tools and numerical simulations do enhance accessibility of these models, but cannot replace the in depth insight obtained from mathematical analysis. In fact, for a full understanding of the dynamics of the transition of a system from one situation to another, mathematical analysis is indispensable. Here, we summarize the elementary mathematics underlying a suite of simple models of resource competition (Tilman 1982), in which the dynamics of consumers and resources are explicitly represented. The original papers presenting the mathematical roots of the model require mathematical skills that most ecologists do not possess. Our aim is to make the presentation as accessible as possible. Thus, we keep mathematical sophistication to the minimum needed to explain how the ecology of the model derives from the mathematics.|$|R

60|$|Shortly {{after noon}} {{of the second}} day the storm {{commenced}} to abate, and before the sun went down, the little craft upon which Tara of Helium had hovered {{between life and death}} these many hours drifted slowly before a gentle breeze above a landscape of rolling hills that once had been lofty mountains upon a Martian continent. The girl was exhausted from loss of sleep, from lack of food and drink, and from the nervous reaction consequent to the terrifying experiences through which she had passed. In the near distance, just topping an intervening hill, she caught a momentary glimpse of {{what appeared to be a}} dome-capped tower. Quickly she dropped the flier until the hill shut it off from the view of the possible occupants of the structure she had seen. The tower meant to her the habitation of man, suggesting the presence of water and, perhaps, of <b>food.</b> If the <b>tower</b> was the deserted relic of a bygone age she would scarcely find food there, but there was still a chance that there might be water. If it was inhabited, then must her approach be cautious, for only enemies might be expected to abide in so far distant a land. Tara of Helium knew that she must be far from the twin cities of her grandfather's empire, but had she guessed within even a thousand haads of the reality, she had been stunned by realization of the utter hopelessness of her state.|$|R
