5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> males eventually to drop out.|$|E
