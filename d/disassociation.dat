25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or <b>disassociation)</b> of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels.

40|$|Educational {{policy and}} children’s science fiction {{literature}} provide two distinct {{visions of the}} future for children and corresponding representations {{of the future of}} childhood. By refracting the literary and the political through a sociological critique, this article scrutinizes how such texts construct ideas about childhood and thus motivate an impetus for social and economic change, especially in the context of children’s digital media use and the reform of children’s services. In particular, I focus on the way literary studies scholars represent childhood in their readings of science fiction texts, and on the political construction of childhood in policy texts such as reports to the public and in high-profile media campaigns including teacher recruitment advertisements displayed in the UK between 2006 and 2008. The analysis suggests there are intertextual associations as well as <b>disassociations</b> in the discourses of childhood found in sci-fi and educational policy...|$|R

The analyses showed that large changes in single-locus allelic frequencies and major reorganizations in multilocus genetic structure occurred {{in each of the}} generation-to-generation transitions examined. Although associations among a few traits persisted over generations, dynamic <b>disassociations</b> and reassociations occurred among several traits in each generation-transition period. Overall, the restructuring that occurred was characterized by gradual decreases in the number of clusters of associated traits and increases in the number of traits within each cluster. The observed changes in single-locus frequencies and in multilocus genetic structure were attributed to interplay among various evolutionary factors among which natural selection acting in a temporally heterogeneous environment was the guiding force...|$|R

In its ambition to tame this radical contingency, Prevent represents an extension of governmentality that acts at the level of potential, before the threat being targeted has come to exist. It does so by mediating these unknowable futures through ascriptions of identification, values and the danger it sees posed by <b>disassociations</b> from “Britishness” and then intervenes in the present, both pre-emptively through community cohesion and at a precautionary level through the Channel programme.

In comparison, third- and fourth-generation Zainichi Chosenjin have largely given up active participation or loyalty to the Chongryon ideology.

Many Zainichi Chosenjin also felt deeply betrayed by the North Korean government's recent admission that it had kidnapped at least 13 Japanese citizens over the years, because Chongryon had been categorically and fiercely denying for many years that the abductions had ever taken place.

25|$|The {{overriding}} {{theory as}} to the main impetus behind An Island is that it allegorises Blake's rejection of the bluestocking society of Harriet Mathew, who, along with her husband, Reverend Anthony Stephen Mathew organised 'poetical evenings' to which came many of Blake's friends (such as John Flaxman, Thomas Stothard and Joseph Johnson) and, {{on at least one}} occasion, Blake himself. The Mathews had been behind the publication in 1783 of Blake's first collection of poetry, Poetical Sketches, but by 1784, Blake had supposedly grown weary of their company and the social circles in which they moved, and chose to distance himself from them. This theory {{can be traced back to}} an 1828 'Biographical Sketch' of Blake by his friend in later life, the painter J. T. Smith, published in the second volume of Smith's biography of Joseph Nollekens, Nollekens and his times. Smith's references to the Mathew family's association with Blake were taken up and elaborated upon by Blake's first biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, in his 1863 biography Life of William Blake, Pictor Ignotus., and from that point forth, the prevailing belief {{as to the}} primary background of An Island is that it dramatises Blake's <b>disassociation</b> from the social circles in which he found himself.|$|E
25|$|The Ecumenical Order {{is one of}} many listed “Unrecognised Orders” putting {{claim on}} the successors of the Order of St. John, however with some {{international}} recognition. By the early 19th-century, the original Order of St. John became defunct but various orders put claim over it; one of the Orders is the Ecumenical Order which is believed {{to be based on the}} Russian tradition dating back to Tsar Paul I in 1810 and to their split American Order in 1890 or 1908. Since 1997, the Prince and Grand Master of the Order was Joseph Frendo Cumbo, who adds to his name the title Torre Sarocca, and resided in Canada. Roberto Paterno acts as the Prince and Grand Master Emeritus. Other notable individuals are Derrick Langford, the Grand Chancellor and Busietta himself was the Grand Prior of Malta. Busietta and others claim titles of nobility but there is no historic prove in support, and in any case such titles in Malta have been void since the 1970s.

40|$|We {{have created}} a genetic map of Capsicum (pepper) from an {{interspecific}} F 2 population consisting of 11 large (76. 2 - 192. 3 cM) and 2 small (19. 1 and 12. 5 cM) linkage groups that cover a total of 1245. 7 cM. Many of the markers are tomato probes that were chosen to cover the tomato genome, allowing comparison of this pepper map to the genetic map of tomato. Hybridization of all tomato-derived probes {{included in this study}} to positions throughout the pepper map suggests that no major losses have occurred during the divergence of these genomes. Comparison of the pepper and tomato genetic maps showed that 18 homeologous linkage blocks cover 98. 1 % of the tomato genome and 95. 0 % of the pepper genome. Through these maps and the potato map, we determined the number and types of rearrangements that differentiate these species and reconstructed a hypothetical progenitor genome. We conclude there have been 30 breaks as part of 5 translocations, 10 paracentric inversions, 2 pericentric inversions, and 4 <b>disassociations</b> or associations of genomic regions that differentiate tomato, potato, and pepper, as well as an additional reciprocal translocation, nonreciprocal translocation, and a duplication or deletion that differentiate the two pepper mapping parents...|$|R

It argues that China and Egypt faced a population crisis that was undermining economic development since the 19 th century and this issue of excessive population growth continues {{to be on the}} top of the political agenda in the 21 st century. Furthermore China and Egypt both have experienced three stages of population development in terms of family planning policies.

For Egypt, the first phase of Cairo’s family planning program began in 1965 and this was also accompanied by two more stages of development, one in the 1970 s and the other in the 1980 s. The results of these family planning programs were impressive. China and Egypt both experienced extraordinary fertility decline since the 1980 s. Despite these achievements in family planning however, China and Egypt is expected to experience further waves of population increase in the foreseeable future.

40|$|This thesis investigates two episodic {{television}} shows, Arrested Development and Scrubs, {{and attempts}} to establish why one succeeded with audiences and the other failed. Following the work of genre theory, it is asserted that the two shows resonate with opposing narratives framing lived experience. The former presents the institutional (or restrictive) force of language to guide one's thoughts, mark <b>disassociations</b> between the self and others, and determine action. The latter appeals to the creative (or liberating) use of dialogue and narrative to inspire agency. In privileging the concrete situations in which interactions with others enable growth without restricting the will, and in which others are engaged in the same self-investigation, Scrubs calls for an acknowledgement of others. Arrested Development points to the metaphysical language and power systems that make such acknowledgements impossible. It is argued thereafter that both world-pictures have their place. The opposition between Arrested Development and Scrubs develops into a dual affirmation of how ordinary uses of language {{have the potential to}} create arbitrary limits between the self and others, but also how ordinary language in a state of emergence from the particular lives of a multiplicity of speakers enables us to meaningfully communicate {{in the first place and}} antagonizes the metaphysical pictures that hold us captive. This thesis concludes by exploring the way that fiction, as a series of propositions, occupies the middle space between an epistemological opening up and closing off of the self to others, allowing it to be used for either purpose, or for both at once.

40|$|Residency patterns, abundance, {{and social}} {{composition}} of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were assessed from 2006 to 2008 in Bahía San Antonio (BSA), Patagonia, Argentina. A total of 714 survey hours resulted in 132 contact hours with 224 bottlenose dolphin groups. Results indicated that dolphins {{can be seen}} year-round on average every 4 h, with sighting periods lasting an average of 45 min. A total of 57 bottlenose dolphins were positively identified in the bay, of which 56 % showed a degree of residency, including almost all mother and calf pairs. Using the closed time heterogeneity model (Mth), and accounting for the proportion of unidentifiable individuals, calculations resulted in a corrected abundance estimate of 83 individuals for the study area. Further analysis revealed that individual dolphins associated at random and that the entire community exhibits rapid <b>disassociations</b> and two levels of casual acquaintances. Data suggest that the shallow waters of BSA support a relatively resident community of bottlenose dolphins, living in a fission-fusion society in which companionships frequently change. The relative constant presence of calves in more than 50 % of the dolphin groups and the observed presence of neonates might furthermore indicate that dolphins specifically use this area, among others, to give birth and nurse their young. In addition, a reported decline in bottlenose dolphin sightings in the larger area of the Argentinean coast might indicate that BSA {{is one of the}} last remaining refuges of the species in the country. Further research seems vital for their conservation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to reflect on the origins and {{meanings}} of names describing investment practices that integrate a consideration of environmental, social and corporate governance issues in the academic literature. A review of 190 academic papers spanning the period 1975 to mid- 2009 was conducted. This exploratory study evaluated the associations and <b>disassociations</b> of the primary name assigned to this genre of investment with variables grouped into five domains, namely Primary Ethical Position, Investment Strategy, Publication Date, Regions Covered and Periodical Type. The study indicated that papers coded as expressing a deontological ethical position were more frequently associated with the name Ethical Investment, whereas those with an ambiguous ethical position were less frequently associated with Ethical Investment. Three investment strategies (positive screening; best-in-class; and cause-based investing) were unusually associated with the primary name Responsible Investment. A strong preference for the name Ethical Investment was noted in the United Kingdom, and contrasted starkly with an apparent aversion for this name in the United States. The name Ethical Investment is significantly more frequently used in journals dealing with ethics, business ethics and philosophy than in finance, economic and investment journals. Finally, the study yielded some weak hints that the name Responsible Investment might perhaps be linked to an egoist ethical position. On the basis of this, and because these have already been substantively linked through the Principles for Responsible Investment in the popular discourse, we follow the heuristic tradition set by Sparkes (2001), and propose that Responsible Investment be defined as ‘Investment practices that integrate a consideration of ESG issues with the primary purpose of delivering higher-risk-adjusted financial returns’...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will explore}} a particular {{moment in the}} complex and multi-faceted relationship that exits between football and fashion. In 1996 the Liverpool team presented themselves wearing cream Armani suits {{as part of the}} media build up to that year’s FA Cup final. The representation of the team and the subsequent treatment received by those from within and outside the game make visible certain cultural and sociological ideologies. Such ideologies which concern ideas around class, masculinity, and (in this case) the male body, are powerful and have far reaching effects that remain relevant today. Of particular use here is the work of Henri Lefebvre and his ideas around moments of ‘contestation’ (Lefebvre, 1969). Lefebvre discusses the idea of an uneven development across social experiences precipitated by the existing class structures and capitalist hierarchies. Such uneven development creates ‘differences’ manifested within the formation of identities. These differences in turn create what he terms – lags, distortions, or <b>disassociations.</b> Such ‘lags’ or ‘gaps’ between groups and individuals create specific environments. Within these conceptual spaces, moments of contestation occur where resistance to the superstructures that govern and control everyday existence take place. Such lags or gaps and the resulting differences or contestations they produce are often unacknowledged or misrepresented. As a result the reality of everyday life contrasts with that officially sanctioned or proposed as culture and/or knowledge. Central here is a discussion of the role that the body and clothing play in marking out or positioning ideas around class, as Skeggs states; ‘representations have to work on the body for them to be read as authentically belonging’ (Skeggs, 2004 : 111). When working class men, of which footballers are convenient symbol, engage with consumption and grooming in such a visible way the subsequent reactions highlight not least, middle class insecurities around subjective value and distance from working class experience...|$|R
