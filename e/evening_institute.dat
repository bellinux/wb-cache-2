25|$|The <b>Evening</b> <b>Institute</b> for Younger Men, {{located at}} the Huntington Avenue YMCA, held its first class on October 3, 1898, {{starting}} what would transform into Northeastern University {{over the course of}} four decades. The School of Law was formally established that year with the assistance of an Advisory Committee, consisting of Dean James Barr Ames of the Harvard University School of Law, Dean Samuel Bennett of the Boston University School of Law, and Judge James R. Dunbar. In 1903, the first Automobile Engineering School in the country was established followed by the School of Commerce and Finance in 1907. Day classes began in 1909. In 1916, a bill was introduced into the Massachusetts Legislature to incorporate the institute as Northeastern College. After considerable debate and investigation it was passed in March 1916.|$|E
25|$|Members paid {{an annual}} {{membership}} fee {{to use the}} facilities and services of the association. Because of political, physical, and population changes in Boston {{during the second half}} of the century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs of local neighbourhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational classes. In 1895, it established the <b>Evening</b> <b>Institute</b> of the Boston YMCA, the precursor of Northeastern University. From 1899 to 1968, the association established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 31 branches and centres. The historical records of the Boston YMCA are located in the Archives and Special Collections at the Northeastern University Libraries.|$|E

Herbert had been born before his parents' marriage and thus was not eligible to claim the Portland title even if his father had been the duke.|$|R

50|$|In many English {{speaking}} countries neuropathology {{is considered}} a subfield of anatomical pathology. In contrast, {{there are a number}} of independent university chairs in neuropathology and <b>even</b> <b>institutes</b> of neuropathology in German speaking countries due to a different historical background. A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or general pathology, is called a neuropathologist. In day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist is a consultant for other physicians. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy of nervous tissue is taken and sent to the neuropathologist, who examines it using a microscope or certain molecular methods to make a definitive diagnosis.|$|R

50|$|With {{the onset}} of war in 1939, the major {{engineering}} firms had to expand to produce munitions and other vital military equipment. The demand for skilled men, and also now for women, escalated {{but there was nothing}} in the education or training field to cope with this demand. The industrial expansion continued but it wasn't until 1944, that the Soke of Peterborough Education Committee established Advisory Committees for Engineering and Building and reorganised courses into the Senior <b>Evening</b> <b>Institute</b> of Commercial and Technical Students, Junior <b>Evening</b> <b>Institute</b> and Adult Institute. Classes were held all over the city but, in 1946, temporary premises were erected on land in Garton End Road to provide space for engineering subjects. Pressure from local firms with education and training policies resulted in the Education Committee supporting a plan for Peterborough Technical College, initially at the Garton End Road site.|$|E
