40|$|The purpose {{with this}} master’s thesis, with Scania CV AB in Södertälje as <b>job</b> <b>initiator,</b> {{has been to}} develop three {{different}} passenger seat concepts with focus on modularisation, functionality and production. The different concepts are: a foldable passenger seat, which is possible to fold away completely, a bench for two passengers, and a resting seat for resting during breaks when the vehicle is parked. The main tools used during the search for concept solutions have been brainstorming, morphological analyses, and evaluation matrixes. Prototypes {{have been made in}} order to visualise the ideas but also for the possibility to test them in a real truck cabin and by that find advantages but also flaws. Final product specifications has been made and with that guidelines for a continued development work. Experiences gained during this thesis work has been that by using ergonomic data and theories, well thought through designs, and standardised interfaces a good result can be achieved, which fulfils the demands and wishes placed on the future product...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{experimental}} method to calculate cohesive characteristics for {{an adhesive layer}} in a End Notched Flexure (ENF) specimen is presented and evaluated. The method {{is based on the}} path independent J-integral where the energy release rate (ERR) for the adhesive is derived {{as a function of the}} applied forces and the rotational displacements at the loading point and at the supports of the specimen. The major advantage with the method in comparison with existing theory known by the <b>job</b> <b>initiator</b> is that it is still applicable with ENF specimens that are subjected to yielding of the adherends. The structure of this thesis is disposed so that the theory behind the J-integral method is shortly described and then an evaluation of the method is performed by aid of finite element simulations using beam and cohesive elements. The finite element simulations indicates that the ERR can be determined with good accuracy for an ENF specimen where a small scale yielding of the adherends has occurred. However when a fully cross sectional yielding of the adherends is reached the ERR starts diverging from the exact value and generates a too high ERR according to input data in the simulations, i. e. the exact values. The importance in length of the adhesive process zone is also shown to be irrelevant to the ERR measured according to the J-integral method. Simulation performed with continuum elements indicates that a more reality based FE- simulation implies a higher value of the applied load in order to create crack propagation. This is an effect of that the specimen is allowed to roll on the supports which makes the effective length between the supports shorter than the initial value when the specimen is deformed. This results in a stiffer specimen and thus a higher applied force is needed to create crack propagation in the adhesive layer. An experimental set up of an ENF specimen is created and the sample data from the experiments are evaluated with the J-integral method. For measuring the rotational displacements of the specimen which are needed for the J-integral equation an image system is developed by the author and validated by use of linear elastic beam theory. The system calculates the three rotational displacements of the specimen by aid of images taken by a high resolution SLR camera and the system for measuring the rotations may also be used in other applications than for a specific ENF geometry. The validation of the image system shows that the rotations calculated by the image system diverge from beam theory with less than 2. 2 % which is a quite good accuracy in comparison with the accuracies for the rest of the used surveying equipment. The results from the experiment indicates that the used, about 0. 36 mm thick SikaPower 498, adhesive has an maximum shear strength of 37. 3 MPa and a critical shear deformation of 482 µm. The fracture energy is for this thickness of the adhesive is determined as 12. 9 kJ/m 2. This report ends with a conclusion- and a suggested future work- chapter...|$|E
40|$|Currently, most {{workflow}} management systems in Grid environments provide push-oriented job distribution strategies, where jobs are explicitly delegated to resources. In those scenarios the dedicated resources execute submitted jobs {{according to the}} request of a workflow engine or Grid wide scheduler. This approach has various limitations, particularly if human interactions should be integrated in workflow execution. To support human interactions {{with the benefit of}} enabling inter organizational computation and community approaches, this poster paper proposes the idea of a pull-based task distribution strategy. Here, heterogeneous resources, including human interaction, should actively select tasks for execution from a central repository. This leads to special demands regarding security issues like access control. In the established push-based job execution the resources are responsible for granting access to workflows and <b>job</b> <b>initiators.</b> In general this is done by access control lists, where users are explicitly mapped to local accounts according to their policies. In the pull-based approach the resources actively apply for job executions by sending requests to a central task repository. This means that every resource {{has to be able to}} authenticate against the repository to be authorized for task execution. In other words the authorization is relocated from the resources to the repository. The poster paper introduces current work regarding to the mentioned security aspects in the pull-based approach within the scope of the project "HiX 4 AGWS"...|$|R
