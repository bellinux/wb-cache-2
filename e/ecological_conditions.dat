5|$|The Laysan duck is an insular {{relative}} of the mallard, with a very small and fluctuating population. Mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration, and {{can be expected to}} occasionally have remained and hybridised with Laysan ducks as long as these species have existed. However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and thus have lower fitness. These ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. Now, their range includes only Laysan Island. It is one of the successfully translocated birds, after having become nearly extinct in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

The region is noted for its high biodiversity value and increased pressure associated with habitat fragmentation and urbanisation. Ten sites defined by a distinct open eucalypt forest community dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora ssp. variegata) were stratified based on patch size and patch connectivity. Each site underwent a series of detailed vegetation condition and landscape assessments, together with bird surveys and acoustic analysis using relative soundscape power. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the measurement of relative soundscape power reflects <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> and bird species richness, and is dependent on the extent of landscape fragmentation.

5|$|The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{probably}} the best-known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) {{and its ability to}} migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is among}} the four most-spoken Berber {{languages}} (the other three being Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff), and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Central Atlas Tamazight is mostly spoken in the entire Middle Atlas and its outcroppings, reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat. It is also spoken in the central and eastern High Atlas mountains in Morocco. It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle Atlas mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara (Tafilalt). Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas: Riff in the north, Central Atlas in the center, and Shilha in the south/southwest. Central Atlas is not mutually intelligible with the Riff language but is with the Shilha dialect; Shilha- and Riff-speakers also cannot understand each other, That said, the Riffian language is of course related to both Shilha and Atlas Tamazight, and even though Riffian {{and the other two}} are not mutually intelligible, they share a high degree of the same vocabulary and grammar.|$|E

40|$|The Kat River is an {{agricultural}} catchment that drains salt rich geology. Potential salinity impacts on <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> {{of the river}} were investigated. Monthly salt concentrations and flow discharges were monitored at ten sites along the Kat River below the Kat Dam. Monthly salt loads were computed to relate salinity to land use and ionic data {{used to assess the}} toxicity of major salts using the TIMS model. Concentration duration curves for sodium chloride were derived from flow concentration relationships, representing sodium chloride concentrations to which the aquatic ecosystem had been exposed. The <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> was assessed at nineteen sites using SASS 5 biotic index over four seasons. Finally, the modelled instream salt concentrations and bioasessments were evaluated in terms of the modelled level of species protection afforded at different salt concentrations. Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) were used for this exercise. There was a general downstream increase in salinity with the minimum concentrations recorded at the Fairbain tributary (84 mg/L) and maximum levels at the sewage outfall in Fort Beaufort (1222 mg/L). There was evidence that citrus irrigation upstream of Fort Beaufort increased salinisation. Sodium chloride, {{and to a lesser extent}} magnesium sulphate, were the dominant salts in the Kat River catchment, with the latter being more toxic. However these had little or no impact on the aquatic ecosystem. Flow-derived sodium chloride concentrations showed that both the Balfour and Blinkwater tributaries were in a fair/ poor condition. However with regard to <b>ecological</b> <b>condition,</b> it was demonstrated that the river is generally in a good state except for the Blinkwater River and the lower catchment. Degraded habitat condition at the Blinkwater was responsible for poor <b>ecological</b> <b>condition.</b> Integrating SSD derived classes, sodium chloride classes and <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> indicated that sodium chloride is a driver of <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> at the sewage treatment works and the subsequent site (only two of nineteen biomonitoring sites) ...|$|R

Statistically valid quantification of the biota and habitat condition in water bodies are prerequisites for rigorous assessment of aquatic biodiversity and habitat. We assessed the <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> of streams in a southeastern Brazilian basin. We quantified the percentage of stream length in good, fair, and poor <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> according to benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage. We assessed the risk of finding degraded <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> associated with degraded aquatic riparian physical habitat condition, watershed condition, and water quality. We describe field sampling and implementation issues encountered in our survey and discuss design options to remedy them. Survey sample sites were selected using a spatially balanced, stratified random design, which enabled us to put confidence bounds on the <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> estimates derived from the stream survey. The benthic condition index indicated that 62 % of stream length in the basin was in poor <b>ecological</b> <b>condition,</b> and 13 % of stream length was in fair condition. The risk of finding degraded biological condition when the riparian vegetation and forests in upstream catchments were degraded was 2. 5 and 4 times higher, compared to streams rated as good for the same stressors. We demonstrated that the GRTS statistical sampling method can be used routinely in Brazilian rain forests and other South American regions with similar conditions.

25|$|Weather {{conditions}} during 1350-1600 CE {{were better}} suited for maize growing on the upper Ohio Valley and West Virginia's tributary valleys. In the same time frame, the central and southwest Ohio (Till Plains) had cooler and wetter conditions, which affected the 'silking', pollination and grain filling stages that likely caused lower yields. Corn consumption decreased in the middle Ohio valley. The following weather pattern had intermittent droughts. This research also includes isotope analysis of samples from 47 archaeological sites in West and South Ohio, and western West Virginia (Staller, Tykot and Benz 2006:219,220).

25|$|The term subfossil {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to remains, such as bones, nests, or defecations, whose fossilization process is not complete, either because the length of time since the animal {{involved}} was living is too short (less than 10,000 years) or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization. Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years. The main importance of subfossil vs. fossil remains is that the former contain organic material, which can be used for radiocarbon dating or extraction and sequencing of DNA, protein, or other biomolecules. Additionally, isotope ratios can provide much information about the <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology.|$|E

Before his research ended abruptly in June 1932, when the aging ship became uneconomical to operate and was decommissioned, he concluded that mortality rates among Atlantic mackerel larvae changed from year to year according to variations in drift based on winds and not, as had earlier been proposed, based on changes in mortality at the critical period when larvae switched over from their yolks to exogenous food sources. Sette's study pioneered the computation of population estimates of larval fish growth and mortality rates.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between river <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> and neighbouring {{land and water}} management was investigated using a range of indices. Four systems in the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia were surveyed and {{a unique set of}} reach parameters were identified that were strongly correlated with reach <b>ecological</b> <b>condition.</b> Of the 115 reaches surveyed, 33 % were classified as being in very poor condition, 24 % as poor, 23 % as average, 15 % as good and 4 % as excellent. Those classified as average to excellent had an <b>ecological</b> <b>condition</b> that was correlated (R 2 = 0. 50) with: bank stability, % riparian cover, ungrazed, fenced, aquatic wood, and width of the riparian zone.

25|$|Within wine {{there are}} {{volatile}} and non-volatile compounds {{that contribute to}} the make up of a wine's aroma. During the fermentation and for {{the first few months of}} a wine's existence, chemical reactions among these compounds occur frequently and a wine's aroma will change more rapidly during this period than at any other point. As a wine ages and matures, changes and developments in aroma will continue to take place but at a slower and more gradual pace. Volatile aroma compounds are present in the skin and juice of a grape berry and will vary in composition according to the individual grape variety. It is theorized that the Vitis vine developed these compounds as an evolutionary tool to aid in procreation by attracting insects to assist with pollination and birds and other animals to eat the berries and disperse the seeds. The diverse spectrum of aromas associated with individual grape varieties is a reflection of the vine's adaptation to <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> and competition among other plants.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{historians have}} found that {{societies}} in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant respiration, <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital {{to invest in a}} sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.|$|E

A seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl {{came to the conclusion that}} female peafowl do not select mates merely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens expressed any preference for peacocks with more elaborate trains, such as trains having more ocelli, a more symmetrical arrangement or a greater length. Takahashi determined that the peacock's train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and, based on physiological data collected from this group of peafowl, do not correlate to male physical conditions. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded to Takahashi's study by voicing concern that alternative explanations for these results had been overlooked and that these might be essential for the understanding of the complexity of mate choice. They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions.</b> Jordania suggested that peacock's display of colourful and oversize train with plenty of eyespots, together with their extremely loud call and fearless behaviour has been formed by the forces of natural selection (not sexual selection), and served as a warning (aposematic) display to intimidate predators and rivals.|$|E

25|$|Although Iraqi Kurdistan is {{not well}} known from an archaeological point of view, the {{available}} evidence nevertheless shows that the relatively favourable <b>ecological</b> <b>conditions</b> of the Iraqi part of the Zagros attracted human groups from early prehistory onwards. Lower Palaeolithic archaeological sites have to date not {{been found in the}} Iraqi part of the Zagros Mountains, but they are known from the Iranian side where numerous cave sites have been found during archaeological surveys. Information on the early prehistory of the wider Little Zab region itself comes from the excavations carried out by the Oriental Institute at archaeological sites east of Kirkuk and south of the Little Zab. The earliest evidence for human occupation in this region comes from the Middle Palaeolithic site of Barda Balka, where Late Acheulean stone tools have been found. Archaeological research elsewhere in the Zagros confirms the importance of this area to early human hunter-gatherers – including groups of Neanderthals as evidenced by the finds in Shanidar Cave in the Great Zab basin. Mousterian stone tools that were used by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans have recently been excavated in Arbil, between the Little Zab and the Great Zab. Both open-air and cave sites are attested for the Zarzian culture, which straddles the Upper and Epipalaeolithic periods. After the Zarzian, the focus of human occupation shifted from cave-sites, which continue to be used as secondary or seasonal occupation sites up to today, to open-air sites and it was in this period that the trend toward domestication of plants and animals set in. Domestication of the goat probably occurred first in this area of the Zagros. Jarmo, a tell east of Kirkuk, was a Neolithic village community that practiced agriculture and animal husbandry. Pottery occurs from the early occupation levels onward; in its later phases it resembles pottery from Hassuna. The early occupation of Tell Shemshara, in the Ranya Plain, can also be dated to this period. The archaeological fieldwork in the Ranya Plain showed that this area was occupied during the Ubaid, Uruk and Ninevite V periods – roughly from the middle 6th to the mid-3rd millennium BCE. Evidence for these periods comes from the Citadel of Arbil as well.|$|E
