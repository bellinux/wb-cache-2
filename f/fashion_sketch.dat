30|$|The {{subject was}} raised by Charles Darwin in the {{principles}} of species survival first. The basic principles of the genetic algorithm (GA) were raised by John Holland in 1975 (Beasley et al. 1993). Following some researchers, Kim and Cho (2000) presented a computer aided fashion design system, based on the genetic algorithm. In this system, clothes designs are divided into three parts trunk, collar and sleeve, based on a new method of coding. Lee et al. (2001) allowed the user to directly manipulate {{in order to prevent}} generations from worsening. Sano and Yamamoto (2001) presented a three-dimensional computer aided fashion design system which could measure the body form of a customer and simulate Japanese Yukata clothes. To prevent user fatigue, as well as apply her personal opinion, during generation production, direct manipulation can be used (Honolulu 2002). With efforts of Volino et al. (2005) a framework and details, which are matched with requirements of clothing industry, were obtained to design virtual clothes and modeling with focus on interactive design, simulation, and visualization features. In fact, this is an evolutionary tool of productivity and quality in the process of fashion modeling ad design, which is effective in mechanical simulation and animation. Gong et al. (2007) have presented a new algorithm based on a multi-population method and mutation strategy, which can create diversity within population, improve the capability of exploitation and exploration, prevent from eliminating the fittest generation, and reduce user fatigue. Ogata and Onisawa (2007) have presented a fashion design support system, using the interactive genetic algorithm, which allows applying users’ opinions. After producing designs, the system shows some models to the user, and then according to evaluation and application of the operators of the genetic algorithm (selection, crossover and mutation), produces better designs. Gong et al. (2008 a, b) determine its evolutionary path based on differences of individuals’ fitness among genes to reduce two errors stemmed from random visual systems and customer taste mechanism and increase the efficiency of the interactive genetic algorithm. Results indicate the effect of the presented strategies in reduced errors and improved algorithm. Yuan and Gong (2008) presented an interactive genetic algorithm of a large group with individuals’ fitness not assigned by the user. Population is divided into some groups, and the majority of the group is changeable through expansion and population distribution. In this algorithm, the user evaluates just one sample placed in the center of population, and accordingly other members’ fitness is calculated automatically. Experiments and studies represent the advantage of the algorithm to traditional interactive genetic algorithms. Instead of determining fitness, Gong et al. (2008 a, b) selected and recorded a sample of population, with respect to sensitivities, as the user’s satisfactory sample or unacceptable sample {{to solve the problem of}} user fatigue in the interactive genetic algorithm, its fitness is calculated automatically by transfer from time space to fitness space, and the genetic operators are applied on it. Tseng et al. (2009) have utilized computer vision for recognizing clothes features in a variety of applications including customer taste recognition and suggestion of similar clothes. Because of the importance of the customer’s opinion on clothes fitness after the element of quality, Barari et al. (2010 a, b) have employed the interactive genetic algorithm to produce Iranian dress designs. First, the designs obtained in the initial step are given to the user and the user determines their fitness degree. Then, fitness of other designs is obtained by their similarity degree to the initial designs. Results indicate user-friendly design productions after certain numbers of algorithm replication. Using the interactive genetic algorithm, Mok et al. (2012) have presented a <b>fashion</b> <b>sketch</b> design system to accelerate the design process: (1) a design model based on design knowledge to describe the features of the fashion product using developed parameters; (2) a database based on suggesting a fashion design method to define the elements of a general style; and a multi-stage sketch design motor. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is effective to help ordinary people achieve <b>fashion</b> <b>sketch</b> design. Mok et al. (2013) have presented a customized fashion design system for nonprofessional users and customers, which includes a design, combination method, model designed by the interactive genetic algorithm, and graphical interface evaluated by the user. Empirical results indicate that the proposed system is effective to create user-friendly <b>fashion</b> <b>sketch</b> designs. Zeng et al. (2013) presented an intelligent recommender system to support personal fashion design. In the system, two models specifying the relationships between body measurements and individual’s inference of body shape are introduced; it allows an evaluation of a series of new design styles for a special customer and special content. In this approach, intelligent methods such as decision tree, cognitive maps and fuzzy relation calculations are used. In studying customer behavior in the process of clothing purchase, factors such as design, size, color and quality are important, but clothes design is most important Zarenejad et al. (2014). So, if a set of similar clothes designs with various and attractive details is existed in market, they will attract attention of different groups of customers. The research, therefore, tries to present a computer aided fashion design system, which can employ various types of fabrics designed as a set by using the interactive genetic algorithm and considering consumer’s taste in fashion set design.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} 2 D shape {{deformation}} method to fit technical drawings of garments ('flats') to body figure drawings with {{a diversity of}} fashion poses. We first dress a flat onto a body figure in a standard standing pose using Radial Basis Function (RBF) mapping. For different types of clothing, we suggest two levels of treatment to determine handles automatically. We deform the flats using the selected handles to create realistic <b>fashion</b> <b>sketches</b> that fit the garments onto fashion figures in different poses. Shape deformation is performed to minimize the distortion of all the triangles of the garment mesh and preserve garment properties in the deformation. Finally, the garment details, such as style lines and seams, are deformed accordingly for realistic deformation results. Experimental results have shown that our method can deform various garment flats to fit fashion figures in different poses. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
50|$|Martin wrote over 100 {{scholarly}} {{papers on}} a wide range of subjects, such as Art History and the Assimilation of Images by Contemporary Artists, and Redress of the Nerds: The Assertion of Nerd Style in Men's Clothing and Imagery in the 1980s. He also wrote a number of books on fashion and art, including Fashion and Surrealism and Charles James, and co-authored others. Martin was critical of the tendency within the art world to designate fashion into a corner of its own, and not acknowledging designers as artists, rather than merely being commercially driven. He states: I think that’s an abiding problem for artists, that because fashion is so often thought to be less serious than art, artists are afraid that they will vitiate their own work and their own importance as artists by participating in any way in fashion. Artists will often shy away from fashion and yet when it comes to incorporating fashion into their own work—such as David Salle using sort of 1950s <b>fashion</b> <b>sketches</b> in his work—that’s perfectly acceptable.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the Davia Bargellini Museum of Bologna {{has set up}} the Fashion and sartorial {{documentation}} section {{thanks to}} donations from private donors and tailor shops that have closed down.

This contribution, besides defining {{the context of the}} fashion and tailoring collection in a museum of applied arts, also illustrates how the section within the museum was formed (history), problems and methods of cataloguing current materials (conservation), and the contents of the first communications to the public (exhibition). The collection highlights the relationship between the designers who created fashion and the local tailors who interpreted the designs which were in vogue.

40|$|I owe {{so much to}} Birmingham and the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS).

I was quite sure during my undergraduate years in Scotland that I wanted to teach and do research. I was interested in gender, popular culture and sexuality. This was 1972 – 1973 and topics like these came under the rubric of ‘deviancy’. Actually, it was romance and feminine conformity that was the problem I wanted to investigate, but only deviancy theorists were keen to support my studies. They were enthusiastic, and I still thank them for their support (people like Laurie Taylor, the late Paul Walton, Jock Young, and the late Stan Cohen) but they were mostly obsessed with football hooligans, drug-takers, or with Mods and Rockers, and so criminology did not feel like the right academic home for me. Only in Birmingham was there the academic space which connected everyday phenomena with the serious study of cultural forms, such as girl's magazines.

40|$|Purpose – To better {{respond to}} today’s {{volatile}} and changing fashion market, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to develop a web-based design support system that enables users to design realistic and interesting skirts in the form of technical sketches over the internet. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed system mainly consists of a sketch representation and composing method (SRCM), a graphic user interface (GUI) and a controller. The SRCM is implemented at the server end that generates technical sketches according to user defined parameters and features via the web-based GUI at the client side. The controller manages the workflows between the server and the clients. Findings – To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a survey was conducted by inviting 30 subjects (professional designers or undergraduate students studying fashion design) to have trial run of the system in Hong Kong and in the USA. Positive comments and feedbacks were received, and valuable suggestions were also obtained in regard to the prototype system. Originality/value – Compared with traditional computer-aided design (CAD) systems, the proposed system is more effective and easier to operate as users can create technical sketches in accurate proportions with simple computer operations in a few mouse clicks. Besides, the output sketches are fully compatible with most commercial CAD software. The system is developed based on web technologies, thus <b>fashion</b> <b>sketches</b> can be easily designed using any computer connected to the internet; it can be implemented on Android or iOS platform in the future.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 64) A {{three part}} questionnaire {{was designed and}} utilized to obtain women's opinions about recent fashion designs. The {{first part of the}} form gathered personal information about the respondent's age, family size, residence, educa??tion, occupation, marital status and number of social groups to which she currently belonged. The second part dealt with the respondent's apparent knowledge and interest in fashions as measured by her participation in fashion related activities, her reading of magazines containing fashion news,her attendance at fashion shows and her predictions of future fashion trends. Third, the questionnaire solicited the women's opinions about eighteen <b>fashion</b> <b>sketches</b> which were typical of clothing worn during the past ten years. The one hundred eighty-nine women were analyzed within five groups: Business Women currently employed in fashion related positions Home Economics Instructors, Home Economics Students, Adult Education Dressmaking class members, and others.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{incorporating}} healthy {{body image and}} body awareness into two aspects of teaching costume design; the research and rendering phase, and the fitting and design realization process. Using Lisa Loomer’s The Waiting Room, a play exploring the body modification of three women from different cultures and time periods {{as a basis for}} research and character analysis, students begin to understand the cultural, social, and political frameworks behind significant historical fashion trends, and to translate that information into a design that communicates the same messages on a contemporary body to a contemporary audience. As students begin to research each culture and time period, they are tasked with finding ways to relate to the characters through common feelings of body confinement and dysmorphia, for example, finding commonalities between the Chinese practice of foot binding, Victorian corsetry, and modern day plastic surgery. Advanced student designers, when given the opportunity to realize their designs, are challenged with promoting healthy body image through their sketches and in fittings with performers. By addressing the way costume sketching is taught and steering away from 9 -head <b>fashion</b> <b>sketches,</b> student designers are better able to demonstrate a full understanding of character, and the performer who is represented in the sketch is more likely to relate to the design and see it as an attainable image. In preparation for fittings, student designers are coached on how to address and clothe varying body types and are then guided through the fitting. Designers learn to see and dress each performer’s body without judgment or cultural bias, while maintaining the significant style lines and aesthetics a particular production, time period, and culture requires...|$|R
