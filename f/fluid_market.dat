The paper builds on current work in the field of spectrum property rights and exclusive usage-rights. The first half of the paper captures the current state-of-play and presents a framework for visualizing the concepts involved. The paper goes on to make a clear distinction between the defining of a set of exclusive usage-rights and the exercising of those rights. This leads to a discussion of policies that are not alone about defining metrics and setting their desired values but are also about behaviors that involve negotiation and interaction.

This project examines the use of RAs within the Army Contracting Command (ACC) using E. Cory Yoder's Three Integrative Pillars for Success. Research questions focus on identifying best practices currently used within the contracting field.

If the ACC is to utilize RAs in {{the most effective and}} efficient manner, it is essential to select the appropriate RA type, field the best platform, and implement the correct protocols to maximize the use of RAs. These three factors together will yield maximum savings while generating new process improvements that will enable the ACC to become a more efficient and lean organization.

The effect of inbreeding was analyzed using both a fixed and animal model, with little difference in results. Inbreeding depressed RNIOC by $ 12. 69 in a <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> and $ 11. 53 in a manufacturing market per 1 % increase in inbreeding. Addition of somatic cell information in the profit function had little effect. Heritabilities of profit functions were. 16 and. 14 for a fluid and manufacturing market, respectively. Animal model estimates of inbreeding depression were +. 16 days,- 6. 7 days and- 5. 1 days for age at first freshening (AFF), days of productive life (DPL) and days in milk (TDIM), respectively. Inbreeding decreased first lactation mature equivalent milk, fat, and protein by 23. 7 kg,. 85 kg, and. 76 kg, respectively and lifetime milk, fat, and protein production by 176. 9 kg, 6. 4 kg, 5. 6 kg, respectively per 1 % increase in inbreeding.

The study {{was carried out in}} Dar es Salaam; the most populated city in the country (about 4 million residents). Specifically, the study sought to (i) explore locally and imported milks brands in the market; (ii) to examine fluid milk intake level amongst consumers (iii) examine characteristic features of locally processed milk products present in the market (iv) assess consumer choice responses to characteristic features of fluid milk products. A survey of 384 consumers was conducted, complemented by interviews of key stakeholders; importers of milk product, processors and wholesalers of local brands. It was found that the Dar es Salaam <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> is dominated by imported milk brands and products mainly from Kenya and South Africa. The dominant imported fluid milk was Ultra Heat Treated (UHT) with 6 to 12 months shelf-life. Local processors had limited access to UHT technology and thus produced short-lived milk which was dependent on refrigeration. A number of intrinsic and extrinsic consumption drivers which determined consumer responses were identified to include product form, price, packaging, taste/flavour and availability. Milk consumption was far lower than recommended by FAO/WHO mainly due to low level of consumer income and awareness/education. The study concludes that consumer responses to fluid milk products is determined driven mainly by intrinsic and extrinsic product characteristics and there is low consumption rate of milk in the market.

Our modeled is flexible enough to capture the nature of competition between brands within store and across stores. We find that the brands compete much more vigorously within store and than across stores. This structure of competition fits squarely with Slade's (1995) assumption on retail competition.

40|$|The {{recording}} industry and Hollywood in general {{have responded to}} declining music sales by attempting to expand excessively intellectual property protection, domestically through the proposed, yet indefinitely postponed, Stop Online Piracy Act and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act, and internationally through the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and the intellectual property provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Such legislation restricts free speech, reduces innovation, and weakens due process rights on the internet. This paper proposes an alternative revenue-generating strategy—bespoke musical recordings that would be privately auctioned rather than publicly released. For example, a recording of Anne-Sophie Mutter playing a piece she has never publicly performed would be sold to a music lover or an investment fund as a one-of-a-kind recording, as unique as an Artemisia Gentileschi painting or a Camille Claudel sculpture. Besides providing the {{recording industry}} with additional revenue, bespoke recordings would generate more income for musicians, augment funds for music outreach programs and other music nonprofits, and increase the chances of discovering new musical talent. Similarly to many new markets, it would take time for such recordings to generate substantial revenue. To aid {{the development of a}} <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> for bespoke recordings, numerous new legal and institutional arrangements would be established, including a bespoke recording registry, tailored contractual agreements, anti-counterfeit protections, and a secure bespoke recording storage facility.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades the shape of the European public {{administration}} has changed considerably; the EU has become much more strongly involved in the regulation of very dynamic and <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> activities. One of the consequences of that has been an increasing reliance on EU regulatory agencies to perform the novel administrative tasks. While agencies can be beneficial for the EU, they also generate new problems. In particular, these bodies have limited resources and have to rely on (national and sector) external capacities to a significant extent. There is a risk here that if the important issues are mainly capacity-related and „liquid‟, {{it will be very difficult}} to ensure „checks and balances‟ in these institutional systems. The thesis examines this through case-studies (EU regulatory agencies) in medicines, chemicals, financial services and aviation. It finds that the problems in each EU agency are different and unpredictable. In such a context, having more external and static controls on the agencies will hardly improve things. An alternative „framework‟ (that of fluid administrative law) should be considered to deal with the challenges of the new administrative state. It promotes constant administrative law principles (internal process, external justification, commitment to pluralism and policy effectiveness) to coordinate the operation of the agencies, and offers institutional tools for the dynamic application of such principles. As the „solutions‟ for each agency should have to vary, the review of these bodies (which usually occurs every three years) could be used to address the required heterogeneity of the controls. In order to make the best use of that exercise, the creation of a new European agency to review the regulatory agencies and make proposals for each of them (according to the fluid law principles) might be envisioned...|$|E
40|$|D. Comm. In the South African context leading {{multinational}} companies within mining, automotive, {{financial and}} other sectors {{are faced with}} the complexity of: uncertain political policies, <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> dynamics, and market follower status in global relations. In addition, emerging markets are directly affected by capital and structural adjustments in first world economies, as currency flows direct to safe-haven markets under uncertainty. Thus, additional complexities of: currency fluctuations, energy cost increases, implied inflationary spikes, and pending recession become a reality, and have an enormous impact on how organisations manage within the unforeseen complexity that this brings to the local economy. As complex environmental factors beyond organisational boundaries and management’s ability to predict and control, start impacting on an organisation’s material capital flows, this uncertainty will drive leadership to review their current worldview. This researcher argues that this new worldview must be a shift away from a Newtonian-Cartesian paradigm, that through its cause-and-effect scientific base has modelled the world and its structures around a rigid linear approach, that cannot cope within the complexities exerted on the system. It is suggested therefore, by the researcher that the shift in leadership thinking should be towards a different paradigm, built on complexity based models using quantum Einsteinian-Quantum physics as a metaphor. The impact of this shift in paradigm, towards an Einsteinian-Quantum worldview, has an has an implicative effect for organisations in terms of; mental models, subsequent organisational design, the values that support this, the leadership behaviours that are a response to these value sets and the resultant directional quantum leap outcome within a multi-dimensional range of examples including; material (financial), social and spiritual capital aspects of the organisation.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the common notions of negotiable instruments {{as they relate}} to the modern day promissory note in the context of residential mortgage lending. The Article further addresses the destruction of the negotiability of such promissory notes through various undertakings added {{for the benefit of the}} banking industry, often to the detriment of a borrower. The use of negotiable instruments commenced in the 1800 s in England as a way of ensuring a <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> between trades as there was no fiat currency system in place. The fundamental purpose behind the concept of negotiability was subsequently abrogated by the modernization of the financial industry, and the creation of a global marketplace for the purchase and sale of promissory notes. Furthermore, the Article discusses how the holder in due course doctrine, which limits a borrower’s defenses when a promissory note has been transferred from one note holder to another, has created significant abuse to consumers by the financial industry. The abuse of consumers through the holder in due course doctrine remains a problem unchecked by many courts that continue to apply negotiability law to modern day promissory notes in real estate mortgage transactions despite the fact that modern day promissory notes lack any of the tenets of “negotiability” under article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The Article then calls on the judiciary, as theoretically the least political and most impartial branch of government, to find that such promissory notes are no longer negotiable instruments, and therefore must be transferred via assignment pursuant to article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Such a new construct or approach would provide the transparency necessary to protect consumers and preserve defenses to predatory lending by the financial industry...|$|E
40|$|Restructuring is {{attempting}} to bring the economic efficiency of competitive markets to the electric power industry. To at least some extent it is succeeding. New generation is being built in most {{areas of the country}} reversing the decades-long trend of declining reserve margins. Competition among generators is typically robust, holding down wholesale energy prices. Generators have shown that they are very responsive to price signals in both the short and long term. But a market that is responsive only on the supply side is only half a market. Demand response (elasticity) is necessary to gain the full economic advantages that restructuring can offer. Electricity is a form of energy that is difficult to store economically in large quantities. However, loads often have some ability to (1) conveniently store thermal energy and (2) defer electricity consumption. These inherent storage and control capabilities can be exploited to help reduce peak electric system consumption. In some cases they {{can also be used to}} provide system reliability reserves. Fortunately too, technology is helping. Advances in communications and control technologies are making it possible for loads ranging from residential through commercial and industrial to respond to economic signals. When we buy bananas, we don't simply take a dozen and wait a month to find out what the price was. We always ask about the price before we decide how many bananas we want. Technology is beginning to allow at least some customers to think about their electricity consumption the same way they think about most of their other purchases. And power system operators and regulators are beginning to understand that customers need to remain in control of their own destinies. Many customers (residential through industrial) are willing to respond to price signals. Most customers are not able to commit to specific responses months or years in advance. Electricity is a <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> commodity with a volatile value to both producers and consumers. Fortunately too, only a percentage of loads need to respond elastically for all customers to benefit.

40|$|In his {{dialogue}} entitled - A Look Back to Look Forward: New Patterns In The Supply/Demand Equation In The Lodging Industry - by Albert J. Gomes, Senior Principal, Pannell Kerr Forster, Washington, D. C. What {{the author}} intends {{for you to}} know is the following: “Factors which influence the lodging industry in the United States are changing that industry as far as where hotels are being located, what clientele is being served, and what services are being provided at different facilities. The author charts these changes and makes predictions for the future. ” Gomes initially alludes {{to the evolution of}} transportation – the human, animal, mechanical progression - and how those changes, in the last 100 years or so, have {{had a significant impact on}} the hotel industry. “A look back to look forward treats the past as prologue. American hoteliers are in for some startling changes in their business,” Gomes says. “The man who said that the three most important determinants for the success of a hotel were “location, location, location” did a lot of good only in the short run. ” Gomes wants to make you aware of the existence of what he calls, “locational obsolescence. ” “Locational obsolescence is a fact of life, and at least in the United States bears a direct correlation to evolutionary changes in transportation technology,” he says. “…the primary business of the hospitality industry is to serve travelers or people who are being transported,” Gomes expands the point. Tied to the transportation element, the author also points out an interesting distinction between hotels and motels. In addressing, “…what clientele is being served, and what services are being provided at different facilities,” Gomes suggests that the transportation factor influences these constituents as well. Also coupled with this discussion are oil prices and shifts in transportation habits, with reference to airline travel being an ever increasing method of travel; capturing much of the inter-city travel market. Gomes refers to airline deregulation as an impetus. The point being, it’s a <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> rather than a static one, and [successful] hospitality properties need to be cognizant of market dynamics and be able to adjust to the variables in their marketplace. Gomes provides many facts and figures to bolster his assertions. Interestingly and perceptively, at the time of this writing, Gomes alludes to America’s deteriorating road and bridge network. As of right now, in 2009, this is a major issue. Gomes rounds out this study by comparing European hospitality trends to those in the U. S...|$|E

The six games include a vertical integration model, a vertical Nash game, a manufacturer Stackelberg game, a generalized manufacturer Stackelberg game, a retailer Stackelberg game and a generalized retail Stackelberg. The best-fit generalized manufacturer Stackelberg game indicates that coffee manufacturers have significant channel power and price transmission is very poor in the US ground coffee market.
