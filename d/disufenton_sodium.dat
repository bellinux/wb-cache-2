25|$|Neuroprotective agents {{including}} antioxidants which combat reactive oxygen species, or inhibit programmed cell death, or inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters {{have been}} shown experimentally to reduce tissue injury caused by ischemia. Until recently, human clinical trials with neuroprotective agents have failed, with the probable exception of deep barbiturate-induced coma. <b>Disufenton</b> <b>sodium,</b> the disulfonyl derivative of the radical-scavenging phenylbutylnitrone, {{was reported to be}} neuroprotective. This agent is thought to work {{at the level of the}} blood vessel lining. However the favourable results evidenced from one large-scale trial were not reproduced in a second trial. So that the benefit of <b>disufenton</b> <b>sodium</b> is questionable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Disufenton</b> <b>sodium</b> (NXY-059, Cerovive) is the disulfonyl {{derivative}} of the neuroprotective spin trap phenylbutylnitrone or [...] "PBN". It was under {{development at the}} drug company AstraZeneca. A 2005 phase-3 clinical trial called [...] "SAINT-1" [...] reported some efficacy in the acute treatment of ischemia injury due to stroke. However, a 2006 attempt to repeat this trial indicated no significant activity. After ruling out other causes, the authors tentatively attributed the positive results in the first trial to [...] "chance". AstraZeneca then terminated the development programme. [...] PBN and its derivatives hydrolyze and oxidize in vitro to form respectively MNP-OH (AKA, NtBHA) and its parent spin-trap MNP.|$|E
