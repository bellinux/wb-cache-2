That's the reason that performance and durability were of such prime consideration from the very beginning." [...] Although some of components were interchangeable between the AMC 258 cubic inch six-cylinder and the new engine, the four-cylinder was not a cut down version of the big six. Noted Roy Lunn, [...] "There are some common parts, but the 4-cylinder includes many unique items such as its own electronics systems. It also has a shorter stroke and larger bore. The valves are larger and the pistons are new." [...] Roy Lunn recalled: [...] "We wanted as much displacement - for power and torque - as possible {{within the confines of}} bore centers of the tooling. The only parameter we could influence substantially was stroke. So we picked the largest bore and stroke in order to get 2.5 Liters." ...|$|E

[...] The title was confirmed to be in development by EA's chief operating officer, John Pleasants, at a Stock meeting in June 2009, where he stated: [...] "We've taken the Burnout team and combined <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> Need for Speed franchise. So we now have that in our favor because that Burnout team {{is probably one of the}} more online-centric and notably high-quality game developers that we have out at Criterion." [...] Shift producer, Jesse Abney, expressed his delight to work with Criterion Games, stating that it would be a [...] "great team to work with on that stuff," [...] referencing the development of Need for Speed. [...] It was reported that the game was scheduled for release in Q4 2010. EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, [...] "a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio," [...] in a post-financial report conference call. The title was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010, with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer. According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.|$|E
2500|$|Britain's {{economic}} {{weakness and}} {{its dependence on}} the financial support of the United States (Britain had received a large American loan in 1946 and the Marshall Plan began in mid-1947), left him little alternative but to yield to American pressure over Palestine policy. At the reconvened London Conference in January 1947, the Jewish negotiators were only prepared to accept partition and the Arab negotiators only a unitary state (which would automatically have had an Arab majority). Neither would accept limited autonomy under British rule. When no agreement could be reached, Bevin threatened to hand the problem over to the United Nations. The threat failed to move either side, the Jewish representatives because they believed that Bevin was bluffing and the Arabs because they believed that their cause would prevail before the General Assembly. Bevin accordingly {{announced that he would}} [...] "ask the UN to take the Palestine question into consideration." [...] A week later, the strategic logic of Britain retaining a presence in Palestine was removed when the intention to withdraw from India in August of that year was announced. The decision to allow the United Nations to dictate the future of Palestine was formalised by the Attlee government's public declaration in February 1947 that Britain's Mandate in Palestine had become [...] "unworkable." [...] Of the UN partition plan which resulted, Bevin commented: [...] "The majority proposal is so manifestly unjust to the Arabs {{that it is difficult to}} see how we could reconcile <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> conscience." [...] During the remainder of the Mandate, fighting between the Jewish and Arab communities intensified. The end of the Mandate and Britain's final withdrawal from Palestine was marked by the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when five Arab states intervened in the inter-communal fighting. [...] The Arab armies were led by the state with that position which was most effective, Jordan, whose military forces were trained and led by British officers. The war ended with Israel, in addition to the territory assigned by the UN for the creation of a Jewish state, also in control of much of the Mandate territory which had been assigned by the UN for the creation of an Arab state. The remainder was divided between Jordan and Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of, overwhelmingly Arab, civilians had become displaced.|$|E
