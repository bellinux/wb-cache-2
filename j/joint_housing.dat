Computational algorithms were developed to establish the criteria for optimization, such as minimizing the required recycling, the energy consumption in pumping, and the diameter of the pipes in the secondary circuit of the distribution network. The numerical method adopted, the conjugate gradient method combined with a genetic algorithm, has exhibited a very satisfactory degree of convergence, even though high-oscillation amplitudes were observed, which are attributed to slight varia-tions in the pipe diameters (commercial).

Desirably a braced knee joint should effectively duplicate the compound, complex, actions of a normal knee. The key to knee braces is the knee <b>joint</b> <b>housing.</b> The housing herein carries a number of cam action pawls. with teeth adapted to engage the internal teeth of a ratchet ring mounted in the housing. Cam action return springs and {{the shape of the}} cam action pawl teeth allow rotation of the ratchet ring in a leg straightening direction while still supporting a load. The leg can then be extended during walking {{while at the same time}} being prevented by the cam action pawls from buckling in the knee bending direction...|$|E

When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler <b>joint</b> <b>house</b> precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the <b>joint</b> <b>house</b> resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|R
40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two needle bearings, and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the needle bearings. The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear actuator) via a pin. This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger diameter flange of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of needle bearings, one {{on each side of the}} flange. During the assembly of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the needle bearings. The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The needle bearings with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the <b>joint</b> <b>housing</b> while providing minimal friction during rotation. The diameter of the flange and the bearings can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|E
