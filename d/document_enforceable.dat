Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of {{the separation of church and}} state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil <b>document,</b> <b>enforceable</b> in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{shrink-wrap}} licenses {{are legally}} binding differs between jurisdictions, though {{a majority of}} jurisdictions hold such licenses to be enforceable. At particular issue is the difference in opinion between two US courts in Klocek v. Gateway and Brower v. Gateway. Both cases involved a shrink-wrapped license document provided by the online vendor of a computer system. The terms of the shrink-wrapped license were not provided {{at the time of}} purchase, but were rather included with the shipped product as a printed document. The license required the customer to return the product within a limited time frame if the license was not agreed to. In Brower, New York's state appeals court ruled that the terms of the shrink-wrapped license <b>document</b> were <b>enforceable</b> because the customer's assent was evident by its failure to return the merchandise within the 30 days specified by the document. The U.S. District Court of Kansas in Klocek ruled that the contract of sale was complete {{at the time of the}} transaction, and the additional shipped terms contained in a document similar to that in Brower did not constitute a contract, because the customer never agreed to them when the contract of sale was completed.|$|R

Over the years, these compliance agreements {{have been used to}} implement much of the cleanup activity at DOE sites, which is carried our primarily under two federal laws - the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 0 f 1976, as amended (RCRA). Our objectives were to determine the types of compliance agreements in effect at DOE cleanup sites, DOE's progress in achieving the milestones contained in the agreements, whether the agreements allowed DOE to prioritize work across sites according to relative risk, and possible implications the agreements have on DOE's efforts to improve the cleanup program...|$|R
40|$|Contribution of the Lisbon Treaty to the {{protection}} of human rights in the European Union The aim of this thesis is to analyze the changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty to {{the protection}} of human rights in the European Union. The author focuses on two key areas: 1, The Charter of Fundamental Rights has become legally binding and thus <b>enforceable</b> <b>document</b> by the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. The author outlines how the agenda of the protection of human rights has grown to become the Union's major theme, and what preceded it, the Union now has its own catalog of rights. The author describes the systematics of the Charter and the reasons why countries like Great Britain, Poland and the Czech Republic consequently negotiated an exception to its applicability. 2, The possibility of accession of the EU as a whole to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950, a significant human rights document of Council of Europe. If indeed such a step was taken, it would become the Union's 48 th Party to the Convention in addition to 47 member states of the Council of Europe and in this context the question arises, what would be the future relationship of the ECJ and the Court of Human Rights.

40|$|In {{making an}} {{arbitration}} award, the arbitrator must define it clearly, unambiguously Justly and enforceability. Once {{the award is}} made and published, is a final and binding <b>document</b> and <b>enforceable</b> as a judgment of the High Court. However, the award can still be challenged when an arbitrator had committed a clear error of law {{on the face of}} an award where a court can set aside or remit the award to the arbitrator for further consideration. There is no provision in both 1952 Act and 2005 Act to limit and no clear definition as to what exactly means by "error of law on the face of award". Thus, it does not provide guidelines for the losing party to decide whether the award is error {{on the face of it}} and should they challenge the arbitral award under this ground. Normally it is for the court to decide. Hence, this research intends to determine the judicial interpretations on "error of law on the face of arbitration award". This research was carried out mainly through documentary analysis of law journals and law reports. Results show that there are four judicial interpretations for "error of law on the face of award". The first interpretation is when the award not satisfies the essential features of a valid award. Second, appears by the award that the arbitrator has proceeded illegally for instance decided using evidence which the law was not admissible or using principles of construction which the law did not countenance. Next interpretation is the error must be such that it can be found in the award, or in a document actually incorporated with it. Lastly, there is an error of law on the face of award when there is found some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous. It is recommended that the four judicial interpretations should be included in the Arbitration Act so that it can be the guidelines for the party who wish to challenge the award under the ground of error of law on the face of award...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{covenants}} (or easements) are flexible but legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>documents</b> {{attached to}} a land title restricting {{the use of that}} land, providing for the protection of important conservation values, while allowing the landholder to retain possession. Given the attractiveness of covenants to those who seek to expand national and regional nature conservation initiatives, {{it is important to understand}} landholder motivations for participation in programmes that covenant for nature conservation. This paper examines the likely influences on landholder decision making when it comes to conservation initiatives. A review of literature highlights key motivations and determinants, such as landholder demographics and the nature of the land tenure in question, their knowledge and awareness of the programme, financial circumstances, and perceptions of financial and other risks and benefits of the programme itself, including incentives and compensation. Underpinning, or mediating, the decision-making processes will be landholder philosophies and values, and five constructs are determined from the review, namely economic dependence on property, private property rights, confidence in perpetual covenant mechanisms, nature conservation equity and nature conservation ethic. Using these constructs, a series of explicit hypotheses is drawn, applicable to agencies dealing with conservation covenants and testable through an adaptive management approach. A conceptual model is presented to show hypothesized relationships between motivational factors and the five constructs that will lead to the uptake of covenants by landholders, providing direction for policy makers and managers of incentive programmes for nature conservation on private lands...|$|R
40|$|In {{both his}} 2013 and 2014 annual reports the Australian Inspector-General of Taxation {{wrote of the}} need to {{consider}} the adoption of a taxpayers' bill of rights in Australia. Whilst a charter of taxpayer rights has been a feature of ATO administration for almost two decades it does not provide a legal remedy for an aggrieved taxpayer. In the absence of constitutional protection for fundamental rights, and the inapplicability of Australian human rights legislation to taxation matters, the courts have been reluctant to extend legal protections to taxpayers. If neither the Taxation Administration Act 1953 nor the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 are applicable then, typically, taxpayers are left to the vagaries of the ATO's internal dispute resolution procedures or to attempt to convince the Ombudsman, and now Inspector-General, of the merits of their case. It is notable that in Europe there is a body of jurisprudence on the application of the European Convention on Human Rights to taxation matters by virtue of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights ("ECtHR"). It is proposed to examine these developments to identify if there are any lessons for Australia as we (again) consider the need for, and possible framework of, a taxpayers' bill of rights. The various articles of the Convention that impact on tax matters will be outlined together with the approach by the ECtHR to interpreting these articles. These principles will then be applied to recent Australian controversies (which otherwise lacked a legal remedy) using as a reference the ECtHR tax jurisprudence. The aim will be to gauge whether an appropriate resolution would have been achieved in these matters had these articles been incorporated into Australian law. It will be demonstrated that, in many cases, with some amendment or re-interpretation, these articles would have provided a legal solution. The paper adds to the chorus {{of the need to}} enshrine taxpayer, if not citizen rights, in a legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>document...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although some {{statements}} {{made before the}} contract was entered into may have been intended to operate as terms, not all such statements will in fact operate as terms. Whether or not a statement made during negotiations is an enforceable term depends {{on whether or not}} the contract is one that is fully in writing, or one that contains an oral agreement. If a contract is fully in writing, then no {{statements made}} outside of the contractual <b>document</b> will be <b>enforceable.</b> This is known as the Parol evidence rule. This is sometimes made even more explicit by the inclusion of an entire agreement clause, which clarifies that no other statements or extrinsic materials may have any bearing on the terms. In the absence of an entire agreement or merger clause, the parties' intention for the whole of the agreement to be in the written contract must be considered. By the flexible approach, extrinsic evidence may be admitted in the determination of whether the agreement is wholly in writing. That is, the prima facie appearance of the contract to be a complete contract provides no more than an evidentiary basis for inferring that the document was wholly written. The presence of a written document creates a presumption that all the terms are contained in that document, but courts have recently been willing to allow this presumption to be rebutted. If the extrinsic evidence was promissory in nature [...] and viewed objectively was intended by the parties to supplement the written document and form part of the contract, the existence of the evidence may support the view that the document was not wholly in writing and thus could be incorporated into the contract. [...] Such a contract would be considered to be partly written and partly oral. For contracts that are made entirely by oral agreement, a statement will be an express term if it is promissory in nature.|$|R
