25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{opportunities}} in 1944 of international and nationwide gathering of Bahá'ís, the first Bahá'í World Congress {{was attended by}} Bahá'ís from South Carolina where again {{the scope of the}} community was more plain and invigorating to those that attended. “Seeing all these people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, the beauty of these diverse people coming together for one purpose, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> could happen all over the world. It wasn’t just in Greenville, South Carolina; this was a world community.…I already knew that, but at the World Congress I saw it.” This event saw the election of the Universal House of Justice, the new head of the religion since the death of Shoghi Effendi, for the first time.|$|E

It felt like it should groove there. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money.

The Chemical Brothers refer to [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as their [...] "manifesto"; their 1996 track [...] "Setting Sun" [...] is a direct tribute to it. John Foxx of Ultravox also cited the song as an influence, saying that [...] "As soon as I heard it, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> contained almost everything that I would want to investigate {{for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was going to be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E
500|$|According to the Church of Scientology, [...] "even some {{fifty years}} later, those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage {{as the one}} grand {{adventure}} in the twilight of their youth." [...] Hubbard put it somewhat differently, writing in 1935 that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He told Look magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition [...] "was a two-bit expedition and financial bust, and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933." [...] The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds.|$|E

500|$|On April Fools' Day on , Sunsoft {{announced}} that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master: Destination Fred. According to their press release, the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice-10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989. Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these. When I was going through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> had to be put up on the Virtual Console as fast as we could make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{blamed the}} expedition's {{problems}} on the captain: [...] "the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts." [...] Specimens and photographs collected by the expedition are said by Scientology accounts to have been acquired by the University of Michigan, the U.S. Hydrographic Office, an unspecified national museum and the New York Times, though none of those institutions have any record of this. Hubbard later wrote that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He called it [...] "a two-bit expedition and financial bust", which resulted in some of its participants making legal claims against him for refunds.|$|E

500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be interesting to act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{opposite}} Sacha Parkinson, {{who plays}} Sian Powers, Thompson filmed his first screen kiss. He {{said of the}} experience, [...] "It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn't. I knew the line I had to say and then kiss her. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> every time, and every time I said it I was shaking." [...] He continued, [...] "Oh it was dreadful. I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I was {{in the back of the}} landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E
