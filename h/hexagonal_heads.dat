50|$|The type {{species for}} Cyanomyovirus {{of the family}} Myoviridae is Cyanophage AS-1, which was {{isolated}} from a waste stabilization pond, and {{was also the first}} genus recognized. The tails have been observed as either contractile or noncontractile with lengths of 20 to 244 nm, widths of 15 to 23 nm, and a shrinking range of 93 nm. Cyanophages generally have isometric <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> with diameters ranging from 55 to 90 nm. There is large morphological variation in this group, which suggests that they infect a variety of host species. At the point of attachment between the long tail and the head there is a base plate where short pins are attached, a contractile sheath, and an internal core, similar to other bacteriophages in the Myoviridae.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 15 {{wild-type}} Brocothrix thermosphacta strains isolated from beef {{and the type}} strain, B. thermosphacta ATCC 11509, were used as hosts for the isolation of bacteriophages under psychrotrophic conditions (7 degrees C). A total of 21 virulent, psychrotrophic phages were successfully isolated and purified from aqueous extracts of spoiled rib steaks. Phage plaque size and plating efficiency significantly increased as incubation temperature was reduced from 25 to 1 degree C. Electron microscopy of two homologous B. thermosphacta phages showed the virions to consist of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and tails, with terminal appendages clearly visible {{on one of the}} phages. On the basis of culture and biochemical data, the wild-type B. thermosphacta strains had characteristics identical to those of strain ATCC 11509. However, specific differences in the pattern of susceptibilities to the phages revealed the presence of 14 distinct phage lysotypes.

40|$|Bacteriophages {{have been}} {{proposed}} as specific alternative for chemotherapy against multidrug resistant bacterial infections. The aim {{of the present study}} was the isolation and purification of bacteriophages from sewage, which were effective against multidrug resistant bacterial isolates and detection of their morphological characteristics. Sewage and clinical samples were used for the isolation of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. The bacteriophages were isolated and purified from sewage samples by overlay cultures of the isolated bacteria after centrifugation and filtration procedures. Three isolates of the most multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa selected for bacteriophage isolation. Most of the isolates were resistant to different classes of antibiotics in the aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines and β-lactam antibiotic groups. The isolated bacteriophges showed different plaque morphologies on the bacterial cultures. The three purified bacteriophages had icosahedral or <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads.</b> Long tails observed in Escherichia coli bacteriophages, with the total length of about 170 nm for the phages particles; short tails observed in Klebsiella pneumonia phages particles, with the approximate total lengths of 150 nm; and short tails with the approximate 35 nm total particles length observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to induce and characterize verotoxin-encoding phages from a collection of 91 verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O 103 :H 2 strains of human and bovine origins. All the strains carried the vt 1 gene, and two carried the vt 2 gene as well. The phages were induced by UV irradiation and characterized by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), genome size, morphology, and Q and P genes, characteristic of lambdoid phages. A total of 32 vt-positive phages were induced and isolated from 31 VTEC O 103 :H 2 strains. Thirty phages were vt 1 positive, and two were vt 2 positive. Ten of the 30 vt 1 -positive phages (33. 3 %) were from cattle strains, and 20 (66. 6 %) were from human strains. The two vt 2 -positive phages were from human strains. Phages belonged to 21 RFLP profiles, of which 17 were single-phage profiles and 4 were multiple-phage profiles. The estimated genome size of the phages ranged from 34 to 84 kb. Two phages that were examined by electron microscopy possessed <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> with long tails, and one had an elongated head with a long tail. The Q and P genes were amplified in all 32 phages, and the Q-stxA 1 gene region yielded an amplicon in 19 phages (59. 3 %). It is concluded that the VTEC O 103 :H 2 strains of human origin were more readily inducible than those of bovine origin and that the genotypic profiles of verotoxin-encoding phages were highly diverse, as revealed by their RFLP profiles...|$|E

40|$|A {{bacteriophage}} encoding the Shiga toxin 2 c variant (Stx 2 c) {{was isolated}} from the human Escherichia coli O 157 strain CB 2851 and shown to form lysogens on the E. coli K- 12 laboratory strains C 600 and MG 1655. Production of Stx 2 c {{was found in the}} wild-type E. coli O 157 strain and the K- 12 lysogens and was inducible by growing bacteria in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Phage 2851 is the first reported viable bacteriophage which carries an stx 2 c gene. Electron micrographs of phage 2851 showed particles with elongated <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and long flexible tails resembling phage lambda. Sequence analysis of an 8. 4 -kb region flanking the stx 2 c gene and other genetic elements revealed a mosaic gene structure, as found in other Stx phages. Phage 2851 showed lysis of E. coli K- 12 strains lysogenic for Stx phages encoding Stx 1 (H 19), Stx 2 (933 W), Stx (7888), and Stx 1 c (6220) but showed superinfection immunity with phage lambda, presumably originating from the similarity of the cI repressor proteins of both phages. Apparently, phage 2851 integrates at a different chromosomal locus than Stx 2 phage 933 W and Stx 1 phage H 19 in E. coli, explaining why Stx 2 c is often found in combination with Stx 1 or Stx 2 in E. coli O 157 strains. Diagnostic PCR was performed to determine gene sequences specific for phage 2851 in wild-type E. coli O 157 strains producing Stx 2 c. The phage 2851 q and o genes were frequently detected in Stx 2 c-producing E. coli O 157 strains, indicating that phages related to 2851 are associated with Stx 2 c production in strains of E. coli O 157 that were isolated in different locations and time periods...|$|E
40|$|Phages {{encoding}} {{production of}} Vero cytotoxins VT 1 or VT 2 were isolated from strains of Escherichia coli {{of human and}} bovine origin. Two human strains of serotype 0 1 57 : H 7 produced both VT 1 and VT 2 and each carried two separate phages encoding either VT 1 or VT 2. The phages were morphologically similar {{to each other and}} to a VT 2 phage previously isolated from a strain of serotype 0157 : H-; all had regular <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and short tails. The phages had similar genome sizes and DNA hybridization and restriction enzyme digestion showed that the DNAs were very closely related. This contrasts with another report that one of the strains tested (933) released two clearly distinguishable phages separately encoding VTl and VT 2. The 0157 phages differed from a VT 1 phage isolated from a bovine E. coli strain belonging to serotype 026 : H 11 and from the reference VT 1 phage isolated previously from a human strain, H 19, of serotype 026 : H 1 1. The two 026 phages were morphologically similar with elongated heads and long tails. They had similar genome sizes and DNA hybridization indicated a high level of homology between them. Hybridization of an 0157 phage DNA probe to DNA of the 026 phages, and vice versa, showed there was some cross-hybridization between the two types of phage. A phage from a bovine strain of serotype 029 : H 34 had a regular hexagonal head and short tail resembling those of the 0157 phages. The DNA was distinguishable from that of all the other phages tested in restriction digest patterns but hybridized significantly to that of an 0157 phage. Hybridization of the phage genomes with VTl and VT 2 gene probes showed that sequences encoding these toxins were highly conserved in the different phages from strains belonging to the three serogroups...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) family. These organisms are responsible for a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from non-bloody diarrhoea to gross bloody diarrhoea with complications that include haemorrhagic colitis (HC), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP). Infection occurs by the ingestion of faecally contaminated food products, water sources and through person-to-person contact. Outbreaks of E. coli O 157 :H 7 have been reported worldwide although most outbreaks seem to be from countries in the Northern hemisphere. Very little information is available on the prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in South Africa. The only data available on E. coli O 157 :H 7 were from a 1992 outbreak in Swaziland with some cases spreading to the adjacent provinces of South Africa. Selective methods were assessed and optimised to identify and isolate E. coli O 157 :H 7 from food, water and faeces. These methods included culture techniques, immunomagnetic separation, immunoassays and molecular confirmation techniques. The methods optimised and assessed in this study proved to be suitable for the detection and isolation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from environmental water, food and faecal samples. In addition to the isolation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from these sources, methods were also optimised for the characterisation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 using repetitive sequence analysis and induction of shiga toxin (Stx) ¬converting phages which carry the genes coding for Stx from strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7. The prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in human-, bovine- and porcine faeces, sewage and recreational waters was investigated in a selected region of South Africa. Data suggested a low prevalence in sewage (0. 76 %), recreational waters (0 %) and human faecal (0 %) samples with a higher prevalence among carriers such as cattle (12. 5 %) and pigs (14. 29 %). UV-induced Stx-converting phages were examined and found to have different phage morphologies to the previously described lambdoid structure. In order to establish the host range susceptibility of these phages, all induced phages were subjected to conditions favourable for infecting E. coli O 157 :H 7, non-O 157 E. coli and other members of the enterobacteriaceae family including Salmonella, Shigella, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus. These results have shown that Stx-phages were able to infect Salmonella cholerasuis and produce infectious progeny from these strains. Stx-converting phages propagated in Salmonella cholerasuis were able to re-infect strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7. This study has shown that IMS in combination with molecular techniques was a sensitive tool for the isolation, identification and characterisation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from different sources. Results indicated that Stx-phages induced from E. coli O 157 :H 7 demonstrated lambdoid structure as well as phages with long <b>hexagonal</b> <b>heads</b> and long non-contractile tails.

Methods: Samples of raw milk were examined for the presence of lactococcal bacteriophages. Samples were centrifuged and then filtered through 0. 45 µm pore size filters. The filtrates were added to early-exponential cultures of Lactococcus lactis subspp. Lactis (PTCC 1336). Overlay method was used to detect the formation of plaques. After isolation and concentration of phages, serial dilutions of phage stock were used to determine titer of phage in concentrated sample. Electron Microscopy was used for observation and characterization of structural details of bacteriophages. Results: Two phages were isolated; one of them had a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> of 45 × 30 nm in diameter and a flexible non-contractile tail of 70 nm long which belonged to Siphoviridae.

This fact, together with the absence of pathogenic genes in the F 108 genome, makes this bacteriophage a valuable tool for P. multocida genetic manipulation...|$|R

30|$|High {{stresses}} at the pin–bone interface {{contribute to}} micro-motion and failure resulting in unicortical loosening. Experimental models have demonstrated far higher pressures are generated under loading {{conditions at the}} bone interface from half pins as compared to fine wires [5]. The pin–bone interface has therefore been regarded as the weakest link in the mechanical stability of external fixation systems and has been investigated extensively [6, 7, 8]. In contrast, no studies {{have looked at the}} interface between the half pin and frame assembly. Loss of stability here compromises the bone remodelling process through a change in the biomechanics of the construct. In the systems of Ilizarov and Taylor Spatial frames (TSF) external fixation by Smith and Nephew, grub screws are used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate 2 different methods used (grub screw or 10  mm stainless steel <b>hexagonal</b> <b>headed</b> bolt [M 6 A 2 - 70]) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. This is to determine whether use of bolts is appropriate and could reduce the potential for loosening at this interface.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To isolate phages against {{extensively}} drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) and {{characterize the}} highest lytic capability phage {{as a model}} to evaluate the potential on phage therapy. Methods and Results: Eight phages were isolated from hospital sewage and showed narrow host spectrum. Phage wkm 18 p was able to effectively lyse the most XDRAB. It has a dsDNA genome of 45 kb in size and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> of about 59 nm in diameter and no tail. Bacterial population decreased quickly from 108 CFU ml 21 to 103 CFU ml 21 in 30 min by wkm 18 p. The 185 kDa lysis protein encoded by wkm 18 p genome was detected when the extracted protein did not boil before SDS-PAGE; it showed that the lysis protein is a complex rather than a monomer. Phage wkm 18 p improved human lung epithelial cells survival rates when they were incubated with A. baumannii. Combination of phages (wkm 18 p, wTZ 1 and w 314) as a cocktail could lyse all genotype-varying XDRAB isolates. Conclusion: Infections with XDRAB are extremely difficult to treat and development of a phage cocktails therapy could be...|$|R

Bacteriol. 91 : 340 – 348. 1965. —The {{biological and}} physical-chemical {{properties of the}} thermophilic bacteriophage TP- 84 were investigated. TP- 84 was shown to be lytic for 3 of 24 strains of Bacillus stearothermophilus tested over the temperature range of 43 to 76 C. The latent period of TP- 84 on B. stearothermophilus strain 10 was 22 to 24 min. TP- 84 has a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head,</b> 53 mμ in diameter and 30 mμ on a side; its tail is 130 mμ long and 3 to 5 mμ wide. The phage has an S 5020,w of 436, and bands at a density of 1. 508 g/cc in CsCl (pH 8. 5). The diffusion coefficient of TP- 84 was calculated to be 6. 19 × 10 − 8 cm 2 /sec. From the sedimentation and diffusion data, a particle molecular weight of 50 million daltons was calculated for TP- 84. The phage DNA has a base composition of 42 % guanine + cytosine, deduced from buoyant density and melting temperature measurements...|$|R
50|$|The museum {{considers}} its {{highlight to}} be three medieval ceremonial maces which date from the 15th century. The oldest of these, the Mace of the Faculty of Arts, was commissioned in 1416 and was probably made in Paris. It has a simple <b>hexagonal</b> <b>head</b> on which are engraved the images of saints and the coats of arms of various important families {{from the time of}} the foundation of the University of St Andrews. The second mace, that of the College of St Salvator, was made in Paris by Jean Maiel in 1461. The head is considered by some to be one of the finest pieces of medieval European silverware in existence. It shows Christ, or St Salvator, in the centre of an architectural shrine. He stands on a globe with his hands raised to show the nail marks. Around him stand three angels, each holding a symbol of the passion. The third mace, that of the Faculty of Canon Law, was probably made in Scotland in the mid-15th century and is thought to be a copy of the Mace of the Faculty of Arts, though the quality is not as good. Its probable origin in Scotland makes it particularly rare. These maces are still used during graduation ceremonies.|$|R
