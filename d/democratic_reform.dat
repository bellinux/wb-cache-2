5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly <b>democratic</b> <b>reform</b> {{of the electoral}} system, and also some Tory ones, including protectionism. He began to move in Tory circles. In 1834 he {{was introduced to the}} former Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, by Henrietta Sykes, wife of Sir Francis Sykes. She {{was having an affair with}} Lyndhurst, and began another with Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a fondness for intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} analyses {{the interaction}} between economic <b>reforms,</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms,</b> and economic growth. One of the salient characteristics of the transition region has been two very distinct patterns between economic and democratic reforms: convergence of the two reform dimensions in the CEE countries and divergence in Eurasia. Nevertheless, results from econometric tests (which attempt to control for possible intervening influences) suggest that economic and <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> are mutually reinforcing throughout the region, even in Eurasia. We also found evidence that: (1) economic reforms have a stronger impact on <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> than the reverse; (2) economic reforms favorably affect economic growth; (3) <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> favorably affect economic growth indirectly (via economic reforms) if not directly; and (4) while the feedback effects from economic growth to reforms are more ambiguous, {{there is some evidence}} that economic growth may actually stifle <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms,</b> and/or economic contraction may facilitate democratization. 2 USAID/E&E/PO Working Paper Series on the Transition Countrie...|$|R

5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the <b>democratic</b> <b>reform</b> that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
