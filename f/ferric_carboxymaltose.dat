We aimed to assess side effects and tolerance of <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> compared to i. v. iron sucrose in pregnant women. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 206 pregnant women who were treated either with <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> or iron sucrose for iron-deficiency anemia with intolerability to oral iron substitution, or insufficient hemoglobin increase after oral iron treatment, or need for rapid hemoglobin reconstitution. Primary endpoint was to evaluate the maternal safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoint was to assess efficacy of the treatment and exclude safety concerns for the fetus. Results: The incidence of drug-related adverse events was low and mostly mild in both groups. Mild adverse events occurred in 7. 8 % for <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> and in 10. 7 % for iron sucrose.

This meta-analysis addressed this by summarising the available date from clinical trials of <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> using clinical trial reports and published reports. Methods Clinical trial reports were supplemented by electronic literature searches comparing <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> with active comparators or placebo. Various outcomes were sought for efficacy (attainment of normal haemoglobin (Hb), increase of Hb by a defined amount, for example), together with measures of harm, including serious adverse events and deaths. Results Fourteen studies were identified with 2, 348 randomised patients exposed to <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose,</b> 832 to oral iron, 762 to placebo, and 384 to intravenous iron sucrose. Additional data were available from cohort studies. Intravenous <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> was given up to the calculated iron deficit (up to 1, 000 mg in one week) for iron deficiency anaemia secondary to chronic kidney disease, blood loss in obstetric and gynaecological conditions, gastrointestinal disease, and other conditions like heart failure. The most common comparator was oral iron, and trials lasted 1 to 24 weeks. Intravenous <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> improved mean Hb, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation levels; the mean end-of-trial increase over oral iron was, for Hb 4. 8 (95 % confidence interval 3. 3 to 6. 3) g/L, for ferritin 163 (153 to 173) Î¼g/L, and for transferrin saturation 5. 3 % (3. 7 to 6. 8 %). <b>Ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> was significantly better than comparator in achievement of target Hb increase (number needed to treat (NNT) 6. 8; 5. 3 to 9. 7) and target Hb NNT (5. 9; 4. 7 to 8. 1).

The increasing incidence of hip fracture has also raised the need for this scarce resource. Additionally, red-cell pack transfusions are not without complications which may involve excessive morbidity and mortality. This makes it necessary to develop blood-saving strategies. Our objective was to assess safety, efficacy, and cost-effictveness of combined treatment of i. v. <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> and erythropoietin (EPOFE arm) versus i. v. <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> (FE arm) versus a placebo (PLACEBO arm) in reducing the percentage of patients who receive blood transfusions, as well as mortality in the perioperative period of hip fracture intervention. Methods/Design Multicentric, phase III, randomized, controlled, double blinded, parallel groups clinical trial. Patients > 65 years admitted to hospital with a hip fracture will be eligible to participate. Patients will be treated with either a single dosage of i. v. <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> of 1 g and subcutaneous erythropoietin (40. 000 IU), or i. v. <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> and subcutaneous placebo, or i. v. placebo and subcutaneous placebo.

40|$|Sunil BhandariDepartment of Renal Medicine, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust and Hull York Medical School, Kingston upon Hull, UKBackground: The {{clinical}} {{need to be}} able {{to administer}} high doses of intravenous iron conveniently as a rapid infusion has been addressed by the recent introduction of <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> and subsequently iron isomaltoside 1000. Neither requires a test dose. The maximum dose of <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> is 1000 mg. The maximum dose of iron isomaltoside 1000 is based on 20 mg/kg body weight without a specified ceiling dose, thereby increasing the scope of being able to achieve total iron repletion with a single infusion. This ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia, which is associated with a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high. It is also an important component of the strategy as an alternative to blood transfusion. Affordability is a key issue for health services. Recent price changes affecting iron sucrose and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose,</b> plus modifications to the manufacturers&rsquo; prescribing information, have provoked this update. Methods: This study is a comparative analysis of the costs of acquiring and administering the newly available intravenous iron formulations against standard treatments in the hospital setting. The costs include the medication, nursing costs, equipment, and patient transportation. Three dosage levels (600 mg, 1000 mg, and 1600 mg) are considered. Results and conclusion: The traditional standard treatments, blood and iron sucrose, cost more than the alternative intravenous iron preparations across the dose spectrum and sensitivities. Low molecular weight iron dextran is the least expensive option at the 1600 mg dose level but has the caveat of a prolonged administration time and requirement for a test dose. At 600 mg and 1000 mg dose levels, both iron isomaltoside 1000 and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> are more economical than low molecular weight iron dextran. Iron isomaltoside 1000 is less expensive than <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> at all dose levels.

40|$|Background: Iron {{deficiency}} is {{a common}} nutritional deficiency amongst women of childbearing age. Peri-partum iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is associated with significant maternal, fetal and infant morbidity. Current options for treatment are limited: these include oral iron supplementation, which can be ineffective and poorly tolerated, and red blood cell transfusions, which carry an inherent risk and should be avoided. <b>Ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> is a new treatment option that may be better tolerated. The {{study was designed to}} assess the safety and efficacy of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) correction with intravenous <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> in pregnant women with mild, moderate and severe anaemia {{in the second and third}} trimester. Methods: Prospective observational study; 65 anaemic pregnant women received <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> up to 15 mg/kg between 24 and 40 weeks of pregnancy (median 35 weeks gestational age, SD 3. 6). Treatment effectiveness was assessed by repeat haemoglobin (Hb) measurements and patient report of well-being in the postpartum period. Safety was assessed by analysis of adverse drug reactions and fetal heart rate monitoring during the infusion. Results: Intravenous <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> infusion significantly increased Hb values (p < 0. 01) above baseline levels in all women. Increased Hb values were observed at 3 and 6 weeks post infusion and up to 8 weeks post-infusion. Ferritin values increased significantly after the infusion. Only 4 women had repeat ferritin values post-partum which remained above baseline levels. Fetal heart rate monitoring did not indicate a drug related negative impact on the fetus. Of the 29 (44. 6 %) women interviewed, 19 (65. 5 %) women reported an improvement in their well-being and 9 (31 %) felt no different after the infusion. None of the women felt worse.

40|$|Background: Intravenous (IV) iron {{preparations}} {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} anemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). All IV iron preparations carry a risk of causing hypersensitivity reactions. However, the pathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesize that a relevant number of these reactions are mediated by complement activation, resulting in a pseudo-anaphylactic clinical picture known as complement activation-related pseudo allergy (CARPA). Methods: First, the in-vitro complement- activating capacity was determined for 5 commonly used IV iron preparations using functional complement assays for the 3 pathways. Additionally, the preparations were tested in an ex-vivo model using the whole blood of healthy volunteers and HD patients. Lastly, in-vivo complement activation was tested for one preparation in HD patients. Results: In the in-vitro assays, iron dextran, and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> caused complement activation, which was only possible under alternative pathway conditions. Iron sucrose may interact with complement proteins, but did not activate complement in-vitro. In the ex-vivo assay, iron dextran significantly induced complement activation in the blood of healthy volunteers and HD patients. Furthermore, in the ex-vivo assay, <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> and iron sucrose only caused significant complement activation in the blood of HD patients. No in-vitro or ex-vivo complement activation was found for ferumoxytol and iron isomaltoside. IV iron therapy with <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> in HD patients did not lead to significant in-vivo complement activation. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that iron dextran and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> have complement-activating capacities in-vitro, and hypersensitivity reactions to these drugs could be CARPA-mediated.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} (ID) and anaemia {{are common}} in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The presence of anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in CHF, and ID is {{a major reason for}} the development of anaemia. Preliminary studies using intravenous (i. v.) iron supplementation alone in patients with CHF and ID have shown improvements in symptom status. FAIR-HF (Clinical Trials. gov NCT 00520780) was designed to determine the effect of i. v. iron repletion therapy using <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> on self-reported patient global assessment (PGA) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) in patients with CHF and ID. This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study recruiting ambulatory patients with symptomatic CHF with LVEF < 40 % (NYHA II) or < 45 % (NYHA III), ID [ferritin < 100 ng/mL or ferritin 100 - 300 ng/mL when transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20 %], and haemoglobin 9. 5 - 13. 5 g/dL. Patients were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> (Ferinject((R))) 200 mg iron i. v. or saline i. v. weekly until iron repletion (correction phase), then monthly until Week 24 (maintenance phase). Primary endpoints are (i) self-reported PGA at Week 24 and (ii) NYHA class at Week 24, adjusted for baseline NYHA class.

40|$|Intravenous iron {{preparations}} {{are typically}} classified as non-dextran-based or dextran/dextran-based complexes. The carbohydrate shell {{for each of}} these preparations is unique and is key in determining the various physicochemical properties, the metabolic pathway, and the immunogenicity of the iron-carbohydrate complex. As intravenous dextran can cause severe, antibody-mediated dextran-induced anaphylactic reactions (DIAR), {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore the potential of various intravenous iron preparations, non-dextran-based or dextran/dextran-based, to induce these reactions. An IgG-isotype mouse monoclonal anti-dextran antibody (5 E 7 H 3) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed to investigate the dextran antigenicity of low molecular weight iron dextran, ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside 1000, ferric gluconate, iron sucrose and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose,</b> as well as isomaltoside 1000, the isolated carbohydrate component of iron isomaltoside 1000. Low molecular weight iron dextran, as well as dextran-based ferumoxytol and iron isomaltoside 1000, reacted with 5 E 7 H 3, whereas <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose,</b> iron sucrose, sodium ferric gluconate, and isolated isomaltoside 1000 did not. Consistent results were obtained with reverse single radial immunodiffusion assay. The results strongly support the hypothesis that, while the carbohydrate alone (isomaltoside 1000) does not form immune complexes with anti-dextran antibodies, iron isomaltoside 1000 complex reacts with anti-dextran antibodies by forming multivalent immune complexes. Moreover, non-dextran based preparations, such as iron sucrose and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose,</b> do not react with anti-dextran antibodies. This assay allows to assess the theoretical possibility of a substance to induce antibody-mediated DIARs. Nevertheless, as this is only one possible mechanism that may cause a hypersensitivity reaction, a broader set of assays will be required to get an understanding of the mechanisms that may lead to intravenous iron-induced hypersensitivity reactions...|$|E

40|$|Sunil BhandariDepartment of Renal Medicine, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust and Hull York Medical School, Kingston upon Hull, UKBackground: The {{clinical}} {{need to be}} able {{to administer}} high doses of intravenous iron conveniently in a single rapid infusion has been addressed by the recent introduction of <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> and subsequently iron isomaltoside 1000. Neither requires a test dose. <b>Ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose</b> can be administered at 15 mg/kg body weight to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, whereas iron isomaltoside 1000 can be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight. The ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia in a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high (including chronic blood loss associated with inflammatory bowel disease, menorrhagia, and chronic kidney disease). It is also an important component in the strategy as an alternative to a blood transfusion. Affordability is a key issue for health services. Methods: This study was a comparative analysis of the costs of administering the newly available intravenous iron formulations against standard practice (blood transfusion, intravenous iron sucrose) by considering the cost of this treatment option plus nursing costs associated with administration, equipment for administration, and patient transportation in the secondary care (hospital) setting across three dosage levels (600 mg, 1000 mg, and 1600 mg). Results and conclusion: The analysis indicates that the use of iron isomaltoside 1000 results in a net saving when compared with iron sucrose, blood, and <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose.</b> At 600 mg and 1000 mg doses, it is cheaper than low-molecular-weight iron dextran but more expensive at a dose of 1600 mg. However, it takes six hours to administer low-molecular-weight iron dextran at this dose level, which is inconvenient and reduces patient throughput (productivity).

40|$|Background There is a {{significant}} clinical need for effective treatment of iron deficiency. A number of compounds that can be administered intravenously have been developed. This study ex-amines how the compounds are handled by macrophages and their relative potential to pro-voke oxidative stress. Methods Human kidney (HK- 2) cells, rat peritoneal macrophages and renal cortical homogenates were exposed to pharmaceutical iron preparations. Analyses were performed for indices of oxidative stress and cell integrity. In addition, in macrophages, iron uptake and release and cytokine secretion was monitored. Results HK- 2 cell viability was decreased by iron isomaltoside and ferumoxytol and all compounds induced lipid peroxidation. In the renal cortical homogenates, lipid peroxidation occurred at lowest concentrations with <b>ferric</b> <b>carboxymaltose,</b> iron dextran, iron sucrose and sodium fer-ric gluconate. In the macrophages, iron sucrose caused loss of cell viability. Iron uptake was highest for ferumoxytol and iron isomaltoside and lowest for iron sucrose and sodium ferric gluconate. Iron was released as secretion of ferritin or as ferrous iron via ferroportin. The latter was blocked by hepcidin.
