The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate retrospectively whether aPL testing at our Thrombosis Centre was justified. Methods: Medical records from 520 subjects for aPL screening tests for various clinical conditions were reviewed. The aPL screening tests were: lupus anticoagulant (LA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β(2) glycoptotein I (aβ(2) GPI). Requests for aPL screening were divided into justified, potentially justified or not adequately justified. Results: aPL testing <b>requests</b> were considered <b>justified</b> in 358 (69 %) patients, potentially justified in 66 (12. 6 %) and not adequately justified in 96 (18. 4 %).

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} {{efficiency}} of complaining as a method of social influence (Doliński, 2005). In Polish culture, complaining seems to be an efficient technique for initiating a dialogue, potentially increasing the effectiveness of persuasive messages expressed in a conversation. Methodology: The hypothesis was tested in two natural experiments. In the first one, a random sample of persons (n= 246) were asked to let the experimenter through to the checkout counter at a supermarket. The request was preceded either by (1) a dialogue, (2) a complaint, or (3) no prior contact. It was either substantially or seemingly justified. In the second study, customers in a shop (n= 46) were invited to pursue conversation initiated with (1) a positive statement or (2) a complaint regarding an extensive range of products. Findings: Study 1 proved that a seemingly <b>justified</b> <b>request</b> preceded by complaining is less effective (65. 6 per cent) than a request preceded by a dialogue (93. 8 per cent); this result is similar to the result of the control group (53. 1 per cent). When the request was substantially justified, both dialogue and complaining seemed equally effective (86 per cent and 90 per cent respectively) – more effective than the results of the control group (46 per cent). In Study 2, positive and negative remarks initiating a conversation triggered similar responses in terms of willingness to pursue the dialogue (73. 1 per cent and 78. 3 per cent respectively). Constraints to research: Natural experiments presented in the paper were not controlled for such variables as environmental factors or individual differences. Originality: Complaining has never been subject to systematized examination as a method of social influence. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{presenting}} {{the outcome of}} the final round of negotiations on CAP reform at a press conference on June 26 th 2003, the EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler claimed that the EU had 'largely said goodbye to an old system of support which distorted trade' and he maintained that the new system would be more 'trade friendly', and would put the EU 'on the offensive at the WTO negotiations in Cancun in September', with the EU looking for 'something in return' for the concessions they will now be able to make. He acknowledged that the reform was a compromise but maintained that it was 'an acceptable one', and claimed that the new system would no longer promote overproduction so that the trade-distorting effects of EU policies would be substantially reduced. In a speech to the European Parliament on July 9 th 2003, Commissioner Fischler sought to evaluate the final agreement on CAP reform. He began by reiterating the objectives of reform, namely to: make a substantial contribution to stabilising farmers' incomes {{and at the same time}} to diversifying their farming activities; promote healthy and better quality foods, produced under environmentally sound production methods, which respected animal welfare; improve the public image of agricultural-support programmes. He then set out the reforms agreed, namely: a multiple-choice system for the introduction of the single farm payment scheme from January 2005 (with exceptions upon <b>justified</b> <b>request</b> until 2007); the introduction of flexibility without distorting competition; the linkage of the single farm payments scheme to compliance with a range of standards (cross compliance); the use of the 2000 - 2002 payment entitlements as the basis for calculating the single decoupled farm payment. The introduction of decoupling alongside specific sector reforms will it is argued 'strengthen the EU's negotiating hand in the WTO Ministerial conference in Cancun in September'. Commissioner Fischler maintained that the EU is now well placed to reach agreement in Cancun and that it is now up to other countries to match the EU's concessions. Comment: The claim that the reform will lead to less trade distortion is only justified in a highly relative context, as the reference point for the claim is the level which EU production would have attained by 2009 were existing policies to be pursued until then. If this reference point is used then EU production levels post-reform in most major commodities subject to reform will be lower than in the scenario without reform. However, if the point of reference is current levels of EU production then post-reform EU production will be higher, but at prices that will be much lower than those currently prevailing. This will enable the EU to clear its markets more easily without recourse to WTO-restricted trade instruments. EU claims to the effect that the new policy will be less trade distorting thus need to be subjected to close and critical scrutiny.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Diagnostic Radiography in the Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012 Complete, accurate and justified radiological examination requests are prerequisite to radiological exposures. However, global research shows evidence of high numbers of incomplete and inaccurate requests {{as well as that}} up to 77 % radiological exposures are unjustified. Plain lumbar spine and plain skull radiology examinations are reported as being procedures that generate high dose and a low diagnostic yield. This study was designed to objectively measure the completeness, accuracy and justification of these two examinations {{in an effort to make}} inferences that will contribute to an improved radiology service. This research could therefore have positive effects on optimisation of radiation protection in Zimbabwe. Methodology A non participatory prospective descriptive analytical document review of quota sampled radiological request forms for 200 plain skull and 200 plain lumbar spine examinations was employed. Data was captured using structured data collection instruments designed and tested by the researcher for this study. The instrument was designed using the IAEA-HHS 4 (2010) minimum prescribed request data as a framework and adding additional form fields found to be relevant through a review of all identified radiological request template forms in use at the research site. Data analysis involved central tendency measures and inferential statistics. Results: The central tendency demonstrated for the two examinations was that generally referrers for plain lumbar spine and for plain skull radiology would respectively provide 38. 9 +/- 0. 6 % and 40. 2 +/- 0. 5 % overall examination request information. This information was significantly below expectation. There was however no significant difference between the samples’ means for the two examinations. The tendency demonstrated in patient information for lumbar spine and skull requests was that generally referrers would respectively provide 48. 4 +/- 0. 8 % and 49. 5 +/- 0. 8 % patient information. These values were inclusive of each other and they were significantly (p= 0. 00 Sig.) below expectation. There was however no significant difference between the two examinations’ data. The tendency demonstrated for examination information was that referrers for the research site would generally provide 29. 8 +/- 0. 8 % (lumbar) and 32. 6 +/- 0. 8 % (Skull) examination information. These values were significantly (p= 0. 000 Sig.) below expectation and demonstrated a significant difference between the sample means for the two examinations. With respect to referrer information, the tendency demonstrated was that generally referrers for plain lumbar spine and for plain skull examinations would respectively provide 38 +/- 1 % and 38. 5 +/- 0. 8 % referrer identification information. These were significantly below expectation (p= 0. 000 Sig.) but there was no significant difference between the samples’ means with respect to referrer information. With respect to accuracy of request data, it was observed that 5 % plain lumbar spine and 3 % plain skull requests were specific in so far as information documented on request forms could unambiguously identify the area to be imaged. It was also observed that 22. 5 % (lumbar spine) and 12 % (skull) examination requests were indicated and therefore justified. All requests forms were found to be legible. Conclusions: Generally, referrers to this research site tend to provide incomplete, inaccurate and unjustified radiological request data. The observed levels of completeness, accuracy and justification of requests were generally consistent between the two examinations relative to expectation. These levels had medico-legal implications and negative effects on optimisation of radiation protection to patients. Further research to establish causes of this variance in referral behaviour is recommended. The researcher also recommends further research to establish whether there is an association between requested examination and completeness, accuracy and justification of diagnostic radiology examination requests.

30|$|Long (30 - 100 year) {{climate change}} {{scenarios}} and impact studies {{that dominated the}} first three IPCC assessments may have been useful to frame political discourse toward mitigation policies, but are not relevant to the planning horizons of vulnerable farmers, or of governments of poorer countries grappling with immediate climate-sensitive development challenges. Few climate-sensitive agricultural decisions have planning horizons longer than about two decades, and most are much more immediate. Early policy under the UNFCCC compounded this dilemma by defining adaptation narrowly {{in terms of the}} anthropogenic change component of climate, and restricting the main adaptation funds to the verifiable additional adaptation costs imposed by anthropogenic climate change, while the cost of development that would target the sources of climate vulnerability had to be borne elsewhere (Pielke 2005; Khan and Roberts 2013; Ayers and Huq 2009). This “additionality” policy, which was meant to ensure that industrialized countries provide adaptation funds beyond existing development assistance commitments, was seen as an obstacle to poor countries securing funds for promising adaptation options that also addressed immediate climate-related development challenges. For adaptation interventions with longer planning horizons, the considerable uncertainty inherent in projections of local changes in climate (particularly precipitation) complicates decision-making, and the challenge of <b>justifying</b> <b>requests</b> for adaptation funds. By focusing on immediate actions that target vulnerability and build resilience to the impacts of climate across time scales, CRM is increasingly recognized as a crucial bridge between immediate development challenges and longer-term adaptation.|$|R
