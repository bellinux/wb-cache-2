The unknown {{in this case}} is the negative or positive behaviors or properties that emerge from a complex software system. The application of systems theory to software is becoming increasingly important as systems become more complex. Looking at a complex software system through the lens of systems science can give the manager the insight needed to understand and control negative or enhance positive emergent behaviors. This article provides an overview of some of the key terms and concepts of systems theory, complexity, and emergence. Both the positive and negative effects of emergent behavior on software systems are considered. Additionally, some speculative and new methodologies for managing undesirable emergent behavior are explored...|$|E

40|$|Problem: How does project {{managing}} {{appear in}} small IT-consulting companies and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> manager {{carry out their}} projects to create successful solutions for their customers? Purpose: The research has the purpose to analyze and review how IT-consults in small companies work and lead their projects to create profitability for the company, {{which leads to a}} good development for the company.    Methodology: The research is made on eight research objects in IT-consulting business and the sizes of them are between 1 - 49 employees. The research is made with a qualitative method to get closer to the research objects. Therefore the research is made in forms of interviews. The analysis is grounded on a comparison between the research data and the theories that are used in the research. Theoretical perspectives: The theories which have been used in the research are Involvement theory (Fill, 1999), PAFF-metoden (Marcusson & Ahlin, 2002), Projektledning (Tonnquist, 2006), Jakten på det effektiva projektet (Engwall, 1999) och Mervärde (Grönroos, 2002) Empirical foundation: The research data are founded from the interviews of the eight research objects, they have the fictive names: Gondor, Minas Morgul, Minas Tirith, Mordor, Osgiliath, Rivendell, Rohan and The Shire.  Analysis/Result: Each study object starts their projects with a pre-study phase, as the PAFF-method describes it. Each study object majorly involves their customers, which is equal to Fill’s theory about high involvement buying processes. This shows that the study objects are aware that they sell solutions that require high involvement of the customers. Four of the study object enjoy seeing that the customer contributes with high engagement and maintain a good level of ambition for the project; this is consistent with Engwall’s theory about organizational ideal types.   Conclusion: The project manager chooses not to rupture the present institutionalism. The project manager initiates the project with a pre-study phase. The project manager is sure to involve their customers. The service guaranty the project manager uses is “problem-free-guaranty”. The role of the project manager is to plan and organize the project; the project manager should also be a good communicator...|$|E

40|$|The general {{concept of}} {{communication}} for development {{is that it}} explores the use of communication – both as a tool and {{as a way of}} expressing processes of social change. Art can be regarded as a way of communication, and to use the arts in the field of communication for development is not new. Art as a force in social change has a long history. The purpose of this thesis is {{to take a closer look}} at the art project To Reveal, Remember and Expose and make an exploration of how or if an art project can facilitate new awareness, primarily around memories, heritage, identity and social change among project participants and city inhabitants encountered by the project. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the following questions: What kind of awareness will the participants get out of the project? Can the project create a new awareness in terms of memory and heritage? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> connect and relate to culture, identity and city space? Communication theory, concepts of culture and representation, identity and space in the form of private and public space are presented. Performance art and theory, art intervention, sitespecific art and tactical media are elaborated upon. The primary methodology used is participatory observation, which has been applied on the planning, actions and discussions of the project. An interview with the artist behind the project and a structural content analysis of texts written by the students that participated in the art project will complement the participatory observation. The analysis of the project showed that the project could create awareness among its participants, especially about people, time and space. The actions also gave some insight and awareness concerning memories and heritage of some objects and places. The project connected and related to culture, identity and space in different ways. There were similarities to tactical media as it create situations were criticality could occur, but it was hard to see a whole picture of the outcome as it was not possible to know what the “audience” thought. All topics are relevant in communication and development and social change, but the thesis was not able to show that the project could give access to ways of expressing processes of social change. For further research it is of relevance to consider the magnitude of social change an art project can bring, and take into consideration that social change usually take time and is hard to find in a short period of time...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore, how a joint project on {{meditation}} is {{a learning experience}} that can change participation in school. This project is made in {{a joint venture with}} the authors, a meditation teacher and a class of public school students and their teacher. The project has a duration of three months, during which the students meditate twice a day during school hours in the subject Understøttende Undervisning (UU) - an initiative introduced in the public school reform of 2014 to support school education. UU can be understood as part of the reform's overall strategy. As a new school reform has been made, the joint meditation project is initiated on grounds of criticism towards the one-sided view on learning, as a transfer of curriculum from teacher to student in the classroom, which is valued and measured through tests. In this context “well-being” is seen as something that should be enhanced to support learning readiness. We conclude, that the school reform promotes a perspective on learning, and a view on subjects, that is consistent with neoliberal societal meanings, where the purpose of the school is to teach individual competences, defined by what is needed in the labour market. Something that is different to former school reforms, where learning participation, equality and democratic values were emphasized. This thesis examines the joint meditation project as a social experiment, made within the reformed school practice: <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> relate to societal meanings in the school reform? How does other possibilities of learning and participation in the school class, become possible through the project? Through a social perspective on learning, and an experiment that takes place in students everyday life in school, we explore learning as processes of change in meanings, through participation. The thesis is founded within critical psychology, supplemented by Etienne Wenger’s theory on social learning in Communities of Practice. Concepts of participation, learning and practice underline the way the project is explored. Criticism and change are concepts used to comprehend and challenge how learning, participation and practice is done and can be done better. In our analysis of the joint meditation project in UU in an 8. grade school class, we found that meditation as an activity is negotiated as useful in accordance to norms, values and competences, seen as meaningful within the community of practice of the class. Meditation is negotiated as either meaningful or not, according to whether the students feel it helps improve their academic achievements, the social well-being or their personal well-being. The learning opportunities from meditation as an activity can be understood as similar to those in the school reform. The students also emphasize that one cannot expect that meditating in school “changes your life", though some students might have changed personally through meditation, and the general tone in class has become better. By understanding learning as participation in a joint project about meditation in school, and not only as an meditation activity, other learning perspectives can be explored. Meditation as a joint (research) project can potentially challenge the one-sided views of learning in school. Through the methods and joint venture around the work with the project, the students critically reflect and dialogue about meditation, as well as their own school practice. Through their engagement and participation, the students become experts on the relevance of the meditation project, and are empowered in the process. Through the elaboration with different participants, new competences are valued and recognized. Processes taking place through the joint participation allow new possibilities of learning in school. This also involves the students to learn new things about themselves, others then what school could be - by launching new possibilities of subjectivity and capacity to act. Through the joint meditation project, the school students got the possibility of new learning experiences, that are not limited to the school reforms concept of learning. Instead they point to improved well-being in the class community, and empowerment of the students through participation...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} among libraries for using assistance of dogs in reading training for children. Many Swedish school libraries and public libraries are already today using this kind of pedagogy. From study results {{we can see that}} humans feel relaxed and calm together with kind animals. This affects humans physically and psychologically in different ways for example; lowering the blood pressure and set off calming hormones oxytocin. As we all know that reading out loud can be a very stressful situation so taking assistance of a reading dog or an assisting dog can be very helpful. Designed as a qualitative interview study, by interviewing project leaders, school and children’s librarians working with this kind of reading activity, this study examines the questions: how is reading stimulation using reading dogs depicted in practice? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> and <b>how</b> function and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>Project’s</b> librarians experience this kind of pedagogy?

Foucault takes as his starting point from the 16th century right up until the 18th century with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics, political economy and statistics Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (arcana imperii, from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by Jean Bodin. Which, according to Foucault, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth (Foucault, in referring to the term 'public opinion,' refers to the term'regimes of truth'Foucault also mentions a group called The Ideologues where the term Ideology is taken from) through raison d'état. Here the modern version of government is presented in the national media, both in the electronic medium-television and radio and especially in the written press, as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimization, responsibility, a fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasized through these four points.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate how elements of the dynamic and temporary team environment of construction project teams influence trust, commitment, satisfaction and learning in the teams. While much can be learnt from the current literature about teams, the theories have mainly derived and focused on teams from permanent environments such as manufacturing, hospitality, health care, education and technology sectors. The uniqueness of construction project teams (for example, temporariness and multi-organisations involvement) creates a team working environment different from common permanent work teams. As such, numerous questions arise when we consider how construction project teams function and how the members are influenced by the temporary and dynamic team environment. For example, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> team members establish trust and commitment in <b>the</b> <b>project</b> team environment? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> interdependency on each other to accomplish their assigned tasks influence individual members&# 146; attitudes and learning in <b>the</b> <b>project</b> teams? <b>The</b> research adopted a cross-sectional mixed method research design employing both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection in Singapore construction industry. The quantitative method involved survey questionnaires collected from 136 construction practitioners from 47 <b>project</b> teams. <b>The</b> qualitative method involved in-depth interviews with 28 construction practitioners. Quantitative statistical analysis was performed on the survey data using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the interview data using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software - NVivo. Amongst other things the research findings indicated that individual team members&# 146; perceived task interdependence and reward interdependence are positively related to their trust and commitment in the team. Additionally, their satisfaction in the team played a mediating role between the relationships. With respect to team learning, the research found that team goals, task interdependence and reward interdependence influence team learning, and team learning contributes to <b>the</b> performance of <b>project</b> teams. On a broad view, the circumstances in which how team members&# 146; trust, commitment, satisfaction and team learning are influenced appear to be similar with other work teams. However, in-depth interviews with construction professionals revealed many complex and subtle factors relating specifically to construction project teams, such as, multi-projects and multi-organisations involvement, and degree of familiarity between the members before the team is set up. These factors are central to the team members. In conclusion, this study has brought insights into how temporary construction project team environment influence members&# 146; team attitudes and team learning experience...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of teachers has {{been regarded as}} crucial {{to the success of}} standards-based reform (Fishman, Marx, Best, 2 ̆ 6 Tal, 2003). Research, particularly within science and mathematics, has underscored the need for professional development to help teachers understand (a) subject matter, (b) learners and learning, and (c) teaching methods (Loucks-Horsley, 1999). In addition to focusing on teacher professional development, national reform efforts have also emphasized science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (i. e., Rising Above the Gathering Storm, NRC, 2006). While substantial work has been conducted in mathematics and science, the efforts in technology and engineering education are much less mature. This makes sense given the relatively recent development of the Standards for Technological Literacy (ITEA, 2000) and recent calls for integrating engineering into the K- 12 classroom as both an avenue to technological literacy and as a way to enhance the engineering pipeline (Erekson 2 ̆ 6 Custer, 2008; Lewis, 2005; Wicklein, 2006). The complexity of engineering and its integration into K- 12 education, however, have resulted in a variety of issues requiring sustained empirical research (Johnson, Burghardt, 2 ̆ 6 Daugherty, 2008). One particular area of need given the emphasis on teacher effects on student learning is to research engineering-oriented teacher professional development. A lack of publication on the effective practices of engineering-specific professional development projects makes a study investigating mature efforts necessary. Thus, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore professional development elements for secondary school engineering education. The research questions that guided this study were: 1. What are the primary design elements used to deliver engineering-oriented professional development (logistics, format, activities, instructors, and instructional strategies) and why were these elements selected?+ 2. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> define and evaluate effectiveness? The focus on the professional development design decisions and determinations of effectiveness for secondary school engineering education are particularly important because they are the elements that “designers of professional development have immediate control over and can modify in order to increase their impact on teachers’ knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, and subsequent enactment” (Fishman et al., 2003, p. 646). Each design decision is typically connected to a distinct purpose and level of impact (Speck 2 ̆ 6 Knipe, 2005). By understanding the design decisions of specific <b>projects,</b> <b>the</b> connection to secondary school engineering and its impact on teaching and student learning can be better understood...|$|R

In the 1940 s, local Pueblo Indians, Hispanic farmers, Mexican immigrants, and Anglo ranchers extensively relied on agro-pastoral activities for sustenance and lived on the fringe of industrialized America. Many of these locals’ lives were drastically altered by the development of the nuclear economy.

Following consultation with the ISP and CCAFS management, the Evaluation addressed four key evaluation questions. 1) How well is strategic collaboration and integration {{both within and outside}} the CGIAR being achieved? 2) To what extent is CCAFS generating unique international public goods for agriculture, food security and climate change? 3) <b>How</b> well <b>do</b> <b>the</b> Flagship <b>Projects</b> link together and combine at output and outcome levels in the regions; and, to what extent are successes toward outcomes transferable from region to region? 4) How robust are the monitoring, evaluation and learning processes of the Program? As its main approach, the Evaluation selected nine projects for case studies to address the evaluation criteria and questions at three levels: global Program level, Flagship level and Regional Program level. The methodology also included document review, field visits to all regions, interviews of over 150 stakeholders, survey of CCAFS researchers, identification of exemplary cases of CCAFS work with high impact potential using a triple loop learning analysis, bibliometric analysis and H-index analysis of senior researchers. An independent third-party review team contributed to the evaluation of quality of science by assessing a random sample of journal articles published by CCAFS...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of a well-functioning legal and regulatory system in creating an effective market economy is now widely accepted. One flagship project that tries to measure {{the environment in which}} businesses operate in countries across the world is <b>the</b> World Bank's <b>Doing</b> Business project, which was launched in 2002. This project gathers quantitative data to compare regulations faced by small and medium-size enterprises across economies and over time. The centerpiece of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> is <b>the</b> annual <b>Doing</b> Business report. It was first published in 2003 with five sets of indicators for 133 economies, and currently includes 11 sets of indicators for 189 economies. The report includes a table that ranks each country in the world according to its scores across <b>the</b> indicators. <b>The</b> <b>Doing</b> Business <b>project</b> has become a major resource for academics, journalists, and policymakers. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> also enjoys a high public profile with close to ten million hits on its website each year. With such interest, it's no surprise that <b>the</b> <b>Doing</b> Business report has come under intense scrutiny.

40|$|Changes in {{construction}} projects are common {{and can lead}} to disruptive effects such as project delays, cost overruns and quality deviations. The rework due to unplanned changes can cost 10 - 15 % of contract value. By managing these changes more effectively, these disruptive effects can be minimised or avoided. Previous research has approached this industry problem from an information-processing view with the introduction of hard IT based solutions. In this knowledge age, this study argues that effective change management can be brought about by understanding the significant role of knowledge during change situations. In managing change, <b>the</b> construction <b>project</b> team members bring their tacit and explicit knowledge into the problem situation and it is this knowledge that is captured, converted and shared between the parties during the change process. With this knowledge-based perspective of managing <b>project</b> change, <b>the</b> research problem is articulated for this study as follows: <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> construction <b>project</b> team manage knowledge during unplanned change in the construction phase within collaborative team settings? The research problem is investigated by a conceptual model supported by hypotheses, which recognises and integrates process, group, organisational and wider environmental characteristics within the change process. The research methodology for this study adopted a phenomenological research philosophy. Within this context, case studies were used to investigate the research problem. The principal data collection technique used in the case studies was the semi-structured interviews. Content analysis and cognitive mapping techniques were used to analyse the primary data. The case study findings reveal that different forms of knowledge are created and shared between project team members during problem-solving activities of change events. These knowledge flows are very much centred on tacit knowledge and experience of project personnel. This social construction and use of knowledge in change management challenges the prevailing codification knowledge management solutions based on 'hard' IT approaches, which do not appreciate and accommodate this social phenomenon. The study concludes by stressing the need to balance codification knowledge management strategies with 'soft' personalisation strategies to stimulate and support appropriate social interaction between team members and, thereby, enhance the creation, dissemination and shared understanding of tacit project experience. It is through the balance of codification and personalisation strategies that collaborative teams can successfully resolve and learn from change events in the construction phase of projects.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{increased}} emphasis since being designated by the United States National Security Language Initiative (NSLI) {{as one of the}} sixteen critical languages, the number of students studying Turkish at the university level is small (MLA, 2015). During implementation of this project, several problems unique to Turkish arose. According to the Defense Language Institute (DLI), the degree of difficulty for English language speakers to learn Turkish is greater than that of most European languages because of the vast cultural differences between the United States and Turkey. There is one commonly used textbook at the university level across the United States (Öztopçu) which succeeds in delivering the teaching materials suitable for a traditional classroom but fails to provide opportunities for students to develop cultural and communicative competence. Additionally, it fails to offer digital technology, such as online study materials, which many students would prefer to have included in their academic studies (ECAR, 2014). The Turkish Global Simulation (TGS) project offers a solution: the development of effective teaching materials that would provide students access to the Turkish language and culture using the latest technologies that students already use and enjoy. The TGS was based on the French Apartment Building (Dupuy, 2006 a, 2006 b), which exemplifies relevant task-based instruction. The French Apartment Building project helps students attain communicative competence and cultural literacy through books and web resources, and focuses on improving students' reading and writing skills. The TGS allows students to experience a virtual life as a tenant in an apartment building in Istanbul. This is accomplished with the use of web applications (Facebook, Google Earth, Google Docs, Google Voice, emails, Blogger, chats, text messages, podcasting, audio-video files, 3 -D maps, and Google Bookmarks), and authentic materials (e. g. movie/music clips). I delivered the tasks and the materials—in accordance with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards—through <b>the</b> TGS <b>project,</b> which was first piloted and run successfully for several years to teach second-year second-semester university Turkish learners. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> involves a semester-long simulated life in a Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) environment, and promotes cultural and communicative competence while motivating students to be virtually connected to a new culture, autonomous, and lifelong learners. The specific research questions address: 1. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> TGS <b>project</b> affect student’s cultural competence? 2. How effective is <b>the</b> TGS <b>project</b> as a context for language learning? 3. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> students compare <b>the</b> TGS with more traditional learning methods? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> teachers evaluate <b>the</b> Turkish textbook? 4. How effective is Internet technology in <b>the</b> TGS <b>project?</b> A number of different instruments were used to measure the effectiveness of global simulation in promoting cultural competence: oral interviews, ACTFL standards textbook evaluations, Flashlight surveys, teacher-course evaluations, and the TGS final exams. The results revealed that the success of global simulation in Turkish has clear implications for teaching not only Turkish, but also other less commonly taught languages, for which the classroom is the predominant method for American university students to learn a foreign language and culture...|$|R
40|$|Purpose and Research Questions: This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the scholarly field of leadership development in connection to virtues, by mapping a concrete initiative that seeks to develop a virtuous aspect of leadership (The Virtues Project™). This thesis postulates that the view of human nature must be a fundamental part of any discourse on the nature, purpose and development of leadership, and offers one perspective of the view of human nature, as {{a contribution to}} this discourse. The view of human nature that this thesis is founded on is that humans have the virtues in potential and that their purpose in life is to develop these virtues and to contribute to the welfare of society. This view is based on the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and is in line with the view of human nature that <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> bases its strategies on. The main and overarching research question of this thesis is “How <b>does</b> <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> seek to develop a virtuous aspect of leadership?”. The questions “What is a virtuous aspect of leadership?” and “Why seek to develop a virtuous aspect of leadership?” are also addressed. Methods and Sources: To answer the first question a case study of <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project’s</b> approach to leadership development is conducted and a Pathway map of this approach is made. This map is based on the information gathered from the written material of <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> and interviews with four Master Facilitators of <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> from Australia, Canada, Fiji, and Norway, who have experience with implementing <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> in organizations and with developing leadership. To answer the two latter questions I conduct a literature review of the literature that seeks to connect the fields of leadership and virtues. Results and Main Conclusions: The following are the main conclusions: - The validity of the ideas presented in this thesis, is based on whether or not someone agrees with the view of human nature presented in this thesis. What is a virtuous aspect of leadership? - The innate and praiseworthy qualities of the human character (virtues) should be taken into consideration when an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal (leadership). Why seek to develop a virtuous aspect of leadership? - Developing one’s virtues is the true meaning and purpose of life, therefore fulfilling this purpose is reward enough in itself. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> seek to develop a virtuous aspect of leadership? - The strategies of The Virtues Project; speaking the language of the virtues, recognizing teachable moments, setting clear boundaries, honoring the spirit, and offering companioning, are both what <b>The</b> Virtues <b>Project</b> seeks to develop and how they seek to develop a virtuous aspect of leadership. These strategies are meant to complement and enhance the structures, systems, and methods that already exist, by adding a new and deeper, more meaningful dimension and understanding...|$|R
40|$|Inclusion {{of local}} {{knowledge}} in decision-making {{is recognized as}} important for land use planning. However, this is prevented by communication constraints. Increasingly local communities throughout the world are using community mapping and simple Geographic Information Technologies (GIT) to communicate information about traditional lands to decision-makers. This corresponds to the trend, primarily in North America, for practitioners to apply Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies in public participation settings. Claims have been made that use of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) by disadvantaged groups can be empowering. However, others claim that PPGIS is disempowering due to the cost {{and complexity of the}} technologies, inaccessibility of data, restrictive representation of local geographic information, and the low level of community participation. The research described in this thesis sets out to contribute to the debate regarding PPGIS and empowerment. Participatory Geographic Information and Multimedia Systems (PGIMS) technologies were developed for this project in an attempt to overcome the weaknesses of PPGIS described above. A PGIMS project was introduced into two communities in West Kutai, Indonesia. The PGIMS technologies enabled local communities to gather information using a digital camera and video camera, and store, manage and access it. A participatory process ensured that communities made all decisions related to <b>the</b> <b>project</b> and were trained in the necessary technical skills. Functional PGIMS were created in both participating villages. These PGIMS were relevant to the communities’ needs to record information for future generations and communicate information about boundaries and land use to outsiders. The research question addressed in this thesis was: <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> PGIMS <b>project</b> empower or disempower local communities? The author developed a working definition of empowerment to enable evaluation: empowerment is an increase in social influence or political power. Furthermore the author determined that empowerment is achieved through a combination of internal changes in an individual or community as well as external factors. These are defined as changes in ‘empowerment capacity’. This thesis presents a framework to structure an analysis of empowerment. It enabled the author to examine how four catalysts related to <b>the</b> PGIMS <b>project</b> empowered and disempowered, as well as increased and decreased empowerment capacity of the individual and community. Catalysts included the information contained within the PGIMS, the participatory process used, the technological skills acquired and the tools applied to develop the PGIMS. Qualitative data were gathered in the field using participant observation, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Data were categorised into indicators of increased or decreased empowerment and empowerment capacity. These indicators were sorted into the relevant cells of the framework. The empowerment framework offered a logical structure to categorize the data and enable an analysis of how different components of <b>the</b> PGIMS <b>project</b> impacted individuals and communities. It was also useful for differentiating between empowerment and empowerment capacity impacts. There were weaknesses with the methods and framework. These included the inability {{to determine the extent to}} which <b>the</b> PGIMS <b>project</b> contributed to <b>the</b> observed indicators relative to other influences; the difficulty of interpreting the data to create indicators, and the difficulty of measuring some indicators or defining their relative importance in the framework. This research concluded that <b>the</b> PGIMS <b>project</b> empowered participating individuals and communities, and also increased their empowerment capacity, but it is difficult to determine how lasting or significant this is. It also disempowered individuals and communities. Individuals were more empowered by skills and processes, while communities more empowered by information and tools. The benefits of individual empowerment can conflict with community empowerment. Empowerment in <b>the</b> PGIMS <b>project</b> was highly influenced by pre-existing conditions in individuals and communities...|$|R
40|$|If you are {{responsible}} for a late and over-budget software project, you are not alone – software project overruns are all too common. But if serious problems have existed for quite a while and the situation is getting worse, not better, you may have a project catastrophe on your hands. At this point, there is no established rescue process to follow. Dealing effectively with an out-of-control project is as much an emotional challenge as it is a managerial and technical one. This article describes a 10 -step process to disentangle a software project catastrophe and get it back on track. In Spencer Johnson’s “Who Moved My Cheese? ” [1], the little people keep coming back to where the cheese used to be even though it is not there anymore. It is a natural tendency to continue doing what we have always done even when, to an outside observer, it no longer makes sense. This behavior is quite common when projects get into trouble. We keep plodding away at <b>the</b> <b>project</b> hoping that <b>the</b> problems will go away and the cheese will miraculously reappear. In all too many cases, it does not. Just as the smart thing to do when a ball of twine seems hopelessly entangled is to stop whatever we are doing with it (otherwise the tangle gets worse), so it often is with a disastrous project: The longer we keep at it, the worse it gets. At some point, we need to halt all activity and reassess what we are doing. Disastrous software projects, or catastrophes, are projects that are completely out of control in {{one or more of the}} following aspects: schedule, budget, or quality. They are by no means rare – 44 percent of surveyed development organizations report that they have had software projects cancelled or abandoned due to significant overruns, and 15 percent say that it has happened to more than 10 percent of their projects (see Figure 1). But, obviously, not every overrun or quality problem means a project is out of control, so at which point should we define a software project as a catastrophe? What are the criteria for taking the drastic step of halting all activities, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> we go about reassessing <b>the</b> <b>project?</b> Most importantly, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> we get <b>the</b> <b>project</b> moving again? <b>The</b> answers to these questions are the essence of the concept of catastrophe disentanglement...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, {{complexity}} theory has gained a lot of importance in several scientific disciplines like astronomy, geology, chemistry etc. It has slowly extended its usage in <b>the</b> field of <b>project</b> management. While {{trying to understand the}} managerial demands of modern day <b>projects</b> and <b>the</b> different situations faced in <b>projects,</b> <b>the</b> term ‘complexity’ is progressively becoming a benchmark term. In the recent past some of <b>the</b> challenging <b>projects</b> that have been completed are the Heathrow Terminal 5 and the construction of venues for the Beijing Olympics. But can we call these projects complex?It is probably too simplistic to classify projects as complex or non-complex. What is particularly important is to identify the source of the complexity, the level and also the implications of the complexity. Several academicians have studied the different dimensions and established different classifications of complexity. These are put together into models of complexity. But is this classification well-grounded in reality? This is what we aim to explore through this research. The specific questions that we wish to explore by conducting this research are: <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> understanding of <b>project</b> complexity in actuality conform to the theoretical complexity models? In an effort to answer the primary question, our study will also throw some light on factors of complexity across different sectors. We hope that this distinction will pave way for further research within these sectors. This now brings us to our sub-question:- <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> factors that contribute to complexity compare across different sectors?At the outset of this research, the literature on complexity was reviewed. An attempt was made to understand what complexity means with a focus on <b>the</b> field of <b>project</b> management. It was observed that there is a new wave of thinking in this field and a camp which believes that regular project management tools and techniques cannot be used for complex projects. This has drawn several academicians to generate models of complexity based on various factors. In this research we have focused on some important models like that of Turner and Cochrane, Ralph Stacey, Terry Williams, Kahane and Remington and Pollack. We have tried to see if any of these models fit in with how practitioners understand complexity. To find out how practitioners comprehend complexity, we followed a grounded theory approach and also used quantitative methods to supplement the results in accordance in a mixed methodology. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with nine project managers from different sectors and different  geographical locations. The interviews were analyzed and the data was broken down to different categories referred to as open coding where labelling was done. This was followed by Axial coding where we describe the properties and build relations between these categories. The final stage is selective coding where the emerged theory is integrated and refined. Quantitative data was collected through a short questionnaire which listed out some factors which could cause or lead to complexity in projects. A total of 29 responses were obtained for the questionnaires. By analyzing this data we were able to determine <b>the</b> factors that <b>project</b> managers thought caused complexity in projects. A new dimension was also added by analyzing it sector-wise. Since we collected data from two different sources, via interviews and through questionnaires, it gave us the opportunity to triangulate the findings. Wesincerely hope that this piece of work will pave way for future research on similar areas like models of complexity and perception of complexity in project managemen...|$|R
