50|$|Despite the {{upgraded}} fireproof construction, {{a fire in}} 1865 caused {{extensive damage}} to the upper floor of the building, destroying the correspondence of James Smithson, Henry's papers, two hundred oil paintings of American Indians by John Mix Stanley, the Regent's Room and the lecture hall, and {{the contents of the}} public libraries of Alexandria, Virginia and Beaufort, South Carolina, confiscated by Union forces during the American Civil War. The ensuing renovation was undertaken by local Washington architect Adolf Cluss in 1865-67. Further <b>fireproofing</b> <b>work</b> ensued in 1883, also by Cluss, who by this time had designed the neighboring Arts and Industries Building. A third and fourth floor were added to the East Wing, and a third floor to the West Wing. Electric lighting was installed in 1895.|$|E
50|$|The {{studio was}} created to be a {{freelance}} art studio and to eventually create its own games. Fireproof credits LittleBigPlanet creator Media Molecule with being a major help during its first two years. Media Molecule outsourced the art creation for LittleBigPlanets downloadable content to Fireproof. Media Molecule called upon Fireproof for art for LittleBigPlanet 2 as well. <b>Fireproof</b> <b>worked</b> closely with Guerrilla Games to provide the art for multiplayer levels within Killzone Shadow Fall and Killzone: Mercenary. Over {{the past couple of}} years Fireproof have also contributed art and assets to Ridge Racer Unbounded, the DJ Hero series, and Kinect Sesame Street TV.|$|R
25|$|Neponsit Beach Hospital {{returned}} to city operations in summer 1950 following minor renovations, {{and was now}} associated with Queens General Hospital in Jamaica. In July 1950 Neponsit Beach Hospital began operating as an annex of Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis (adjacent to Queens General), with 24 patients transferred from Triboro to Neponsit. On June 19, 1952, Queens Hospital Center was formed with the merger of the adjacent Queens General and Triboro Hospitals. Neponsit Beach Hospital, the College Point Outpatient Department, and the Ozone Park ambulance station were also absorbed into the new medical center. Around this time, the city planned to renovate and expand Neponsit Hospital {{so it could be}} used in a general hospital capacity {{in the event of an}} emergency. Plans were drawn up by the York and Sawyer firm in 1952. In July 1953, the Board of Estimate approved <b>fireproofing</b> and electrical <b>work</b> for the hospital, including fire stairs to replace the original wooden stiarcases.|$|R
