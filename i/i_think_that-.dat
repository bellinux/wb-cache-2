Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were all on a {{different}} page. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf - he was also the writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the film would have been more satisfying." ...|$|R

60|$|Why comest thou then so slowly? Because I am hindered. What hinders? Has God {{forbidden}} thee? No. Art thou {{not willing}} to come faster? Yes, yet I cannot. Well, prithee be plain with me, and tell me the reason and ground of thy discouragement. Why, says the sinner, though God forbids me not, and though I am willing to come faster, yet there naturally ariseth this, and that, and the other thought in my heart, that hinders my speed to Jesus Christ. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am not chosen; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am not called; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am come too late; and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know not {{what it is to}} come.

40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about my trips to El Salvador, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{of peace and}} joy. <b>I</b> also <b>think</b> of peace and joy when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about Christmas break and summer. In the blur of a school day, it can be so hard to find these things—why? How {{is it that we}} can {{accomplish}} so much in one day, from 8 am until midnight, but still feel as though we’ve missed out on something bigger, something better? My argument is this: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were created to experience life to the full. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were made to feel joy and peace and sorrow and love in their fullest forms. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that we came from something big before we got here, and that we’re going somewhere big when we leave here, and so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> God created us to be something.

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that the}} band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had}} a goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we showed too much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> the {{economic}} arguments are clear. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{being part of}} a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> as <b>I</b> was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues {{is that a lot of}} people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. If we were not in Europe, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> Wilson puts up with House for {{the same}} reason that {{millions}} of people watch him every week. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he’s really dynamic and fun and audacious and self-deprecating. All those things that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> make people really appealing, and he tells it like it is. The money things, he doesn’t tend to pay you back, but I have a lot of friends like that. So I don’t find it that much of a mystery. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> House is a very attractive character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> most people would want to be friends with him.
