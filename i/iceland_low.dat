50|$|The {{latitude}} of {{the north}} wall in any year, {{as described in the}} GSNW index, is a delayed response to atmospheric changes over the North Atlantic Ocean, and especially to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Gangopadhyay et al. found that the point of separation of the Gulf Stream from the US coast was determined by the wind patterns across the ocean two or three years earlier, which they attributed to the passage of Rossby waves across the ocean. The GSNW index has been observed to follow the North Atlantic Oscillation with a lag of two years which is in agreement with (but Joyce et al. reported a shorter delay). Hameed and Piontkovski have shown the index seems to be most sensitive to the <b>Iceland</b> <b>Low.</b> Taylor and Gangopadhyay have used a simple model developed by Behringer, Regier and Stommel to predict the latitude of the Gulf Stream {{on the basis of the}} NAO (see Fig. 1).

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{comprehensive}} review of previous studies and concepts concerning the North Atlantic Oscillation. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and its recent homologue, the Arctic Oscillation/Northern Hemisphere annular mode (AO/NAM), are the most prominent modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere winter climate. The NAO teleconnection is characterised by a meridional displacement of atmospheric mass over the North Atlantic area. Its state is usually expressed by the standardised air pressure difference between the Azores High and the <b>Iceland</b> <b>Low.</b> This NAO index {{is a measure of the}} strength of the westerly flow (positive with strong westerlies, and vice versa). Together with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, the NAO is a major source of seasonal to interdecadal variability in the global atmosphere. On interannual and shorter time scales, the NAO dynamics can be explained as a purely internal mode of variability of the atmospheric circulation. Interdecadal variability may be influenced, however, b...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevailing}} local {{weather has}} a direct influence on the Baltic Sea environment. Thus, {{it is probable that}} it is also influenced by large scale atmospheric patterns like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A high NAO winter index, corresponds to an anomalous pressure difference between the Azores high and the <b>Iceland</b> <b>low,</b> resulting in increased westerlies with an increased advection of mild air masses leading to mild winters. A low NAO winter index, corresponds to weak westerlies, with increasing influence by the Eurasian winter high, leading to severe winters in the Baltic Sea. In the present study the influence of the North Atlantic climate, as described by the NAO index, is investigated with respect to its possible impact on biological, chemical and physical conditions prevailing in the Baltic Sea. These variations are compared with the known fluctuations in fish stock and food supply. It is argued that the NAO has an impact on the internal circulation of the Baltic Sea and the water mass exchange with the North Sea, hence, influencing oxic/anoxic conditions in the Baltic Sea deep basins. The study of geological sediment records from the deep basins provides information on the extent and duration of anoxic periods during the recent past, where the NAO index is available, and also during the past millennia to give a proper temporal perspective to variations in Baltic Sea conditions prior to human impact...|$|E

50|$|The warming {{of the air}} near to {{the ground}} leads to rising {{movements}} and the atmosphere becomes less stable. One of these patterns is the air pressure difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes: the so-called Arctic oscillation with the Azores highs and <b>Iceland</b> <b>lows</b> known from the weather reports. If this difference is high, a strong westerly wind will result which in winter carries warm and humid Atlantic air masses right down to Europe. In the negative phase when pressure differences are low, cold Arctic air can then easily penetrate southward through Europe without being interrupted by the usual westerlies, {{as has been the}} case frequently over the last three winters. Model calculations show that the air pressure difference with decreased sea ice cover in the Arctic summer is weakened in the following winter, enabling Arctic cold to push down to mid-latitudes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceModeling studies {{addressing}} {{daily to}} interannual coastal evolution typically relate shoreline change with waves, currents and sediment transport through complex processes and feedbacks. For wave-dominated environments, the main driver (waves) {{is controlled by}} the regional atmospheric circulation. Here a simple weather regime-driven shoreline model is developed for a 15 -year shoreline dataset (2000 – 2014) collected at Truc Vert beach, Bay of Biscay, SW France. In all, 16 weather regimes (four per season) are considered. The centroids and occurrences are computed using the ERA- 40 and ERA-Interim reanalyses, applying k-means and EOF methods to the anomalies of the 500 -hPa geopotential height over the North Atlantic Basin. The weather regime-driven shoreline model explains 70 % of the observed interannual shoreline variability. The application of a proven wave-driven equilibrium shoreline model to the same period shows that both models have similar skills at the interannual scale. Relation between the weather regimes and the wave climate in the Bay of Biscay is investigated and the primary weather regimes impacting shoreline change are identified. For instance, the winter zonal regime characterized by a strengthening of the pressure gradient between the <b>Iceland</b> <b>low</b> and the Azores high is associated with high-energy wave conditions and is found to drive an increase in the shoreline erosion rate. The study demonstrates the predictability of interannual shoreline change from a limited number of weather regimes, which opens new perspectives for shoreline change modeling and encourages long-term shoreline monitoring programs...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of liver cirrhosis mortality and morbidity in Iceland and {{to obtain a}} reliable separation between alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) and non-alcoholic cirrhosis (NAC) by using multiple data sources. METHODS: The study included the whole population of Iceland. Mortality was studied through death certificate data for the period 1951 - 90 and morbidity (clinical incidence) through hospital, autopsy and biopsy records for the period 1971 - 90. RESULTS: The average mortality for AC in age group 20 years and older was 8. 6 and for NAC 19. 2 per 10 (6) /year and the average clinical incidence was 22. 1 per 10 (6) /year for AC and 25. 9 per 10 (6) /year for NAC. In the morbidity study 44 % of cases were due to AC. In the mortality study 24 % of cases were due to AC but the data suggested an underreporting of AC for males {{at a rate of}} 30 %. There was a significant decrease in AC mortality with time but no change in NAC. Average alcohol consumption of inhabitants aged over 15 years increased from 2. 1 to 4. 9 litres per year (130 %) during the period 1951 - 90. CONCLUSION: The incidence of cirrhosis in <b>Iceland</b> is very <b>low</b> for both AC and NAC, accounting for only 0. 2 % of total deaths. The reasons are unknown. The low incidence of AC in Iceland is probably partly due to low alcohol consumption. The decreasing incidence of AC despite 130 % increase in alcohol consumption is thought to be due to intensive treatment of alcoholism. A low prevalence of hepatitis B and C probably contributes to the low incidence of NAC...|$|R

Between 1970 – 1979 the incidence was 8. 0 (6. 0 – 10. 6) and between 1980 – 1989 it was comparable at 10. 8 (8. 4 – 13. 8) (p> 0. 10). By Poisson regression analysis the variation in incidence was related to age at diagnosis (p< 0. 001), while a linear trend for calendar year at diagnosis did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 07). A quadratic curve, however, better described the temporal variation in incidence (p< 0. 05). The total prevalence per 1, 000 {{by the end of}} 1979 and 1989 was similar, 0. 45 (0. 30 – 0. 65) and 0. 57 (0. 40 – 0. 79), respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms that both the incidence and prevalence of childhood Type 1 diabetes in <b>Iceland</b> are <b>low</b> compared to the other Nordic countries. The findings may suggest a causative role for environmental factors that are not related to latitude or ambient temperature...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of primary}} {{production}} (PP), calcification (CF), and coccolithophore abundance were made during late summer (July–August 2007) in the <b>Iceland</b> Basin. <b>Low</b> numbers of coccolithophore cells and detached coccoliths (, 1 3 103 cells mL 21 and 1 – 15 3 103 coccoliths mL 21, respectively) indicated a non-bloom community, with Emiliania huxleyi {{as the dominant}} coccolithophore in terms of abundance, coccolithophore organic biomass, and cell calcite. PP ranged from 0. 1 to 2 mmol C m 23 d 21, while CF ranged from 10 to 250 mmol C m 23 d 21, with both typically decreasing with depth. Coccolithophores were estimated to contribute 10 – 20 % toward total chlorophyll a, phytoplankton carbon, and PP within the euphotic zone. In these non-bloom conditions,, 30 – 60 % of the total calcite {{in the water column}} was present as detached coccoliths rather than whole cells. Both cell numbers and variability in cell-normalized CF controlled the magnitude of total CF, and hence both physiological limits to cell CF and growth, as well as mortality factors, need {{to be taken into account}} when examining oceanic coccolithophore communities. Combining cell-normalized CF with an estimate of coccolith calcite gave coccolith production rates (0. 4 – 1. 8 h 21) similar to those reported in the literature for laboratory cultures of E. huxleyi. None of the factors currently associated with coccolithophore blooms (irradiance, mixed-layer depth, nitrate, phosphate, or calcite saturation) showed a clear correlation with community or cellular CF. Hence, although mortality is likely to control cell numbers, other factors such as trace metal (iron) availability may influence coccolithophore physiology in the central Iceland Basin during late summer...|$|R

To our knowledge no studies have been conducted on vitamin D status amongst critically ill patients at high northern latitudes. Despite the Icelandic population traditionally taking vitamin D supplements, we hypothesized that the majority of critically ill patients in Reykjavik, <b>Iceland</b> have <b>low</b> vitamin D levels. This was a prospective observational study on 122 patients admitted to Landspitali University Hospital intensive care unit. Serum vitamin D (25 (OH) D) was measured in all patients on two occasions (first and second day). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its effect on hospital stay was calculated. Only 9 % of patients had vitamin D levels recommended for good health (> 75  nmol/l) and 69 % were deficient (25 (OH) D <  50  nmol/l). The average difference between the first and second vitamin D samples was 2. 8  nmol/l. Forty-three percentage of the severely vitamin D deficient stayed in the ICU for more than 4  days compared to 19 % of patients with better status (P =  0. 196). Vitamin D deficiency is very common in critically ill patients at high northern latitudes and patients with severely deficient vitamin D levels had trend towards longer intensive care unit stay. Furthermore, 43 % of the patients had vitamin D levels under 25  nmol/l that is associated with osteomalacia. It appears that a single vitamin D measurement gives a reasonable clue about the vitamin D status in critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|Dab (Limanda limanda) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) were {{collected}} from coastal and offshore locations in the Baltic (dab only), North Sea (haddock from one location only) and Iceland. Blood was analysed for DNA strand breaks using the comet assay and liver samples for DNA adduct concentrations. DNA strand breaks were at background levels in dab from the two Iceland locations and from the Dogger Bank. The highest levels were observed in dab from the Firth of Forth, Ekofisk and the German Bight. Hepatic DNA adducts in dab were highest at Ekofisk, in the Baltic and Dogger Bank, below detection limit in dab from <b>Iceland</b> and <b>low</b> in dab from the Firth of Forth and German Bight. There was large variation in DNA strand breaks between locations and individuals for haddock, particularly from Iceland. Adduct concentrations were elevated in haddock from both Iceland and the Firth of Forth. A general linear model (GLM) suggested that, in addition to location, the size of dab and its general condition contributed to explaining the observed variability in DNA strand breaks. A GLM for adducts in dab similarly allocated most of the variability to location, but with a possible contribution from CYP 1 A activity. There were no apparent differences {{between male and female}} dab for any of the methods. There was no obvious relationship between strand breaks and adducts in the same fish although dab from Ekofisk and Iceland had respectively high and low responses using both methods. The results from this large-scale study showed pollution-related genotoxicity for dab, that fish blood samples can be conserved prior to comet analyses and that there are clear species differences in genotoxic responses even when collected at the same location...|$|R
