5000|$|All {{types of}} {{parachuting}} techniques are dangerous, but HALO/HAHO carry special risks. At high altitudes (greater than 22,000 feet m), the partial pressure of {{oxygen in the}} Earth's atmosphere is low. Oxygen is required for human respiration and lack of pressure can lead to hypoxia. Also, rapid ascent in the <b>jump</b> <b>aircraft</b> without all nitrogen flushed from the bloodstream can lead to decompression sickness (also known as caisson disease or [...] "the bends").|$|E

50|$|General Barno {{commanded}} the 3rd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, followed by {{command of the}} 2nd Ranger Battalion at Ft Lewis, Washington. Following attendance at the Army War College, he {{commanded the}} Warrior Brigade, a multi-functional support brigade at Fort Polk, Louisiana, which supported the Joint Readiness Training Center and was then the largest brigade in the Army. He then directed the Joint Task Force training program at Joint Forces Command, Norfolk, Virginia. With three Ranger Battalion tours and command of the 3rd Bn, 505th PIR in the 82nd Airborne Division, he accumulated over 110 parachute jumps during his career, to include a 500-foot night-time parachute assault into Panama in 1989, during which 11 of 15 <b>jump</b> <b>aircraft</b> were struck by enemy fire. He holds two awards of the coveted Combat Infantryman's Badge {{as well as the}} Ranger Tab and Master Parachutist Badge with Combat Jump Star.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{parachute}} jump in history {{was made by}} André-Jacques Garnerin, {{the inventor of the}} parachute, on October 22, 1797. Garnerin tested his contraption by leaping from a hydrogen balloon [...] above Paris. Garnerin's parachute bore little resemblance to today's parachutes, however, as it was not packed into any sort of container and did not feature a ripcord. The first intentional freefall jump with a ripcord-operated deployment was not made until over a century later by Leslie Irvin in 1919. [...] While Georgia Broadwick made an earlier freefall in 1914 when her static line became entangled with her <b>jump</b> <b>aircraft's</b> tail assembly, her freefall descent was not planned. Broadwick cut her static line and deployed her parachute manually, only as a means of freeing herself from the aircraft to which she had become entangled.|$|R

50|$|In March 2004, however, DARA {{announced}} {{the loss of}} 550 jobs at St Athan as part of streamlining to make DARA more efficient and better able {{to compete with the}} private sector for lucrative aircraft repair contracts, but also because they lost out to a direct RAF bid for a contract to upgrade the air force's fleet of ageing Harrier <b>jump</b> jet <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The aircraft's {{frame is}} made from {{aluminium}} and the cabin is of non-structural fiberglass. The aircraft {{is equipped with a}} helicopter-style collective pitch control to allow [...] "jump" [...] takeoffs. Take-offs are accomplished by powering the rotor system to 150% cruise rpm and then increasing collective rapidly to <b>jump</b> the <b>aircraft</b> into the air where it can then fly away.|$|R
50|$|A Paratrooper helmet {{is a type}} of Combat helmet {{exclusive}} to paratroopers and airborne forces. The main difference from combat helmets is that Paratrooper helmets have a different harness and lining to withstand impact when <b>jumping</b> from <b>aircraft</b> and keep the helmet stable in flight, and most have a lower-profile shell to reduce wind resistance. Most modern combat helmets have features making them suitable for airborne use.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the British War Office {{called for a}} machine that weighed less than 23 lb (this was not {{achieved}} - the final weight was about 32 pounds) and would withstand being dropped by parachute. In response, the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) developed a folding bicycle small enough {{to be taken in}} small gliders or on parachute <b>jumps</b> from <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ralph W. Bottriel {{became the}} first American {{military}} person to <b>jump</b> from an <b>aircraft</b> using a manually-operated backpack parachute on 19 May 1919. He later received the Distinguished Flying Cross for this feat.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} for predicting critical control inputs for which nonlinear rotational coupling may cause sudden <b>jumps</b> in <b>aircraft</b> response. The analysis includes the effect of aerodynamics which are nonlinear in angle of attack. The method involves the simultaneous solution of two polynomials in roll rate, whose coefficients are functions of angle of attack and the control inputs. Results obtained using this procedure are compared with calculated time histories to verify {{the validity of the}} method for predicting jump-like instabilities...|$|R

5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat <b>jump</b> from C-17 <b>aircraft</b> onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They <b>jumped</b> from <b>aircraft</b> of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|R

25|$|During World War II Lord Egerton's parkland {{played a}} major role in the {{training}} of all allied paratroops by No.1 Parachute Training School RAF based at nearby RAF Ringway. On 6 July 1940, Squadron Leader Louis Strange approached his pre-World War I fellow aviator and friend, Maurice Egerton, to ask for the latter's co-operation in granting permission for the Royal Air Force to use his estate for this most important wartime purpose. Lord Egerton readily agreed to the proposal and the first live test <b>jumps</b> from <b>aircraft</b> were made on 13 July by RAF parachuting instructors.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{another war}} game {{occurred}} at Fakhrobod, this time led by instructors of the French Air Force. Using French aircraft, some 50 Mobile Forces and National Guard soldiers practiced parachuting from airplanes.

[...] The study (1999-2015) reviews medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases and includes 65 cases of pilot suicide (compared to 195 pilot-errors in those years) and 6 cases of passengers who <b>jumped</b> from <b>aircraft.</b> There are also 18 cases of homicide-suicide involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non-aviation samples, {{a large percentage of}} pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).|$|R
25|$|All {{members of}} the Field Ambulance had to undergo a twelve-day {{parachute}} training course, which was carried out at No. 1 Parachute Training School, RAF Ringway.

50|$|The Chinese, Indian, and Russian navies operate {{conventional}} aircraft from STOBAR {{aircraft carriers}} (Short Take-Off But Arrested Landing). Instead of a catapult, {{they use a}} ski <b>jump</b> to assist <b>aircraft</b> in taking off with a positive rate of climb. Carrier aircraft such as the J-15, Mig-29K, and Su-33 rely on their own engines to accelerate to flight speed. As a result, they must take off with a reduced load of fuel and armaments.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} HALO exercise, the {{parachutist}} will <b>jump</b> from the <b>aircraft,</b> free-fall {{for a period}} of time at terminal velocity, and open their parachute at an altitude as low as 600 meters. The combination of high downward speed, minimal forward airspeed, and the use of only small amounts of metal helps to defeat radar and reduces the amount of time a parachute might be visible to ground observers, enabling a stealthy insertion.|$|R
50|$|On 21 February 1935 {{two sisters}} forced {{open the door}} of a de Havilland Dragon Rapide in flight and <b>jumped</b> from the <b>aircraft</b> and were killed in the fall.
