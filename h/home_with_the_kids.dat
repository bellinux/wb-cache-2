5000|$|However, {{this story}} was refuted by both Clapton and Baker, first by Clapton in a Times article from April 2006. The article stated that when asked about Cream, Clapton said: [...] "No. Not for me. We did {{it and it was}} fun. But life is too short. I've got lots of other things I would rather do, {{including}} staying at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> my <b>kids.</b> <b>The</b> thing about that band was that it was all to do with its limits ... it was an experiment." [...] In an interview in the UK magazine Music Mart, about the release of a DVD about the Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park 1969, Baker commented about his unwillingness to continue the Cream reunion. These comments were far more specific and explosive than Clapton's, as they were centred around his relationship with Jack Bruce. Ginger said, [...] "When he's Dr. Jekyll, he's fine ... It's when he's Mr. Hyde that he's not. And I'm afraid he's still the same. I tell you this - there won't ever be any more Cream gigs, because he did Mr. Hyde in New York last year." ...|$|R
