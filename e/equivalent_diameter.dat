25|$|The high-wheeler {{lives on}} in the gear inch units used by cyclists in English-speaking {{countries}} to describe gear ratios. These are calculated by multiplying the wheel diameter in inches {{by the number of}} teeth on the front chain-wheel and dividing by the teeth on the rear sprocket. The result is the <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> of a penny-farthing wheel. A 60-inch gear, the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler, is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle, while top gears on many exceed 100inches. There was at least one 64-inch Columbia made in the mid-1880s, but 60 was the largest in regular production.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds number can {{be defined}} for several {{different}} situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension {{is a matter of}} conventionnbsp&– for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.|$|E
500|$|Several ellipsoid-model {{calculations}} of Haumea's dimensions have been made. The first model produced after Haumea's discovery was calculated from ground-based observations of Haumea's light curve at optical wavelengths: {{it provided a}} total length of 1,960 to 2,500 km and a visual albedo (pv) greater than 0.6. The most likely shape is a triaxial ellipsoid with approximate dimensions of 2,000 × 1,500 × 1,000 km, with an albedo of 0.71. Observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope give a diameter of [...] and an albedo of , from photometry at infrared wavelengths of 70 μm. Subsequent light-curve analyses have suggested an equivalent circular diameter of 1,450 km. In 2010 an analysis of measurements taken by Herschel Space Telescope together with the older Spitzer Telescope measurements yielded a new estimate of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> of Haumea—about 1300 km.

40|$|Most {{often the}} {{determination}} of the concentration of virus particles is rendered difficult by the availability of proper standards. We have adapted a static light scattering based method for the quantification of virus particles (shown for poliovirus) without the need of virus particle standards. Instead, as standards, well-characterized polymeric nanoparticle solutions are used. The method is applicable for virus particles acting as Rayleigh scatterers, i. e., virus particles with <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters</b> up to ca. 1 / 10 th of the wavelength of the scattered monochromatic light (∼ 70  nm diameter). Further limitations may arise if the refractive index of the virus is unavailable or cannot be calculated based on its composition, such as in case of enveloped viruses. The method is especially relevant for preparation of virus particle concentration standards and to vaccine formulations based on attenuated or inactivated virus particles where the classical plaque forming assays cannot be applied. The method consists of: • Measuring the intensity of the light scattered by viruses suspended in an aqueous solution. • Measuring the intensity of the light scattered by polymeric nanoparticles of known concentration and comparable size with the investigated virus particle. • The concentration of virus nanoparticles can be calculated based on the two measured scattered light intensities by knowing the refractive index of the dispersing solution, of the polymer and virus nanoparticles as well as their relative sphere <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceNanoparticle {{aerosols}} are {{a potential}} health hazard and are increasingly used in industry. Effective means for their filtration to avoid occupational exposure are necessary. Granular bed filtration exhibits interesting properties {{in terms of}} ultrafine particle collection efficiency or retention capacity, which could make them a good alternative to the fiber filters commonly used in industry today. Being able to predict changes to their collection efficiency and pressure drop during clogging appears essential for the design, optimization {{and control of the}} filtration process. To meet these needs, this study presents a predictive model for the different phases of deep-bed clogging. The model developed successfully describes changes to collection efficiency and pressure drop using <b>equivalent</b> collector <b>diameters.</b> Microscopic observations showed these <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters</b> to be compatible with considering the deposit as a uniform spherical layer all over the collector's surface.
