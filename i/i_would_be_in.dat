Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|Milian's third studio album, So Amazin', was {{released}} on May 16, 2006. The album's lead single, [...] "Say I", featured rapper Young Jeezy. The single saw peak positions of number four in the UK, and number twenty-one in the US. So Amazin debuted and peaked at number eleven on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week and 163,000 copies in total. Internationally, the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart, 67 on the UK Albums Chart, and 139 on the France Albums Chart. Reviews of So Amazin were mixed; critics felt that while Milian claimed that she was displaying the various sides of her personality, the album could [...] "only [...] the surface of who she really is." [...] "Say I" [...] was praised by several critics, and was described as [...] "instantly rousing" [...] and [...] "intoxicating". In June 2006, Milian's representative confirmed {{that she had been}} dropped by Island Def Jam. In an interview with Rap-Up, Milian revealed she was dropped a week after her album {{was released}}. The singer believed it was a [...] "budget cut", and that Island Def Jam Music Group wanted to spend more money on label mate Rihanna. She said, [...] "it was embarrassing. It was a week after my album got put out. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> my room {{a lot of the time}} crying by myself." [...] After leaving Def Jam, Milian released her first compilation album, The Best of Christina Milian (2006).|$|E

2500|$|In August 1999, at a {{press conference}} in New York City to discuss The Phantom Menace, Lucas {{described}} the [...] "nine year commitment" [...] required to make a Star Wars trilogy. In 2002, he said: [...] "Basically what I said as a joke was, 'Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in their 70s, we'll come back and do another version.' The thing I didn't realize then, and that I do realize now very clearly, is that not only would they be in their 70s, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> my 70s too." [...] In 2007, Lucas described making the films at that age as [...] "an idea that seemed amusing at the time, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that 'off-the-cuff' comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns {{spent his}} early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his {{paternal}} grandparents after his parents' marriage failed. He then {{spent a year}} living with his mother in Columbia, South Carolina, and thereafter he spent several years living with his aunt Gladys in Lake Murray, South Carolina, twenty-two miles from Columbia. He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he once said, [...] "In the place where I was a child, there were no artists {{and there was no}} art, so I really didn't know what that meant.

2500|$|On 2015 Simpson is {{concentrating on}} a new album and {{developing}} a [...] "Live In Session" [...] experience - [...] "a new way to present the music live based around {{the idea of being}} in the centre of the dancefloor and at eye level... I am looking to create a space which mimics the studio environment – not only that – because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the centre of the dancefloor so I can monitor everything around me and be at the same level – eye-level with the presumed dancer. This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind of like an open kitchen in a restaurant – it’s an open kitchen in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it’s produced it’s already on the dancefloor. What I’m looking for in 2015 is sound reproduction in the clubs being taken a lot more seriously than in the past." ...|$|E

We had been so happy all week long until this sudden threat of his to kill me and then himself". On February 2, 1929 Jennie Wedge applied in the superior court to have her marriage to Wedge annulled {{on the basis of his}} [...] "unsound mind" [...] and his fraud, alleging that Wedge [...] "falsely and fraudulently" [...] represented that he had sufficient funds to provide for her immediate needs, whereas he had insufficient funds to pay the $100 bill for their honeymoon suite. Also on February 2, 1929 Wedge was charged with insanity at his own request, with the papers signed by his son, Hugh. On February 5, 1929 Wedge was declared insane and committed to the Napa State Hospital, [...] "an insane asylum" [...] in Napa, California.|$|E

2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house and told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E
