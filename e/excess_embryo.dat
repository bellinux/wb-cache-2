40|$|When {{parents have}} a baby, they are {{required}} by law and social precedent {{to care for the}} baby and provide it with a good home; unless their baby is an <b>excess</b> <b>embryo</b> produced from in vitro fertilization (IVF). Then the embryo can be abandoned to indefinite freezing. However, some families are choosing to adopt these embryos fixed in cryogenic limbo. In this article, I will look at the history and legality of embryo adoption, explain what is involved in embryo adoption, and finally expound on the ethical ramifications of choosing embryo adoption. During IVF, embryos are created in a petri dish for implantation. To insure sufficient viable embryos for the first and subsequent implantation attempts, excess embryos are produced, with the surplus stored in embryo cryopreservation. The embryos are gradually frozen over approximately 3 hours in cryoprotectant, destined for long term storage in liquid nitrogen at- 196 ° C (Embryo Freezing & Thawing, 2009). Due to increasingly nuanced storage and freezing techniques, there are comparable results for pregnancy using frozen embryos compared to initial, unfrozen embryos. According to a 2007 study, there is a 35 % chance of carrying a frozen embryo to term (Nightlight Christian Adoptions, 2009). Embryo cryopreservation technology has been widely utilized since the first baby was born from a frozen embryo in 1984 (Embryo Freezing & Thawing, 2009).

Eleven were unbalanced, 10 were normal (8 fertilized), and 4 were balanced (3 fertilized) for the fresh IVF cycle. Two normal embryos were transferred. Four normal and 3 balanced embryos were cryopreserved. A chemical pregnancy resulted. Four months later, the 7 cryopreserved embryos were thawed; 2 survived (1 balanced and 1 normal) and were transferred. An ongoing pregnancy resulted, and a normal (46,XX) female was delivered.

40|$|Background. When {{performing}} in-vitro fertilization (IVF), more embryos than needed {{are often}} derived. These embryos are usually frozen and stored, but as ruled by Swedish law {{they have to}} be discarded after 5 years. In other countries it is legal to donate the <b>excess</b> <b>embryos</b> to other infertile couples who for different reasons cannot undergo the procedure of IVF. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate public opinion in Sweden regarding different aspects of embryo donation. Methods. A questionnaire regarding attitudes towards aspects of embryo donation was sent to a randomized sample of 1, 000 Swedish women and men of reproductive age. Results. A total of 34 % responded to the questionnaires. A majority of the respondents (73 %) were positive towards embryo donation. Seventy-five per cent agreed that it should be possible to donate embryos to infertile couples. Approximately half of the participants (49 %) supported embryo donation to single women. A majority of the participants emphasized that demands should be imposed on the recipient’s age (63 %), alcohol addiction (79 %), drug addiction (85 %), and criminal record (67 %). Forty-seven per cent of the respondents agreed that the recipient should be anonymous to the donor, and 38 % thought that the donor should remain anonymous to the child. Conclusions.

Those who believe an embryo has the same human qualities as a fetus accordingly believe embryonic {{stem cell research}} is unethical because it destroys a potential human life. However, scientists advocate the embryo does not have human qualities and should be used for valuable research in the stem cell field. Stem cell research may lead to vast developments in medical treatments, including cancer and brain conditions and injuries that are currently incurable. ^ The current stem cell policy introduced by President Bush in 2001 in an attempt to balance the moral issues with the need for scientific research has broad negative implications on the furthering of stem cell research.

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hES cells) have the potential promise to cure a variety of human ailments. Such cells are pluripotent (from the Latin for “many powers”), and may act as “starter ” cells to grow new nerve tissue, heart muscle tissue, or glandular tissue, which has many scientists excited about new treatments for heart disease, strokes, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and many other disabling conditions. Current U.

40|$|Sex {{allocation}} {{has provided}} rich {{ground for the}} development of evolutionary theory. The dominant models in vertebrates have provided predictions of sex ratio based on asymmetry in variance in breeding success between sexes in the breeding system, and the relative effect of local competition. In ungulates, empirical work has provided some support for these models, but has also generated apparently contradictory observations. Recent models have provided some predictions for both individual and population sex ratio, showing that the availability of high-quality habitat patches and dispersal rates can critically affect both population- and individual-level expectations. We explore patterns in offspring sex ratio among a large sample of roe deer, a species with some interesting aspects of the breeding system. We found that in singleton pregnancies (the minority) there was an <b>excess</b> of male <b>embryos,</b> which was more marked in does in good condition at most sites. While the sex ratio among twins was close to parity, and unaffected either by average condition among populations or by individual condition within populations, we observed a clear excess of mixed pregnancies (sub-binomial variance, SBV). The excess was greater where the average condition was high. Within sites, population changes in average condition were associated with changes in SBV: in populations declining in condition, SBV also declined. There was no tendency for mixed twins to be more likely in individuals in better condition within a population. We conclude that condition-dependent allocation of sex does occur in roe deer. We suggest that in these "income breeders", mixed pairs might offer the greatest opportunity to optimize maternal investment during lactation, when conditions will be unpredictable, and that this is increasingly the case when average condition is poor...|$|R

O sucesso da criopreservação de embriões bovinos é essencial para melhor aproveitamento de embriões produzidos em excesso, para o estabelecimento de bancos de germoplasma e para comercialização de genética.

Embriões bovinos produzidos {{in vitro}} em estágio de blastocisto (144 a 156 horas pós-inseminação) foram vitrificados com Cryotop e não vitrificados (controle). Após 4 horas de cultivo, embriões que re-expandiram ou evoluíram para o estágio de blastocisto expandido foram usados para análises do microarranjo e para quantificação em reação de cadeia de polimerase em tempo real (qPCR). As análises da expressão global revelaram 43 genes diferencialmente expressos em embriões vitrificados comparados aos do grupo controle (p 0, 05), afeta a produção de blastocistos e também a resposta à criopreservação (p< 0, 05). E ainda, que os touros que produzem embriões mais crioresistentes nem sempre são os que produzem maior taxa de embriões PIV. Além disso, embriões macho e fêmea têm a mesma capacidade de resposta à vitrificação por Cryotop. The {{cryopreservation}} success of bovine embryos {{is essential for}} the better use of <b>excess</b> produced <b>embryos,</b> for the establishment of germplasm banks and genetics commercialization. In this study, gene expression alteration induced by the Cryotop vitrification procedure in bovine blastocysts using EmbryoGENE microarray slides was analyzed. Bovine in vitro produced embryos at blastocyst stage (144 to 156 hours postinsemination) were vitrified with Cryotop and non-vitrified (control). After 4 hours of culture, re-expanded or expanded blastocyst stage embryos were submitted to microarray analyzes and real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) quantification. Global gene expression analysis revealed 43 differentially expressed genes in vitrified embryos compared to control group (p < 0. 05). Nine genes in total were evaluated by qPCR, of which FOSL 1, involved in apoptosis process, showed differential expression (p < 0. 05) for both methods, being overexpressed in vitrified embryos. The results suggest that apoptosis {{plays a key role in}} embryos response of vitrification process. Considering that vitrification response is closely related to embryo quality, it was hypothesized that embryos selection for vitrification could also influence the difference in male:female ratio due to developmental speed and stress tolerance. Therefore, in the second stage of this study, the bull´s influence on embryo developmental kinetics and embryo response to cryopreservation was evaluated. For this, five bulls were taken and embryos cryopreservation by Cryotop method was compared in addition to embryo production. Initially, blastocyst stage embryos were vitrified (144 to 156 hours post-insemination), to evaluate the cryotolerance relative to the bulls; while expanded blastocyst stage embryos were removed from culture at D 6, D 7 and D 8, then sexed for developmental kinetics. As a second experiment, expanded blastocyst stage embryos were vitrified (168 hours post-insemination). All embryos (re-expanded, hatched blastocyst stage e, and degenerated) of both treatments, with 24 hours post-vitrification culture were used for sexing. The results suggest that sire´s choice, although not interfering in embryonic development kinetics, affects the blastocysts rates and the cryopreservation response. Besides, bulls producing more cryoresistent embryos are not always the ones that produce the highest IVP embryo rate.
