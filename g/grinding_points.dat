I hang it there so that I can see it while I work. That {{conundrum}} ruined me. It was the last thing I wrote for the `Grasshopper.' How I ever came to imagine it, I cannot tell. It {{is one of those things}} which occur to a man but once in a lifetime. After the wild shout of delight with which the public greeted that conundrum, my subsequent efforts met with hoots of derision. The `Grasshopper' turned its hind legs upon me. I sank from bad to worse,--much worse,--until at last I found myself reduced to my present occupation, which is that of <b>grinding</b> <b>points</b> on pins. By this I procure my bread, coffee, and tobacco, and sometimes potatoes and meat. One day while I was hard at work, an organ-grinder came into the street below. He played the serenade from `Trovatore' and the familiar notes brought back visions of old days and old delights, when the successful writer wore good clothes and sat at operas, when he looked into sweet eyes and talked of Italian airs, when his future appeared all a succession of bright scenery and joyous acts, without any provision for a drop-curtain. And as my ear listened, and my mind wandered in this happy retrospect, my every faculty seemed exalted, and, without any thought upon the matter, I ground points upon my pins so fine, so regular, and so smooth that they would have pierced with ease the leather of a boot, or slipped, without abrasion, among the finest threads of rare old lace. When the organ stopped, and I fell back into my real world of cobwebs and mustiness, I gazed upon the pins I had just ground, and, without a moment's hesitation, I threw them into the street, and reported the lot as spoiled. This cost me a little money, but it saved me my livelihood." ...|$|E

A {{floating}} nozzle {{is characterized}} by the property of intercepting airflow around a superabrasive grinding wheel and supplying coolant to a <b>grinding</b> <b>point</b> surely by adhesion of the coolant to the wheel surface. In this method, a small clearance between the wheel surface and the nozzle tip is automatically adjusted. This is mainly by the coolant pressure and a spring force pressing the nozzle toward the wheel. In grinding difficult-to-machine materials, it has been discovered that the grinding performance of superabrasive wheel improves, when the coolant is supplied using this nozzle. In this research, the basic behavior of the coolant adhering to the surface of a rotating wheel is investigated experimentally. The results confirmed that the coolant forms a thin layer on the wheel surface. Compared with a conventional nozzle, the coolant effectively reaches the <b>grinding</b> <b>point</b> by the floating nozzle, even at a low flow rate. This means that only the coolant that is necessary for grinding is supplied. In addition, it is found that the energy consumption in terms of the current to the machine spindle motor is comparatively small...|$|R

The peak of frequency in Δ 14, Δ 7.0, and Δ 3.5 appears in four <b>grind</b> <b>points,</b> whereas that in Δ 1.7 and Δ 0.87 is larger than four. Since the actual length of four grid points is different in each experiment, we suggest that the simulated convection distance in coarser resolution experiments is determined not physically but numerically; it may depend on the numerical discretization method. Hence, we speculated that the realistic distance between convection cores appears to be larger than the effective resolution in Δ 1.7 and Δ 0.87.|$|R

40|$|The {{work within}} this Thesis is {{concerned}} with the manufacturing processes associated with the production of blade root mounting slots in aeroengine compressor and turbine discs. Typically slots are of dovetail or fir-tree geometry dependent on specific design requirements. The state of the art process across the industry is broaching however, despite achieving required geometrical tolerances and surface integrity for decades the process is not without its disadvantages. Primarily these include the inflexibility of the process, machine tool cost; size and cutting forces, complexity of tooling and set up and further the limited level of control of the process beyond tooling design. This has led to research into alternative processes across a range of conventional and non-conventional manufacturing techniques. Work presented here focuses on two key technology areas, namely <b>point</b> <b>grinding</b> and electrolytic <b>point</b> <b>grinding.</b> The former applies small diameter single layer grinding wheels on a high speed machining centre with spindle capability in the region of 60, 000 rpm. Target geometry was a complex fir-tree root form requiring dimensional control to within +/- 5 um and a surface integrity in line with critical aerospace components. The later process investigated the unification of <b>point</b> <b>grinding</b> and electrochemical machining on a vertical machining centre to assess process performance across a range of variables. ...|$|R

In the protocol, a preliminary grinding cycle was first employed, which significantly reduced {{the effect of}} the initial wheel geometry error on the ground profile accuracy. A new compensation approach was developed. The compensation used the ground profile measured from a Talysurf profilometer to modify the NC toot path for the next grinding cycle. The tool path was modified by offsetting the residual profile error along the normal direction of a <b>grinding</b> <b>point,</b> rather than in the horizontal direction commonly used in the conventional method. The performance of the developed method was evaluated by fabricating aspherical mould inserts on cemented tungsten carbide. The result indicated that the residual profile error after two grinding cycles was reduced to approximately 0. 4 mu m in PV, with average surface roughness of below 10 nm, which is more efficient than the conventional compensation process.

40|$|Abstract. In surface grinding, {{the shape}} error is {{occurred}} by the thermal deformation of a ground workpiece. To finish the workpiece with high accuracy, {{it is necessary}} to understand the temperature distribution of the workpiece during grinding process. However there is no study to analyze the temperature distribution of a large workpiece during surface grinding process. In this study, an advanced simulation analysis method of the temperature distribution for a large workpiece was developed. In the developed simulation analysis method, the temperature distribution was calculated from the power consumption of the wheel motor. The power consumption can be obtained easily without any specialized equipment. To evaluate the developed simulation analysis method, in-process measurement of the temperature distribution of a large workpiece was also carried out. A large workpiece ground in this study weights about 1. 3 tons. The temperature distribution was measured with thermistors mounted in many places of the ground workpiece. At the area close to the grinding surface, it was found that temperature rises immediately after the passage of grinding wheel with measuring the developed in-process measurement system. On the other hand, at the area far from the <b>grinding</b> <b>point,</b> temperature does not change quickly. The in-process measured temperature distribution agreed well with the simulated results...|$|R

However, due to the repulsion of the winding air along the surface of the wheel rotating at high speed, a large amount of coolant is wasted without reaching the <b>grinding</b> <b>point.</b> This research aims to improve the grinding performance for glass edge grinding using a small amount of coolant supplied through a floating nozzle instead of a conventional nozzle. A special floating nozzle with its end covering the narrow groove formed on the wheel was made. The edge of a glass plate with a thickness of 0. 7 mm was ground under the conditions of grinding speed Vs= 1570 m/min, depth of cut a= 0. 5 mm, and feed rate Vw= 5 m/min. With a conventional nozzle, the amount of coolant needed was 3 l/min. With a floating nozzle, the amount was drastically reduced to only 0. 1 l/min. No damage occurred on the ground surface. The ground surface was also improved with the floating nozzle. The grinding force was measured.
