5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a <b>fader</b> on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E

25|$|Impressionism did {{not make}} itself evident among Argentine artists until after 1900, however, and never {{acquired}} the kind of following it did in Europe, though it did inspire influential Argentine post-impressionists such as Martín Malharro, Ramón Silva, Cleto Ciocchini, Fernando <b>Fader,</b> Pío Collivadino, Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós, Realism, and aestheticism continued to set the agenda in Argentine painting and sculpture, noteworthy during this era for the sudden fame of sculptor Lola Mora, a student of Auguste Rodin's.|$|E

25|$|The Concrete Herald {{was founded}} in Hamilton, Washington in 1901, then moved to Concrete, Washington in 1913. After {{changing}} its owners and editors several times, the newspaper entered a 40-year period of stability when from 1929 to 1970 it was owned and edited by Charles Dwelley. During this period, as Dwelley's editorials were picked up by other publications and quoted nationwide, the Herald recognition and subscription base expanded beyond Concrete, into Skagit Valley. After Dwelley's retirement, The Concrete Herald was purchased by Robert and June <b>Fader,</b> both experienced journalists. However, after Robert's premature death in 1985, and June's retirement in late 1989, the Herald was purchased by a local businessman unconnected to publishing business {{which led to the}} newspaper's demise in 1991. In 2009, after raising money within local community, local activist Jason Miller has revived The Concrete Herald in both paper and electronic form in a move that surprised the publishing industry.|$|E
25|$|DJ mixers {{are small}} audio mixing {{consoles}} specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer {{used by a}} record producer or audio engineer; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard recording studio mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have {{many of the same}} features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, effects units, etc), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the crossfader. The crossfader is a type of <b>fader</b> that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a DJ controller instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.|$|E
