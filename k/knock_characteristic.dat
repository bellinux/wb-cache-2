Thus knock feature extraction {{is the key}} of closed-loop control of ignition in {{spark ignition}} engine. This paper reports an investigation of knock detection in spark ignition (SI) engines using CEEMD-Hilbert transform based on the engine cylinder pressure signals and engine cylinder block vibration signals. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) was used to decompose the signal and detect <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Hilbert transform was {{used to analyze the}} frequency information of <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The result shows that, for both of cylinder pressure signals and vibration signals, the CEEMD algorithm could extract the <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic,</b> and the Hilbert transform result shows that the energy of knock impact areas has the phenomenon of frequency concentration in both cylinder pressure signal and cylinder block vibration signal. At last, the knock window is then determined, based on which a new knock intensity evaluation factor K is propose, and it can accurately distinguish between heavy knock, light knock, and normal combustion three states...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to detect critical knock for a gasoline engine by the common method of knock diagnosis. In this paper, a new approach is presented to detect critical knock for gasoline engines. Based on this approach knock diagnosis consists of four steps. Firstly, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is chosen as a pre-processor for a neural network to extract <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic</b> signals; Secondly, four characteristic factors are selected and calculated from <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic</b> signals; Thirdly, degree of memberships of the characteristic factors are calculated as the input and output of the neural network; and finally a RBF(Radial Basis Function) neural network is chosen, trained and applied to detect critical knock. Knock experiments were performed on a gasoline engine, {{and the application of}} the presented approach was studied. The results show that the presented method is practicable and can be applied to control the ignition of a gasoline engine working under critical knock which is admitted as an improved state of engine performance...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that the piano was developed to produce a keyboard instrument with a larger dynamic range and higher sound radiation level than the harpsichord possesses. Also, the harpsichord is a plucked string instrument with a very controlled mechanism to excite the string. For these reasons it is often falsely understood that the harpsichord does not exhibit any dynamic variation. On the contrary, the signal analysis and the listening test made in the this study show that minor but audible differences in the dynamic levels exist. The signal analysis portrays that stronger playing forces produce higher levels in harmonics. The energy given by the player is not only distributed to the plucking mechanism but also carried on from {{the key to the}} body. This is evident from the increased level of body mode radiation. A synthesis model for approximating the dynamic behavior of the harpsichord is also proposed. It contains gain and timbre control, and a parallel filter structure to simulate the soundboard <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic</b> for high key velocity tones. 1...|$|E

In the dual-fuel combustion pro-cess we have the ignition stage followed by the combustion stage. There are three types of knock: diesel knock, spark knock and knock due to secondary ignition delay of the primary fuel (erratic knock).

40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the {{importance}} of chamber wall temperature in the <b>knocking</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a spark-ignition engine. To vary the chamber wall temperature, two procedures were used, one {{is to change the}} coolant temperature and the other is to raise the exhaust valve surface temperature by substituting a ceramic surface layer for the original steel layer. Although the coolant temperature change had no influence on the flame propagation process, it fairly affected the knocking process, such as mean knock intensity and mean knock occurrence timing. This is caused by both the change of bulk mixture temperature of the end gas and the temperature uniformity within the end gas region. Cycle-by-cycle based knocking behaviour can also be influenced by the coolant temperature, which is considered {{to be based on the}} temperature uniformity in the whole chamber region. Exhaust valve surface temperature change did not affect any <b>knocking</b> <b>characteristics.</b> It suggests the importance of the wall temperature in the end gas region...|$|R

The first method is reasonable for countries with developed oil refining system, which possess sufficient capacities for catalytic cracking, isomerization and alkylation. At this time the second version is more suitable to Kazakhstan’s oils. The additive is represented in the paper; this additive allows to increase antiknock properties (octane number) and to decrease harmful component content in exhaust gases, tar deposit on engine feed system {{as well as to}} extend the term of service of catalysts for exhaust gas purification. Regulation the high <b>knock</b> <b>characteristic</b> of gasoline is one of requirements to motor fuel producers.

40|$|Abstract: Concerns {{on energy}} security, emissions, {{and the recent}} hike {{in the price of}} fossil fuels have {{prompted}} the rapidly growing interest in the use of various alternative and renew-able fuels, including low heating value fuels such as land-filled gases, biogases, coal bed methane gases, and others. Generally, the low heating value (btu) fuels contain substantial amounts of dilu-ents such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapour, and other trace gases in the fuel composition. The present contribution describes the results of the investigation of knock in a single-cylinder variable compression ratio (CR) spark-ignition engine fuelled with gaseous fuels, such as natural gas, methane, and hydrogen, in the presence of different amounts of diluents, specifically carbon dioxide and nitrogen, in the fuel mixture in order to represent closely the general composition of land filled and biogases in practice. The <b>knock</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the fuels were quantitatively evaluated in terms of the methane number using various methods. Generally, the addition of either diluent carbon dioxide or nitrogen in the fuel mixtures augmented the <b>knock</b> resistance <b>characteristics</b> extending the engine operational limits.

40|$|Net heat release, <b>knock</b> <b>characteristics</b> and {{temperature}} {{were derived from}} in-cylinder pressure and end-gas CARS measurements for different fuels in a single-cylinder engine. The maximum net heat release rate resulting from {{the final phase of}} autoignition is closely associated with knock intensity. Aromatic fuels have lower maximum heat release rates and lower knock intensities than expected from their octane number when compared to paraffinic fuels; this is observed even when there is significant heating of the end-gas from pre-flame reactions. Leaner mixtures have lower combustion rates so that pressure development is slowed and hence ignition needs to be more advanced to get knock to occur as frequently as in a richer mixture. However, for a given frequency of knock occurrence, there is no significant difference in peak net heat release rates and hence in knock intensities for different mixture strengths...|$|R
50|$|The {{octane rating}} of {{gasoline}} {{is measured in}} a test engine and is defined by comparison with the mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane) and heptane that {{would have the same}} anti-knocking capacity as the fuel under test: the percentage, by volume, of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane in that mixture is the octane number of the fuel. For example, gasoline with the same <b>knocking</b> <b>characteristics</b> as a mixture of 90% iso-octane and 10% heptane would have an octane rating of 90. A rating of 90 {{does not mean that the}} gasoline contains just iso-octane and heptane in these proportions but that it has the same detonation resistance properties (generally, gasoline sold for common use never consists solely of iso-octane and heptane; it is a mixture of many hydrocarbons and often other additives). Because some fuels are more knock-resistant than pure iso-octane, the definition has been extended to allow for octane numbers greater than 100.|$|R
40|$|Engine knock {{has long}} been a well {{recognized}} phenomenon in the automotive industry. Detecting engine knock opens up the possibility for an indirect feedback of the engine's internal combustion without installing a pressure transducer inside the cylinder. Knock detection has mainly been used for spark advance control, making it possible to control the engine close to its knock limit in search for the optimal ignition timing. This application has to a lesser extent been applied to lightweight two-stroke engines, which is the focus of this study. The investigation features a modern chainsaw engine whose <b>knock</b> <b>characteristics</b> were first determined with a pressure transducer. The structural vibrations originating from the engine knock are filtered out of the signal from a remote located accelerometer.

There {{was no significant}} charge cooling due to fuel evaporation. The decrease in NOx emission and exhaust temperature {{could be explained by}} the change in adiabatic flame temperature of the mixture. The fuel knock resistance improved significantly with the gasohol so that ignition could be timed at a value much closer or at MBT timing. Changing from 0 % to 100 % ethanol in the fuel, this combustion phasing improvement led to a 20 % increase in NIMEP and 8 percentage points in fuel conversion efficiency at 1500 rpm. At 2000 rpm, where knocking was less severe, the improvement was about half (10 % increase in NIMEP and 4 percentage points in fuel conversion efficiency). Because there was no significant change in the end gas temperature in these experiments, the gasohol knock resistance was attributed solely to the ignition chemistry of the ethanol.

40|$|The {{effects of}} air {{humidity}} on the <b>knock</b> <b>characteristics</b> of fuels are investigated in a lean-burn, high-speed medium BMEP engine fueled with a CH 4 + 4. 7 mole% C 3 H 8 gas mixture. Experiments {{are carried out}} with humidity ratios ranging from 4. 3 to 11 g H 2 O/kg dry air. The measured pressure profiles at non-knocking conditions are compared with calculated pressure profiles using a model that predicts the time-dependent in-cylinder conditions (P, T) in the test engine (“combustion phasing”). This model was extended to include the effects of humidity. The {{results show that the}} extended model accurately computes the in-cylinder pressure history when varying the water fraction in air. Increasing the water vapor content in air decreases the peak pressure and temperature significantly, which increases the measured Knock Limited Spark Timing (KLST); at 4. 3 g H 2 O/kg dry air the KLST is 19 °CA BTDC while at 11 g H 2 O/kg dry air the KLST is 21 °CA BTDC for the same fuel. Excellent agreement is observed between the calculated knock resistance (using the Propane Knock Index, PKI) and the measured knock resistance (KLST) for the range in water content in air studied in this work. Since the effect of water on autoignition delay time is negligible, the observed increase in knock resistance of the fuel-air mixture is due a decrease in pressure and temperature of the end gas with increasing water content in as a result of changes in the mass burning rate, and thermophysical properties of the fuel-air mixture...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLarge Eddy Simulation of {{knocking}} in {{piston engines}} requires high-fidelity physical models and numerical techniques. The need to capture temperature fields with high precision to predict autoignition {{is an additional}} critical constraint compared to existing LES in engines. The present work presents advances for LES of knocking in two fields: (1) a Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) technique is implemented to compute the flow within the engine over successive cycles with LES together with the temperature field within the cylinder head walls and the valves and (2) a reduced two-step scheme is used to predict both propagating premixed flames as well as autoignition times {{over a wide range}} of equivalence ratios, pressures and temperatures. The paper focuses on CHT which is critical for knocking because the gas temperature field is controlled by the wall temperature field and knocking is sensitive to small temperature changes. The CHT LES is compared to classical LES where the temperatures of the head and the valves are supposed to be homogeneous and imposed empirically. Results show that the skin temperature field (which {{is a result of the}} CHT LES while it is a user input for classical LES) is complex and controls knocking events. While the results of the CHT LES are obviously better because they suppress a large part of the empirical specification of the wall temperatures, this study also reveals a difficult and crucial element of the CHT approach: the description of exhaust valves cooling which are in contact with the engine head for part of the cycle and not in the rest of the cycle, leading to difficulties for heat transfer descriptions between valves and head. The CHT method is successfully applied to an engine studied at IFP Energies Nouvelles where <b>knocking</b> <b>characteristics</b> have been studied over a wide range of conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effect of oxygenated hydrocarbons on the <b>knocking</b> <b>characteristics</b> of an engine when blended with low-leaded gasoline. Alcohols, ethers, esters and ketones were tested individually and in various combinations up to an oxygen content of 4 % wt/wt in a blend with Series F- 7 gasoline of 90, 92, 94 and 96 RON. Tests were carried out at wide open throttle, constant speed and standard timing setting. Engine speed was varied using a dynamometer and knock was detected by two piezoelectric transducers, one on the cylinder head monitoring all four cylinders and one monitoring the cylinder most prone to knock. The engine speeds associated with trace and light knock of a continuous nature were noted. Curves were produced for each oxygenate blend of base RON used against engine speed for the two knock conditions which were compared with those produced using pure Series F- 7 fuels. From this a suggested RON of the blend was derived. RON increase was less when using a higher RON base fuel in the blend. Most individual oxygenates showed similar effects in similar concentrations when their oxygen content was comparable. Blends containing more than one oxygenate showed some variation with methanol/MTBE/ 3 methylbutan- 2 -one and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one knocking less than expected and methanol/MTBE/TBA also showing good knock resistance. Further tests to optimise initial findings suggested a blend of methanol and MTBE to be superior although partial replacement of MTBE by 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one resulted in a fuel of comparable performance. Exhaust emissions were tested for a number of oxygenated blends in 2 -star gasoline. 2 -star and 4 -star fuels were also tested for reference. All oxygenate blends reduced carbon monoxide emissions as expected and hydrocarbon emissions were also reduced. The largest reduction in carbon monoxide occurred using a 14. 5 % (1 : 1 : 1) methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one blend. Hydrocarbon emissions were most markedly reduced by a blend containing 25. 5 % 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one. Power output was tested for the blends and indicated a maximum increase of about 5 % at low engine speeds. The most advantageous blends were methanol/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 5) 11 % in 2 -star and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 3 : 2) 11 % in 2 -star.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The effects of air and exhaust gas dilution on the CAI combustion {{of a range of}} fuels including three gasoline compositions, four primary reference fuels, and two alcohols are experimentally investigated using a single cylinder research engine. Two of the three gasolines tested are manufactured from standard gasoline during engine operation by a novel fuel system, designed to improve the performance of both controlled autoignition and spark ignition engines. A series of experimental tests are performed to establish the satisfactory combined air and exhaust gas dilution regions for each fuel. Detailed in-cylinder pressure and exhaust gas speciation measurements are taken, and the fuels are compared and contrasted for their performance in terms of power output, fuel consumption, and harmful exhaust emissions. Results show that alcohol fuels are superior to hydrocarbon fuels for controlled autoignition combustion because their autoignition characteristics are less affected by the presence of exhaust gas species. Furthermore, the timing of autoignition is shown to be of minor importance for achieving efficient and stable controlled autoignition combustion, contrary to widely held beliefs. In addition, the novel fuel system is developed and commissioned for use on a single cylinder research engine operating with a spark ignition system. The two gasoline fuels produced by the system are evaluated individually for their <b>knocking</b> combustion <b>characteristics</b> over a range of compression ratios and spark advances.

40|$|Downsizing” engines with a turbo-charger is {{considered}} a promising way to realize the reduction of CO 2 emissions and the improvement of fuel efficiency. Understanding high pressure engine combustion and knock is a prerequisite of developing any ”Downsizing” Spark Ignition (SI) engine. Nevertheless, the lack or inconsistent of experimental data about dynamic behaviours of premixed flame and autoignition at elevated pressure hinder further research. The aims {{of this study are}} developing an optical experimental boosted spark-ignition engine, and applying advanced diagnostic tools for investigation of flame propagation and autoignition. In this study, the optical engine LUPOE (Leeds University Ported Optical Engine) was employed, which was supercharged using electronically controlled exhaust valves. The controlled exhaust valves can increase the back pressure and extend the inlet boosting time, to raise the initial pressure without changing the inlet flow rate. This new experimental boosting configuration enables the intake mass flow rate and the initial pressure to be independently varied. New engine control and data acquisition systems also were developed to fulfill the requirements of the high pressure experiments. This new boosting method has further been deployed to investigate the influence of a highly boosted initial environment (inlet pressure was up to 2. 5 bar) on the flame development. These studies have been conducted at almost the same conditions of turbulence intensity. The turbulence intensities, and the integral length scales, were measured by using two dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The turbulent flame development was recorded with high speed CH* chemiluminescence. In addition to the image analysis, ”reverse” thermodynamic analysis was applied to derive the in-cylinder charge state and mass burning rate. The results show that an inlet pressure rise from 1. 6 bar to 2. 0 bar decreases the flame burning velocity weakly. However, it has different effects upon the flame acceleration at the early stage, and flame deceleration when the flame approaches the side walls. Burning velocity still shows a slight raise with the pressure increasing at the ”fully developed” stage. The structure of the flame at high pressure and its response to pressure effects also were investigated. A laser sheet visualization technique was applied, and a new image processing algorithm was developed to derive the detailed cross section flame front topology. Wrinkle and curvature of the flame front were characterized to compare the flame shapes under different boosted initial pressures. ”Self-similar” properties of flames were evaluated with mean progress variables. The results show that the initial pressure has only a slight effect on the flame structure. Flames at high pressure have the same ”self-similar” properties as that observed at low pressure. Further analysis and modelling of turbulent combustion requires information on the laminar flame speed. In order to gain the iso-octane laminar flame speed at high igni-tion temperatures and pressures up to 600 K and 15 bar, the LUPOE engine was operated at extremely low engine speeds, i. e. at an engine speed of 100 rpm. A turbulent-free condition was attained and confirmed by PIV measurement, the flame speeds in enginerelevant conditions were collected. By comparing these data with the laminar burning velocities from the correlations calculation and chemical mechanisms simulation, the measured burning velocities could be twice faster than that of unstretched and stable flame. This is possibly caused by flame surface wrinkling, induced by hydrodynamic instabilities at high pressure. Finally, <b>knock</b> <b>characteristics</b> were examined in the strongly boosted SI engine. Images of different knock development processes provide a detailed understanding of the pressure oscillation in relation to in-cylinder phenomena. It was found that the extreme knock events, observed during the strongly charged operation, occurred at lower pressures, and larger mass fractions burned compared with knock at the normally aspirated operation. The gas dynamics of autoignition, and flame-autoignition interaction played an important role for the pressure oscillations. The reaction front initiated by the autoignition events propagated at velocities much lower than the speed of sound at the extreme knock onset...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{modelling}} of the combustion and emissions of dual fuel HCCI engines for design of “engine combustion system”. For modelling the combustion first the laminar flamelet model and a hybrid Lagrangian / Eulerian method are developed and implemented {{to provide a}} framework for incorporating detailed chemical kinetics. This model can be applied to an engine for the validation of the chemical kinetic mechanism. The chemical kinetics, reaction rates and their equations lead to a certain formula for which the coefficients can be obtained from different sources, such as NASA polynomials [1]. This is followed by study of the simulation results and significant findings. Finally, for investigation of the <b>knock</b> phenomenon some <b>characteristics</b> such as compression ratio, fuel equivalence ratio, spark timing and their effects on the performance of an engine are examined and discussed. The OH radical concentration (which is the main factor for production of knock) is evaluated with regard to adjustment of the above mentioned characteristic parameters. In the second part of this work the specification of the sample engine is given and the results obtained from simulation are compared with experimental results for this sample engine, in order to validate the method applied in AVL Fire software. This method is used to investigate and optimize the effects of parameters such as inlet temperature, fuels ratio, diesel fuel injection timing, engine RPM and EGR on combustion in a dual fuel HCCI engine. For modelling the dual fuel HCCI engine AVL FIRE software is applied to simulate the combustion and study the optimization of a combustion chamber design. The findings for the dual fuel HCCI engine show that the mixture of methane and diesel fuel has a great influence on an engine's power and emissions.
