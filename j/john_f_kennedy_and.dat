5|$|JFK is a 1991 American conspiracy-thriller film {{directed}} by Oliver Stone. It examines {{the events leading}} to the assassination of <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> alleged cover-up {{through the eyes of}} former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). Garrison filed charges against New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to assassinate the President, for which Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was found responsible by the Warren Commission.|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B.

Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create.

Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E

Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E
5|$|After a year, Matlock was {{promoted}} to Third Secretary in the Political Section. American foreign policy {{with regard to the}} Soviet Union, known as containment, had been articulated in 1947 by George F. Kennan, who was later to become a good friend of Matlock’s. The American policy was basically to contain the spread of Communism, in the expectation that it would eventually collapse of internal contradictions. This did not prevent discussions between the Superpowers. In June 1961, President <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev met in Vienna, and in December the United Nations General Assembly approved a draft joint resolution on principles for negotiating disarmament. This period also saw the beginnings of U.S. - U.S.S.R. cultural exchanges, notably the visit of poet Robert Frost to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> <b>and</b> the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E

5|$|In 1947 Warren {{became the}} first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although {{controversial}} and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out {{about the dangers of}} nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{forged a}} highly {{successful}} career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for From Here to Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward {{the end of his}} career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.|$|E

Since this hall was slated as {{the first part of}} Lincoln Center for completion, its inauguration was considered especially momentous. Among the guest list of 2600 for the first concert and the white-tie gala which would follow it were John D. Rockefeller III (chairman of Lincoln Center), Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Governor and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, United Nations Secretary General U Thant and prominent figures in the arts that included of Metropolitan Opera General Manager Rudolf Bing, violinist Isaac Stern and actress Merle Oberon. Noted composers would also attend included Samuel Barber, Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Richard Rodgers, William Schuman and Roger Sessions. United States President <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> his wife Jackie had also been invited.

5|$|Nixon {{was born}} in Yorba Linda, California. After {{completing}} his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 {{to work for the}} federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president – at 40, the second-youngest vice president in history. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> <b>and</b> lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey.|$|E
