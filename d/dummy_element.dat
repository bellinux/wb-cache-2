40|$|The mutual {{coupling}} in phased array {{is a well-known}} phenomenon. It affects the active element pattern of the array as the phase of the individual element is altered. In an array that has many elements, the effect is identical for all the elements that are nearer {{to the center of}} the antenna, thus allowing a more predictable scan performance with respect to the phase of the elements. However, in a small array that has only three elements, the active element pattern for the elements at the end can be significantly different from the center element and this affects the predictability of operations such as direction finding. The thesis investigates two ways that can potentially reduce or at least control the {{mutual coupling}} in small arrays. The first method simply adds a <b>dummy</b> <b>element</b> with a special load condition to each end of the array to make the edge element "feel" as if there are more elements next to it. The second method uses a passive feedback circuit to both monitor and correct the magnitude and phase of the mutual coupling at the input of each array element. A hybrid ring is attached to each of the elements to monitor the amount of interference received by that element. Simulation results for the <b>dummy</b> <b>element</b> method shows that some reduction in phase error can be achieved if the spacing and length of the element are selected properly. The compensation network approach relies on an efficient two-port array element. The research has focused on the design of a two-port printed circuit dipole that could be used in such an array. The dipole was designed, simulated, and fabricated. Future research will use this element in a compensation network. Republic of Singapore Navy author...|$|E

40|$|The {{adjectives}} of quantity (Q-adjectives) many, few, {{much and}} little {{stand out from}} other quantity expressions on account of their syntactic flexibility, occurring in positions that could be called quantificational (many students attended), predicative (John’s friends were many), attributive (the many students), differential (much more than a liter) and adverbial (slept too much).

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} cross-linguistic parallels in the grammaticalization of ‘do’-auxiliaries in periphrastic verb constructions. Such constructions are {{exemplified by}} the phenomenon of ‘do’-support in English, where they are obligatory in interrogative and negative clauses. Similar phenomena can be attested across {{a wide range of}} genetically and typologically diverse languages. The auxiliary in periphrastic ‘do’-constructions is derived from a ‘schematic action ’ verb that can either be directly associated with a specific function, or it appears in the clause as a consequence of other grammatical factors. Based on a sample of 200 languages I will argue that periphrastic ‘do’-constructions become grammaticalized in a limited range of grammatical context after going through a stage of optional usage, and also that direct expression of a verbal category by a ‘do’-auxiliary represents a possible final stage of grammaticalization of the ‘schematic action’-verb. The verbal categories expressed by such an element are restricted to a subsection of tense, aspect and mood. If in a given language the use of a ‘do’-auxiliary has become obligatory in association with other functions, the auxiliary will not grammaticalize further and continues as a semantically bleached <b>dummy</b> <b>element.</b> Tense, aspect and mood are therefore the only functional domains in which ‘do’-auxiliaries can become grammaticalized as meaningful elements...|$|E
40|$|This paper elaborates on offline {{and online}} {{research}} into linguistic status of non-anaphoric 'er' "there" in presentive sentences with a preposed adjunct (e. g. Op de hoek van de straat is (er) een winkel). In a first study (Grondelaers & Brysbaert 1996), we used corpus materials and self-paced reading data {{to demonstrate that}} there is a positive correlation between the presence of 'er' in adjunct sentences and the spatial and discursive situating potential of the preposed locative adjunct: the preference for 'er' in such sentences increases as the locative search precision of the adjunct and the topicality of the adjunct referent decrease. Building on additional corpus data and a new self-paced reading experiment, the present paper goes beyond the observation of correlations, and concentrates on 'er's' exact linguistic function. The cumulative empirical evidence suggests that 'er' is an acciessibility marker in the sense of Ariel (1990) : 'er' is not - as is generally assumed - an optional <b>dummy</b> <b>element,</b> but a discourse particle inserted to inform the hearer how important the subject to be created is from a communicative point of view, how inferrable it is from the foregoing context, and how much effort the hearer should invest in its creation...|$|E

Recently considerable {{effort has been}} directed towards the development of high density magneto-resistive memories. This research includes work in many areas such as obtaining cells with higher signal levels, densification of storage cells {{and the development of}} an appropriate sensing scheme. This dissertation deals with the development of latter stages of a multi stage sensing scheme for a large magneto-resistive memory. In this sensing scheme the signal of a actual element is compared against the signal from a <b>dummy</b> <b>element.</b> The resulting signal is stored and again is compared against a signal of opposite polarity which is generated from the same element. This process is called self referencing and is done to minimize offset problems. The special features of this sensing scheme are: the balanced sensing where the signal from the actual and the dummy elements are balanced to have identical time constants, a two stage switched capacitor auto-zero scheme where the DC offsets between the two elements due to mismatch is removed while generating very little noise and self referencing which is done by a sample and compare circuit. This self referencing process increases the bit density by 50 % and the two stage auto-zero significantly reduces read access time.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} pressure on the dynamics of pre-stiffened structures such as the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM). Previous work in which the stiffness terms resulting from constant pressure were derived has been extended to enable modeling of nonconstant pressure applied over nonenclosed volumes. These conditions will result in nonsymmetric terms in the global stiffness matrix which will not cancel out. Three new pressure stiffness elements incorporating these nonsymmetric terms have been implemented as <b>dummy</b> <b>elements</b> in COSMIC NASTRAN and have been tested on various simple examples as well as an existing ASRM NASTRAN finite element model. The results indicate that for all load cases of practical interest to the ASRM program, the nonsymmetric terms have very little effect on the dynamic characteristics. In addition, the pressure stiffness elements developed in the previous work which assumed constant pressure gave virtually the same results as the new elements even for problems in which the pressures are not constant. The original elements appear to work well as long as the pressure gradient across any individual element is no larger than about 0. 75 psi/inch. The new elements are therefore most useful for determining the conditions under which the original pressure stiffness elements can be used...|$|R

The upper PCB contains the four radiating cavity-backed slots, where the cavity is formed in substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) using metalized via holes. The SIW cavity is excited by a coupling slot. The excitation slot is fed by a microstrip-ridge gap waveguide formed in the air gap between {{the upper and lower}} PCBs. The lower PCB contains the microstrip line, being short-circuited to the ground plane of the lower PCB with via holes, and with additional metalized via holes alongside the microstrip line to form a stopband for parallel-platemodes in the air gap. The designed element can be used in large arrays with distribution networks realized in such microstrip-ridge gap waveguide technology. Therefore, the present paper describes a generic study in an infinite array environment, and performance is measured in terms of the active reflection coefficient S 11 and the power lost in grating lobes.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is two-fold, being, firstly, to {{describe}} certain important areas of the syntax of modern spoken Telugu and, secondly, by formulating the description in terms of localise case theory, to contribute something {{to the understanding of}} this approach. Illustrative support for the localist hypothesis has hitherto been drawn largely from languages of the Indo-European family. This thesis attempts to provide a supplement to this by drawing on a language of the Dravidian family, which is genetically entirely unrelated to Indo-European. After an introductory chapter surveying earlier [...] work on the grammar of Telugu, from which it will become apparent that there has so far been only a modest amount of work on Telugu syntax in terms of any recent theoretical model and nothing in terms of the localist approach, there follows an account of Telugu sentence patterns and the major elements of Telugu sentence construction. This is intended to provide the necessary data on the surface grammar of the language to make the subsequent proposals regarding underlying structures more readily comprehensible. Chapter 3 gives an outline of the theory of generative localism and makes comparisons with other current syntactic theories, in particular the case grammar of Fillmore and generative semantics. The fourth chapter examines one of the primitive case relations, namely the one that specifically underlies the spatial locative constructions of Telugu. Attention is drawn in the discussion to the co-relationship between word-order and definiteness and the bearing this has on a statement of the derivation of existential clauses. Chapter 5 attempts to show the underlying uniformity between the concrete locatives (spatial locatives) and certain apparently nonconcrete phenomena such as possessive and stative expressions, including verbs of cognition, perception and wanting. The examination of equative clauses that is presented'-in Chapter & focuses attention on agu, the 'copula' of Telugu. The presentation leads to the conclusion that this 'copula' needs to be taken as a basic verb rather than as a <b>dummy</b> <b>element.</b> It also becomes necessary to suggest the need to abandon the Fillmorean principle of one instance per clause of a given case relation. The locative discussed in Chapters 4 and 5 has been non-directional. Chapter 7 is concerned with directional locatives, that is to say with 'source' and 'goal'. It is shown that these two do not involve two further case relations, since 'goal' can be accounted for as a sub¬ type of static locative. The thesis concludes with a summary account of further worthwhile avenues of research in Telugu syntax which might usefully be handled in localist terms...|$|E

With the same core configuration and similar assembly type, high-density monolithic U-Mo fuel will replace the current HEU fuel with comparable performance. Part of the required analysis for relicensing includes detailed fuel management and burnup studies with the new LEU fuel, to be carried out with a recently developed fuel management tool called MCODE-FM. This code-package is a Python wrapper enabling automatic fuel shuffling between successive runs of MIT's MCODE, which couples MCNP with ORIGEN for full-core neutronics and depletion. In this work, the capabilities of MCODE have been expanded, and the effects of depletion mesh parameters have been explored. Several features {{have been added to the}} fuel management tool to encompass the the full range of fuel management options needed for detailed analysis, including assembly flipping, rotation, and temporary storage above the core. In addition, an option to easily manage experiments and custom <b>dummy</b> <b>elements</b> has been added, and a parallel version of MCODE for MCODE-FM that better handles finer discretizations of full-core runs has been developed. These changes have been made in the main wrapper utility as well as the graphical user interface (GUI). In addition to the new MCODE-FM capabilities, a suite of automatic data analysis utilities were developed to consistently parse results. These include utilities to extract or calculate isotope data, fission powers, blade heights, peaking factors, and 3 D VTK files for visualization at any time step. The suite has been developed as a series of Python scripts, accessible also through the MCODE-FM GUI. Finally, the effects of the spatial discretization parameters for the depletion mesh have been explored, and mesh choice recommendations have been made for different types of studies. In summary, coarser meshes in the radial and lateral dimensions have been found to yield conservative power peaking results, whereas a finer axial mesh is needed axially. Thus for iterative fuel management studies a fast-running depletion mesh of 8 axial regions, 3 radial regions, and 1 lateral region can be used. However, for safety studies and benchmarking that only need to run once or twice, 16 axial regions, 15 or 18 radial regions (HEU or LEU, respectively), and 4 lateral regions should be used. by Nicholas E.

40|$|AbstractExplosion from an {{anti-tank}} mines or {{improvised explosive}} devices are {{recognized as one of}} the lethal threat towards occupants inside an armoured vehicle.

Minimizing the occupant's casualty can be achieved by properly dissipating the shock waves exerted to the vehicle. It is important to distinguish the contributing factors that affectted the behavior of the blast wave so that proper reduction on the shock waves can be achieved. In this paper, three factors such as occupant seating height, charge weight placement and the Hopkinson-Cranz blast scaling were studied using numerical simulations.
