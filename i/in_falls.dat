5|$|Filming {{occurred}} during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film <b>in</b> <b>Falls</b> City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Falls</b> the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E

5|$|As <b>in</b> <b>falls</b> one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo {{started out}} against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E
