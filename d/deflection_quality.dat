40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{several key}} issues in mechanics and automated planning of workpiece fixturing and robotic grasping, including accurate and efficient modelling of compliance, well-defined and practically useful quality measures, and well-defined kinematic metric functions for rigid bodies. The accurate and efficient modelling of compliant fixtures and grasps is considered. A stiffness matrix formula is derived using the overlap compliance representation for quasi-rigid bodies. In contrast to existing approaches using the linear contact model, this formula is well-suited to automated planning algorithms since it can incorporate realistic nonlinear contact models (e. g., the classical Hertz model), {{and can be}} directly computed from CAD data on basic geometric and material properties of the bodies. The formula is then used {{as a basis for}} a systematic analysis of local curvature effects on fixture stability. This analysis shows that destabilizing effects of local curvatures are practically negligible, and that curvature effects can be used to stabilize, sometimes significantly, an otherwise unstable fixture. The stiffness matrix formula is also used to show that stability analysis in general depends on the choice of contact models, which offers additional evidence for the importance of using realistic contact models. The stiffness and <b>deflection</b> <b>quality</b> measures are defined for compliant fixtures and grasps, and are applied to optimal planning. Unlike existing quality measures that rely on heuristic rules or depend on reference frame choices, the stiffness and <b>deflection</b> <b>quality</b> measures are theoretically sound. Equally important is that these quality measures accurately characterize functional performances which are important to practical fixturing applications, such as fixture stiffness and workpiece deflections. The stiffness and <b>deflection</b> <b>quality</b> measures are applied to optimal fixture and grasp planning, resulting in maximum-stiffness and minimum-deflection fixtures and grasps. The qualitative properties of optimal fixtures are characterized with respect to each quality measure, and efficient techniques are developed for finding such optimal fixtures. The final key issue is concerned with formal well-definedness conditions and practical development methods for rigid body kinematic metric functions, such as norms, inner products, and distance metrics. Based on an intrinsic definition of the configuration space of a rigid body, the notion of objectivity is proposed to formalize the natural requirement that metric measurements be indifferent to the observers who perform the measurements. This notion is then used to clarify the fundamental physical implications of left, right and bi-invariant functions on SE(3), and is further shown to be equivalent to the notion of frame-invariance. Based on these clarifications, several frame-invariant norms of rigid body velocities and wrenches, which have interesting physical interpretations, are defined...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to determine the}} weight, center of gravity, areal properties, and mass inertial properties for typical mirrors. A number of support conditions were considered to examine optical surface <b>deflections,</b> surface <b>quality,</b> and fundamental natural frequency for single- and double-arch mirror shapes. Structural performance estimates were made with the NASTRAN program, and optical performances were evaluated with the FRINGE program, using an SXA 40 -in mirror. To show the behavior of element types from the NASTRAN program, finite element validity and sensitivity studies were performed in optical model applications. Material parameters, contoured back shapes, and support locations are shown to have significant effects on structural and optical performances. Optimal support locations and support points are given. Fundamental natural frequencies for some shapes are found with the closed-form solution. The plate models results may not be acceptable for determining real mirror optical performances...|$|R
40|$|Intraocular lens(IOL) {{often has}} {{different}} degrees of tilt, decentration and rotation in the eye. The deflection of IOL {{is an important factor}} to impact on the visual quality of the patients with cataract surgeries. Vision was commonly used to evaluate visual quality before. In recent years, some new methods are also introduced to evaluate visual quality, such as optical aberration, modulation transfer function(MTF) and subjective visual perception. They show that the IOL deflection will cause decreases in eyesight and MTF, cause increase in aberration, lead to ametropia and so on. Therefore, a better evaluation of the effects of IOL <b>deflection</b> on visual <b>quality,</b> has significance for IOL selection, positioning and cataract individualized treatment...|$|R
40|$|Several {{analytical}} {{models can}} be used to predict the propagation of bending waves in the track/embankment system. A model of a Euler beam on a Winkler foundation is studied and used to demonstrate how the magnitude of displacements are dependent on train speed and track damping. The methods by which the model parameters may be calculated are discussed and their relative advantages and disadvantages are considered. From this study it is possible to form practical suggestions on methods by which the design of rail tracks can be adjusted to limit the maximum transient deflections as a train passes. This paper compares results from a predictive method with the results of in-situ assessments. INRODUCTION One method to reduce the visibility and noise pollution caused by high-speed rail lines it is convenient to limit the height of the embankments. However, these smaller embankments tend to be flexible and, hence, on soft ground, track-soil bending waves may result in significant transient train-induced soil <b>deflections.</b> Ride <b>quality</b> and maintenance costs have a direct relationship to the magnitude of these deflections and, hence, there is a requirement for their accurate prediction. Several analytical models {{can be used}} to predict the propagation of bending waves in th...|$|R
40|$|Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has {{implemented}} a pavement rehabilitation design approach {{that attempts to}} utilize pavement evaluation data and current pavement design procedures. There are numerous different mechanisms and testing equipment currently utilized to evaluate the existing structural and functional condition of roadway pavements. In the same manner, {{there are many different}} analysis approaches and design theories that are used in the pavement industry to develop the pavement design strategies for new roadways and the rehabilitation of existing roadways. The majority of the pavement rehabilitation design approaches are based primarily on test site empirical equations or on the experience of the individuals responsible for the construction management of the project. In addition, most of the known existing rehabilitation design approaches do not typically utilize current pavement evaluation techniques to assist in rehabilitation design. MDSHA utilizes pavement evaluation data collected from <b>deflection</b> testing, ride <b>quality</b> testing, surface friction testing, ground-penetrating radar testing, and pavement surface distress testing to {{contribute to the development of}} our pavement rehabilitation strategies. The pavement evaluation data collected is used along with the procedures in the “ 1993 AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures ” to develo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary mission and system {{analysis of a}} small-scale, light-weight system for the deflection, manipulation and exploitation of small size asteroids. The system proposed in this paper, called Light-Touch 2, uses lasers to ablate the surface of an asteroid and induce a low thrust modification of its orbit. The system {{is applied to the}} deflection of a small size asteroid, 2 - 4 m in diameter, 130 tons in mass. It will be demonstrated that a laser system powered by conventional solar arrays can produce enough thrust to change the velocity of the asteroid by 1 m/s in less than 3 years. The current mission and system design to implement the Light-Touch 2 concept envisage the use of a small class spacecraft, called AdAM (Asteroid Ablation Mission), which will fly in formation with the asteroid and apply laser ablation for a suitably long time. In the paper, the Light-Touch 2 concept is compared against other known contactless <b>deflection</b> systems. Assessed <b>qualities</b> include momentum coupling and mass efficiency. The system and mission analysis will also be complemented by navigation analysis. A combination of ground-based and onboard optical measurements will be used to provide the required accuracy to fly in formation with the asteroid and to measure the deflection. The paper will therefore present the preliminary spacecraft system analysis and the preliminary transfer and navigation analysis...|$|R
