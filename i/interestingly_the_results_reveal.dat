40|$|Management of IS employees' {{turnover}} {{has been}} one of the important areas of research in the IS discipline. Prior IS studies have focused on personality factors that differentiate IS personnel from non-IS personnel. Unlike prior studies, this study examines job contextual factors that may be salient in IS personnel turnover. Seven variables that have been frequently employed as determinants of turnover intention in prior studies were compared across different job contexts. These seven variables are role conflict, role ambiguity, job alternatives, interpersonal conflict with colleagues within a team, interpersonal conflict with colleagues outside a team, burnout, and career plateau. A total of 209 responses obtained from employees in different job contexts were analyzed. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>reveal</b> that IS and non-IS personnel have statistically similar levels of perceptions on these variables. In addition, we investigated differences between the behavioral models of turnover intention for IS and non-IS personnel. The results indicate that role conflict and interpersonal conflict with colleagues outside a team have a higher influence on turnover intention for IS personnel compared to non-IS personnel. Based on the results, the paper discusses the implications of the findings and provides directions for future research. close 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{downlink}} {{problem of a}} cloud-based central station (CCS) to multiple base stations (BSs) in a heterogeneous cellular network sharing {{the same time and}} frequency resources. We adopt non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and propose power allocation for the wireless downlink in the heterogeneous cloud radio access network (HCRAN). Taking into account practical channel modelling with power consumptions at BSs of different cell types (e. g. macro-cell, micro-cell, etc.) and backhauling power, we analyse the energy efficiency (EE) of the practical HCRAN utilising NOMA. Simulation results indicate that the proposed NOMA for the HCRAN outperforms the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme in terms of providing higher EE of up to four times. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>reveal</b> a fact that the EE of the NOMA approach is not always an increasing function of the number of BSs but varies as a quasiconcave function. This motivates us to further introduce an optimisation problem to find the optimal number of BSs that maximises the EE of the HCRAN. It is shown that, with a low power supply at the CCS, a double number of micro BSs can be served by HCRAN providing an improved EE of up to 1. 6 times compared to the macro BSs and RRHs, while they achieve the same EE performance with high-power CCS...|$|E

Recent studies have provided evidence that a night of sleep plays a similar functional role following motor imagery (MI), while the simple passage of time does not result in performance gains. Here, we examined {{the benefits of a}} daytime nap on motor memory consolidation after MI practice. Participants were trained by MI on an explicitly known sequence of finger movements at 11 : 00. Half of the participants were then subjected (at 14 : 00) to either a short nap (10 min of stage 2 sleep) or a long nap (60 - 90 min, including slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep). We also collected data from both quiet and active rest control groups. All participants remained in the lab until being retested at 16 : 00. The data revealed that a daytime nap after imagery practice improved motor performance and, therefore, facilitated motor memory consolidation, as compared with spending a similar time interval in <b>the</b> wake state. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> that both short and long naps resulted in similar delayed performance gains.

40|$|International audiencePerceptual {{properties}} of odorant mixtures {{are assumed to}} result from interactions occurring {{at different stages of}} odour processing. Peripheral mechanisms have been proposed {{to play an important role}} in the processing of mixture information. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the responses of several human olfactory receptors (ORs) to aldehyde binary mixtures containing various ratios of either octanal and citronellal or octanal and methional. Receptor responses were measured by calcium imaging using HEK 293 cells transfected with ORs. Responses to octanal+citronellal mixtures were almost always found to be lower than the sum of single compound responses (hypo-addition). For one OR (OR 1 A 1), octanal was even found to extinguish the receptor response altogether, suggesting strong competition mechanisms. In contrast, OR activation by octanal+methional mixtures was hyper-additive. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> that (i) <b>the</b> interaction pattern was largely influenced by the nature and ratio of the mixed odorants whatever the OR and (ii) the interaction pattern depended on the OR response patterns to single odorants. These findings provide some insight into the phenomena that may occur at the periphery of the olfactory system. Moreover, since OR responses are partially reconcilable with human integrated odour responses, this highlights the critical role of peripheral events in the encoding of natural odours.

40|$|AbstractPrototypical {{defective}} interfering (DI) RNAs of the plus-strand RNA virus tomato bushy stunt virus contain four noncontiguous segments (regions I–IV) {{derived from}} the viral genome. Region I corresponds to 5 ′-noncoding sequence, regions II and III are derived from internal positions, and region IV represents a 3 ′-terminal segment. We analyzed the internally located region III in a prototypical DI RNA to understand better its role in DI RNA accumulation. Our results indicate that (1) region III is not essential for DI RNA accumulation, but molecules that lack it accumulate at significantly reduced levels (∼ 10 -fold lower), (2) region III is able to function at different positions and in opposite orientations, (3) a single copy of region III is favored over multiple copies, (4) the stimulatory effect observed on DI RNA accumulation is not due to region III-mediated RNA stabilization, (5) DI RNAs lacking region III permit the efficient accumulation of head-to-tail dimers and are less effective at suppressing helper RNA accumulation, and (6) negative-strand accumulation is also significantly depressed for DI RNAs lacking region III. Collectively, these results support a role for region III as an enhancer-like element that facilitates DI RNA replication. A scanning-type mutagenesis strategy was used to define portions of region III important for its stimulatory effect on DI RNA accumulation. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> several differences in the requirements for activity when region III was in the forward versus the reverse orientation.

40|$|Studies {{of complex}} {{networks}} has provided new grounds {{to the understanding}} of evolutionary dynamics [1, 2]. Models for evolutionary games have traditionally assumed that players imitate their successful neighbours by comparison of payoffs [3, 4]. In this paper for two-strategy evolutionary games in structured populations, we follow a different approach, bypassing the requirement for explicit knowledge about the exact payoffs, by encoding the payoffs into the willingness of any player to switch from her current strategy to the competing one. Theoretical computations and numerical simulations show that the evolutionary dynamics are intrinsically regulated by contact relationships specified by the network topologies of the populations. In particular, when each player plays simultaneously against all her nearest neighbors, competing strategies can easily coexist even when one strategy dominates the other in each base game. More <b>interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> further <b>reveals</b> that <b>the</b> frequencies of the coexisting strategies can be calculated analytically.

For instance, the empirical findings indicate that the amount charged as insurance premium and the frequency of payments significantly affect weather index-based crop insurance coverage and uptake. Higher amounts seem to discourage participation and take-up. Similarly, the more informed consumers are about crop insurance, the greater their chances of participating and the higher their demand. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> also <b>reveal</b> that households with more access to formal credit facilities showed higher participation and greater take-up rates.

40|$|Student Number : 0500547 G - PhD thesis - School of Psychology - Faculty of HumanitiesThis {{study is}} aimed at {{understanding}} the role of assault severity, personality traits and rape myths in predicting rape victims’ psychological responses and coping styles. Specifically, the study assessed the mediating role of victims’ attribution in predicting psychological impacts of rape victimization and the coping styles. On the basis of theory, it was postulated that the severity of assault (as determined by either the use of physical force and/or the presence of weapons); intrapersonal resources of hardiness; and the acceptance of rape myths would have a direct influence on survivors’ psychological impact and on coping. The thesis provides comprehensive coverage of the prevalence of rape victimization; the trauma and psychological impacts of rape victimization; coping with rape victimization; and the theory {{on the role of}} social cognition (appraisal and attribution) in explaining victims’ responses to rape. The theoretical conceptualisation underpinning the study offers a unique integration of this body of knowledge within the South African context. In investigating the research question, two hundred and fifty adult black (African) South African women who had experienced rape in the previous month were interviewed about the event and their subsequent responses. The interviewees were drawn from Xhosa, SePedi and Zulu speaking communities. The study was located within the quantitative research tradition. A structured interview questionnaire was developed. Descriptive statistics were calculated and the emphasis of the analysis was {{in the area of the}} Structural Equation Model. The model was successful in terms of explained variance in accounting for the two types of coping; approach and avoidance coping dimensions followed by the psychological impact and attribution. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> showed psychological impact as explained through the symptoms of Hyperarousal, Intrusion and Avoidance had the greatest influence on coping of rape survivors. As hypothesized, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> confirmed that an increase in rape assaults severity resulted into increased levels of psychological distress. The findings indicated that internal styles of self-blame attribution (behavioural and characterological attribution) were prevalent among victims of rape in the present study. Although hardiness (commitment and control) dimensions were not found to significantly influence coping, an orientation of control and commitment amongst survivors was found to significantly influence the attribution styles. Furthermore, the control dimension was found to have a significant influence on victims’ psychological distress. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> that acceptance of rape myths among survivors resulted in a decrease in psychological distress. The findings demonstrate the strength of the current study in the development and testing of theoretically based models of processing rape victimization recovery among rape survivors.

From the empirical analysis, I find the endogenous income propagation effect <b>resulting</b> from <b>the</b> household waste treatments induced by unit household consumption (one million yen) was remarkably small, {{as compared to}} that for ordinary commodity productions. I also find that the contribution of industrial and household waste treatment and recycling activities to the 1995 Japanese economy was about one trillion yen (0. 1 % {{of the gross domestic}} output), considering the endogenous income propagation effects induced by the consumption behaviour of labours engaging in <b>the</b> waste treatments. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> empirical <b>results</b> <b>reveal</b> that <b>the</b> contribution of one ton of the industrial waste to the Japanese economy was 5, 730 yen, while one ton of the household waste brought about 8, 266 yen of total economic impact.

These are based on pURI 2 and pURI 3 expression vectors which have been previously used for the successful production of recombinant proteins at the milligram scale. The newly designed vectors combines two different promoters (lppp- 5 and T 7 RNA polymerase Ø 10), two different endoprotease recognition sites for the His 6 -tag removal (enterokinase and tobacco etch virus), different antibiotic selectable markers (ampicillin and erythromycin resistance), and different placements of the His 6 -tag (N- and C-terminus). A single gene can be cloned and further expressed in the eight pURI vectors by using six nucleotide primers, avoiding the restriction enzyme and ligation steps. A unique NotI site was introduced to facilitate {{the selection of the}} recombinant plasmid. As a case study, the new vectors have been used to clone the gene coding for the phenolic acid decarboxylase from Lactobacillus plantarum. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> obtained <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> markedly different production levels of the target protein, emphasizing the relevance of the cloning strategy on soluble protein production yield.

40|$|Mechanical loads play {{a pivotal}} role in the growth and {{maintenance}} of bone and joints. Although loading can activate anabolic genes and induce bone remodeling, damping is essential for preventing traumatic bone injury and fracture. In this study we investigated the damping capacity of bone, joint tissue, muscle, and skin using a mouse hindlimb model of enhanced loading in conjunction with finite element modeling to model bone curvature. Our hypothesis was that loads were primarily absorbed by the joints and muscle tissue, but that bone also contributed to damping through its compression and natural bending. To test this hypothesis, fresh mouse distal lower limb segments were cyclically loaded in axial compression in sequential bouts, with each subsequent bout having less surrounding tissue. A finite element model was generated to model effects of bone curvature in silico. Two damping-related parameters (phase shift angle and energy loss) were determined from the output of <b>the</b> loading experiments. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> that <b>the</b> knee joint contributed to the largest portion of the damping capacity of the limb, and bone itself accounted for approximately 38 % of the total phase shift angle. Computational results showed that normal bone curvature enhanced the damping capacity of the bone by approximately 40 %, and the damping effect grew at an accelerated pace as curvature was increased. Although structural curvature reduces critical loads for buckling in beam theory, evolution apparently favors maintaining curvature in the tibia. Histomorphometric analysis of the tibia revealed that in response to axial loading, bone formation was significantly enhanced in the regions that were predicted to receive a curvature-induced bending moment. These results suggest that in addition to bone's compressive damping capacity, surrounding tissues, as well as naturally-occurring bone curvature, also contribute to mechanical damping, which may ultimately affect bone remodeling and bone quality.

40|$|This is an {{open access}} journal {{available}} at [URL] Researchers have demonstrated {{that a variety of}} visual factors, such as the colour and balance of the elements on a plate, can influence a diner’s perception of, and response to, food. Here, we report on a study designed to assess whether placing the culinary elements of a dish in an art-inspired manner would modify the diner’s expectations and hence their experience of food. The dish, a salad, was arranged in one of three different presentations: One simply plated (with all of the elements of the salad tossed together), another with the elements arranged to look like one of Kandinsky’s paintings, and a third arrangement in which the elements were organized in a neat (but non-artistic) manner. The participants answered two questionnaires, one presented prior to and the other after eating the dish, to evaluate their expectations and actual sensory experience. Results: Prior to consumption, <b>the</b> art-inspired presentation <b>resulted</b> in <b>the</b> food being considered as more artistic, more complex, and more liked than either of the other presentations.

40|$|This study aims to make {{theoretical}} and methodological contributions to knowledge by examining how change is managed {{and to what}} extent employees at the Ministry of Interior in the UAE are ready to lead and implement change initiatives. The UAE has nowadays become synonymous with change. The fast growing pace of change is transforming the UAE landscape and the MOI needs to be prepared to implement changes in order to be competitive and comply with the government’s Excellence Vision for 2021. This research addresses aspects of change management and readiness for change within a context which is under-researched in the UAE. It examines how change is managed by assessing the level of readiness for change. Although there is vast literature on change management and many studies have investigated change models and initiatives, this topic still generates plenty of interest and is under-researched in the Arab world and in particular in the UAE public sector. Change management is viewed as imperative and inevitable for the survival and success of an organisation. The extensive literature has revealed that there is no single approach to change management—what works or fits best depends on the organisational and cultural settings which have a direct impact on the success rate of the change project. In general, the change management theories and models appear to be rather abstract and too broad. Although they offer some guidance on how change can effectively be managed, they fall short on supporting their claims with concrete empirical evidence. In addition, there is little research on the drivers or leaders of organisational change and the expertise and know how required to lead the organisation to successful change. In addition, change models and theories tend to overlap and correlate highly with each other. Based {{on the nature of the}} problem and research questions, a predominately positivist paradigm has been selected by this study. However, a mixed method approach is adopted to enhance the effectiveness of this study combining both qualitative and quantitative which help support each other and compensate for each other’s weaknesses, thus providing fresh insights and an in-depth understanding of the topic under investigation. The main findings of the study suggest employees are in general satisfied with the way change has been managed within <b>the</b> MOI. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> also <b>reveal</b> that most change initiatives have not generated a consensus or a united front of satisfaction but feelings of discontent and negative reactions were voiced from several individuals who perceived that the way aspects of change were handled lacked a sense of purpose and inadequate preparation. This minority of employees is not clear about the organisation’s strategic vision of the change, showing signs of resistance. This uncertainty is considered as a critical barrier to the change efforts initiated by the MOI leadership to enhance its performance and deliver quality service. The research contributes towards the change management debate by expanding the academic literature and the findings of this study have practical implications. They provide the MOI with the key mechanisms on how to prioritise and prepare for the different phases of change management activities to address the requirements of the development agenda. This study also helps to raise awareness of the decision makers about the flaws and shortcomings of the current change management practices within the MOI. Finally the findings of this study will enable the development of a change management programme and strategy tailored for the MOI and made by the MOI change management experts...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of everyday financial instruments {{is an important}} dimension of modern life, and credit cards {{are considered to be}} the main instruments and facilitators of spending in modern economies. Together with the Internet, which facilitates the spending process, credit cards have become essential instruments of spending. In response to this, and due to the expansion of Islamic banking and finance, the Islamic equivalent of credit cards (Islamic credit cards or ICCs) have been engineered with their own sophisticated financing methods alongside conventional credit cards (CCCs). Malaysia is one of the pioneering countries in Islamic finance and has developed a number of ICC products. This study aims to analyse the two main aspects of credit cards, namely, the selection criteria and the impact of credit cards in Malaysia in general, as well as the difference between ICCs and CCCs in particular. The selection criteria are investigated in terms of various factors, including those that explain the first motivation for credit card holding, selection factors influenced by the credit cards’ embedded features, the difference between the satisfaction and the loyalty level of CCC holders as compared to ICC holders, the customers’ perceptions of ICCs, an investigation into whether ICCs are perceived as being inferior to CCCs, religious commitments of ICC holders as opposed to CCC holders, and how the socio-demographic characteristics may have deterministic power over the holding of ICCs and CCCs. The impact of credit cards is investigated through their usage as well as the perceptions of the credit card holders. In conducting the research, this study assembled primary data from Malaysia through a questionnaire survey with 507 participants. In addition, interviews with financiers or bankers, Shari’ah scholars, economists, and cardholders were conducted to verify <b>the</b> <b>results</b> that were established through a quantitative data analysis of the questionnaire. The findings of this study, inter alia, indicate that Malaysian cardholders are found as perceiving credit card selection factors not much differently than individuals in other nations. ‘Protection’ and ‘convenience’ appear to be {{on the top of the}} selection list, while ‘reputation’ is in the lowest rank. Furthermore, in investigating the selection attributes, ICC holders were found to value religious factors more highly than in comparison with CCC holders. It was also revealed that ICC holders were less satisfied with having a credit card but they were more loyal than CCC holders. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> also <b>revealed</b> that ICC holders perceived ICCs to be more Islamic than CCC holders, although, in an overall evaluation, ICCs were perceived as inferior to CCCs by ICC holders. It should be noted that the religious commitments among the ICC holders were also higher than those of the CCC holders. Furthermore, the ‘ethnicity’ and ‘religion’ of the socio-demographic variables appear to be significantly related to the holding type. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>reveal</b> that religious factors are more influential in the selection process of the ICC holders as compared to CCC holders. In terms of determining the impact of credit cards, the study indicates five determining factors for Malaysian revolving credit cardholders, namely, ‘education’, ‘income’, ‘credit behaviour’, ‘car loan’, and ‘number of credit cards held’. A further analysis to determine the impact between sixteen usage and perception variables with holding type indicates that ICC holders suffer a less negative impact for the use of credit cards in comparison with CCC holders. There is also a higher agreement among respondents in believing that credit card companies use aggressive strategies and misleading advertisements. Importantly, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> also indicate that there is, in reality, no obvious difference between ICC and CCC issuers in marketing their credit cards. It should also be noted that the respondents indicate rationality in their thinking, as the majority admit that widespread credit card debt is due to their self-attitude. This study is useful for various parties, including customers, to examine how credit cards can create financial difficulty. It will also aid financial issuers in understanding the attitudes and perceptions of cardholders, hence, allowing a better strategy in structuring their credit cards. Policy makers, on the other hand, will be able to use it as a guide in implementing policies to curb credit card debt from proliferating. ...|$|R

To this respect, diet has been considered to be a determinant of ageing process. In order to better illustrate this, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model and fed them orally with different concentrations of two commonly used Indian medicinal plant products, Curcuma longa (rhizome) and Emblica officinalis (fruit). <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>revealed</b> significant increase in life span of Drosophila flies on exposure to both the plant products, more efficiently by C. Longa than by E. officinalis. In order to understand whether the increase in lifespan was due to high-antioxidant properties of these medicinal plants, we performed enzymatic assays to assess the SOD and catalase activities in case of both treated and control Drosophila flies. <b>Interestingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> support <b>the</b> free radical theory of aging as both these plant derivatives show high reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities...|$|R
