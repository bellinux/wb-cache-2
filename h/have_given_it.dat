5|$|According to some authors, {{the name}} killer whale is a {{mistranslation}} of the 18th century Spanish name asesina-ballenas which means literally whale killer. Basque whalers would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> such name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe {{to the idea that}} they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E

25|$|Planetary {{scientist}} Erik Asphaug {{has suggested}} that Quaoar may have collided with a much larger body, stripping the lower-density mantle from Quaoar, and leaving behind the denser core. He envisions that Quaoar was originally covered by a mantle of ice that made it 300 to 500 kilometers bigger than it is today, and that it collided with another Kuiper-belt body about twice its size—an object roughly the diameter of Pluto (or even approaching the size of Mars), possibly Pluto itself. This model was made assuming Quaoar actually had a density of 4.2g/cm3, but more-recent estimates <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> a more Pluto-like density of only 2g/cm3, with no more need for the collision theory.|$|E

25|$|Sun News Network (commonly {{shortened}} to Sun News) was a Canadian English language Category C {{news channel}} owned by Québecor Média through {{a partnership between}} two of its subsidiaries, TVA Group (which maintained 51% majority ownership of the company) and Sun Media Corporation (which held the remaining 49% interest). The channel was launched on April 18, 2011 in standard and high definition and shut down February 13, 2015. It operated under a Category 2 (later classified as Category C) licence granted by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in November 2010, after the network aborted a highly publicized attempt for a Category 1 licence (later classified as Category A) that would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> mandatory access on digital cable and satellite providers across Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} Birmingham's {{politics in the}} post-war era was the loss of much of city's independence. World War II had seen a huge expansion {{in the role of}} central government in British life, and this pattern continued into the post-war years: for Birmingham, this meant major decisions about the city's future tended to be made outside the city, mainly in Westminster. Planning, development and municipal functions were increasingly dictated by national policy and legislation; council finances came to be dominated by central government subsidies; and institutions such as gas, water and transport were taken out of the city's control. Birmingham's unrivalled size and wealth may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> more political influence than any other provincial city, but like all such cities it was essentially subordinate to Whitehall; the days of Birmingham as a semi-autonomous city-state, with its leading citizens dictating the agenda of national politics, were over.|$|E
25|$|While Eliot was in Europe, he {{was again}} {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} enter the world of active business. The Merrimack Company, one of the largest textile mills in the United States, tendered him an invitation to become its superintendent. In spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of $5000 (plus a good house, rent free), Eliot, after giving considerable thought to the offer, turned it down. One of his biographers speculated that he surely realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration. This post would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> scope. He must have felt, even if dimly, that if science interested him, it was not because he was first and last a lover of her laws and generalizations, not only because the clarity and precision of science was congenial, but because science answered the questions of practical men and conferred knowledge and power upon those who would perform the labors of their generation.|$|E

500|$|In the series, {{the world}} has been divided among sixteen rival {{families}} who run their territories in a feudal system.

500|$|The story {{contains}} many autobiographical elements, {{and the character}} of Olivero owes much to Read's experiences as {{an officer in the}} British Army during the First World War. The novel was positively received, although some commentators have considered it to be [...] "inscrutable", and one has suggested that it has been so differently and vaguely interpreted by those who <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> serious study that it may lack the form and content to justify the praise it has received.|$|E
500|$|Gibraltar's {{geography}} {{has thus}} given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It {{is virtually impossible}} to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around Europa Point is surrounded by cliffs which are up to [...] high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> an enormous military significance over the centuries.|$|E

500|$|... "Mother Simpson" [...] {{is one of}} Oakley and Weinstein's {{favorite}} episodes; {{they have}} called it a perfect combination of real emotion, good jokes, and an interesting story. In 1996, [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] was submitted for the Emmy Award in the [...] "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)" [...] category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which they felt would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> the edge. Pinky and the Brain eventually went on to win. Bill Oakley feels that had this episode been submitted, it would have easily won. The joke about Homer apparently being familiar with Walt Whitman is one of David Silverman's favorite jokes.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of the anime series was called the [...] "masterpiece of the new season" [...] by ANN, which also complimented the musical score as [...] "understated but highly effective".

Another praised its [...] "honest and heartfelt storytelling" [...] while saying {{it would be easy to}} call the episode's pacing [...] "almost too-languid". A fourth reviewer found it to be typical of Adachi anime adaptations, but that the production values were [...] "at best, mediocre and, at times, brushing up against the marginal".|$|E
