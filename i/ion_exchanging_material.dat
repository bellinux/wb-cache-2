40|$|Wastewater {{containing}} ammonia is {{a product}} of oil refineries, coal gasification plants, slaughterhouses, dairy plants, distilleries, fertilizer plants and pharmaceutical operations; ammonia is also found in municipal wastewater. The ammonia is toxic to living organisms and it is desirable that it be removed. The foremost aim of this research was to use biologically activated <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>materials</b> for ammonia removal from wastewater. In the past sand, plastic media and activated carbon as well as some <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>materials,</b> e. g., clinoptilolite, have been used like a solid surface for bacteria growth. In this work some other materials were used for a combined biological and <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> process. The <b>materials</b> used were mordenite and Macronet MN 500 for terrestrial water, and modified zeolites for selective uptake of ammonia from marine waters. Clinoptilolite was used for comparison, as an ion exchanger which previously has been biologically activated. The ammonia adsorption characteristics of the materials in saline and non-saline synthetic wastewater were determined and compared with literature data. The data was fitted using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The effect of the individual presence of potassium, calcium and magnesium ion upon ammonium ion uptake onto each material was also investigated. Bench scale ion-exchange stirred cell experiments were conducted to assess the uptake kinetics of ammonium ion. Process parameters include: initial ammonia concentration, the agitation rate, material particle size and mass of the material. The suitability of the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>materials</b> as a support for the growth of nitrifying bacteria was determined by observing the nitrification process in the flasks containing different materials, for the fresh and saline media. The ion exchangers were tested in continuous columns initially without bacterial growth and later with. To overcome the problem of low oxygen levels in the column and to avoid over aeration of the system, a novel design of columns was introduced, where aeration through the column was achieved by the air permeable silicon tubing. The synthetic material MN 500 exhibited the highest uptake capacity but the natural zeolites had the highest preference for ammonium ions in the presence of interfering cations. The <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>materials</b> removed ammonia from saline water. A product of zeolitic nature, ZZ, exhibited the highest uptake capacity for ammonia removal from saline water. Natural zeolites were shown to be better media for bacterial growth in non-saline water. MN 500 exhibited better ammonia removal performance for the combined process in sea water compared to modified zeolite, ZZ. Both the clinoptilolite and mordenite used in non-saline medium, exhibited higher uptake capacity during the column experiments than for batch experiments. By introducing bacteria into the column, the uptake capacity was increased from the value of 0. 15 to the value of 0. 22 meq/g for clinoptilolite. The improvement for the biologically active mordenite was from the value of 0. 30 meq/g without bacteria to the value of 0. 4 meq/g with bacteria. The aeration of 2. 88 dm³/h, achieved by the tubing, provided better condition for the nitrification within the column, compared to the commonly used tank pre-aeration at the rate of 180 dm³/h. The biologically active <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> column was not efficient in removing ammonia from saline water. High salt concentrations and slower nitrification in saline medium interfered the process significantly. It could be concluded that biologically active <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> is acceptable method for ammonia removal from non-saline wastewater. The possible way to improve the efficiency of the process in saline water would be to apply it in wastewaters in with nitrifying bacteria are already established. Mordenite proved to be more adequate for biological activation compared to commonly used clinoptilolite, which indicates that more <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>materials</b> should be tested for combined process. The new aeration system within the columns proved to be more efficient compared to the commonly used tank pre-aeration...|$|R

In addition, small amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been found. These small amounts are significant from a regulatory standpoint. Ultimately, it is planned to transfer the K Basins sludge to the Hanford double shell tanks (DSTs). Chemical pretreatment is required to address criticality issues and the destruction or removal of PCBs before the K Basin sludge can be transferred to the DSTs. Eleven technologies have been evaluated (Papp 1997) as potential pretreatment methods. Based on the evaluations and engineering studies and limited testing, Fluor Daniel Hanford recommended solvent washing of the K Basin sludge, followed by nitric acid dissolution and, potentially, peroxide addition (FDH 1997). The solvent washing (extraction) and peroxide addition would be used to facilitate PCB removal and destruction.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In many applications employing particles, the distribution of particle sizes has significant influence on {{the properties of the}} resultant material. Membrane emulsification (ME) is a method for manufacturing uniformly sized emulsion droplets where a dispersed phase is forced through a membrane into the continuous phase. It is the shear applied on the membrane surface that detaches the droplets thereby generating an emulsion. Formulation of the dispersed and the continuous phase influences the final droplet size of the emulsion. Therefore one of the aims of this research is to broaden the existing knowledge on particle production by membrane emulsification using nickel microengeneered disk membrane with cylindrical pores and the Dispersion Cell. The Dispersion Cell was successfully used to produce W/O/W emulsions (the oil phase was pumpkin seed oil). Also W/O emulsions (the water phase was acidified sodium silicate) were produced and additionally solidified in order to manufacture solid silica particles with high surface area and internal porosity. The particles were additionally functionalized using 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and turned into <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material</b> capable to sorb copper. Since the silica particles do not swell such <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material</b> might be interesting for applications in nuclear industry. Having in mind an industrial application of membrane emulsification the Dispersion Cell cannot be used due to the problems with the scaling up. Therefore two novel systems: Oscillating and Pulsating were developed and reported for continuous production of the particles. Both systems were commissioned using sunflower oil for production of O/W emulsions. Additionally the Pulsating system was successfully used for production of complex coacervates. In the Oscillating system the nickel membrane was {{in the shape of a}} candle and the shear on the membrane surface was induced by vertical oscillations of the membrane. In the Pulsating system a tubular nickel membrane was used and the shear on the membrane surface was applied by oscillations of the continuous phase. The scaling up of both Oscillating and Pulsating system can be achieved by providing a larger membrane area (elongating the membrane) as well as connecting the membranes in parallel. It was successfully shown that a simple force balance can be used to model the size of emulsion droplets as a function of the shear stress. The average shear stress worked better when modelling the droplet sizes in the Dispersion Cell, but the correction for the droplet neck had to be taken into consideration when higher dispersed phase flow rates were used. In the Oscillating and Pulsating systems it was the maximal shear stress that gave the better prediction, but in both systems it was clear that additional forces were present which influenced the final droplet size. An alternative field of application for the Dispersion Cell, relevant to the tests of functionalized silica particles, was investigated. The Dispersion Cell was modified into a continuous flow stirred cell with a slotted nickel membrane on the bottom. The continuous flow stirred cell is shown to be an effective technique for both mass transfer kinetics as well as equilibrium data acquisition combining both into a single step, and simplifying <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> analysis. To commission the system the commercial <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resin (Dowex 50 W-X 8) was used. Once determined, the design parameters can readily be used to model <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> contacting in a well mixed system, column operations or any process that requires <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material.</b> Using the continuous flow stirred cell it was shown that the silica particles produced using the Dispersion Cell and functionalized using 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane were capable to sorb copper.

Today <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> processes are successfully applied for desalination of both sea water and brackish water, softening hard water, treating industrial effluents for removal of heavy metals, dyes, nitrates, ammonia and fluoride and dealkalization. In spite of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> technology advanced stage of development, various aspects remain a subject of intensive investigations in many institutes to bring about new functional materials that can tolerate various operating conditions to improve its efficiency and economy of its applications. The objective of this chapter is to review the current status of the development in <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>materials</b> and their applications in the field of water and waste water treatment. A brief encounter of the basic fundamentals of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> processes including mechanism, types of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins and systems, configurations and mode of operation are also illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Aluminosilicate zeolites {{remain the}} most widely used {{microporous}} materials for important industrial gas separation applications. Aluminophosphate molecular sieves (AlPO-n) are the first microporous materials synthesized without silica. Substitution of silica in the AlPO-n framework result in the formation of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO-n) molecular sieve. In this study, Na-SAPO- 34 zeolite was synthesized and <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> with alkali metal cations (K+ and Li+) using a two-step <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> procedure, with each step lasting for 24 hours. The prepared materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Thermal analysis was carried out using thermographymetric analyzer (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The textural properties (surface area, pore size and pore volume) were calculated from N 2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms and adsorption capacity were measured volumetrically at 273, 298 and 323 K respectively for CO 2 and at 298 K for CH 4 at pressure of 101. 3 KPa. The corresponding isosteric heats of adsorption of CO 2 was calculated using the Clausius-Claperon equation. The Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips models were applied to correlate the adsorption isotherm data. The equilibrium performance of the prepared materials for CO 2 separation from CO 2 / CH 4 mixtures operating at room temperature were calculated based on working capacity, regenerability and selectivity. The results showed that although all the prepared materials show changes in structural properties, the structure did not collapse after <b>ion</b> <b>exchange.</b> All the prepared materials showed high preference for CO 2 over CH 4. At 273 K, the 1 st stage K+ <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material</b> had the highest CO 2 adsorption capacity (2. 90 mmol/g), whereas at 323 K, the 1 st stage Li+ material had the highest capacity (1. 90 mmol/g). However, at 298 K, the adsorption capacity did not improve. The 1 st stage K+ material had highest adsorption capacity for CH 4 (0. 54 mmol/g) at 298 K. Sips model provides the best fit with experimental data. The 1 st stage K+ <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material</b> had the highest heat of adsorption reflecting stronger interaction between the extra framework cation and CO 2. Based on the adsorbent performance evaluation, all the prepared materials showed potential for CO 2 removal from CO 2 / CH 4 mixtures at room temperature {{with the exception of the}} 2 nd stage K+ <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material.</b> The lithium <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> series had higher working capacity and regenerability than the potassium <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> series at 298 K. This study showed that adsorption capacity of CO 2 and CH 4 depends not only on temperature but also on the properties of the exchangeable cation such as size, charge, location, and distribution within the channels and cavities of the prepared materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of zeolite in forms suitable for industrial applications {{is of great}} importance, mainly as <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material,</b> molecular sieves, adsorbents and catalyst. In the present investigation an effort {{has been made to}} synthesize zeolite from glaze free ceramic (inorganic) wastes (porcelain bodies) such as broken stoneware pipe and washbasin. Porcelain mainly is composed of amorphous glass phase and crystalline phases such as quartz and mullite. Most of the amorphous and crystalline phases are converted into soluble phases by alkali fusion and transformed into zeolite crystals with high specific area and unique micro-pores. The synthesized zeolites were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction...|$|R
40|$|Tank wastes at Hanford and SRS contain highly {{alkaline}} supernate solutions of conc. Na, K nitrates {{with large}} amounts of {sup 137 }Cs. It is desirable to remove and concentrate the highly radioactive fraction for vitrification. One candidate <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material</b> for removing the radiocesium is R-F resin. This report summarizes studies into synthesis and characterization of 4 -derivatized R-F resins prepared in pursuit of more chemically/oxidatively robust resin. 85 % 4 -fluororesorcinol/ 15 % phenol formaldehyde resin appears to have good stability in alkaline solution, although {{there may be some}} nucleophilic displacement reaction during synthesis; further studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical elution was {{investigated}} {{as an alternative}} method to acid elution for the desorption of cesium from loaded <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins. The approach {{was found to have}} several potential advantages over existing technologies, in particular, electrochemical elution eliminates the need for addition of chemicals to elute cesium from the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resin. Also, since, in the electrochemical elution process the eluting solution is not in direct contact with the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>material,</b> very small volumes of the eluting solution {{can be used in a}} complete recycle mode in order to minimize the total volume of the cesium elute. In addition, the cesium is eluted as an alkaline solution that does not require neutralization with caustic to meet the tank farm specifications. Other advantages include easy incorporation of the electrochemical elution process into the present cesium recovery schemes...|$|R
