40|$|It {{is often}} argued that future-directed {{decisions}} are effective at shaping our future conduct because they give rise, {{at the time}} of action, to a decisive reason to act as originally decided. In this paper, I argue that standard accounts of decision-based reasons are unsatisfactory. For they focus either on tie-breaking scenarios or cases of self-directed distal manipulation. I argue that future-directed decisions are better understood as tools for the non-manipulative, intrapersonal division of deliberative labor over time. A future-directed decision to ϕ gives rise to a defeasible exclusionary reason to ϕ. This reason is grounded on the <b>default</b> <b>authority</b> that is normally granted to one’s prior self as an “expert” deliberator. I argue that this kind of exclusionary reason {{is the only one that}} can account for the effectiveness of future-directed decisions at shaping our diachronic agency without violating our autonomy over time...|$|R

In addition to being the <b>default</b> <b>authority</b> within Egypt, al-Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments. Prior to the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom, and despite Islam's two holiest sites being located within Saudi Arabia, he asked the head sheikh of al-Azhar instead of the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the time French Minister of the Interior, requested a judgment from al-Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the hijab in French public schools, despite the existence of the French Council of Islam. The sheikh of al-Azhar provided the ruling, saying that while wearing the hijab is an [...] "Islamic duty" [...] the Muslim women of France are obligated to respect and follow French laws. The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government, and in turn the Egyptian government.|$|R

A trust signature indicates both that the key belongs to its claimed owner and that the owner of the key is trustworthy to sign other keys at one level below their own. A level 0 signature is comparable to a web of trust signature since only the validity of the key is certified. A level 1 signature is similar to the trust one has in a certificate authority because a key signed to level 1 is able to issue an unlimited number of level 0 signatures. A level 2 signature is highly analogous to the trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use the <b>default</b> certificate <b>authority</b> list (like those included in web browsers); it allows the owner of the key to make other keys certificate authorities.|$|R

40|$|Perry Yang, AdvisorTo {{speak of}} the city apart from {{agriculture}} is to deny a very real part of human wellbeing in a plethora of ways. We absolutely need both food and a connection to nature for nourishment and happiness. The problems of the city, agriculture, nature and a potential ecological crisis are dynamically interconnected. Anthropogenic climate change, or to use a more accurate term – climate chaos, {{is the result of}} a dualistic worldview that detaches man from nature. There is no name for the dominant worldview that we are currently experiencing, perhaps because we are stuck in it. However, we can name it here as the Materialist paradigm (or materialism). The Materialist paradigm is a gross societal assumption that the physical world is the extant of reality and all mental and spiritual phenomena are a result of interactions of matter within the body. Of course, not all people on earth hold this worldview as the totality of all reality, even scientists. It is, however, the <b>default</b> <b>authority</b> in government, finance, business, international relations, and social relations. It is the authority that says that there must be sufficient data to back up claims. It is the authority that says our DNA determines most of our fate. And it also says that the scientific method is favored over human emotions. The problem of materialism is not so much science itself, but it is with the simple act of looking towards the outside world for all meaning and solutions to problems. The result is to look further and further into the reaches of the universe or to look deeper and deeper into the tiniest of subatomic particles for truth. Scientists are currently looking for the ultimate reality by smashing subatomic particles together and extremely high speeds in what is known as a particle accelerator. The most advanced of these devices is called the Large Hadron Collider on the border of France and Switzerland. The collider is in search of evidence that can prove a grand unifying theory of physics that will explain the nature of the universe by finding the Higgs particle that gives mass to everything (Gleiser, 2011). This reductionist process has been extended to all things physical and social. For cities, the result has been to separate uses in a very simple manner using Euclidean Zoning. It has also resulted in a fragmented urban structure that relies on technology and massive amounts of energy to hold things together. For agriculture, the result has been to determine the minimum chemical compounds that plants need to grow and using technological means for production. The materialist paradigm has very wide reaching socio-­‐economic implications including the atomization of society, the compulsion to consume in a futile attempt to fulfill needs and globalized economies founded on consumption and debt. The very distinction of city from nature is a result of the dualistic worldview that dominates our time.

The idea is that common law precedents govern workers who are employed and managerially controlled without the requirement that formal, written contracts be established, and that these <b>defaults</b> support the <b>authority</b> of management to direct their activities within the firm. However, many firm owners voluntarily restrict their ability to control workers by making them agents. Workers who are agents differ from workers who are managerially controlled in that in the former caseworkers are treated differently in the eyes of the common law and they often sign detailed, formal employment contracts. The typical features of formal employment contracts are examined. The principal conclusion is that formal employment contracts facilitate the granting of discretion to workers by superseding many of the legal defaults that define the relationship between the worker and firm owner...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{certificate}} authority in the conventional SSL system is to vouch for {{the identity of a}} site, by checking its SSL certificate. Without some vouchsafing, one is open to a man-in-the-middle attack. A single site is vouched for by only a single certificate authority (CA), and this CA has to be trusted by the user. Web browsers typically include a list of <b>default</b> trusted certificate <b>authorities,</b> and display a warning about an [...] "untrusted connection" [...] when a site cannot be vouchsafed by a trusted CA. A problem with this system is that if a user (or browser vendor) loses trust in a CA, removing the CA from the browser's list of trusted authorities means losing trust in all the sites that used that CA. This happened when major browsers lost trust in the DigiNotar CA and sites registered with this CA had to get new certificate authorities (see Certificate authority#CA compromise for more examples of trust breaches).|$|R

The sovereign defaults tend to cluster at business-cycle frequencies, the business itself <b>defaults</b> tax <b>authority</b> payments and loan repayments, in turn all serving to creating a vicious cycle in the entire financial market. Country Risk is the major factor, indicating in the default of credit swap, and this is more intuitive, rather than taken from frequency macroeconomic data, which are highly missing in the transition economies like Albania. Country sovereign rating for Albania, assessed by the International Intelligence Agencies, historically shows that Albania is a risky country and that is why the Foreign Direct Investments had been in a moderate level through the time. Beyond borrowing in foreign currency from Albanian Government, accompanied by a devaluation of national currency during crises, the higher debt service cost has contributed in a comparably lower level of Foreign Debt. Notwithstanding the positive developments in the country, the Albanian market economy, it is still far from being a stable & developed one in a longer term, and be considered as an attractive country for foreign investments. The global economic crises revealed real problems of the economy, by showing that positive trends of GDP growth, during the first years, failed to create an essential and steady base for a sustainable development. The {{sovereign credit}} risk is a combined product of many country-specific factors, and also global ones, which in turn should be diminished by installing and applying modern portfolio diversification methods...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Treasury {{estimates}} {{that more than}} $ 14 billion annually is spent on the concessional taxation of superannuation. However, none of these funds flow to low income earners. Conversely, low income earners are the income group most likely to require retirement pension support and who thus hold the greatest capacity to benefit the tax concession investment. This thesis explores {{the question of whether}} Australia’s concessional taxation of superannuation is consistent with Adam Smith’s theory of an effective method of taxation which impounds equity, efficiency and simplicity. The research was performed by analysing sample data from the capital markets in order to construct a portfolio modelled on APRA’s (Australian Prudential Regulation <b>Authority)</b> <b>default</b> style. An estimation was then made of the likely future value of an individual superannuation account subject to the tax concession impact. The research has found that not only does the tax concession impact skew the future value of the individual superannuation account but that it also creates a fundamental distortion to the risk/return profile of the investment...|$|R

40|$|Chapters 2 - 3 : A global games {{approach}} to sovereign debt crises The first chapters present {{a model that}} investigates the risks involved when a fiscal authority attempts to roll-over a stock of debt {{and there is the}} potential for coordination failure by investors. A continuum of investors, after receiving signals about the authority's willingness to repay, decides whether to roll-over the stock of debt. If an insufficient proportion of investors participates, the <b>authority</b> <b>defaults.</b> With one fiscal authority, private information results in a deterministic outcome. When a public signal is available, the model behaves in a similar manner to a sunspot model. In line with much of the global games literature, improving public information has an ambiguous effect on welfare. Finally, the model is extended to include a second fiscal authority, which captures a similar sunspot result and illustrates the potential for externalities in fiscal policy. Lower debt in the less indebted authority can push a more indebted authority into crisis. Lower debt makes the healthier authority relatively more attractive, which causes the investors to treat the heavily indebted authority more conservatively. In certain circumstances, this is sufficient to cause a coordination failure. Chapter 4 : A debt game with correlated information This chapter models of debt roll-over where a continuum of investors receives correlated signals on whether a debtor is solvent or insolvent. The investors face a collective action problem: a sufficient proportion of investors must agree to participate in the debt roll-over for it to be a success. If an insufficient proportion of investors participates in the deal, the debtor will default. The game has a unique switching strategy, which results in global uncertainty being preserved. The ex ante distribution of play (conditional on the true solvency of the debtor) follows a Vasicek credit distribution. The ex ante probability of a debt crisis is affected by the exogenous model parameters. Of particular interest is the observation that increasing private noise unambiguously reduces the probability of a debt crisis. Unsurprisingly, increasing the fiscal space or return on debt also decreases the probability of a crisis. Chapter 5 : Bailouts and politics The final chapter examines the political-economic equilibrium in a two-period model with overlapping generations and a financial sector, which is inspired by the model in Tabellini (1989). The public policy is chosen under majority rule by the agents currently alive. It demonstrates that the bailout policy adopted in the second period has important effects on the bank's financing decisions in the first period. By adopting a riskier financing regime (i. e. higher leverage) in the first period, the older generation can extract consumption from the younger generation in the second period. Sovereign backstops of the financial sector are state-contingent: they can appear costless {{for long periods of time}} but eventually result in a socialization of private-sector debt. It is this mechanism that makes implementing capital requirements costly to investors yet beneficial to the younger generation. The model also highlights two important issues: (i) bank capital is endogenous and (ii) proposed resolution mechanisms must be politically credible. It suggests that a major benefit of increasing and narrowing equity-capital requirements or increasing liquidity ratios is that they are implemented ex ante and therefore available either to absorb losses in the event of a crisis or to reduce the possibility of large drops in asset values. Finally, this chapter also provides a structure by which to interpret the stylized facts of Calomiris et al. (2014) : that more populist political institutions are associated with more fragile financial systems. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R
