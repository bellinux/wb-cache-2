40|$|Propósito: Evaluar la correlación entre la ocurrencia de Restricción al Crecimiento Intrauterino (RCIU), RCIU selectivo (RCIUs) y Síndrome de Transfusión Feto-Fetal (STFF) y las características de la {{placenta}} en la gestación doble monocorial (GDM). Estimar cuál es la importancia de los hallazgos ecográficos y Doppler. Material y métodos: Entre enero del 2005 y enero de 2008 fueron evaluados 8 GDM. La corionicidad fue determinada con ecografía en el 1 º trimestre. Se realizaron seguimientos ecográficos evaluando cantidad de líquido amniótico, vejiga, peso fetal y Doppler de vasos fetales. Al nacimiento se tiñeron los vasos placentarios con colorantes no vitales y se evaluó la presencia y tipo de anastomosis, la distribución de los territorios y la calidad de inserción del cordón umbilical (CU) sea central (C), marginal (M) o velamentosa (V). Resultados: Seguimiento ecográfico: discrepancia de peso > 25 % (RCIUs) (n= 3); peso de ambos fetos &# 8804; percentil 3 (RCIU) (n= 1); signo ecográfico de STFF (n= 1); normales (n= 3). Seguimiento con Doppler: Flujo Ausente/Reverso intermitente (FA/Ri) en arteria umbilical (AU) (n= 4); signos de insuficiencia placentaria en AU (n= 3); normales (n= 2). Complicaciones perinatales evaluadas: STFF (n= 1); RCIUs (n= 2); RCIU (n= 1); ninguna (n= 4). Territorios placentarios: distribución igual (n= 6); distribución desigual (n= 2). Inserción del CU: ambos M (n= 3); ambos C (n= 2); una C y otra M(n= 2); una M y otra V (n= 1). Anastomosis vasculares: presencia de anastomosis arterio-arteriales (AAA) y anastomosis arterio-venosas (AAV) en ambas direcciones (n= 6); presencia de AAA y AAV en una dirección (n= 1); presencia de AAV en una dirección sin AAA(n= 1). El STFF se relacionó con ausencia de AAA y presencia de AV en una dirección. Los signos de insuficiencia placentaria en AU se dieron en los casos de RCIU. Los 2 RCIUs presentaron desigual distribución del territorio placentario. Conclusión: Las anastomosis vasculares están presentes en todas las GDM. Las anomalías de inserción del CU son frecuentes en GDM. En la GDM el RCIUs se relaciona con distribución desigual del territorio placentario. La presencia de FA/Ri en la AU de un feto sugiere la presencia de AAA, las que impedirían un STFF. Objective: To correlate {{between the}} appearence of <b>Intrauterine</b> Fetal <b>Growth</b> Restriction (IFGR), Selective <b>Intrauterine</b> Fetal <b>Growth</b> Restriction (SIFGR), Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) and macroscopic findings of placentas in Monochorionic Twin Gestations. To determine {{the importance of}} ultrasound and Doppler findings. Materials and methods: Between January 2005 and January 2008 we diagnosed 8 monochorionic twin pregnancies. Chorionicity was determined with first trimester ultrasound screening. Follow-up scans were done to assess amniotic fluid volume, bladders, fetal weight and fetal Doppler ultrasound. Alter delivery, we cannulated and dyed umbilical arteries and veins in order to characterise vascular anastomoses. We also evaluated distribution of the placenta plate, and type of cord insertion (central, marginal or velamentous). Results: Follow-up scans revealed: 3 cases with selective <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> restriction (SIFGR); 1 case with <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> restriction (IFGR); 1 case with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS); and 3 normal pregnancies. Follow-up Doppler scans revealed: 4 cases with intermittent absent/reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow; 3 cases with signs of placental insufficiency; and 2 normal cases. Perinatal outcome: 1 case of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS); 2 cases of selective <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> restriction (SIFGR); 1 case of <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> restriction (IFGR); 4 healthy cases. Visual inspection of placental plate: equal placental sharing (6 cases); unequal placental sharing (2 cases). Types of cord insertion: both fetuses with marginal cord insertion (3 cases); both fetuses with central insertion (2 cases); one fetus with central {{and the other one}} with marginal insertion (2 cases); one fetus with marginal insertion and the other one with velamentous insertion (1 case). Vascular anastomoses: 6 cases presented arterio-arterial ansatomoses (AAA) and arterio-venous anastomoses (AVA) in both directions; 1 case showed AAA and AVA in only one direction; another case showed AVA in one direction without AAA. The only case of TTTS was related to the presence of AVA in one direction and the absence of AAA. Signs of placental insufficiency were seen in the case of <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> restriction (IFGR). Both cases of SIFGR showed unequal placental distribution. Conclusions: Vascular anastomoses are present in all cases of monochorionic twin gestations. anomalies in the cord insertion are frequent in this type of pregnancies. Selective <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> restriction is related to unequal distribution of the placental plate. Intermittent absent/reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow in one of the fetuses suggests there are arterioarterial anastomoses, which are supposed to protect against twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Undernutrition during pregnancy, {{and other}} factors, may cause <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> {{retardation}} (IUGR), {{which is one}} cause of low birth weight. However, {{it has been suggested}} that in IUGR the brain may be selectively spared. Brain growth is usually less affected than whole body weight or length. Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> retardation also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in adolescence or adulthood. For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas. This was later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18–19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas. The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES), whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES. Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.|$|E

Trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, cardiovascular, renal and spine malformations, along with a delay in mental and physical development. Valproate has anti-folate effects, leading to neural tube closure-related defects such as spina bifida.

This might be because of the nitric oxide pathway that controls the vascular tone. Increased uterine arterial resistance triggers higher sensitivity to vasoconstriction and subsequently chronic placental ischemia and oxidative stress, which cause <b>intrauterine</b> fetal <b>growth</b> retardation (FGR) and death.

Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly.

25|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{clonazepam}} during pregnancy {{is less clear}} than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> retardation, functional deficits, floppy infant syndrome, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, cyanosis, suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and growth retardation. This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or breast feeding, {{it is recommended that}} serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.|$|E

Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy. Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, diabetes, <b>intrauterine</b> <b>growth</b> retardation, and rhesus incompatibility.
