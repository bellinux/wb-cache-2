500|$|In 1999, Wijnberg {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} {{the presence of}} several structurally related antifungal compounds called benzoxepines in the latex of Mycena galopus. One of these compounds, 6-hydroxypterulone, is a derivative of pterulone, a potent antifungal metabolite first isolated from submerged cultures of Pterula species in 1997. The antifungal activity of pterulone is based on selective inhibition of the NADH dehydrogenase enzyme of the electron transport chain. A 2008 publication reported that fatty acid esters of benzoxepine serve as precursors to wound-activated chemical defense. When the fruit body is injured and the latex is exposed, an esterase enzyme (an enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis) presumably cleaves the inactive esterified benzoxepines into their active forms, where they can help defend the mushroom against yeasts and parasitic fungi. In nature, the mushroom is rarely attacked by parasitic fungi, however, it is prone to infection by the [...] "bonnet mold" [...] Spinellus fusiger, which is insensitive to the benzoxepines of M.galopus. In an English field study, where the two fungi M.galopus and Marasmius androsaceus made up over 99% of the fruit bodies in a site under Sitka spruce, the <b>fungivorous</b> collembolan arthropod Onychiurus latus preferred to graze on the mycelium of M.androsaceus.

50|$|Not only do entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} {{affect their}} host insects, {{they can also}} change the species composition of the soil community. Many familiar animals like earthworms and insect grubs live in the soil, but smaller invertebrates such as mites, collembolans, and nematodes are also common. Aside from EPNs, the soil ecosystem includes predatory, bacteriovorous, <b>fungivorous</b> and plant parasitic nematode species. Since EPNs are applied in agricultural systems {{at a rate of}} 1,000,000 individuals per acre, the potential for unintended consequences on the soil ecosystem appears large. EPNs have not had an adverse effect on mite and collembolan populations (Georgis et al. 1991), yet there is strong evidence that they affect the species diversity of other nematodes. In a golf course ecosystem, the application of H. bacteriophora, an introduced nematode, significantly reduced the abundance, species richness, maturity, and diversity of the nematode community (Somaseker et al. 2002). EPNs had no effect on free-living nematodes. However, there was a {{reduction in the number of}} genera and abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes, which often remain enclosed within growths on the plant root. The mechanism by which insect parasitic nematodes have an effect on plant parasitic nematodes remains unknown. Although this effect is considered beneficial for agricultural systems where plant parasitic nematodes cause crop damage, it raises the question of what other effects are possible. Future research on the impacts EPNs have on soil communities will lead to greater understanding of these interactions.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that microbial-feeding invertebrate soil fauna species can significantly contribute to N 2 O emissions. However, in soil food webs microbial-feeding soil fauna interact {{with each other and with}} their predators, which affects microbial activity. To date we lack empirical tests of whether or not these interactions play a significant role in N 2 O emissions from soil. Therefore we studied how interactions between soil microbes, two groups of microbial-feeding soil fauna (enchytraeids and <b>fungivorous</b> mites) and their predators (predatory mites) affect soil N 2 O emissions. We hypothesized that: 1) the presence of two microbial-feeding fauna groups (enchytraeids and <b>fungivorous</b> mites) together increase N 2 O emissions more than when only a single group is present; and 2) the addition of predatory mites further enhances N 2 O emissions. We assembled soil food webs consisting of soil microbes, enchytraeids, <b>fungivorous</b> and predatory mites in microcosms with sandy loamy soil and sterilised hay as a substrate for the soil microbes. N 2 O emissions were measured during 56 days. We found no support for our first yet support for our second hypothesis. Addition of predatory mites to microcosms with enchytraeids and <b>fungivorous</b> mites increased N 2 O emissions significantly from 135. 3 to 482. 1 mg N m- 2, which was also significantly higher than the control without fauna (83 mg N m- 2) (P < 0. 001). In presence of enchytraeids, <b>fungivorous</b> and predatory mites, we found much higher nitrate availability at the time of the N 2 O peak on Day 35 (10. 9 versus 5. 5 mg N per kg soil without soil fauna), indicating that the major increase in N 2 O emissions in this treatment may be due to increased nitrification. Increased nitrification may be attributed to higher availability of N from the dead tissues of <b>fungivorous</b> mites and increased activity of the enchytraeids that might also have affected soil structure and contributed to increased N 2 O emissions. This study demonstrates the importance of interactions between microbial-feeding invertebrate soil fauna and their predators in understanding N 2 O emissions...|$|E

40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} spatial {{structure}} can mediate interactions that affect species diversity in a patchy environment. A rarely considered effect of spatial structure on biodiversity is {{the interplay of}} spatial habitat arrangement with species interactions at multiple spatial scales. We investigated how spatial habitat arrangement and predation mediate the assembly of the larval communities of <b>fungivorous</b> insects breeding in the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq. ex Fr.) P. Kumm in a North American woodland. In a two-way factorial design, we varied the spatial arrangement of mushroom clumps (‘clustered', ‘patchy', and ‘uniform'; 3 levels) crossed with predator exclusion (access allowed or not; 2 levels) to study their joint effects on patterns of α, β and γ diversity of the <b>fungivorous</b> insect communities. Partitioning diversity into these three components suggested that neither spatial nor predation treatments significantly affected α, β and γ diversity. We found that an intermediate inter-clump distance (i. e., the ‘patchy' treatment) increased spatial autocorrelation in insect community composition within experimental blocks, particularly in the mushrooms to which predators had access. The spatial structuring in β diversity indicates that the arrangement of mushroom clumps can structure β diversity of <b>fungivorous</b> larval communities through direct effects on the species themselves (e. g., increased aggregation and habitat choice of ovipositing females of <b>fungivorous</b> insects), as well as effects mediated through the presence and behavior of predators (e. g., spatially structured selective foraging by predators acting as a filter on which species were in the clumps). The naturally patchy nature of mushroom fruiting may transform the spatial pattern of β diversity by altering the behavior of ovipositing females, or by weakening the negative effect of larval competition...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} and clarify the feeding habits of <b>fungivorous</b> soil fauna, with the overall objective of improving our understanding of their functional roles in the ecosystem. Special focus was given to symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, that, owing to their abundance and diversity, are considered to constitute an important food source for <b>fungivorous</b> soil fauna and may be a factor regulating these faunal communities. Previous studies on soil animal feeding habits have been strongly dependent on the methodology used; therefore an additional aim was to find the technique most suitable for studying <b>fungivorous</b> feeding. The results in this thesis confirm {{that it is necessary}} to combine a number of different methods in order to determine the feeding habits of <b>fungivorous</b> soil fauna. The total abundance of oribatid mites was significantly reduced in spruce forest stands that were girdled to restrict flow of photoassimilates to roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and Oppiella nova was the species that showed the most marked reduction in abundance, especially in spruce forest soils. This reduction in abundance could be explained by the results from a microcosm study, in which O. nova was clearly favoured by the presence of certain EM fungi and increased its abundance of both adults and juveniles in microcosms with the two EM species Suillus variegatus and Paxillus involutus. In the same study, Cognettia sphagnetorum was suppressed by the presence of EM fungi, which partly explains why this species reach high populations after clear-cutting. PCR in combination with washing of the body surface and dissection was a successful method for analysing diets of fungal feeding oribatid mites. This method will be considered for future analyses of field collected animals. We could also demonstrate that the isotopic composition of <b>fungivorous</b> animals should be interpreted with great care, when used as a method for studying fungivore feeding habits. The range of values recorded from field collected Diptera larvae utilising a single food source was large enough to span across several trophic levels when these were determined using fixed enrichment values from literature data.

Abundance of bacterivorous and <b>fungivorous</b> nematodes in litterbags containing sunn hemp residues peaked at 14 days after burial (DAB) followed by increase of omnivorous nematodes at 28 DAB. Another peak of <b>fungivorous</b> nematodes occurred at 56 DAB. A succession of bacterivorous and <b>fungivorous</b> nematodes was observed in the litterbags. Enhancement of predatory nematode abundance by sunn hemp residues was not significant, but abundance of herbivorous nematodes appeared {{to respond to the}} increase in crop biomass over time. Although sunn hemp had great impact on the percentages of nematode trophic groups, several nematode fauna indices had reverted by 70 DAB to values found in untreated soil. Succession patterns of the nematode trophic groups and community indices in this sunn hemp-amended soil are consistent with a food web response to disturbance from an N-rich resource. The nematode succession dynamics suggested that decomposition of sunn hemp material occurred rather quickly (within 2 weeks after burial), which is consistent with data on weight loss of the residue. These results provide insight into efficient use of an organic residue to optimize succession of nematodes involved in decomposition, and to provide a way to maintain enrichment of the soil food web...|$|E

So far, most {{research has been}} focusing on primary decomposers, while studies on effects at higher trophic levels are relatively scarce. Giant goldenrod Solidago gigantea, native to North America, is a widespread and common invasive species in most European countries. We investigated its impact on plant communities and on multiple trophic levels of the soil food web in two contrasting habitats: riparian zones and semi-natural grasslands. In 30 pairs of invaded and uninvaded plots, floristic composition, pH, fungal biomass and the densities of 11 nematode taxa were determined by using a quantitative PCR-based method. In the two habitats, the invader outcompeted both rare and dominant plant species. Belowground, S. gigantea invasion reduced pH, increased overall fungal biomass {{as well as the}} density of a single lineage of <b>fungivorous</b> nematodes, the family Aphelenchoididae. The densities of two other, phylogenetically distinct lineages of <b>fungivorous</b> nematodes, Aphelenchidae and Diphtherophoridae, were unaffected by the local increase in fungal biomass. Apparently this plant species induces a local asymmetric boost of the fungal community, and only Aphelenchoididae were able to benefit from this invader-induced change. The alternative explanation - the results are explained by a subtle, S. gigantea - induced 0. 1 - 0. 2 units decrease of pH - seems unlikely, as pH optima for nematode taxa are relatively broad.

Poor description of a number of non plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species further complicates identification.

We showed previously that C. cinerea expresses constitutive, tissue-specific armories against antagonists such as animal predators and bacterial competitors. In order to dissect the inducible armories against such antagonists, we sequenced the poly(A) -positive transcriptome of C. cinerea vegetative mycelium upon challenge with <b>fungivorous</b> and bacterivorous nematodes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and mechanical damage. As {{a response to the}} <b>fungivorous</b> nematode Aphelenchus avenae, C. cinerea was found to specifically induce the transcription of several genes encoding previously characterized nematotoxic lectins. In addition, a previously not characterized gene encoding a cytoplasmic protein with several predicted Ricin B-fold domains, was found to be strongly upregulated under this condition. Functional analysis of the recombinant protein revealed a high toxicity toward the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Challenge of the mycelium with A. avenae also lead to the induction of several genes encoding putative antibacterial proteins. Some of these genes were also induced upon challenge of the mycelium with the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. These results suggest that fungi have the ability to induce specific innate defense responses similar to plants and animals...|$|E
40|$|The gall midges {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of gall makers. Emerging larvae produce stimuli and the host plant responds by producing galls, fascinating structures which provide food and shelter for the developing larvae. Most gall inducing midges are host specific: they are only able to induce galls in a few, often related, plant species. A few species have different feeding modes: among them are saprophagous, <b>fungivorous</b> and predaceous species and some are used in biocontrol. We recorded 416 species in the whole area; 366 species are recorded from the Netherlands, 270 species from Belgium and 96 species from Luxembourg...|$|E
40|$|The {{digestion}} {{ability of}} 20 species of Collembola sampled from nutrient-poor moist peat meadows was determined. The activity of three carbohydrases was measured, i. e. trehalase, cellulase and chitinase. Species were classified in feeding guilds {{based on the}} presence or absence of enzymatic activity. The majority of the samples analysed showed trehalase and cellulase activity, and indicate that Collembola commonly have the ability to digest cell walls of plants and algae, and the contents of fungal hyphae. Most of the species examined had chitinase activity, and are able to digest fungal cell walls. Based on the results, four feeding guilds were distinguished, i. e. herbo-fungivorous grazers (nine species), <b>fungivorous</b> grazers (two species), opportunistic herbofungivores (one species) and omnivore (one species). Five species could not be classified due to low number of samples. One more feeding guild was indicated if the levels of enzymatic activity within species were taken into account, i. e. <b>fungivorous</b> browsers. The results show that most species have the ability to digest the food items reported from gut content analyses. Between species, significant difference in specific enzymatic activity was recorded. These findings suggest that, together with information on feeding guilds, under field conditions the various species in the community differed in their food choice. It is hypothesised that a relationship exists between the mouthpart morphology of Collembola species and specific carbohydrase activity. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|E
