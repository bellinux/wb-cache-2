50|$|Hierarchical {{law as a}} {{model for}} {{understanding}} the structural description of the process of understanding and applying the law was central for Kelsen and he adopted the model directly from his colleague Adolf Merkl at the University of Vienna. The main purposes of the hierarchical description of the law would be three-fold for Kelsen. First, it was essential to understanding his celebrated static theory of law as elaborated in Chapter four of his book on the Pure Theory of Law (see subsection above). In its second edition, this chapter on the static theory of the law was almost one hundred pages in length and represented a comprehensive study of law capable of standing as an independent subject for research for legal scholars in this area of specialization. Second, it was a measure of relative centralization or decentralization. Third, a <b>fully</b> <b>centralized</b> <b>system</b> of law would also correspond to a unique Grundnorm or Basic norm which would not be inferior to any other norm in the hierarchy due to its placement at the utmost foundation of the hierarchy (see Grundnorm section below).|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a single-period distribution system with one supplier and two retailers. The supplier may have infinite or finite capacity. The demand at each retailer is random. When a stockout occurs at one retailer the customer {{may go to}} the other retailer. We study both the decentralized and centralized inventory control problems. For the decentralized problem we show that a unique Nash equilibrium exists when the capacity at the supplier is infinite. However, when the capacity is finite, only under certain conditions does the Nash equilibrium exist. For centralized inventory control we obtain the optimal allocation that maximizes the expected profit of the entire supply chain. For the case of decentralized controls we also design channel coordination mechanisms, i. e., a decentralized cost structure resulting in a Nash equilibrium with chain-wide profits equal to those achieved under a <b>fully</b> <b>centralized</b> <b>system.</b> We compare the performance of two retailers in the decentralized and centralized controls and analyze the impact of channel coordination on the whole supply chain.

40|$|Abstract—In {{peer-to-peer}} storage systems, peers replicate {{each others}} ’ data {{in order to}} increase availability. If the matching is done centrally, the algorithm can optimize data availability in an equitable manner for all participants. However, if matching is decentralized, the peers ’ selfishness can greatly alter the results, leading to performance inequities that can render the system unreliable and thus ultimately unusable. We analyze the problem using both theoretical approaches (complexity analysis for the centralized system, game theory for the decentralized one) and simulation. We prove that the problem of optimizing availability in a centralized system is NP-hard. In decentralized settings, we show that the rational behavior of selfish peers will be to replicate only with similarly-available peers. Compared to the socially-optimal solution, highly available peers have their data availability increased at the expense of decreased data availability for less available peers. The price of anarchy is high: unbounded in one model, and linear with the number of time slots in the second model. We also propose centralized and decentralized heuristics that, according to our experiments, converge fast in the average case. The high price of anarchy means that a completely decentral-ized system could be too hostile for peers with low availability, who could never achieve satisfying replication parameters. More-over, we experimentally show that even explicit consideration and exploitation of diurnal patterns of peer availability has a small effect on the data availability—except when the system has truly global scope. Yet a <b>fully</b> <b>centralized</b> <b>system</b> is infeasible, not only because of problems in information gathering, but also the complexity of optimizing availability. The solution to this dilemma is to create system-wide cooperation rules that allow a decentralized algorithm, but also limit the selfishness of the participants.

40|$|Large {{number of}} {{autonomous}} robot solutions exists for various missions and domains. These robots are {{sufficient for the}} missions they are built for. At the same time each of them has limited functional and physical capabilities. Multi robot systems {{can be used to}} remove these limits. However it is true only in case when the system ensures effective interaction among the robots i. e. enables their social behaviour. Usually it is hard to implement such capabilities directly into robots due to functional and physical limitations and heterogeneity of the team. One of possible solutions is to implement management systems outside the robots. It should decompose tasks, allocate subtasks to specific robots and monitor the execution of the assigned tasks. In order to avoid inherent drawback of <b>fully</b> <b>centralized</b> <b>systems</b> a significant level of autonomy has to be preserved. Intelligent agents fulfil these requirements. Therefore we propose a general multi-agent system’s architecture for multi-robot management system for applications with a common goal. It can be used to implement various purpose multi-robot systems from existing single operating robots without major changes in their software and hardware. A vacuum cleaning problem of a large area is considered as an application case...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The correct {{functioning}} of a peer-to-peer network relies on cooperative behavior of peers as service providers. Current approaches to detection and deterrence of non-cooperative behavior, such as reputation systems, rely on (1) global sharing of observations about service provisioning and (2) global authentication. These two factors severely impair the practical applicability. We propose a novel forward feedback protocol {{that is completely}} local and authentication-free and where peers locally and independently learn to avoid non-cooperative peers and routing failures. We evaluate our system {{in a variety of}} failure scenarios. The convergence rates and failure resilience are close to those of a <b>fully</b> <b>centralized</b> reputation <b>system.</b> High churn is tolerated without significant drop in performance. For increased fault tolerance the system takes advantage of the service replicas existing in the network. The proposed protocol is lightweight and can readily be integrated into any architecture where service requests are recursively routed, which includes all modern structured overlays. ...|$|R

There were identified three shocks with major social impact on Romanian economy: the revolution in December 1989; the EU accession in January 2007 and the world economic crisis began in 2007.
