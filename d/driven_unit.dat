40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} of a novel robotic <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> intended as the driving kernel for multi-degree of freedom (dof) parallel manipulators. The transmission system of this unit features a planetary gear train and a ball-screw mechanism. Due to this special transmission design, two driving motors can {{be placed on the}} fixed base, thereby enhancing the load-carrying capacity of the robotic <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> Parallel robots constructed and actuated with the proposed units should exhibit higher load-carrying capacity and faster motion capability, as compared to existing drives. The conceptual design of the unit is first proposed, and a design alternative is then discussed. The application of this novel <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is illustrated by the example of integrating three such <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> into a six-dof parallel manipulator with three Universal-Prismatic-Spherical (UPS) legs. With six actuators installed on the fixed base, such a manipulator can be endowed with high stiffness, high speed, high accuracy and high load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, a testbed is designed in order to verify the kinematic and dynamic performance of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> The kinematic analysis of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> the testbed and the six-dof parallel manipulator is conducted.

50|$|A PTO {{or power}} {{take-off}} unit {{has the same}} driven components as a petrol or diesel <b>driven</b> <b>unit</b> except that the unit takes mechanical power from the vehicles engine via a specially fitted power take off unit which is usually fitted to the vehicle transmission. The power is usually transmitted via a drive shaft or hydraulic pump and motor. Heating the solution is either by a vehicle exhaust heat exchanger, coolant heater or LPG fired heater. The advantage is quieter running and lighter weight in addition to not having to maintain a second engine. The disadvantages are putting extra running hours on the vehicle engine and transmission. The PTO system is also usually vehicle specific so transferring the truckmount to another make or model of vehicle will require a new PTO system to be fitted.|$|E

It is considered a requirement that a unit must be stable when supplying an isolated load and it is assumed that this requirement assures stability of a sys-tem of such units when interconnected. A mathematical model of a typical unit supplying an isolated load is presented.

40|$|A dc {{brushless}} motor driven mixer unit (a vaneaxial fan) {{was designed and}} evaluated for use in cryogenic fluids (liquids and gases). It was found to operate well in all fluids {{in which it was}} tested. The test fluids were liquid and gaseous helium, hydrogen in the liquid phase gas phase and mixtures of the two phases, and liquid nitrogen. It operated for over 100 hr at cryogenic temperatures without damage to the bearings and at the conclusion of testing the condition of the bearings was such that an operational life of 5000 hr appeared possible. The unit demonstrated that (with the brushless dc motor principle) useful pumping of cryogenic fluids could be accomplished with very small power inputs to the mixer motor. During test, the motor input power varied from approximately 0. 5 W to 2. 5 W, depending on fluid density. The high power input produced a mixer efficiency of over 49 percent. In an earlier program (see NASA Report CR- 72365), a mixer using an ac induction motor demonstrated an efficiency of 17. 7 percent under the same conditions, illustrating the advantage of the dc {{brushless motor}} <b>driven</b> <b>unit.</b> The mixer also demonstrated its ability to automatically vary speed {{as a function of the}} density of the fluid being pumped.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} among dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder {{effects in the}} context of wave transmission through a discrete periodic structure, subjected to continuous harmonic excitation in its stop band. We consider a damped nonlinear periodic structure of finite length with disorder. Disorder is introduced throughout the structure by small changes in the stiffness parameters drawn from a uniform statistical distribution. Dispersion effects forbid wave transmission within the stop band of the linear periodic structure. However, nonlinearity leads to supratransmission phenomenon, by which enhanced wave transmission occurs within the stop band of the periodic structure when forced at an amplitude exceeding a certain threshold. The frequency components of the transmitted waves lie within the pass band of the linear structure, where disorder is known to cause Anderson localization. There is therefore a competition between dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder {{in the context of}} supratransmission. We show that supratransmission persists in the presence of disorder. The influence of disorder decreases in general as the forcing frequency moves away from the pass band edge, reminiscent of dispersion effects subsuming disorder effects in linear periodic structures. We compute the dependence of the supratransmission force threshold on nonlinearity and strength of coupling between units. We observe that nonlinear forces are confined to the <b>driven</b> <b>unit</b> for weakly coupled systems. This observation, together with the truncation of higher-order nonlinear terms, permits us to develop closed-form expressions for the supratransmission force threshold. In sum, in the frequency range studied here, disorder does not influence the supratransmission force threshold in the ensemble-average sense, but it does reduce the average transmitted wave energy.

40|$|Biogas {{is seen as}} one of {{the most}} {{promising}} fuels for the market entry of stationary fuel cells. Biogas SOFCs because of the special chemical composition of biogas. can be designed in a much simpler way than conventional natural gas SOFCs while still retain their high electrical efficiency. It was shown that a biogas driven SOFC system may be run at significantly higher electrical efficiencies than a methane or natural gas <b>driven</b> <b>unit</b> and still remain with a simple and robust process design. That is due to the great amount of carbon dioxide within the biogas. It allows the biogas to be reformed at significantly lower air-to-fuel-ratios (methane: λ min≡ 0, 26; biogas: λ min≡ 0, 05) without the risk of carbon formation resulting in a reformate with substantially greate r chemical energy flux Pch. The greater chemical energy flux within the reformate allows more current to be drawn from the same chemical energy flux input into the system. This leads to a greater gross electric power output at the same chemical energy flux input into the system resulting in a higher electrical efficiency. It was shown that at probable operating conditions the ideal gross electrical efficiency of a biogas-fed system may be as much as 14 percentage points greater than that of a methane-fed system (FU= 0, 75; methane: η e,ideal≡ 0, 50; biogas: η e,ideal≡ 0, 64). Experiments were run on an SOFC system laid out for both methane and biogas operation. Through the course of these experiments it was not possible to demonstrate the calculated results. It was shown th at using biogas the ratio of output and input chemical energy fluxes can be larger than for methane operation. Due to the insufficient heat flux directed at the reformer it was not possible to achieve higher electrical efficiencies with biogas. As a result a new system should be designed solitarily for biogas operation. For this system to deliver the desired performance it is necessary to couple heat sources with the drain the reformer poses. Present activities aim at coupling reformer and afterburner into one proprietary component especially designed to allow maximum heat flux from afterburner to reformer...|$|E
40|$|LectureThe Oil & Gas {{industry}} faces increasing {{challenges to}} meet growing energy demands {{with the most}} sustainable exploration and production techniques. Compressor manufacturers have responded to these challenges {{with the development of}} hermetically sealed compressors, enabling gas compression with minimized environmental footprint. The main feature in all of these designs is integration of driver and <b>driven</b> <b>unit</b> into a single casing. As a result, there is no shaft protruding out of the casing, hence {{there is no need for}} shaft sealing elements like dry gas seals that have traditionally suffered poorest reliability. There is one major disadvantage of this design concept: electrical components from electrical motor and active magnetic bearings are introduced in a process gas environment. This may not be so detrimental on compressor applications handling clean, export-quality gas allowing hermetically sealed technology with the electrical insulation system directly exposed to the process gas used for cooling purposes. However, for non-clean, toxic or corrosive applications the electrical components require either special treatment or, alternatively, need to be separated from the process gas. Authors? company has introduced the STC-ECO following the latter principle, a field-proven hermetically sealed, canned, compressor specifically designed to meet the requirements of the most demanding upstream applications. The applications have been defined and described in four distinct material categories. The primary design concept of the Electrical, Canned and Oil-free (ECO) unit is its 'canned' technology. The electric motor, Active Magnetic Bearings and instrumentation are separated from the process gas by cylindrical parts integrated in stationary housing parts, such that no electrical component is exposed to process gas. A first prototype of a canned hermetically sealed compressor has operated over 50. 000 hours since installation in 2006 on a natural gas asset in the Netherlands. For more severe sour and corrosive applications, special precautions were required on the compressor package design, among which a patented hybrid rotor design and hybrid thrust disk design. The hybrid technology contains separate sections of different materials welded together to form one multi- functional solid component. Furthermore, the motor stator 'can', separating the motor stator windings from the cooling process gas, was subjected to a series of qualification tests at research institutes in the Netherlands to qualify the compatibility to H 2 S and corrosive conditions. For an upstream gas compression project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, such a 5. 8 MW unit capable of handling sour gas was designed, built and ASME PTC- 10 Type- 1 tested at the Author's company facility in Hengelo, The Netherlands. Upon completion of an extensive test program including emergency landing test on the auxiliary bearing system, the unit was shipped and commissioned at site in the Middle East and started operation in June 2015. The paper covers the design concept of the 'canned' hermetically sealed technology, highlights the design aspects making it suitable for sour and corrosive applications and describes the unit built and tested for the upstream gas compression project of Saudi Aramco...|$|E
