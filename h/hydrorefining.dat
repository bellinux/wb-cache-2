40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a Pd/TiO 2 -C-SiC catalyst having high activity in terephthalic acid <b>hydrorefining</b> reaction, and preparation {{and application of}} the Pd/TiO 2 -C-SiC catalyst. The Pd/TiO 2 -C-SiC catalyst mainly solves the problem of unsteady palladium catalyst quality caused {{by the fact that}} the active carbon carrier is friable and greatly different in quality, in the existing terephthalic acid <b>hydrorefining</b> reaction. For the Pd/TiO 2 -C-SiC catalyst, high-strength macroporous silicon carbide is used as the carrier, by surface carbonization and titanium dioxide modification, the palladium metal dispersity is increased, and sequentially, the catalytic activity is improved greatly. Moreover, with the high-strength silicon carbide carrier, the problem of increase of reaction pressure drop caused by breaking of the carbon carrier is also avoided better, so that the catalyst can be used in the industrial production of terephthalic acid <b>hydrorefining</b> reaction. | 本发明涉及一种在对苯二甲酸加氢精制反应中具有高活性的Pd/TiO 2 -C-SiC催化剂及其制备与应用。主要解决现存的对苯二甲酸加氢精制反应中，由于活性炭载体易破碎以及质量差别大，所造成的钯催化剂质量不稳定的问题。本发明以高强度大孔碳化硅为载体，通过表面炭化并用二氧化钛改性，以增大钯金属分散度，从而大大提高了催化活性。另外，高强度碳化硅载体的使用，也很好的避免了碳载体破碎造成的反应压降增大的问题，可用于对苯二甲酸加氢精制反应的工业生产中...|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{cylinder}} liner; {{piston ring}}; additives; tribological behavior Abstract: With a piston ring reciprocating liner test rig, the tribological behavior at {{top dead center}} of diesel engine was evaluated between <b>hydrorefined</b> mineral oil (HMO) and two kinds of cylinder liner/piston ring, chromium-plated+honing/physical vapor deposition (CP/PVD) and boron-phosphrous alloy cast iron+honing/physical vapor deposition (CI/PVD). Friction coefficient vs. temperature at different loads was used to discriminate the principal function of tribofilm. The analysis shows that the interface between CP/PVD and HMO was subject to thin film lubrication with stearic acid at 70 - 150 ℃. When the temperature exceeds 150 ℃, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) began to change the friction status of interface. However, the steady boundary lubrication of CI/PVD exists from 50 — 250 ℃ at different loads and can not distinguish the scope of additives effects.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} kinetics of <b>hydrorefining</b> catalyst in ex-situ presulfurization {{was investigated}} using a fixed-bed penetrating method. A mathematical model {{was built to}} express the intrinsic kinetics of presulfurization using an unreacted shrinking core model for catalyst grains and one-dimension unhomogeneous model for beds, and then {{the significance of the}} new model was tested. Results show that the presulfurization with <b>hydrorefining</b> catalyst was a nonstationary process, as the re-action rate changed with time, and this first-order reaction displayed high activation energy. In this dynamic mathematical model, a correction coefficient f 0 was introduced into the common po-wer-function-formed rate equation, which indicated the effects of solid diffusion on reaction. The model with high significance was able to improve the presulfurization rate and the raw material utilization ratio, thus providing theoretical guidance for achieving high presulfurization effects...|$|E

Isomerization capacity was three times as expensive as distillation, catalytic reforming and <b>hydrorefining</b> four times as expensive, and so on. Aromatics were reported as the most expensive technology on a per barrel basis, and unlike the other units, its complexity factor has declined.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} essential {{aspects of}} the hydrotreatment of pyrolytic oils {{in the light of}} results obtained until now at the Universite Catholique de Louvain. Stability of pyrolysis oils necessitates a two-step processing. A low temperature hydrotreatment enables stabilization through reactions like olefin, carbonyl and carboxylic groups reduction. Further hydrotreatment aims at hydrodeoxygenation of phenols and hydrocracking of larger molecules. Results about catalysts, reaction conditions and parameters enabling or influencing the control of the reaction are summarized. Based on these laboratory data, a preliminary techno-economical evaluation is made. 50 wt. -% yields in hydrocarbons for deep <b>hydrorefining</b> of pyrolysis oils can be expected.

A new {{refining}} {{technique was}} innovatively improved {{and a series}} of high-performance transformer oil was successfully developed from non-cyclic alkyl crude oil through hydrocracking, isodewaxing, <b>hydrorefining</b> and proportioning.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the impossible use of beta radiation to promote chemical reactions at high temperatures and pressures. The advantages of beta sources over other radiation sources are enumerated. A radiation processing apparatus is described which allows operations to 10, 000 psi and 500 deg C and uses 90 C of Sr/sup 90 /-Y/sup 90 /. The dosimetry of the source was accomplished with an iodineheptane system, and the mean dose rate within the chemical reactor was determined to be 0. 98 x 10 /sup 6 / rad/hr. The radiation utilization efficiency in the dosimetry measurements was determined to be 34. 7 %. Results of runs on hydrogenation of coal extract indicate that radiation does not increase the extent of hydrogenation, but that radiation reduces the content of hetero atoms N and S in the 100 x 400 deg C boiling oil products. The use of beta radiation in the <b>hydrorefining</b> of oils is suggested. (D. L. C. ...|$|E

40|$|The second {{generation}} of biofuels processes should differ from the first in a) utilizing the whole plantas a feedstock and b) use of “non-food” perennial crops (woody biomass and tall grasses) andlignocellulosic residues and wastes. Possible options for the conversion of these lignocellulosic plantmaterials include: thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, pyrolysis, carbonisation, catalytic reforming,steam reforming, gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydro-dehydrogenisation, hydrocracking,hydrorefining and decarboxylation. The main goal of biorefinery is to produce high-value low-volumechemicals (levoglucosan) and low-value high-volume fuels {{with a series of}} unit operations. Thermal processes must be included among the attractive basic recycling technology for polymersfor which thermal cracking and pyrolysis enable the conversion of polymer materials into fuels,monomers and other valuable products. The subject of the research were the thermal and catalyticprocesses for the production of motor fuels from polymer material from industrial material or municipaltrash sources turning it into sulfur free, non-aromatic and ecological fuel via chemical recycling toreplace fossil fuels mainly from oil sources. The key is the liquefaction of polymer materials tooil/waxes that can be distilled to provide gasoline, diesel fuels and heating oils that can be useddirectly or after <b>hydrorefining.</b> We found a way, how incorporate polymer waste into conventional liquid steam cracking feedstocks. Polyalkene oils and waxes decompose during co-pyrolysis. Amount of desired alkenes (ethylene,propene) increases or is slightly less in dependence on polymer type. Mixture of waxes in heavynaphtha (10 - 20 % mass) exhibits short tendency to coking. Feedstock and chemical recycling ofpolyalkenes oils and waxes via co-pyrolysis is a very promising method treatment of polymer waste.

40|$|Hydrotreating, hydrocracking, {{and fluid}} {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) catalysts are important components of petroleum refining processes. Hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts are used to improve the yield of high-quality light oil fractions from heavier crude oil and petroleum feedstocks containing high levels of impurities. FCC catalysts improve the yield of higher octane gasoline from crude oil. Residuum hydrotreating and cracking catalysts are susceptible to irreversible deactivation caused by adsorption of sulfur and by metals impurities, such as vanadium and nickel. The gradual buildup of these impurities in a hydrotreating catalyst eventually plugs the pores and deactivates it. Nickel and vanadium adversely affect the behavior of cracking catalysts, reducing product yield and quality. Replacing deactivated catalysts represents a significant cost in petroleum refining. Equally important are the costs and potential liabilities associated with treating and disposing spent catalysts. For example, recent US Environmental Protection Agency rulings have listed spent hydrotreating and <b>hydrorefining</b> catalysts as hazardous wastes. FCC catalysts, though more easily disposed of as road-base or as filler in asphalt and cement, are still an economic concern {{mainly because of the}} large volumes of spent catalysts generated. New processes are being considered to increase the useful life of catalysts or for meeting more stringent disposal requirements for spent catalysts containing metals. This report discusses a collaborative effort between Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Phillips Petroleum, Inc., to identify promising chemical processes for removing metals adhered to spent hydrodesulfurization (HDS, a type of hydrotreating catalyst) and FCC catalysts. This study, conducted by PNNL, was funded by the US Department of Energy's Bartlesville Project Office. Fresh and spent catalysts were provided by Phillips Petroleum. The FCC catalyst was a rare-earth exchanged Y zeolite in a silica-alumina matrix. X-ray fluorescence analyses showed that the rare earths used in preparing the catalysts were a mixture of lanthanum and cerium. Antimony found in the spent catalyst was added during operation of the FCC unit as a way to suppress the adverse effects of deposited nickel. The fresh HDS samples consisted of sulfided nickel and molybdenum on an alumina support. The spent catalyst showed nearly 10 % vanadium on the catalyst and a modest increase in nickel and sulfur on the catalyst as a result of operations. Hydrocracking catalysts were not available for this study...|$|E
