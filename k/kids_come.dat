500|$|Several {{songs on}} New York Dolls {{function}} as what Robert Hilburn deemed [...] "colorful, if exaggerated, expressions of teen alienation". Robert Christgau remarked that {{because many of}} Manhattan's white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the outer boroughs such as the band members could [...] "capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being". [...] "Private World", an escapist plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Johansen, the band's main lyricist, said [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)" [...] was about [...] "how <b>kids</b> <b>come</b> to Manhattan from all over, they're kind of like whipped dogs, they're very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other... it's a love song." [...] According to critic Frank Kogan, the titular monster in the song was the personification of New York City and its ethos—"the ostentation and the terror, the dreams and the fear"—while Johansen asking listeners if they [...] "could make it with Frankenstein" [...] involved more than sexual slang: [...] "David was asking if you—if I—could make it with the monster of life, whether I could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster." [...] Sylvain jokingly said [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)" [...] was titled with a qualifier because rock musician Edgar Winter had released his 1973 song {{of the same name}} before the band could record their own: [...] "Our song 'Frankenstein' was a big hit in our live show... Now, his thing didn't sound at all like ours, but I'm sure he stole our title." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Sweden, {{children}} {{dress up}} as witches and monsters {{when they go}} trick-or-treating on Maundy Thursday (the Thursday before Easter) while Danish children dress up in various attires and go trick-or-treating on Fastelavn (or the next day, Shrove Monday). In Norway, [...] "trick-or-treat" [...] is called [...] "knask eller knep", which means almost the same thing, although with the word order reversed, and the practice is quite common among children, who come dressed up to people's doors asking for, mainly, candy. Many Norwegians prepare for the event by consciously buying a small stock of sweets prior to it, to come in handy should any <b>kids</b> <b>come</b> knocking on the door, which is very probable in most areas.

Put yourself in their place, sir, and try and realize the torture of it. I've been amongst 'em. I've spent half of what I made, and a good many thousands it was, buying food for them.
