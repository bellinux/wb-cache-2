40|$|The Austrian economy {{once again}} {{expanded}} vigorously {{in the first}} quarter of 2008. Overall real GDP growth was 0. 8 percent quarter-on-quarter, according to WIFO's latest flash estimate. Value added growth in export-oriented industrial production, construction and tourism provided fresh stimulus to the economy. Private consumption remained subdued. For the current quarter, the results of the WIFO business survey suggest a weakening of industrial activity. Accelerated consumer price inflation dampened consumer confidence in March. US GDP growth was almost nil for the second consecutive time {{in the first quarter}}, and in Europe, too, leading indicators point to a gradual <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> economic <b>activity.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} characteristics {{of those who}} desist from {{compared to those who}} persist in delinquency over a two year span. Stability of antisocial behavior is a well accepted finding in the social sciences. In addition, many other individual characteristics associated with crime, such as impulsivity, are considered to be stable. These individual characteristics also show a relationship to long term negative outcomes of adult criminality and poor work history. Other variables that correlate with adolescent delinquency are parental monitoring, peer deviancy, and school attachment. While there is stability in antisocial behavior, there is also change; many individuals desist from delinquency as they age. Participants in this study were adolescents involved in a longitudinal study (N = 278). Results show a high degree of stability in delinquency as well as in other correlates of delinquency. Parental monitoring, peer deviancy, and school attachment are all related to delinquency, yet when the subjects are divided into persisters (n = 73) versus desisters (n = 35), these same variables are not significantly related to desistance. This suggests that the variables related to onset may be different from those related to desistance from delinquency. Nonetheless, if one takes a more dynamic perspective of this relationship, change can be seen. Change in impulsivity, risk taking, temper, peer substance use, and school attachment relates to a <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> delinquent <b>activity.</b> Results are discussed from a developmental perspective...|$|R

40|$|With the {{exception}} of Burkina Faso and Mali, the growth experience for WAEMU countries has been disappointing, even {{when compared to other}} sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The main objective of the paper is to investigate why the quest for a growth takeoff has been more elusive in the WAEMU countries compared to other SSA countries. To do this, the paper focuses on the determinants of growth accelerations and <b>decelerations</b> <b>in</b> SSA and the WAEMU. It finds that the variables most closely associated with growth accelerations and <b>decelerations</b> <b>in</b> SSA are changes in terms of trade, private investment, civil tension, real exchange rates, and inflation. Second, as found elsewhere in the literature, there is a certain asymmetry between accelerations and <b>decelerations,</b> <b>in</b> both frequency and determinants, and that the WAEMU region {{is quite different from the}} rest of SSA.

In terms of value added, total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector is higher than in services (2. 4 % and 1. 1 % respectively), although the Communication Sector constitutes an exception. In terms of gross production productivity growth in both sectors is virtually the same (0. 6 % and 0. 7 % respectively) because of the relative lower weight of intermediate inputs in producing services.

40|$|One of the {{features}} of the auditory system is its ability to efficiently process events that occur in rapid succession. The aim of the present study is to propose a new way of investigating sensitivity to auditory tempo changes. More specifically, it proposes to compare the relative sensitivity (bias) to acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> both musical and monotonal conditions. Bias was measured with (1) a conventional psy-chophysical method known as the method of constant stimuli (MCS) and (2) a so-called method of dynamic stimuli (MDS). The latter method consists in responding with a finger press as soon as a near-continual tempo change is detected. With the MCS, there was no preference, as estimated by the point of subjective equality, between acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> the monotonal condition, but there was a preference in the musical condition that indicated more facility for estimating deceler-ations than accelerations. The results obtained with the MDS are con-sistent with the MCS results, given that the response time was faster for <b>decelerations</b> than accelerations <b>in</b> the musical condition but not in the monotonal condition. We conclude that the MDS is a sensitive tool for investigating slight tempo variations...|$|R

A similar consideration applies to the almost fivefold increase of BHBDH <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> starved brains. This observation agrees with the acknowledged brain metabolic response to STS in which the preferential utilization of ketone bodies [28] accelerates cell respiration as confirmed by the enhancement in mitochondrial Complex I function.
