25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} combing machines here, including the <b>French</b> <b>comb,</b> the Lister comb and the Holden comb. The Noble comb {{was the most popular}} as it would comb long, medium and fairly short staple wool, but the slivers needed special preparation in a punching machine beforehand.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>French</b> <b>comb</b> the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E

5000|$|In early December 2013, the French army {{launched}} an {{operation in the}} Timbuktu region, where many jihadist movements were reported. One hundred vehicles and helicopters were involved. Neither the Malian forces nor MINUSMA {{took part in the}} operation. The <b>French</b> <b>combed</b> an area between the towns of Bouje-Baya and Araouane and attacked a katiba of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. A Malian officer said that [...] "the elements of the terrorist group fought to the end. At least 19 members of the movement were killed. There were no wounded or dead on the French side.|$|R
5000|$|Efforts {{were made}} by Bradford to study the {{mechanism}} of noble combing but they failed to produce tangible results. The Noble and <b>French</b> <b>combs</b> are now well understood technology thanks to work by CSIRO. After 1994, Sokolov has endeavored to improve combing performance in the rectilinear comb. Combing technology continues to develop: Sokolov and Kirby developed a theory for combing model, simulation software for combing and drive design in 1982. Current technology used in providing comb drive by introducing innovation on cam performance to deliver textile fiber needs and separate mechanical performance of the comb was developed by Sokolov. [...] The cam technology was an advance on century-old technology of cams by producing a subspecies of new cam design.|$|R
5000|$|A peignoir (...) {{is a long}} {{outer garment}} for women which is {{frequently}} sheer and made of chiffon or another translucent fabric. The word comes from <b>French</b> peigner, to <b>comb</b> the hair (from Latin pectināre, from pecten, pectin-, comb) describing a garment worn while brushing one's hair, originally referring to a dressing gown or bathrobe.|$|R
50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular combing. The <b>French</b> <b>comb</b> is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|E
50|$|The Noble comb is {{no longer}} used in worsted system as {{technology}} is inefficient. Noble combing may have uses for woollen system, or long fibers 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibers is the <b>French</b> <b>comb</b> system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a rectilinear comb relative to a mean fiber length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of wool comb {{can be seen in}} stroke of the components used in a cotton comber. The scaled down has the purpose of accommodating fiber length and fiber physics requirements. The same scaled-up version of a comb {{can be seen in the}} way flax is combed.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{competing}} combing technologies: the Noble (1853) comb (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and the <b>French</b> <b>comb.</b> The Noble comb technology is inefficient, hence most combing {{in the world}} is carried out on the French system. The French system is superior as it combs the entire length of a fiber. Noble combs suffer from the problem that they will not comb 2 mm of a fiber's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a rectilinear combing system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and Noble comb was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18-19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology - resulting in development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.|$|E
6000|$|The worst {{fruit of}} these {{contraband}} operations was, that they involved the Boy in clandestine practices, secret disobediences, {{apt to be}} found out from time to time, and tended to alienate his Father from him. Of which sad mutual humor we already find traces in that early Wusterhausen Document: [...] "Not to be so dirty," [...] says the reproving Father. And the Boy does not take to hunting at all, likes verses, story-books, flute-playing better; seems to be of effeminate tendencies, an EFFEMINIRTER KERL; affects <b>French</b> modes, <b>combs</b> out his hair like a cockatoo, the foolish French fop, instead of conforming to the Army-regulation, which prescribes close-cropping and a club! ...|$|R
5000|$|Fields and Adkins {{had been}} French men {{all through the}} feud, in fact, had been among his most trusted lieutenants since its commencement. Rumor {{therefore}} quickly associated the name of French {{with the murder of}} Judge <b>Combs.</b> <b>French</b> stoutly denied any complicity in this affair. Then, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, came the startling intelligence that Tom Smith, another French warrior, had given out a confession which seriously compromised French.|$|R
40|$|In 1918, the Soviet revolutionary {{government}} repudiated the Tsarist regime’s sovereign debt, triggering one of {{the biggest}} sovereign defaults ever. Yet the price of Russian bonds remained high for years. <b>Combing</b> <b>French</b> archival records, Kim Oosterlinck shows that, far from irrational, investors had legitimate reasons to hope for repayment. Soviet debt recognition, a change in government, a bailout by the French government, or French banks, or a seceding country would have guaranteed at least a partial reimbursement. As Greece and other European countries raise the possibility of sovereign default, Oosterlinck’s superbly researched study is more urgent than ever.

50|$|The Assassination of Judge Josiah Combs: In 1894, Judge Josiah Combs {{decided to}} return to the home he loved, hoping the {{fighting}} was all over. He was ambushed and killed while having a conversation with friends outside of his house. A large field of corn was growing in Hazard. The killers: Joe Adkins, Jesse Fields, and Boone Frazier hid in the corn and fired at Judge Combs. None of this would have come to life except that 'Bad' Tom Smith had been caught on a different murder and sentenced to death row previously for the murder of Dr. John E. Rader. He gave a gallows confession outlining how Fulton French had organized the plot and that Joe Adkins had fired the fatal shot that killed Judge <b>Combs.</b> <b>French</b> was acquitted of the charges, Frazier was never caught, Fields was sentenced to life then acquitted in a second trial, and Adkins received life in both trials, though he only served 8 years before being released.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} books outline that most people {{believed}} that B. Fulton French {{was responsible for the}} murders of Joseph C. Eversole, his father-in-law, Josiah Henry Combs, and many others. In 1913 (19 years after the death of Judge Josah <b>Combs),</b> <b>French</b> accidentally ran into Joe Eversole's widow, Susan Combs Eversole in the lobby of a hotel in Elkatawa, Kentucky (near Jackson, Kentucky). With Mrs. Eversole was her youngest son, Harry C. Eversole then 28 years old. When French spoke to Mrs. Eversole, Harry pulled out a revolver and aware that French wore a bullet proof vest - shot him in the spleen. French initially recovered from his wounds and the Court fined Harry C. Eversole $75 for disturbing the peace. Susan Eversole paid the fine. in 1915, {{a little over a year}} after the shooting, French died from complications from the wound and was buried at the Winchester Cemetery in Clark County. While French never went to prison for the crime of orchestrating the Eversole clan murders, Harry was never tried for Fulton French's murder.|$|R

40|$|This {{issue is}} all about getting to the truth. Science, the systematized {{knowledge}} that has been accumulated through observation, experimentation and reasoning, mandates truthfulness of the answers from testable hypotheses. In this month’s Spotlight, we have our fine, energetic, resourceful, creative and truly European President’s 100 Days and Program Chair’s Quarterly Report, respectively. The venue in Nice is shaping up nicely. Their challenge is to assure us that the ISHLT sessions will keep our {{attention away from the}} <b>French</b> Riviera. Pamela <b>Combs</b> explains to us that VAD programs drive on with bioengineering students aboard. We are given an overview of the necessary pharmacotherapy of right ventricular failure in LVADs by Roy Lee. We are swiftly accumulating more data on the importance of Tregs and Ex vivo lung perfusion to the point we must start asking the practical and proper questions. Rebecca Shilling updates us about Tregs in lung transplantation and the promise of potentially ONE truth or the truth of ONE. Marcelo Cypel, Dirk Van Raemdonck, and Shaf Keshavjee keep us aboard the freight train on what we think is the proper path from where we are to what’s next with ex vivo lung perfusion? Hopefully, the rails remain in place and we don’t steam ahead without tracks. Bryan Boling and Katie Burns move us forward with ambulatory ECMO and share with us how safe it can be especially for those resistant to change and afraid to pursue such an endeavor. Erin Schumer shows us how an ISHLT International Traveling Scholarship Award provided her the opportunity to travel across the ocean to advance research on the biohybrid lung project. Finally, with a nod to our upcoming meeting in France and the dignity and grace of a pirouette in ballet we round out this issue with Tereza Martinu’s adieu to Duke’s Schwartz Center Rounds that grounds us in the truth and humanity of what’s best for our patients...|$|R
