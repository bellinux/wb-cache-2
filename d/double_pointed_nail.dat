50|$|This {{intersection}} is a <b>double</b> <b>point,</b> {{in fact a}} <b>double</b> <b>point</b> counted twice. Furthermore, it {{is included}} in every bitangent plane. The two points of tangency are also <b>double</b> <b>points.</b> Thus the intersection curve, which theory says must be a quartic, contains four <b>double</b> <b>points.</b> But {{we also know that}} a quartic with more than three <b>double</b> <b>points</b> must factor (it cannot be irreducible), and by symmetry the factors must be two congruent conics. Hirsch extends this argument to any surface of revolution generated by a conic, and shows that intersection with a bitangent plane must produce two conics of the same type as the generator when the intersection curve is real.|$|R

The three lines of <b>double</b> <b>points</b> intersect at a triple point which lies on the origin. The triple point cuts the lines of <b>double</b> <b>points</b> into a pair of half-lines, and each half-line lies between a pair of lobes. One might expect from the preceding statements that there could be up to eight lobes, one in each octant of space which has been divided by the coordinate planes. But the lobes occupy alternating octants: four octants are empty and four are occupied by lobes.|$|R

2500|$|If the {{manifold}} is 4 dimensional, {{this does}} not work: {{the problem is that}} a disc in general position may have <b>double</b> <b>points</b> where two points of the disc have the same image. This is the main reason why the usual proof of the h-cobordism theorem only works for cobordisms whose boundary has dimension at least 5. We can try to get rid of these <b>double</b> <b>points</b> as follows. Draw a line on the disc joining two points with the same image. If the image of this line is the boundary of an embedded disc (called a Whitney disc), then it is easy to remove the <b>double</b> <b>point.</b> However this argument seems to be going round in circles: in order to eliminate a <b>double</b> <b>point</b> of the first disc, we need to construct a second embedded disc, whose construction involves exactly the same problem of eliminating <b>double</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
