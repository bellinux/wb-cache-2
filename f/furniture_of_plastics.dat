40|$|This article {{takes an}} imagined, {{transnational}} living room as its setting, examining jazz’s place in {{representations of the}} ‘modern’ middle-class home across the post-war West, and exploring the domestic uses that listeners both casual and committed made of the music in recorded form. In magazines as apparently diverse as Ideal Home in the UK and Playboy in the US, {{a certain kind of}} jazz helped mark a new middlebrow connoisseurship in the 1950 s and 60 s. But rather than simply locating jazz in a historical sociology of taste, this piece attempts to describe jazz’s role in what was an emergent middle-class sensorium. The music’s sonic characteristics were frequently called upon to complement the newly sleek visual and tactile experiences – <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> fabrics, <b>plastics,</b> the light and space of modern domestic architecture – then coming to define the aspirational bourgeois home; an international modern visual aesthetic was reflected back in jazz album cover art. Yet to describe experience or ambience represents a challenge to historical method. As much as history proper, then, it’s through a kind of experimental criticism of both music and visual culture that this piece attempts to capture the textures and moods that jazz brought to the postwar home...|$|R

30|$|Figure  3 is a {{geometric}} {{illustration of}} the state <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse. In what follows, {{it is assumed that}} the increase in the loading parameters does not lead to unloading. It is convenient to divide curve 1 into three segments, namely qk, ks and sw. If the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding occurs at some point of the segment qk, then the only possible mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse is localization <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation at ρ[*]=[*]a. In Figure  3, this mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse corresponds to a point of the line tk. If the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding occurs at some point of the segment sw, then the only possible mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse is the fully plastic disk. In Figure  3, this mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse corresponds to a point of the curve sd. Finally, if the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding occurs at some point of the segment ks, then either mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse is possible. Moreover, both mechanisms occur simultaneously if the values of the loading parameters correspond to point f. A special feature of the solution corresponding to point k is that the plastic collapse occurs by strain localization when the entire disk is elastic (except the line ρ[*]=[*]a). A special feature of the solution corresponding to point s is that the entire disk becomes plastic at the values of the loading parameters corresponding to the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The real values <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> {{properties}} <b>of</b> {{steel sheets}} are basic input parameters for objectification of deep drawing technological processes. The loss <b>of</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties is the criterion <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> steel sheets in most cases. The loss <b>of</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties depends on stress-strain scheme in real conditions of deep drawing of sheets. In the contribution will be evaluated the loss <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties stability <b>of</b> thin double reduced packaging sheets made from low carbon steels. For evaluation <b>of</b> strength and <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> thin packaging sheets is the tensile test most used at present. The material is stressed by uniaxial tension during this test. In {{the conditions of}} technological processes of drawing, which thin packaging sheets are mostly treating, is this way of stress not very objective. In most cases it deals about multiaxial stress of sheet by deformation of sheet to require draw cup. At the present, the biggest problem of thin steel sheets by uniaxial tension test evaluation is the loss <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation stability (localization <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation). Therefore, obtained results <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation during this test do not correspond with real <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> thin steel sheets. In the contribution, will be compared the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> these sheets by uniaxial and biaxial load. Biaxial load is unfavourable from stress point, but less sensitive on loss stability <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation from conditions test influence point...|$|R
