40|$|Rationale and Aims: Grief {{research}} has highlighted the difficult reactions experienced by people bereaved by suicide, with studies {{also looking at}} the importance of sense and meaning making. There is limited research looking at experiences of individual kinships, for example partners {{of people who have}} taken their own lives. The current study therefore aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the experiences of people who have lost a partner to suicide, using a qualitative approach. The research sought to explore the following:What are the experiences of people whose partners have taken their own lives and how do people experience trying to make sense and meaning of their partner???s death? Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with seven participants (two men) who had lost their partner to suicide more than two years previously. Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were then analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: The analysis produced four master themes, including: ???Pervasive impact of loss ??? ???oh god, its such a disaster???; ???The search for understanding ??? ???There are so many questions that are unanswerable, like ???why???????; Challenges and ways of coping ??? ???All the challenges they just come daily, hourly, minute by minute???; and, ???Looking to the future ??? <b>Its</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> turning point for me, and a catalyst for change???. A description of these master themes and the related subordinate themes is presented. Conclusion: The results of the analysis are considered in light of existing theory and their clinical implications...|$|E

This all means that I’m Officer of the Day today, and right now its 7 at night and I’m in Headquarters, all alone, getting caught up on my correspondence like crazy. I received your Christmas letter in tact [sic], {{even though it had}} to be shuttled back and forth [across] the country a couple of times. Let me warn you here and now, that I’m a very poor correspondent (and even a worse typist) …. see what I mean. From the address you sent the Christmas letter to, I better try to get you caught up on my doings the past year. It seems that I was at Basic when I last sent you my address. Well, I graduated from single engine advanced in Jackson, Miss. Last May. From there I went west to Arizona where I took a two week gunnery course. Then up to Victorville, California, which is about 100 miles from Los Angeles, where I stayed until October flying the P- 39 Airacobra, made a couple of ferry trips to Texas and up to Seattle, Washington. You see, the Russians use the P- 39 quite extensively and I guess they picked them up in Seattle. Aside from that, I just hung around getting in the way while I tried to get into an RTU (Replacement Training Unit). I guess they got tired of seeing me mope around because they shipped me down to Williams Field, Arizona where I stayed until November doing some more ferrying—this time of AT- 6 ’s. I reported to Lemoore, Calif. On the 15 th of November. This is the processing in center for the fourth air force, of which I now am a member. I stayed there for another two weeks, and then on December 2 nd, I finally arrived at my goal—RTU, here at Santa Rosa. I’m to get 120 hours in the P- 38 and then overseas. <b>Its</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> long struggle, but now that I’m here, I’m amazed that I’m not dissappointed [sic]. The Lightning is everything that its cracked up to be, and I like it head and shoulders above the other fighters that I’ve flown so far. I guess that brings me up to date, and at the same time, just about runs me out of conversation. Let me again express my thanks for not forgetting me, and if anyone there cares to drop me a line occasionally, I promise to answer within a respectable period.

40|$|INTRODUCTION One of {{the first}} things we agreed to as an {{editorial}} staff was that our university???s literary journal needed an updated title. There was nothing inherently wrong with the name Island Fox, per se, but we preferred something that might better demonstrate the joie de vivre of writing. After batting about a few names, we settled on MYUZ ??? a nod of appreciation to the nine daughters of Zeus ??? the Greek goddesses of artistic inspiration. A muse is something (or someone) every writer needs ??? an inspirational influence to whisper in their ear, to help lift their words and voice above the mundane. During this past year, newspapers, television, and internet blogs have been filled with bad news ??? some of it terrifying. Here in Ventura County we were jolted by the huge loss of life in the Chatsworth Metrolink crash ??? the worst train accident in California history. We have decided to open our journal this year with a non-fiction piece by Joshua Bauer that deals with this tragedy. Bauer begins his first person narrative with a group of friends getting together for a few games of bowling. The Metrolink disaster, which had happened just two days before, is not really on their radar. The story takes a dramatic turn when Katie, a young woman who had been quiet all evening, suddenly reveals the news that a friend of theirs from high school was one of the Metrolink victims. Another short story you???ll be sure to want to check out is Bishara, Avi, Always, Kristi Kellog???s narrative of what happens when a conservative Hindu boy meets a worldly Indian girl hell-bent on winning a major beauty contest. Poetry is well represented in this year???s journal, making up about one-half of the entries. Adam Piccirilli electrifies us with his love poem Arc Eyes, Sara Parker introduces us to the horrors of nursing home life in A Part of Adulthood I???d Rather Avoid, and Krista Wilbur, last year???s managing editor, takes us into the dark, blood-stained alleys of poesie noir with Kaleidoscope. Current events were popular with our submitters this year; Sara Parker comes through again, delivering a sarcastic political elbow-punch with Hooray For Proposition 8, Chris O???Neal tells us the advantages of pet ownership during a recessionary economy in Do Rabbits Dream of Electric People, and Sean Colletti???s esoteric Now Serving Number 44 will have you puzzling over its meaning. Look closely ??? the clues are there. Our editorial committee offers up their own contributions, of course. MYUZ???s mamma capa, Kellie Griffin, brings us into the lives of two young friends {{on their way to a}} blood test in Transposition, Julie Fontes shows us what can happen when you meet up with your past at a downtown club in And Hearts, and Guy MacLaury illustrates the perils of beachcombing after dark in Jamaica with A Walk on the Seven Mile Beach. In addition, Luis Maranan takes us into the gravity-prone forest of One Hundred Hills, there???s the aforementioned reflective non-fiction short story from Joshua Bauer ??? Spared ??? and George Morgan squeezes in a few pages with a story about cul-de-sac culture, helicopters, and Polynesian cannabis in Where the Road Ends. We broke some new ground this year, using technology in innovative ways. This is the first time the CSUCI literary journal has been published by an online publishing company: lulu. com. This will allow copies of MYUZ to be available in perpetuity. All in all we believe our readers will enjoy the writing in this year???s campus journal. <b>It???s</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pleasure putting it together. If you have any comments, or ideas to improve the next one, please write to us at island. fox@csuci. edu. The MYUZ Committe...|$|E
