40|$|SummaryObjectTo {{determine}} whether <b>diacerhein</b> has a disease-modifying effect in an accelerated canine model of osteorthritis. DesignFourteen adult mongrel dogs underwent unilateral L 4 -S 1 dorsal root ganglionectomy (DRG), followed 3 weeks later by ipsilateral {{anterior cruciate ligament}} transection. Seven dogs received <b>diacerhein</b> (15 – 20 mg/kg) daily throughout the interval between DRG and sacrifice, eight weeks after ligament transection. The other seven dogs served as OA controls. ResultsThe mean volume of synovial fluid obtained from the OA knee of the diacerhein-treated dogs was approximately 40 % less than that from the OA knee of the controls. In addition, <b>diacerhein</b> appeared to reduce the severity of fibrillation (femoral condyle) and full-thickness ulceration (trochlear ridge) of the articular cartilage {{and the level of}} collagenase activity in extracts of the OA cartilage, and to increase net PG synthesis in the OA cartilage, although none of the above changes were statistically significant. ConclusionThe differences between the <b>diacerhein</b> group and untreated OA controls, even though not statistically significant, suggest that <b>diacerhein</b> was active in this rapidly progressive model of OA. Because changes associated with initiation of OA may be different than those associated with progression, whether <b>diacerhein</b> has a disease-modifying effect should be examined in a less rapidly progressive model...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} and oxidative stress are striking features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy disease. <b>Diacerhein</b> is an anthraquinone, which exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Based on their actions, {{the present study}} evaluated the effects of <b>diacerhein</b> against myonecrosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response in the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice and compared these results to current treatment widely used in DMD patients, with a main focus {{on the impact of}} prednisone. The results demonstrated that <b>diacerhein</b> treatment prevented muscle damage indicated by a decrease in the IgG uptake by muscle fibers, lower CK levels in serum, reduction of fibers with central nuclei with a concomitant increase in fibers with peripheral nuclei. It also had an effect on the inflammatory process, decreasing the inflammatory area, macrophage staining and TNF-α and IL- 1 β content. Regarding oxidative stress, <b>diacerhein</b> treatment was effective in reducing the ROS and lipid peroxidation in the diaphragm muscle from mdx mice. Compared to prednisone treatment, our findings demonstrated that <b>diacerhein</b> treatment improved the dystrophic phenotype in the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice similar to that of glucocorticoid therapy. In this respect, this work suggests that <b>diacerhein</b> has a potential use as an alternative drug in dystrophinopathy treatment and recommends that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidants properties in the dystrophic muscle should be better understood...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Hyperglycemia and insulin {{resistance}} {{have been associated}} with a worse outcome in sepsis. Although tight glycemic control through insulin therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, the effect of intensive insulin therapy in patients with severe sepsis is controversial because of the increased risk of serious adverse events related to hypoglycemia. Recently, knowledge about <b>diacerhein,</b> an anthraquinone drug with powerful antiinflammatory properties, revealed that this drug improves insulin sensitivity, mediated by the reversal of chronic subclinical inflammation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether the antiinflammatory effects of <b>diacerhein</b> after onset of sepsis-induced glycemic alterations is beneficial and whether the survival rate is prolonged in this situation. Methods: Diffuse sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP) in male Wistar rats. Blood glucose and inflammatory cytokine levels were assessed 24 hours after CLP. The effect of <b>diacerhein</b> on survival of septic animals was investigated in parallel with insulin signaling and its modulators in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Results: Here we demonstrated that <b>diacerhein</b> treatment improves survival during peritoneal-induced sepsis and inhibits sepsis-induced {{insulin resistance}} by improving insulin signaling via increased insulin-receptor substrate- 1 -associated phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation. <b>Diacerhein</b> also decreases the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling that involves upregulation of proinflammatory pathways, such as the I kappa B kinase and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase, which blunts insulin-induced insulin signaling in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Additionally, our data show that this drug promoted downregulation of proinflammatory signaling cascades that culminate in transcription of immunomodulatory factors such interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that <b>diacerhein</b> treatment increases survival and attenuates the inflammatory response with a significant effect on insulin sensitivity. On the basis of efficacy and safety profile, <b>diacerhein</b> represents a novel antiinflammatory therapy for management of insulin resistance in sepsis and a potential approach for future clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Diacerhein,</b> an anti-osteoarthritic agent, {{was tested}} {{for its ability}} to {{suppress}} synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in a model of granuloma-induced cartilage breakdown. Design: 50 TO mice received a subcutaneous implant of cotton-wrapped rat femoral head cartilage for a period of 2 weeks. Animals (N= 10 /group) were dosed daily with either 6 mg/kg p. o. diclofenac or diacetylrhein at 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg p. o. in 0. 1 ml 1 % gum tragacanth which served as a control. Implanted cartilages were assayed for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and hydroxyproline content. The surrounding granulomas were assayed for interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL- 6. Statistical analysis was by Mann–Whitney U test. Results: Diclofenac had no significant effect on GAG or hydroxyproline content of implanted cartilage or on granuloma cytokine concentrations. <b>Diacerhein</b> protected implanted cartilages against hydroxyproline loss, implanted control cartilages contained 220 μg hydroxyproline compared with <b>diacerhein</b> at 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg which produced a 21, 16 and 59 % decrease in hydroxyproline loss compared with non-implanted controls (P< 0. 05, 0. 05 and 0. 001) respectively. <b>Diacerhein</b> also protected against GAG loss at 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, control cartilages contained 134 μg GAG compared with <b>diacerhein</b> at 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg which produced a 24 and 38 % decrease in GAG loss respectively (P< 0. 05 for both). <b>Diacerhein</b> significantly reduced granuloma interleukin- 1 α content at 5 mg/kg (control level of 2. 4 μg/ml reduced by 58 %;P< 0. 05), reduced TNF-α at 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg (reduced by 61 %:P< 0. 01 and 49 %:P< 0. 05 respectively; control level of 469 pg/ml) and reduced IL- 6 at 15 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg (control level of 537 pg/ml reduced by 60 and 51 %, respectively;P< 0. 01 for both). Conclusions: The mechanism of the chondroprotective effects of <b>diacerhein</b> is not understood but may be explained by a reduction in the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diacerhein,</b> {{a poorly}} water soluble {{antirheumatic}} prodrug, was spectroscopically characterized to form inclusion complexes with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) in both aqueous solution and in solid phase. Complexation with the hydrophilic carriers {{was used to}} improve the solubility and dissolution rate of the compound. The kinetics of the prodrug degradation to the active rhein in aqueous buffer solution were also investigated {{as a function of}} HPβCD concentration. The solid complexes prepared by different methods such as physical mixture, kneading, co-evaporation method and freeze dried method in 1 : 1 M ratio, were characterized by DSC and FTIR. The dissolution profiles of solid complexes were determined and compared with <b>diacerhein</b> alone and their physical mixture, in the simulated intestinal fluid at 37 C. The accurate molecular spectroscopic characterization of <b>diacerhein</b> in the presence of different amounts of aqueous cyclodextrins was essential to determine the correct binding constants for the diacerhein/HPβCD system. The binding constants were also validated by UV spectrometry and HPLC procedure in order to compare the values from the different methods.

40|$|Obesity {{and type}} 2 {{diabetes}} are characterized by insulin resistance, and the common basis of these events is a chronic and systemic inflammatory process marked by the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and inhibitor-kappa B kinase (IKK beta) /nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B) pathways, up-regulated cytokine synthesis, and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of <b>diacerhein</b> administration, an antiinflammatory drug that reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines, on insulin sensitivity and signaling in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Swiss mice were fed with conventional chow (control group) or a high-fat diet (DIO group). Later, DIO mice were randomly subdivided into a new subgroup (DAR) that received 20 mg/kg <b>diacerhein</b> for 10 d. Western blotting was used to quantify the expression and phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, and Akt and of inflammatory mediators that modulate insulin signaling in a negative manner (IKK beta, JNK, and inducible nitric oxide synthase). We show here, for the first time, that the administration of <b>diacerhein</b> in DIO mice improved endoplasmic reticulum stress, reduced JNK and IKK beta phosphorylation, and resulted in a marked improvement in fasting glucose, a decrease in macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, and a reduced expression and activity of proinflammatory mediators accompanied by an improvement in the insulin signaling mainly in the liver and adipose tissue. Taken together, these results indicate that <b>diacerhein</b> treatment improves insulin sensitivity in obesity, mediated by the reversal of subclinical inflammation, and that this drug may be an alternative therapy for insulin resistance.

40|$|AbstractObjective IL- 1 β plays a {{fundamental}} role in osteoarthritis (OA) pathophysiology and cartilage destruction. Targeting the activation mechanism of this cytokine {{appears to be}} important as a therapeutic approach. As the interleukin- 1 converting enzyme (ICE) is the physiologic modulator of the production of active IL- 1 β, we investigated the effect of <b>diacerhein</b> and its active metabolite rhein used in the treatment of OA patients, on the enzyme expression and synthesis on human OA cartilage. Further, we looked at the effect of both drugs on the production of the active form of IL- 1 β and IL- 18. Methods The expression and synthesis of ICE were investigated on human OA cartilage explants using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemical methods, respectively. The effect of the drugs on ICE OA chondrocytes was also determined by Northern blotting and a specific ELISA assay. Furthermore, the effect of both drugs on the level of active IL- 1 β and IL- 18 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Results Data showed that <b>diacerhein</b> and rhein have no true effect on reducing total ICE mRNA by both Northern blotting analysis and in-situ hybridization. A marked and statistically significant decrease was, however, found for protein production. ELISA showed a reduction of 31 % (P< 0. 04) for <b>diacerhein</b> and 50 % (P< 0. 02) for rhein. The drugs' immunohistological cell score reduction was similar to data from the ELISA, and a statistical significant reduction of ICE production was found at both superficial and deep zones of the cartilage. IL- 1 β and IL- 18 were both preferentially produced in chondrocytes of the superficial zone. For each of these cytokines, both drugs demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in this zone. A marked decrease was also noted in the deep zone, but statistical significance was reached only for rhein. Conclusion These results provide a novel regulatory mechanism by which <b>diacerhein</b> and rhein could exert a down-regulation on IL- 1 's effect on OA cartilage...|$|E

All patients completed the WOMAC, Lequesne, and visual analogue pain scale (VAS) questionnaires at baseline and after six months treatment. All patients were treated with <b>diacerhein</b> and analgesics (according to pain), orthotics (when indicated), and an educational program on osteoarthritis. They were instructed on balanced diet and exercise {{at least three times}} a week. RESULTS: There was no significant BMI variation in this study. The higher the initial BMI, the lower the improvement in pain (p = 0. 03). Pain did not improve significantly (p = 0. 2). Function improved (p < 0. 001) in inverse ratio to the initial BMI.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the chondroprotective effect of {{diacerein}} and glucosamine regarding degenerative changes and articular stiffness in an experimental model of arthritis. METHODS: Twenty rats underwent medial meniscectomy on the right knee. Ten animals were given <b>diacerhein,</b> and 10 were given glucosamine, from day 1 to the third month postoperatively, when all of them were killed. Histological and functional analysis of the knees were performed (measurement of maximum extension). RESULTS: All operated knees showed more limited extension values and more degenerative changes as compared to nonoperated contralateral sides. A comparison of the two drugs showed that the degree of articular stiffness was significantly lower with diacerein, although degenerative changes were similar.

40|$|ABSTRACTClinical {{treatment}} for osteoarthritis (OA) {{is very important}} {{and is based on}} patient’s self care and guided by the physician. Drug therapy is additional to losing weight, improving muscular strength, proprioception, flexibility and range of motion. Between the available drugs for osteoarthritis’ treatment, some are basically analgesics and do not interfere on disease’s progression; some are anti-inflammatory with good analgesic power but with side effects that compromise their prolonged usage; and the structure modifying drugs that slow down the progression of OA. The medications are presented in topic, oral, intra-muscular, intra-venous and intra-articular forms. The hyaluronic acid has various presentations with good analgesic effect and some evidence of structure modifying property. There is IA evidence level for the use of <b>diacerhein</b> and of glucosamine to slow down the disease.

40|$|Iron Regulatory Proteins (IRPs), by {{modulating}} {{expression of}} ferritin, which stores excess iron in a non toxic form, and transferrin receptor, which controls iron uptake, {{are the main}} controller of cellular iron metabolism. During inflammation, modification of IRP activity may affect iron availability, free radical generation and cytokine gene response in inflammatory cells. In the present study we tested the effect of inflammatory stimuli on IRP function in a human monocytic-macrophagic cell line {{and the possibility of}} interfering with these pathways by using an antiinflammatory compound, <b>diacerhein</b> (DAR). IRP activity was enhanced by interferon gamma/lipopolysaccarhide (IFN/LPS), and this effect was consistently counteracted by increasing concentrations of DAR. No direct effect of DAR on IRP activity was found in vitro. However, in vivo, similar IRP activation was achieved by exposing cells to nitric oxide (NO) donors and the LPS/IFN-induced activation of IRP was reversed by NO inhibitors. Interestingly, NO-induced IRP activation was efficiently blocked by DAR.

40|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{efficient}} treatment that could stop the pathological process of osteoarthritis (OA), and {{the management of the}} disease is mainly based on the alleviation of clinical symptoms by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics compounds.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{musculoskeletal}} diseases and causes of lameness in the dogs. The osteoarthritic disease process involves the entire synovial joint, encompassing the synovium, cartilage and underlying bone. Joint failure results from an abnormal mechanical strain causing damage to normal tissue or failure of pathologically impaired articular cartilage and bone under the influence of normal physiological strain or a combination of both. In both cases, the end point is cartilage loss and joint impairment. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes show an altered phenotype characterised by an excess production of catabolic factors, including metalloproteinases and reactive oxygen species. These factors constitute potential therapeutic targets and some new drugs and nutraceuticals have been proposed to promote the return to homeostasis. Until now, the therapeutic management of OA in dogs has been dominated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but some new compounds, including <b>diacerhein,</b> with potential structure-modifying effects, are already used to treat OA in humans and could be helpful to manage OA in the dog. In addition, novel nutraceuticals, such as avocado/soybean unsaponifiable substances, have shown symptomatic effects in knee OA in humans, and could offer an alternative to prevent OA progression.

40|$|Abstract. Animal {{models have}} proved to be of {{considerable}} importance in elucidating mechanisms underlying joint damage in osteoarthritis (OA) and providing proof of concept in the development of pharmacologic and biologic agents that may modify structural damage in the OA joint. The utility of animal models in predicting the response to an intervention with a drug or biologic agent in humans, however, can be established only after evidence is obtained of a positive effect of the agent in humans. To date, no agent has been shown unequivocally to have such an effect, although <b>diacerhein</b> and glucosamine have recently been reported to lower the rate of loss of articular cartilage in patients with hip OA and knee OA, respectively, based on measurements of the rate of joint space narrowing in plain radiographs. Furthermore, the predominant manifestation of OA – and the feature that leads people with radiographic changes of the disease to decide to seek medical attention and contributes to the enormous medicoeconomic and socioeconomic burden imposed by the disease – is joint pain. Notably, none of the animal models of OA is a good indicator of the analgesic effects of pharmacologic agents. Indeed, it should not be assumed a priori that reduction in the rate of progression of joint damage in OA will be associated with a reduction in joint pain. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of them, the active metabolite of <b>diacerhein,</b> on the metabolic functions of human chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads. Enzymatically isolated ostcoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads in a well-defined culture medium for 12 days. Rhein was tested in a range of concentrations comprised between 10 (- 7) and 4 x 10 (- 5) M, in {{the presence or absence of}} 10 (- 10) M IL- 1 beta. Interleukin (IL) - 6 and - 8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP- 1 beta), stromelysin- 1 (MMP- 3), aggrecan (AGG), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 (TIMP- 1), prostaglandin E- 2 (PGE(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) productions were assayed. Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA steady-state levels were also quantified. In the basal condition, 10 (- 5) M them increased by 46. 5 % the production of AGG, decreased by 17 - 30 % the production of IL- 6, MMP- 3, NO and MIP- 1 beta but enhanced by 50 % the production of PGE 2 (.) IL- 1 beta increased IL- 6, IL- 8, MIP- 1 beta, NO, PGE(2) and MMP- 3 productions, but inhibited AGG and TIMP- 1 synthesis. Rhein partially reversed the effect of IL- 1 beta on TIMP- 1 and NO production, had no effect on AGG, IL- 6 and MIP- 1 P production, but upregulated the IL- 1 beta stimulated PGE(2) production. The COX- 2 and iNOS mRNA levels and IL- 8 production were not modified by rhein. Overall, these results contribute to explain the clinical efficiency of rhein and give new information on its mechanisms of action. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|AbstractObjective A new micro-histological {{method of}} {{assessing}} the sulfated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG) content in unstained histological sections of articular cartilage {{was developed and}} used to {{study the effects of}} orally administered <b>Diacerhein</b> (DIA) on joint cartilage in an ovine model of osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Twenty adult, age-matched Merino wethers were subjected to bilateral lateral meniscectomy, while 10 served as non-operated controls (NOC groups). Half of the operated sheep (N= 10) remained untreated (MEN groups), while the other 10 animals were given DIA (25 mg/kg orally) daily for 3 months, then 50 mg/kg daily for a further 6 months (DIA groups). Five animals each of the DIA, MEN and NOC groups, respectively, were sacrificed at 3 months post-operatively, and the remainder 6 months later. For the present study only one knee joint of each animal was used for histological processing. The tissues studied were from the lateral femoral condyles (LFC) and lateral tibial plateaux (LTP). Each of these joint regions was further subdivided into inner (I), middle (M), and outer (O) zones. Unstained histological sections from these AC regions and zones were then analysed for S-GAG content using the following procedure. Images of each section of 6 μm thickness were acquired using a flatbed scanner and the area determined with an image analysis software program. The sections were then transferred to wells of a microtiter plate, digested with papain and the S-GAG content quantitated using a modification of the 1, 9 -dimethylmethylene blue dye binding assay. The data was represented as μg S-GAG/mm 3 of each tissue section. These data were also compared with toluidine blue stained sections from the same paraffin blocks. Results The results obtained showed that the area of histological sections could be very accurately determined by computer assisted image analysis using a 10 mm× 10 mm calibration grid. Cartilage sections of areas ranging from 1 mm 2 up to 25 mm 2 were analysed for S-GAG content with this simple technique. There was a linear relationship between section thickness (2 – 10 μm) and S-GAG content per unit area (R 2 = 0. 993). Sections of 6 μm thickness were found to be optimal. S-GAG analyses of serial sections from tibial and femoral articular cartilage (I, M and O zones) revealed an average coefficient of variation of 7. 0 ± 2. 3 % (range 4. 9 – 10. 2 %) confirming the accuracy and reproducibility of this assay method. A separate experiment showed that no significant losses of S-GAG occurred during the histological sample processing. The different regions and zones of the knee joint AC in the six experimental groups revealed variable levels of S-GAG which did not necessarily correlate with the histochemical distribution of toluidine blue staining. The major S-GAG changes occurred in the middle (lesion zone) and outer zones (hypertrophic zone) of both the LFC and LTP of the MEN groups. In the lesion (M) zone the S-GAG content was reduced while in the O zone levels were increased at both 3 and 6 months post-surgery. In animals receiving <b>Diacerhein</b> S-GAG levels in the M zone were lower than or equivalent to those of non-drug treated OA or non-operated controls for both joint regions at 3 and 6 months. While the hypertrophic response in the outer zone of the LFC, as assessed by S-GAG content, was enhanced by drug treatment, the cartilage of the outer zones of the LTP was not affected by drug treatment. Conclusion The results of this study have demonstrated that the S-GAG (and therefore proteoglycan [PG]) content in different cartilage zones of OA joints can be readily quantitated by direct biochemical analysis of unstained histological sections. By this means subtle changes in PG distribution in different cartilage zones, which were not evident using traditional histochemical staining methods, could be readily detected...|$|E
30|$|In our study, also uCTX-I has {{demonstrated}} itself interesting. Recently, {{as a matter}} of fact, the presence of bone resorption has been recognized as a risk factor for OA progression. A recent study [15] demonstrated that general bone resorption, indicated by serum biomarker measurements, is increased in patients with progressive knee OA. These results confirmed the role of bone changes in the pathogenesis of OA. It is generally believed that degeneration of cartilage in OA is characterized by two phases: a biosynthetic phase during which the cells resident in cartilage, the chondrocytes, attempt to repair the damaged extracellular matrix; and a degradation phase, in which the activity of enzymes produced by the chondrocytes digests the matrix, matrix synthesis is inhibited, and the consequent erosion of the cartilage is accelerated. The cellular reaction pattern during the osteoarthritic disease process is at first glance rather heterogeneous. However, the reaction patterns can basically be summarized in five categories: (a) proliferation and cell death (apoptosis), (b) changes in synthetic activity, (c) changes in degradation, (d) phenotypic modulation of the articular chondrocytes, and (e) formation of osteophyte. Several factors such as retinoic acid, bromodeoxyuridine and IL- 1, induce so-called “dedifferentiation” or modulation of the chondrocytes phenotype to a fibroblast-like phenotype. The chondrocytes stop expressing aggrecan and collagen type II, though they are still very active cells and express collagen types I, III and V [16]. Some AA [17] have reviewed the evidence that OA abnormal osteoblasts are responsible: (a) to maintain the abnormal mineralization, (b) to release factors that can modify both osteoblasts and chondrocytes functions and (c) to degrade articular cartilage. OA osteoblasts release more IL- 6, CXCL 12, CXCL 13 and leptin that can also directly modulate COLLI synthesis, promote articular cartilage degradation and contribute to inflammatory state observed in OA. Production of an abnormal collagen matrix and a soluble factor(s) by OA osteoblasts leads to an abnormal osteoid matrix not mineralizing normally. This putative factor(s) contributes to cartilage degradation but also to abnormal osteoblasts cell function, measurable also as uCTX-I. Marcelli et al. [18] underline the relationship between hand OA and bone mineral density and Zoli et al. [19] confirm it also in hand EOA, a destructive form of primary OA. The most important problem for therapy is the large pathogenetic process number. Obviously therapeutic intervention in order to control both joint cartilage collagen content and bone content have to be considered in OA management. Numerous pharmaceutical and nutriceutical agents [20] have been developed and are used also in combination, to improve the efficacy in delaying the progression of structural changes in OA cartilage [21, 22]. Actually many AA have described the efficacy and potential disease-modifying effect of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, avocado soybean unsaponifiables, <b>diacerhein,</b> intraarticular hyaluronan, ginger, doxycycline, ascorbic acid, manganese, growth factors [23].|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo update {{evidence}} for available therapies {{in the treatment}} of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to examine whether research evidence has changed from 31 January 2006 to 31 January 2009. MethodsA systematic literature search was undertaken using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Science Citation Index and the Cochrane Library. The quality of studies was assessed. Effect sizes (ESs) and numbers needed to treat were calculated for efficacy. Relative risks, hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios were estimated for side effects. Publication bias and heterogeneity were examined. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to compare the evidence pooled in different years and different qualities. Cumulative meta-analysis was used to examine the stability of evidence. ResultsSixty-four systematic reviews, 266 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 new economic evaluations (EEs) were published between 2006 and 2009. Of 51 treatment modalities, new data on efficacy have been published for more than half (26 / 39, 67 %) of those for which research evidence was available in 2006. Among non-pharmacological therapies, ES for pain relief was unchanged for self-management, education, exercise and acupuncture. However, with new evidence the ES for pain relief for weight reduction reached statistical significance, increasing from 0. 13 [95 % confidence interval (CI) − 0. 12, 0. 36] in 2006 to 0. 20 (95 % CI 0. 00, 0. 39) in 2009. By contrast, the ES for electromagnetic therapy which was large in 2006 (ES= 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 36, 1. 17) was no longer significant (ES= 0. 16, 95 % CI − 0. 08, 0. 39). Among pharmacological therapies, the cumulative {{evidence for}} the benefits and harms of oral and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <b>diacerhein</b> and intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid was not greatly changed. The ES for pain relief with acetaminophen diminished numerically, but not significantly, from 0. 21 (0. 02, 0. 41) to 0. 14 (0. 05, 0. 22) and was no longer significant when analysis was restricted to high quality trials (ES= 0. 10, 95 % CI − 0. 0, 0. 23). New evidence for increased risks of hospitalisation due to perforation, peptic ulceration and bleeding with acetaminophen > 3 g/day have been published (HR= 1. 20, 95 % CI 1. 03, 1. 40). ES for pain relief from IA hyaluronic acid, glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and avocado soybean unsponifiables also diminished and there was greater heterogeneity of outcomes and more evidence of publication bias. Among surgical treatments further negative RCTs of lavage/debridement were published and the pooled results demonstrated that benefits from this modality of therapy were no greater than those obtained from placebo. ConclusionPublication of a large amount of new research evidence has resulted in changes in the calculated risk–benefit ratio for some treatments for OA. Regular updating of research evidence can help to guide best clinical practice...|$|E
