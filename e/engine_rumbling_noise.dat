50|$|There was an {{increase}} in seismicity in 1970 accompanied by <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises</b> in Malinao prompting an issue of warning that the mountain might be reactivating. The tremors detected were ranging from 1 to 5 in intensity.|$|R
50|$|Outside, Haresh and Gita are standing; Haresh tells Gita that Sarah Jane wouldn't run off, {{and that}} Rani is {{probably}} {{with her right}} now. A <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> makes them look up: they see large meteors falling through the sky.|$|R
50|$|Thunder is able {{to control}} thunder as he manifests as <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises</b> which he can control to varying degrees. Lightning {{is able to}} release bolts of {{electricity}} and harness lightning. The two have a psychic link {{that allows them to}} communicate with each other.|$|R
50|$|During a yawn, the tensor tympani {{muscle in}} the middle ear contracts, {{creating}} a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> from within the head. Yawning is sometimes accompanied, both in humans and animals, by an instinctive act of stretching several parts of the body, including arms, neck, shoulders and back.|$|R

5000|$|Growling or growl is a low, {{guttural}} vocalization {{produced by}} predatory animals {{as a warning}} to others, as a sign of aggression, or to express anger. Low or dull <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises</b> may also be emitted by human beings when discontent with something or angry. The human sound is often termed [...] "groaning".|$|R
5000|$|The {{earthquake}} {{happened at}} daybreak ... and {{was preceded by}} a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> like the discharge of a heavy cannon in the distance ...

60|$|Meanwhile the sultry heat {{of which}} Joe had {{formerly}} spoken increased considerably, and a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise,</b> as if of distant thunder, was heard; but the flying hunters {{paid no attention}} to it, for the led horses gave them so much trouble, and retarded their flight so much, that the Indians were gradually and visibly gaining on them.|$|R
5000|$|In the wild, {{chimpanzees}} {{have been}} seen [...] "talking" [...] to each other when warning about approaching danger. For example, if one chimpanzee sees a snake, he makes a low, <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise,</b> signaling {{for all the other}} chimps to climb into nearby trees. In this case, the chimpanzees' communication does not indicate displacement, as it is entirely contained to an observable event.|$|R
60|$|The {{camp was}} pitched {{and the rest}} of the day given up to writing voluminous {{accounts}} of the marvel, and correcting astronomical tables to fit it. Toward midnight a demoniacal shriek was heard, then a clattering and <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise,</b> and the next instant a vast terrific eye shot by, with a long tail attached, and disappeared in the gloom, still uttering triumphant shrieks.|$|R
60|$|It {{happened}} to be a fashionable night and the place was crammed. On the level with us--we were in a box--were rows {{of men and women in}} evening attire; above, a somewhat disorderly mob in the gallery; and below, a dense throng--at least, it seemed so to me--of seated people were betraying their impatience for the performance by a continual stamping of feet and other <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... 23 July 2010: Tavurvur cone erupted, {{starting}} at time 1300. The eruption began with discharge of diffuse white plumes, followed by pink-gray fumes with low ash content. A strong odor of hydrogen sulfide was noted, and a diffuse cloud rose 1 km and drifted NW. A few hours later, observers saw billowing gray clouds, accompanied by roaring and <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises.</b> Ashfall {{was reported in}} areas to the cone's NW and NNW.|$|R
6000|$|So {{when the}} giants had gone he swept and tidied {{the camp and}} put some venison on the fire to roast. At midday, when the sun was right overhead, he heard a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> from the river, and looking up he saw the head and {{shoulders}} of an enormous man emerging from it. And behold! right down the river-bed and up the river-bed, till they faded into the blue distance, stretched the giant's grey moustaches! ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment there arose from the streets a cry, or wail. Suddenly a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> was heard. Lawrence bounded towards the nearest door. Full well he knew what it meant.

Lawrence just saw the walls and roof collapsing--then all was dark, and consciousness forsook him.|$|R
5000|$|Cavallo noted {{both that}} the meteor, which was visible for around thirty seconds in total, {{appeared}} to split into several smaller bodies {{immediately following the}} main mass and that a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise,</b> [...] "as it were of thunder at a great distance", was heard around ten minutes after the meteor appeared, which he speculated [...] "was {{the report of the}} meteor's explosion". Other accounts, such as those of Alexander Aubert and Richard Lovell Edgeworth, noted red and blue colour tints in the fireball.|$|R
60|$|It was not {{surprising}} that even {{the hearts of the}} allied troops were appalled at the new and extraordinary dangers which they had to face at the siege of Tournai; and the bravest were indeed exposed to the greatest danger. The first to mount a breach, to effect a lodgment in an outwork, to enter a newly discovered mine, was sure to perish. First there was a low <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise,</b> then the earth heaved, and whole companies were scattered with a frightful explosion.|$|R
50|$|Residents of {{the worst}} {{affected}} areas, including parts of Shrewsbury, reported lateral shaking and swaying to the walls of their houses {{at the height of}} the tremor, which was preceded and then accompanied by a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> that gained strength over a period of 15 to 30 seconds before reaching and sustaining peak intensity during the most severe shaking. Finally, the movement and accompanying sound tailed off much more rapidly than it had first built up, stopping altogether within just a few seconds from the peak activity.|$|R
60|$|The {{hours of}} the night sped on, borne on the {{weighted}} feet of anguish and of horror. Gradually, one by one, the sounds in and about the house died away; the slaves in their quarters must have turned over on their rough pallets and gone to sleep, the women close by had done gossiping, only from the vestibule came the slow measured tread of the watchmen guarding the Augusta's house, and from far away that ceaseless, <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> which meant that discontent was awake and astir.|$|R

30|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that cross-laminated timber structures are sensitive to <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises.</b> These transmissions are best captured by a fully three-dimensional mathematical model. Since the discretization of such models with hexahedral elements in a conforming manner is highly complex, we chose the mortar method to reduce the algorithmic complexity for the mesh generation. Moreover we consider high-order finite elements {{in order to deal}} with the high aspect ratios in three-dimensionally resolved, cross-laminated walls and slabs. The geometric models and material specification was derived from a building information model.|$|R

50|$|Yayo, Miyouke Yasutarō's wife, was {{preparing}} a late meal while carrying her fourth son, Umekichi, on her back. She heard a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> outside, {{but before she}} could investigate, the bear broke through a window and entered the house. The cook pot on the hearth was overturned, dousing the flames, and in the ensuing panic the oil lamp was put out as well, plunging the house into darkness. Yayo tried to flee the house, but her second son, Yūjirō, clung to her legs, tripping her as she ran. The bear attacked her and bit Umekichi.|$|R
5000|$|During new and [...] full moons, {{when the}} river is {{relatively}} less deep and the ocean tide is high, water flows in from the Atlantic, {{rather than the other}} way around. As river and ocean collide, the Amazon’s flow reverses and a water bulge speeds upstream with incredible force, forming a tidal bore with <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise.</b> The tidal phenomenon is best observed on biannual equinoxes in September and March. On an equinox, when the Moon and Sun fall into alignment with the Earth, their gravitational pull is combined, bringing the Pororoca to its peak.|$|R

60|$|One {{day he was}} {{standing}} looking at the mountain opposite, {{when he heard a}} kind of <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> in the room behind him. He turned round, and in the corner he beheld a rusty old iron kettle, which could not have seen the light of day for many years. How the kettle got there the old man did not know, but he took it up and looked it over carefully, and when he found that it was quite whole he cleaned the dust off it and carried it into his kitchen.|$|R
60|$|It came at last, {{with the}} suddenness and almost {{the force of}} an explosion. A faint <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> was first heard, a white line of foam {{was seen in the}} distance; and then, with a roar and a crash, the {{hurricane}} was upon them. The vessel reeled over so far under the blow that, for a time, all on board thought that she would capsize. The two sailors at the helm, however, held on sturdily; and at last her head drifted off on the wind, and she flew along before its force.|$|R

As they drive on the highway, the agents are surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise</b> is heard as a mysterious craft flies overhead and a bright light from the object passes over them.

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{elephants}} can also mimic sounds they hear. The discovery was found when Mlaika, an orphaned elephant, would copy the sound of trucks passing by. So far, the only other animals that are thought to mimic sounds are whales, dolphins, bats, primates and birds.Calimero, an African elephant who was 23 years old, also exhibited a unique form of mimicry. He was in a Swiss zoo with some Asian elephants. Asian elephants use chirps that are different from African elephants' deep <b>rumbling</b> <b>noises.</b> Calimero also began to chirp and not make the deep calls that his species normally would.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the second}} Sunday in October that the storm burst over the Lord Giovanni's head. He {{was on the}} point of leaving the Castle to attend Mass at San Domenico, and in his company were Filippo Sforza of Santafior and Madonna Paola, besides courtiers and attendants, amounting in all to perhaps a score of gallant cavaliers and ladies. The cavalcade was drawn up in the quadrangle, and Giovanni was {{on the point of}} mounting, when, of a sudden, a <b>rumbling</b> <b>noise,</b> as of distant thunder, but too {{continuous}} for that, arrested him, his foot already in the stirrup.|$|R
