25|$|Admission is {{strictly}} merit-based, {{and the university}} has several departments which are known for higher-than-average selectiveness. Numerus clausus is applied to select among competing applicants. To such study programmes like those of medicine, pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and architecture, admission is an extraordinarily difficult process, and demand a minimum grade point average from high school plus the entrance exams, that usually ranges from 170 to 200 (out of 200). Acceptance rates may vary significantly from faculty to faculty or from department to department. Foreign applicants usually {{make up more than}} 10 percent of the applicant pool, and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective state of origin or through bilateral protocols between the governments of Portugal and foreign governments. There are also a number of other extraordinary admission processes <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> (admission for candidates older than 23 years old), sportsmen, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), etc., which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each department or faculty.|$|E
25|$|Robert M. Ball, {{a former}} {{commissioner}} of Social Security under President Kennedy in 1961 (and later under Johnson, and Nixon) defined the {{major obstacle to}} financing health insurance for the elderly: {{the high cost of}} care for the aged combined with the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance {{in the same way as}} cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment. In the early 1960s relatively few of the elderly had health insurance, and what they had was usually inadequate. Insurers such as Blue Cross, which had originally applied the principle of community rating, faced competition from other commercial insurers that did not community rate, and so were forced to raise their rates for the elderly.|$|E

After a brief unsuccessful nomination of Walter Waetjen to replace Dr. Love, and Academic Vice President Walker acting as president for 197172, Brage Golding became the new president. He served from 1972 to 1977, and although he did not implement any mainstream changes as prior presidents had, he was instrumental in bringing in qualified administrators who would improve the school during its upcoming years. He worked to establish the San Diego History Research Center for collecting materials on the city's history and established the Educational Growth Opportunities program which offered classes <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> At Golding's leaving of the university, one person commented: [...] "By the end of the five-year administration, San Diego State University had grown into the institution implied by its name.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> everyday {{routines and}} their implications <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> uses {{and perceptions of}} domestic spaces in both mainstream and sheltered housing settings. It draws from qualitative data collected during a large-scale survey of the housing and support needs of <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> and specifically the responses of 60 informants to personal interviews. The findings are that domestic spaces have a significant influence on the scope that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> have to retain a sense of self-determination. It is shown that environmental defects, such as poorly configured domestic spaces, have consequences <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> sense of continuity and choice. The conclusions are that domestic spaces are living spaces that embody personal and family-oriented priorities. It is suggested that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> require adequate, accessible and personalised domestic spaces {{in order to facilitate}} three important objectives: routines, responsibilities and reflection...|$|R

2500|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{controversy}} about flourishes, including from some square dance leaders who feel that flourishes divert dancers from dancing according to the standard. [...] Unusual, unknown or uncommon flourishes may disturb dancers unaccustomed to them, or might be considered disruptive. [...] Some flourishes can be physically challenging and are therefore potentially damaging, such as unexpected twirls and rough handling, especially <b>for</b> <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> [...] Some flourishes are perceived as not fitting to the expected timing, giving some dancers a less than optimum dance experience. [...] At higher dance levels, differences in body flow due to a flourish can interfere with proper execution of a call, as with [...] "dosado three-quarters". [...] For any of these reasons, dancers may ask that flourishes be limited while they are dancing.|$|E

Methods/Approach: Sets of functional regions were modelled for each year in the analysed period using the Intramax method. Functional regions were evaluated based on the attractiveness of central places for labour commuters and the propensity to commute between regions. Results: The results show that in addition to the nominally declared regional centres of Slovenia, there are also some other local centres that should be potentially included in the functional areas <b>for</b> servicing <b>old</b> <b>people.</b> Conclusions: The results suggest that the regionalization into seven functional regions is the most convenient <b>for</b> servicing <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in the region.
