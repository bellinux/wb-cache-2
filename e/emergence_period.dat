5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E

50|$|The nymphs {{emerge in}} large numbers about the same time, {{sometimes}} more than 1.5 million individuals per acre (>370/m²). Their mass emergence is a survival trait called predator satiation: {{for the first week}} after emergence, the periodical cicadas are an easy prey for reptiles, birds, squirrels, cats, and other small and large mammals. Early ideas maintained that the cicadas' overall survival mechanism was simply to overwhelm predators by their sheer numbers, ensuring the survival of most of the individuals. The <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> of large prime numbers (13 and 17 years) was hypothesized to be a predator avoidance strategy adopted to eliminate the possibility of potential predators receiving periodic population boosts by synchronizing their own generations to divisors of the cicada <b>emergence</b> <b>period.</b> Another viewpoint holds that the prime-numbered developmental times represent an adaptation to prevent hybridization between broods with different cycles during a period of heavy selection pressure brought on by isolated and lowered populations during Pleistocene glacial stadia, and that predator satiation is a short-term maintenance strategy. This hypothesis was subsequently supported through a series of mathematical models, and stands as the most widely accepted explanation of the unusually lengthy and mathematically precise immature period of these insects. The length of the cycle was hypothesized to be controlled by a single gene locus, with the 13-year cycle dominant to the 17-year one, but this interpretation remains controversial and unexplored at the DNA level.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{season for}} this bee ranges from the later months of winter to early spring. The bee is {{univoltine}} - it produces only one brood per breeding season. After remaining dormant {{until the following}} winter, the brood which had been laid the previous year emerges and begins the flight season and mating process. The males of the species will emerge from the nests before their female counterparts. Additionally, the minor males, with head widths less than 6.3 mm, tended to emerge before the major males, with head widths greater than 6.3 mm, {{over the course of}} the entire breeding season. Even within the span of single days in the <b>emergence</b> <b>period,</b> minor males tended to surface earlier in the day than major males. This may be due to an evolutionary pressure which forces smaller males to emerge earlier than their larger counterparts to avoid competition for mating with larger individuals. Male emergence is also prolonged, and can last several weeks into the flight season. This results in a large amount of emergence overlap between males and females of the species. This might be due to the increased fitness of late-emerging males to mate with females later in the season, given that the early-emerging competition would already have died.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to predict interannual fluctuations {{in the size of}} sea-trout fry when they emerged from the redd, using models developed from field data for 70 excavated redds (≥three per year), and from experimental data on egg and alevin development at 30 constant temperatures in the laboratory (range 1 · 5 — 10 · 5) C with 100 naturally fertilized eggs at each temperature). Egg weight increased with female length and also with the number of eggs laid in a redd, both relationships being well described by a power function. Early spawners were the largest females laying the largest and most numerous eggs, whilst late spawners were the smallest females laying the smallest and least numerous eggs, with middle spawners being intermediate between these two extremes. Mean values for egg weight and number of eggs per redd were obtained for these three groups. The numbers of early, middle and late spawners for each year of a 30 -year study and the mean values from the excavated redds were used to estimate weighted means for the number of eggs per unit area and egg weight. Mean values varied considerably between years (30 -year ranges: 518 – 7964 eggs per 60 m 2; 112 – 138 mg wet weight). In the laboratory, mean weights of newly hatched alevins and newly emerged fry were both related positively to mean egg weights. Alevin and fry mean weights were independent of the number of days required for 50 % of the eggs to hatch or fry to emerge. Models described in a previous paper formed the basis of those used to predict fry weights over the <b>emergence</b> <b>period.</b> Model predictions were validated by field data for the whole <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> in 8 years (1967 – 1971, 1974, 1975, 1980), and by pre-fry weights on single dates in 21 years (1967 – 1987).

The elevation of Site I was 700 ft. while the lowest site was located at 225 ft. Monthly benthos samples were taken for one year from a riffle and glide section at each site using a stovepipe sampler (6 in. dia.) and a standard tropical fish net. Samples were sorted in the laboratory and Plecoptera identified and placed into 1 mm size classes. Emergence of adults was measured for 13 months using a tent-shaped trap (1 m²) at each site. Traps were checked once or twice weekly. Forty-two species of Plecoptera were found in Oak Creek. The number of species is very large when compared with other studies. The stonefly fauna is fairly similar to that reported 35 years ago. Thirty-seven of the 42 species complete emergence during the spring. Temporal separation is marked in the <b>emergence</b> <b>periods</b> of Nemoura and Leuctra. Examples of split <b>emergence</b> <b>periods</b> and early <b>emergence</b> of males were found.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{hypothesis}} is explored that lodgepole pine at the seedling <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> is {{more resistant to}} low temperatures than ponderosa pine. Differential tolerance between species to low temperatures is then related to the prevalence of lodgepole pine in frost pocket areas in central Oregon {{to the exclusion of}} ponderosa pine. Tolerance thresholds to low temperatures for both species were determined in a controlled environment chamber. The chamber, designed specifically for this study, had separate controls for air and soil temperatures. With soil heated to 32 °F, air temperature could be lowered, with lights out, to a minimum of about 13 °F. Controlled environment chamber treatments consisted of exposing groups of uniformly reared seedlings of each species to nighttime low temperatures of 13 °F to 30 °F. Seedling groups varied in age by two-week intervals for comparisons of differences between seedling development stages. These experiments showed that differential tolerance to low temperatures occurred at 15 °F to 18 °F. About twice as many ponderosa seedlings were killed as lodge pole, with ponderosa mortality occasionally approaching 100 percent. At warmer temperatures up to 23 °F ponderosa mortality continued to be substantially greater than that of lodgepole, but number of seedling deaths was low. Treatments above 23 °F caused little or no injury to either species. During emergence youngest seedlings of each species survived low temperatures better than older seedlings. Fall treatment of seedlings reared in outside planting beds ai 1 ed to show any signs of injury from 15 °F treatments. These results strengthen the theory that the period of species differential tolerance to low temperatures for first year seedlings occurs during the <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> in the spring. The study of the occurrence of low temperatures in the field was made along a transect starting in a lodgepole pine timbered flat and continuing through a lodgepole-ponderosa transition zone up to a ponderosa timbered slope. On a few occasions during the seedling <b>emergence</b> <b>period,</b> night minimums near the surface were as low as 15 °F to 18 °F at the lodgepole flat compared to 20 °F to 22 °F at the ponderosa timbered slope 80 feet above. This spread of five or more degrees was of the same magnitude as the laboratory determined spread of first injury to ponderosa pine to almost total kill. The controlled environment experiments demonstrated differential tolerance between species, and that laboratory-determined lethal temperatures approximated those recorded in field "frost pocket".

Restoration of natural flow regimes requires an understanding of linked hydrological and ecological processes. In this study, we investigated how annual seasonal flow characteristics and physical habitat attributes could interact to explain yearly changes in brown trout population densities (for 0 + fish, corresponding to the young of the year, and for the > 0 + age class) in 112 sites widespread in France. Using an information theoretic approach and general linear modeling, we identified the physical habitat attributes and seasonal hydrological variables which explained 0 + proportion, total, > 0 + and 0 + brown trout density dynamics. A decrease in total and 0 + brown trout densities were mainly linked to high water levels in both high and low flows during the <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> {{and to a lesser extent}}, to physical habitat attributes reflecting the river size. 0 + proportions were only linked to the level of low flows, and to a lesser extent to high flows, during the <b>emergence</b> <b>period.</b> Our study demonstrated that seasonality of flow is a main driver of brown trout population dynamics, especially magnitude of high and low flows for the 0 + age class, and should be considered in the definition of environmental flows...|$|E
40|$|Data on the {{emergence}} of coexisting Cordulegaster boltonii and Boyeria irene in a mountain stream {{in the center of}} Spain (altitude 1200 m a. s. l.) are presented in the study, based on the weekly collection of exuviae. Boyeria irene began to emerge 28 days later than C. boltonii. Larvae of both species overlapped extensively in their selection of substrates for emergence, although a significantly higher use of trees was found in C. boltonii. In comparison to other geographical areas, both species have modified their strategy, delaying the onset of the <b>emergence</b> <b>period.</b> The importance of environmental conditions (especially temperature) is discussed...|$|E
40|$|There is {{tremendous}} size variation within both laboratory and field {{populations of the}} mayfly Hexagenia. I studied the size variation in adults (imagoes) of this mayfly collected in the summers of 1989 and 1990 from Lake St. Clair, Southwestern Ontario (42 ∘ 20 'N; 82 ∘ 57 'W). Additionally, I examined the influence of endogenous factors (egg hatching, egg diapause, maternal size) on size and survivorship of larval Hexagenia. Female imagoes collected early in the <b>emergence</b> <b>period</b> were significantly larger than females collected later in the summer. There was low incidence of parthenogenesis (3 ̆c 5...|$|E
40|$|Upstream {{oviposition}} {{flights of}} several Plecoptera {{species of the}} genera Leuctra, Nemoura, Isoperla and Siphonoperla along the Breitenbach, Hesse, Germany are inferred from 1) oviposition occurring upstream from emergence areas; 2) size differences and size-shifts between emerging and egg-laying females; 3) concentration of oviposition in upstream sections of the emergence area. The last point relies on direct catches of egg-laying females with sticky traps, and on over-representation of old, mature females in upstream emergence traps towards the end of, or even after actual <b>emergence</b> <b>periods.</b> Criteria for age class discrimination of the respective taxa are described. The validity of the present and of other indirect evidence for directed adult flights and the significance of adult upstream displacement are discussed. Optical orientation cues are suggested. Females of Leuctra prima and Siphonoperla torrentium are shown to gain 25 - 50 % dry weight by feeding in the terrestrial environment; general information indicates many other Plecoptera may be similar in this respect. Terrestrial adult life is shown to last for 3 - 8 weeks. This long time, evidence of important flight activity and feeding together suggest that the terrestrial phase is spent as an active adult, the inevitable risks of which may form an important control of population dynamics.

30|$|In {{the central}} Appalachians, fire {{is used for}} {{conservation}} of fire-dependent, oak-dominant communities and to promote the montane pine systems, {{as well as to}} help land managers meet other stewardship goals (i.e., preservation of biodiversity and control of invasive plant species). Our research helps to elucidate effects of repeated prescribed fire in the central Appalachians in the summer. Overall, we found weak positive to neutral effects of fire on bats. Small sample sizes for species such as PESU and MYLE resulting from WNS-related population declines (Frick et al. 2010; Ford et al. 2011; Francl et al. 2012) further limit the inferences we can draw about fire effects on bats in this landscape. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether these negligible impacts extend to critical fall swarm and spring <b>emergence</b> <b>periods</b> when habitat associations of bats are less well understood (Muthersbaugh 2018). Relative to most of the GWNF, the WSM landscape has a higher rate of prescribed fire both spatially and temporally. Indeed, despite prioritization of prescribed burning regionally (Brose 2014), burned land comprises a small percentage of public lands overall in the central Appalachians (Ford et al. 2016 a). The bat activity response we observed at WSM suggests that bat presence should not serve as an impediment for burn programs on the central Appalachian landscape.|$|R
