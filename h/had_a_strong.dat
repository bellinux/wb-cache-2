40|$|A {{family of}} Jordan arcs, such that two arcs are nowhere tangent, defines a {{hypergraph}} whose vertices are the arcs and whose edges are the intersection points. We shall {{say that the}} hypergraph <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> intersection representation and, if each intersection point is interior to at most one arc, we shall say that the hypergraph <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> contact representation. We first characterize those hypergraphs which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> contact representation and deduce some sufficient conditions for a simple planar graph to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> intersection representation. Then, using the Four Color Theorem, we prove that a large class of simple planar graphs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> intersection representation. 1. Introduction A family of Jordan arcs, such that two arcs are nowhere tangent, defines a hypergraph whose vertices are the arcs and whose edges are the intersection points.
