5000|$|The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic {{approach}} to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and {{for the fact that}} columns that are viewed against the sky look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.The most obvious adjustment is to the profile of columns, which narrow from base to top. However, the narrowing is not regular, but gently curved so that each columns appears to have a slight swelling, called entasis below the middle. The entasis is never sufficiently pronounced as to make the swelling wider than the base; it is controlled by a slight reduction in the rate of decrease of diameter.The Parthenon, the Temple to the Goddess Athena on the Acropolis in Athens, is referred to by many as the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture.

40|$|Loan {{repayment}} can {{be viewed}} as a sequence of instalments. Instalments can either fall over time (i. e., repaying more in the beginning and less in the <b>end),</b> <b>rise</b> or stay constant. Three studies investigated whether the well-established preference for improvement (i. e., falling profiles) can also be observed in a loan context. Results show that consumers do prefer falling profiles over rising profiles; however, also a strong preference for constant profiles was found. These preferences for improvement and spreading even outweigh financial benefits. Consumers, hence, may sometimes opt for the financially worse loan option. Financial capability programs could benefit from including information about the perception of sequences. Financial capability Loans Sequences Intertemporal choice...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{possible}} functions of intonation is its capacity to clarify textual structure. It may, for instance, indicate that a sentence {{is likely to be}} the last in a sequence of statements forming a discourse unit. In order to investigate the perception of melodic cues to 'finality', listening experiments were performed with short sentences, the intonation of which was manipulated with respect to three variables: CONTOUR TYPE (with or without <b>end</b> <b>rise),</b> REGISTER (high or low) and RANGE (narrow or wide). The actual testing was done in two ways: (1) by pairwise-comparison and (2) by absolute-rating. A linear least-squares estimation method revealed that in both tests finality judgments could be influenced significantly by the three variables introduced.

The segmental structure of the stimuli was made up by the experimenters and presented to subjects as being taken from a little-known language spoken on a South Pacific island. Pitch patterns consisted of a single rise-fall located {{on or near the}} second syllable. By and large, listeners selected the stimulus with the higher peak, the later eak, and the higher <b>end</b> <b>rise</b> as the one that signalled a question, regardless of language group. The result is argued to reflect innate, non-linguistic knowledge of the meaning of pitch variation, notably Ohala’s Frequency Code.

It may, for instance, indicate that a sentence {{is likely to be}} the last one in a sequence of statements forming a discourse unit.

The actual testing concentrated on melodic cues to the 'last position' of an utterance in a spontaneous discourse. Judgments were expressed by absolute rating on a 'finality* scale. An ANOVA revealed that these finality judgments are influenced significantly by CONTOUR TYPE and REGISTER. The effect of RANGE was not significant, but there was a clear tendency for contours with a narrow range to be judged more final than contours with a wide range...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{correlation}} between gender roles {{and the use of}} the high rise pattern in declarative sentences, and whether the High Rising Terminal is an indicator of insecurity, as Lakoff (1973) suggests. The Introduction gives an overview of the field and the relevant issues and literature and the concepts of gender roles (particularly the phenomenon of the ‘power woman’) and the High Rise are explained. The Methodology for the research consists of two tests. First, five minutes of speech of twenty women in Dutch media were analysed for frequencies of the <b>End</b> <b>Rise.</b> The two women who displayed the highest and lowest frequencies were then subjected to further research (with transcribed speech samples consisting of ten minutes) to investigate the nature and context of their End Rises and whether these End Rises constitute occurrences of the High Rise. The results for both tests, which show that there is little correlation between the High Rise and assumed insecurity, are presented in the Results chapter. In the Conclusion, the results are discussed in relation to the research questions and the implications of the research and its results are also discussed...|$|E

The <b>ends</b> <b>rise</b> to gables, and elements such as gable returns and an undecorated frieze produce a Greek Revival appearance. The original structure was modified circa 1880, when a shed-roofed wooden porch was constructed; it bears its own ornamentation, including a bracketed frieze and a spindled railing.|$|R
