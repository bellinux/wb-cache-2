40|$|Background Although the {{dimension}} of the entire genome can be extremely large, only a parsimonious set of influential SNPs are correlated with a particular complex trait and {{are important to the}} prediction of the trait. Efficiently and accurately selecting these influential SNPs from millions of candidates is in high demand, but poses challenges. We propose a backward elimination iterative distance correlation (BE-IDC) procedure to select the smallest subset of SNPs that guarantees sufficient prediction accuracy, while also solving the unclear threshold issue for traditional feature screening approaches. Results Verified through six simulations, the adaptive threshold estimated by the BE-IDC performed uniformly better than fixed threshold methods that have been used in the current literature. We also applied BE-IDC to an Arabidopsis thaliana genome-wide data. Out of 216, 130 SNPs, BE-IDC selected four influential SNPs, and confirmed the same <b>FRIGIDA</b> <b>gene</b> that was reported by two other traditional methods. Conclusions BE-IDC accommodates both the prediction accuracy and the computational speed that are highly demanded in the genomic selection...|$|E
50|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of vernalization before flowering. This outcome is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals: genes like CONSTANS (CO), Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FRIGIDA regulate integration of environmental signals into the pathway for flower development. Variations in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes that grow in the cold, temperate regions require prolonged vernalization before they flower, while the tropical varieties, and the most common lab strains, don't. This variation is due to mutations in the FLC and <b>FRIGIDA</b> <b>genes,</b> rendering them non-functional.|$|R
50|$|Wild Arabidopsis {{plants have}} {{different}} alleles for the FLC gene, which correspond to ecotypes which either (a) flower rapidly {{and produce a}} number of generations during one summer (summer-annual), or (b) flower only after vernalization (winter-annual or late-flowering). This kind of variation can also be provided by variation in the <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) <b>gene.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of vernalization before flowering. This decision is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals. In Arabidopsis thaliana it is known that genes like CONSTANS (CO), FRIGIDA, Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the environmental signals and initiate the flower development pathway. Allelic variation in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes that grow in the cold temperate regions require prolonged vernalization before they flower, while the tropical varieties and common lab strains, do not. Much of this variation is due to mutations in the FLC and <b>FRIGIDA</b> <b>genes,</b> rendering them non-functional.|$|R
40|$|In {{temperate}} climates, {{the prolonged}} cold temperature of winter {{serves as a}} seasonal landmark for winter-annual and biennial plants. In these plants, flowering is blocked before winter. In Arabidopsis thaliana, natural variation in the <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) <b>gene</b> is a major determinate of the rapid-cycling vs. winter-annual flowering habits. In winter-annual accessions of Arabidopsis, FRI activity blocks flowering through the up-regulation of the floral inhibitor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Most rapid-flowering accessions, in contrast, contain null alleles of FRI. By performing a mutant screen in a winter-annual strain, we have identified a locus, FRIGIDA LIKE 1 (FRL 1), that is specifically required for the up-regulation of FLC by FRI. Cloning of FRL 1 revealed a gene with a predicted protein sequence that is 23 % identical to FRI. Despite sequence similarity, FRI and FRL 1 do not have redundant functions. FRI and FRL 1 belong to a seven-member gene family in Arabidopsis, and FRI, FRL 1, {{and at least one}} additional family member, FRIGIDA LIKE 2 (FRL 2), are in a clade of this family that is required for the winter-annual habit in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|The MADS domain–containing {{transcription}} factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) {{acts as an}} inhibitor of flowering and is a convergence point for several pathways that regulate flowering time in Arabidopsis. In naturally occurring late-flowering ecotypes, the <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) <b>gene</b> acts to increase FLC levels, whereas the autonomous floral promotion pathway and vernalization act to reduce FLC expression. Previous work {{has shown that the}} Landsberg erecta allele of FLC, which is not a null allele, is able to partially suppress the late-flowering phenotype of FRIGIDA and mutations in the autonomous pathway. In this study, using a null allele of FLC, we show that the late-flowering phenotype of FRIGIDA and autonomous pathway mutants are eliminated in the absence of FLC activity. In addition, we have found that the downregulation of SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 by FRI and autonomous pathway mutants also is mediated by FLC. Complete loss of FLC function, however, does not eliminate the effect of vernalization. Thus, FRI and the autonomous pathway may act solely to regulate FLC expression, whereas vernalization is able to promote flowering via FLC-dependent and FLC-independent mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The very late-flowering {{behavior}} of Arabidopsis winter-annual ecotypes is conferred mainly by two <b>genes,</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). A MADS-domain gene, AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (AGL 20), {{was identified as}} a dominant FRI suppressor in activation tagging mutagenesis. Overexpression of AGL 20 suppresses not only the late flowering of plants that have functional FRI and FLC alleles but also the delayed phase transitions during the vegetative stages of plant development. Interestingly, AGL 20 expression is positively regulated not only by the redundant vernalization and autonomous pathways of flowering but also by the photoperiod pathway. Our results indicate that AGL 20 is an important integrator of three pathways controlling flowering in Arabidopsis...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{molecular}} level, flowering is repressed by the protein Flowering Locus C (FLC), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering. Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active {{copy of the}} <b>gene</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI), which promotes FLC expression, thus repression of flowering. Prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) induces expression of VERNALIZATION INSENSTIVE3, which interacts with the VERNALIZATION2 polycomb-like complex to reduce FLC expression through chromatin remodeling. [...] The epigenetic silencing of FLC by chromatin remodeling is also thought to involve the cold-induced expression of antisense FLC COOLAIR or COLDAIR transcripts. Vernalization is registered by the plant by the stable silencing of individual FLC loci. The removal of silent chromatin marks at FLC during embryogenesis prevents the inheritance of the vernalized state ...|$|R
40|$|Thellungiella halophila (T. halophila) (salt cress) {{is a close}} {{relative}} of Arabidopsis and a model plant for salt tolerance research. However, {{the nature of its}} later flowering causes some difficulties in genetic analysis. The <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) <b>gene</b> {{plays a key role in}} the Arabidopsis vernalization flowering pathway, whose homolog in T. halophila may also be a key factor in controlling flowering time. In order to study the molecular mechanism of vernalization responses in T. halophila, a full length cDNA named ThFRI (Thellungiella halophila FRIGIDA) was isolated from the young seedlings of T. halophila by RT-PCR and RACE. The ThFRI cDNA was 2017 bp in length and contained an open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 605 amino acids. The ThFRI showed significant homology to AtFRI (74. 5 % at the nucleotide level and 63. 9 % at the amino acid level). To study its function, ThFRI cDNA was transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana, driven by CaMV 35 S promoter. Transgenic plants expressing ThFRI exhibited late-flowering phenotype, which suggests that ThFRI is the funtional FRI homolog in T. halophila. The cloning and funtional charac-terization of the FRI homolog of T. halophila will faciliate further study of flowering time control in T. halophila...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of natural}} genetic {{variation}} for the vernalization requirement in Arabidopsis have revealed two <b>genes,</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), that are determinants of the vernalization-requiring, winter-annual habit.

FLL 4 {{is part of the}} FLC EXPRESSOR (FLX) gene family and both are non-redundantly involved in flowering-time control. Epistasis analysis among FRI, FLL 4, FLX and autonomous-pathway genes reveals that FRI fve exhibits an extreme delay of flowering compared to fri fve, but mutants in other autonomous-pathway genes do not, indicating that FVE acts most antagonistically to FRI. FLL 4 may represent a new member of a FRI-containing complex that activates FLC...|$|R
40|$|Many {{strains of}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) require {{exposure}} to prolonged cold for rapid flowering, {{a process known}} as vernalization. Vernalization in Arabidopsis results in the suppression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a repressor of flowering. In a screen for mutants that no longer require vernalization for rapid flowering, we identified a dominant allele of the Enhancer of Zeste E(z) ortholog CURLY LEAF (CLF), clf- 59. CLF is a Polycomb Group gene, and the clf- 59 mutant protein contains a proline-to-serine transition in a cysteine-rich region that precedes the SET domain. Mutant plants are early flowering and have reduced FLC expression, but, unlike clf loss-of-function mutants, clf- 59 mutants do not display additional pleiotropic phenotypes. clf- 59 mutants have elevated levels of trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H 3 (H 3 K 27 me 3) at FLC. Thus, clf- 59 appears to be a gain-of-function allele, and this allele represses FLC without some of the components required for vernalization-mediated repression. In the course of this work, we also identified a marked difference in H 3 K 27 me 3 levels at FLC between plants that contain and those that lack the <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) <b>gene.</b> Furthermore, FRI appears to affect CLF occupancy at FLC; thus, our work provides insight into the molecular role that FRI plays in delaying the onset of flowering...|$|R
40|$|A {{latitudinal}} cline in flowering time in accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana {{has been}} widely predicted because the environmental cues that promote flowering vary systematically with latitude, but evidence for such clines has been lacking. Here, we report evidence of a significant latitudinal cline in flowering time among 70 Northern European and Mediterranean ecotypes when grown under ecologically realistic conditions in a common garden environment. The detected cline, however, is found only in ecotypes with alleles of the flowering time <b>gene</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) that lack major deletions that would disrupt protein function, whereas there is no relationship between flowering time and latitude of origin among accessions with FRI alleles containing such deletions. Analysis of climatological data suggests that late flowering in accessions with putatively functional FRI was associated with reduced January precipitation {{at the site of}} origin, consistent with previous reports of a positive genetic correlation between water use efficiency and flowering time in Arabidopsis, and the pleiotropic effects of FRI of increasing water use efficiency. In accessions collected from Southern latitudes, we detected that putatively functional FRI alleles were associated with accelerated flowering relative to accessions with nonfunctional FRI under the winter conditions of our experiment. These results suggest that the ecological function of the vernalization requirement conferred by FRI differs across latitudes. More generally, our results indicate that by combining ecological and molecular genetic data, it is possible to understand the forces acting on life history transitions at the level of specific loci...|$|R
40|$|Heterosis is an {{important}} phenomenon in agriculture. However, heterosis often greatly varies among hybrids and among traits. To investigate heterosis across {{a large number of}} traits and numerous genotypes, we evaluated 12 life history traits on parents and hybrids derived from five Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes (Col, Ler- 0, Cvi, Ws, and C 24) by using a complete diallel analysis containing 20 hybrids. Parental contributions to heterosis were hybrid and trait specific with a few reciprocal differences. Most notably, C 24 generated hybrids with flowering time, biomass, and reproductive traits that often exceeded high-parent values. However, reproductive traits of C 24 and Col hybrids and flowering time traits of C 24 and Ler hybrids had no heterosis. We investigated whether allelic variation at flowering time <b>genes</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) could explain the genotype- and trait-specific contribution of C 24 to hybrid traits. We evaluated both Col and Ler lines introgressed with various FRI and FLC alleles and hybrids between these lines and C 24. Hybrids with functional FLC differed from hybrids with nonfunctional FLC for 21 of the 24 hybrid-trait combinations. In most crosses, heterosis was fully or partially explained by FRI and FLC. Our results describe the genetic diversity for heterosis within a sample of A. thaliana ecotypes and show that FRI and FLC are major factors that contribute to heterosis in a genotype and trait specific fashion...|$|R
40|$|Flowering {{traits in}} winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana are conferred mainly by two <b>genes,</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). FLC {{acts as a}} {{flowering}} repressor and is regulated by multiple flowering pathways. We isolated an early-flowering mutant, suppressor of FRIGIDA 3 (suf 3), which also shows leaf serration, weak apical dominance, and infrequent conversion of the inflorescence shoot to a terminal flower. The suf 3 mutation caused {{a decrease in the}} transcript level of FLC in both a FRI-containing line and autonomous pathway mutants. However, suf 3 showed only a partial reduction of FLC transcript level, although it largely suppressed the late-flowering phenotype. In addition, the suf 3 mutation caused acceleration of flowering in both 35 S-FLC and a flc null mutant, indicating that SUF 3 regulates additional factor(s) for the repression of flowering. SUF 3 is highly expressed in the shoot apex, but the expression is not regulated by FRI, autonomous pathway genes, or vernalization. SUF 3 encodes the nuclear ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP 6), the homolog of which in yeast is a component of an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling SWR 1 complex. Our analyses showed that SUF 3 regulates FLC expression independent of vernalization, FRI, and an autonomous pathway gene, all of which affect the histone modification of FLC chromatin. Subcellular localization using a green fluorescent protein fusion showed that Arabidopsis ARP 6 is located at distinct regions of the nuclear periphery...|$|R
40|$|Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions {{provide an}} {{excellent}} resource to dissect the molecular basis of adaptation. We have selected 192 Arabidopsis accessions collected to represent worldwide and local variation and analyzed two adaptively important traits, flowering time and vernalization response. There was huge {{variation in the}} flowering habit of the different accessions, with no simple relationship to latitude of collection site and considerable diversity occurring within local regions. We explored the contribution to this variation from the two <b>genes</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), previously shown to be important determinants in natural variation of flowering time. A correlation of FLC expression with flowering time and vernalization was observed, {{but it was not}} as strong as anticipated due to many late-flowering/vernalization-requiring accessions being associated with low FLC expression and early-flowering accessions with high FLC expression. Sequence analysis of FRI revealed which accessions were likely to carry functional alleles, and, from comparison of flowering time with allelic type, we estimate that approximately 70 % of flowering time variation can be accounted for by allelic variation of FRI. The maintenance and propagation of 20 independent nonfunctional FRI haplotypes suggest that the loss-of-function mutations can confer a strong selective advantage. Accessions with a common FRI haplotype were, in some cases, associated with very different FLC levels and wide variation in flowering time, suggesting additional variation at FLC itself or other genes regulating FLC. These data reveal how useful these Arabidopsis accessions will be in dissecting the complex molecular variation that has led to the adaptive phenotypic variation in flowering time...|$|R
40|$|Extensive natural {{variation}} {{has been}} described for the timing of flowering initiation in many annual plants, including the model wild species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which is presumed {{to be involved in}} adaptation to different climates. However, the environmental factors that might shape this genetic variation, as well as the molecular bases of climatic adaptation by modifications of flowering time, remain mostly unknown. To approach both goals, we characterized the flowering behavior in relation to vernalization of 182 Arabidopsis wild genotypes collected in a native region spanning a broad climatic range. Phenotype-environment association analyses identified strong altitudinal clines (0 – 2600 m) in seven out of nine flowering-related traits. Altitudinal clines were dissected in terms of minimum winter temperature and precipitation, indicating that these are the main climatic factors that might act as selective pressures on flowering traits. In addition, we used an association analysis approach with four candidate <b>genes,</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI), FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), PHYTOCHROME C (PHYC), and CRYPTOCHROME 2, to decipher the genetic bases of this variation. Eleven different loss-of-function FRI alleles of low frequency accounted for up to 16 % of the variation for most traits. Furthermore, an FLC allelic series of six novel putative loss- and change-of-function alleles, with low to moderate frequency, revealed that a broader FLC functional diversification might contribute to flowering variation. Finally, environment-genotype association analyses showed that the spatial patterns of FRI, FLC, and PHYC polymorphisms are significantly associated with winter temperatures and spring and winter precipi- tations, respectively. These results support that allelic variation in these genes is involved in climatic adaptationPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Most of {{the natural}} {{variation}} in flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana {{can be attributed to}} allelic variation at the <b>gene</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI, AT 4 G 00650), which activates expression of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC, AT 5 G 10140). Usually, late-flowering accessions carry functional FRI alleles (FRI-wt), whereas early flowering accessions contain non-functional alleles. The two most frequent alleles found in early flowering accessions are the ones present in the commonly used lab strains Columbia (FRI-Col) and Landsberg erecta (FRI-Ler), which contain a premature stop codon and a deletion of the start codon respectively. Results: Analysis of flowering time data from various Arabidopsis natural accessions indicated that the FRI-Ler allele retains some functionality. We generated transgenic lines carrying the FRI-Col or FRI-Ler allele in order to compare their effect on flowering time, vernalization response and FLC expression in the same genetic background. We characterize their modes of regulation through allele-specific expression and their relevance in nature through re-analysis of published datasets. We demonstrate that the FRI-Ler allele induces FLC expression, delays flowering time and confers sensitivity to vernalization in contrast to the true null FRI-Col allele. Nevertheless, the FRI-Ler allele revealed a weaker effect when compared to the fully functional FRI-wt allele, mainly due to reduced expression. Conclusions: The present study defines {{for the first time the}} existence of a new class of Arabidopsis accessions with an intermediate phenotype between slow and rapid cycling types. Although using available data from a common garden experiment we cannot observe fitness differences between accessions carrying the FRI-Ler or the FRI-Col allele, the phenotypic changes observed in the lab suggest that variation in these alleles could play a role in adaptation to specific natural environments...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} flowering {{time have}} been extensively studied for decades. Greater understanding of flowering time has wider implications in agriculture and ecology as the trait {{is crucial to}} optimising reproductive success. It is best understood in the genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), in which loss and gain of function mutations have identified several pathways that regulate flowering and its response to the environment. This has been complemented by studies of natural variation in flowering. Worldwide accessions of Arabidopsis {{have been used to}} identify additional flowering regulators and to examine the evolution of these genes and their potential involvement in adaptation to different environments. One of the most extensively studied pathways is responsible for accelerated flowering in response to an extended period of cold (vernalization). Several studies have attributed a substantial proportion of worldwide variation to the <b>genes</b> <b>FRIGIDA</b> (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), both of which are instrumental in conferring sensitivity to vernalization, though other genes have also been found. This study examines flowering time variation locally in populations of Arabidopsis from in and around Edinburgh. It identifies substantial, genetically determined variation in flowering time and in sensitivity to photoperiod and vernalization between local accessions. Variation in FRI and FLC sequences and in their levels of expression were detected in local accessions, but these were able to explain little of the phenotypic variation observed. Hybrids between local accessions showing extreme differences in flowering time or responses to photoperiod and vernalization were therefore used to map genes underlying their differences as quantitative trait loci (QTL). This analysis identified a locus in chromosome 5 that could account for differences in vernalization sensitivity. This region includes the VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN 3) gene. Sequence differences between VIN 3 alleles and their expression in response to vernalization supported the potential involvement of this gene in local flowering time variation...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{variation}} of life history strategies is modulated by both natural selection and physiological constraints. In this study, variation and co-{{variation of}} life history traits at the phenotypic and genomic level were studied in {{details in the}} model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana in order to elucidate the genetic and environmental factors controlling life-cycle evolution. Natural variation for growth rate, flowering time, primary seed dormancy and secondary seed dormancy were measured in a common environment across a set of 161 A. thaliana genotypes isolated from various locations throughout the species’ range. The results show that natural variation of life-cycle strategies was continuous. An antagonistic pattern of co-variation between flowering time and growth rate was observed. These two traits were negatively or positively correlated respectively depending on the latitude of origin of the genotypes. Functionality of <b>FRIGIDA,</b> a <b>gene</b> previously identified as {{a major contributor to}} flowering time variation, was associated with distinct evolutionary trajectories characterized by different patterns of co-variation between life history traits. Indeed, two negative correlations were observed specifically among genotypes carrying functional FRIGIDA allele: between flowering time and primary dormancy as well as between primary dormancy and secondary dormancy. These results indicate that selection on and trade-offs among traits controlling life-cycle strategies change along the distribution range of A. thaliana and are influenced by FRIGIDA functionality. Moreover, natural variation of four life history traits, primary dormancy, secondary dormancy, seedling growth rate and stem leaf number at flowering timing, followed a latitudinal gradient indicating that these traits are involved in local adaptation. Climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation influenced different life history traits across the distribution range of the species or depending on the functionality of FRIGIDA. 	The genetic basis of life history variation in Arabidopsis thaliana was studied at fine and large scales, first focusing specifically on the nucleotidic diversity of a dormancy QTL (DOG 1), second at the genomic level using the newly developed genome-wide association mapping method (GWA) developed by M. Nordborg and his team (Atwell et al. 2010). For exon 1 of DOG 1, non synonymous substitution rate was higher than synonymous substitution rate which is rare. It could be the result of independent selective events in populations isolated by glacial cycles. Only rare alleles based on non synonymous substitutions in exon 1 were associated with primary dormancy, alleles in high frequency were significantly associated with flowering timing. This probable false positive association was first detected using the unified mixed model method initially developed by E. S. Buckler (2006), in collaboration with B. Stich and then confirmed with GWA method using a larger sample. The detection of this false positive revealed linkage disequilibrium between DOG 1 and flowering time genes which is most likely the result of a simultaneous selection on these genes. FLC was significantly associated with primary dormancy and flowering time indicating pleiotropic effect. These results provided some light concerning genetic control of co-variation between life history traits. DOG 1 was not significantly associated with primary dormancy probably because expression level of this gene influences as well phenotypic variation. Finally, GWA method allowed detection of new candidate genes controlling life history traits. SPT gene which controls final leaf size was found as a vegetative growth rate QTL. ...|$|R
