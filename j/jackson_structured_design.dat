40|$|Object {{oriented}} {{design is}} a method where developers {{think in terms of}} objects instead of procedures or functions. The overall system is designed keeping in view the interaction among objects that maintain the states and provide implementation on them. For implementing object oriented design three methodologies are adopted Object Modeling technique (OMT), Structure Analysis/Structured Design (SA/SD), <b>Jackson</b> <b>Structured</b> <b>Design</b> (JSD). SA/SD approach is based on the data flow and JSD approach is action-oriented. Since SA/SD is easy to understand but it focuses on well defined system boundary whereas JSD approach is too complex and does not have any graphical representation. In this paper, we will apply the concept of Genetic Algorithm to minimize the above said problem. Genetic Algorithm method is based on natural evolution. Through this algorithm, we can improve the performance of the system. Genetics Algorithm start with a fixed size of data structure which are used to perform such given task. There ar...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly complex {{demands on}} {{functionality}} {{and quality of}} software systems along {{with the lack of}} qualified staff require a fundamental change in the software development process. A shift from personnel intensive individual software development to capital intensive industrial software production must take place. This could only be achieved by utilizing tools supporting the development process and by planned design and production of generally applicable and reusable components. The AUGUSTA system (Ada Units Generalization Utility and Systems Tailoring Assistant) concentrates on the aspect of reusability. It allows the instantiation of programs from generic components and the compostion of complete application systems based on an equally generic application structure. Furthermore, the AUGUSTA approach postulates a special process model including a particular concept for user roles according to their experience and tasks in the software construction process. 1. Motivation The way software is developed has undergone substantial changes within the last decades. Increased size and complexity of software needed and the long lifetime of software systems, with myrads of modifications made to such large systems led to systems which are almost impossible to maintain on the level of undocumented code only. New programming techniques (e. g. stuctured programming, module concept, information hiding), new design methods (e. g. <b>Jackson</b> System Development, <b>Structured</b> <b>Design),</b> new management methods (e. g. partitioning the development process in life cycle phases), and tools came into use - the integration of these techniques, methods and tools directed to a new paradigm, software engineering. 2 But in spite of the improvements made, a set of crucial problems is still plaguing today [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|What Engineers Know and How they Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) (...) is a {{historical}} reflection on engineering practice in US aeronautics from 1908 to 1953 written by an accomplished practitioner and instructor. This period represents the dawn of aviation which was fraught with uncertainties and numerous paths to many possible worlds. The book captures two main conclusions from this period. The first order conclusion of this book is about [...] "what engineers know." [...] Five case studies {{from the history of}} aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its own scientific discoveries. Thus, engineering should be understood as a knowledge-generating activity that includes applied science but is not limited to applied science. The second order conclusion of this book pertains to [...] "how engineers know" [...] by using the same case studies to reveal patterns in the nature of all engineering. These patterns form an “epistemology” of engineering that may point the way to an “engineering method” as something distinct from scientific method. Walter Vincenti ends the work with a general [...] "variation-selection model" [...] for understanding the direction of technological innovation in human history. The book is filled with numerous additional observations and stories told by a practitioner and instructor. This may be why Dr. Michael A. <b>Jackson,</b> author of <b>Structured</b> <b>Design</b> and Problem Frames, once concluded a keynote address to engineers with the statement, [...] "Read Vincenti's book.

The most commonly used systems specification and design techniques in commercial computing are described and compared; Information Engineering as proposed by James Martin, A Framework for Information Definition-Muitiview proposed by Wood-Harper et al, Real-world Modeling as described by <b>Jackson,</b> <b>Structured</b> Analysis and <b>Design</b> as In Demarco, Yourdon and Constantine and Output-Oriented Structured Requirement Definition proposed by Orr. In addition, system prototyping is discussed, including the role of prototyping in large software development projects and {{as a tool for}} the design of human-computer interfaces. Other areas described and discussed include decision support systems (DSS) and knowledge based management support systems. The context is in the design and development approaches for DSS, prototyping for DSS, expert system for DSS and the integration of DSS and information system. The design and development of human-computer interface is also discussed in relation to user Interface complexity and adaptive interfaces. Further, the important issue of user involvement and support within the development process Is discussed. Thus, weaknesses of current approaches to the system development process are identified and a new model for the development of information system is proposed. In proposing the model, data and functional analysis structured method and methodology for decision support systems (DSS) development is presented including guidelines for the development of knowledge based DSS. The new proposed model is put to test in the design, development and implementation of large integrated commercial systems including DSS. Results and discussion {{on the use of the}} model is reported with special consideration to the users' and developers' view of the model. Finally the objectives of this research program are examined in relation to what has been achieved during this program of research. The prospect of using the model for the development of information systems are concluded with references to current and future goals...|$|R

In this study, we not only fabricated the topology optimized <b>structure</b> <b>designs</b> using one kind of 3 D Printing technology known as stereolithography (SLA), but also tested the mechanical performance of the produced prototype parts. The finite element method is {{used to analyze the}} structure responses, and the consistent results of the numerical simulations and structure experiments prove the validity of this new structure testing approach.
