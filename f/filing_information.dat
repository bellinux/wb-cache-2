50|$|The {{bigger picture}} of an {{automated}} solution is the savings involved. Costs can be minimized by taking the necessary steps to avoid penalties that result when errors are repeatedly made. Furthermore, with an entry visibility solution, errors can be prevented in the entry by sending all of the necessary classification and <b>filing</b> <b>information</b> to the broker up front. This allows for the automatic retrieval and reconciliation of the entry filing on the backend. Keeping customers, suppliers, 3PLs, freight forwarders, and brokers {{all on the same}} page can be accomplished with an automated solution, allowing all parties to view the same data and further ensure the information on the entry is correct and up-to-date.|$|E

50|$|Maintenance is the {{management}} of information. This can include processes such as filing, retrieval and transfers. While the connotation of filing presumes the placing of information in a prescribed container and leaving it there, {{there is much more}} involved. Filing is actually the process of arranging information in a predetermined sequence and creating a system to manage it for its useful existence within an organization. Failure to establish a sound method for <b>filing</b> <b>information</b> makes its retrieval and use nearly impossible. Transferring information refers to the process of responding to requests, retrieval from files and providing access to users authorized by the organization to have access to the information. While removed from the files, the information is tracked by the use of various processes to ensure it is returned and/or available to others who may need access to it.|$|E

Finally, we demonstrate that this risk score can be used to effectively predict fund failures in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{complete}} set of the SEC <b>filing</b> <b>information</b> on hedge funds (Form ADV) and the TASS data, we develop a quantitative model called the ?-Score to measure hedge fund operational risk. The ?-Score is related to conflict of interest issues, concentrated ownership, and reduced leverage in the ADV data. With a statistical methodology, we further relate the ?-Score to readily available information such as fund performance, volatility, size, age, and fee structures. Finally, we demonstrate that while operational risk is more significant than financial risk in explaining fund failure, there is a significant and positive interaction between operational risk and financial risk. This is consistent with rogue trading anecdotes that suggest that fund failure associated with excessive risk taking occurs when operational controls and oversight are weak. mutual funds, hedge funds, investments, the Omega Score...|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} in the year 2001 of some 46 intellectual property offices and organizations worldwide {{in the field of}} patent, trademark and industrial design information are summarized, based on the Annual Technical Reports (ATRs) provided by those offices and organizations. The summary for each country commences with filing statistics, followed by the most relevant, new features of their information activities. Both the filing and information activities vary enormously. The author concludes, inter alia, that 1. In most industrialised countries {{as well as some of}} the emerging countries, the number of IP rights applications continued to increase. 2. The granting/registration procedures have not kept up in many IP Offices with this increased number of applications. 3. Work on systems permitting electronic filing of applications, correspondence and fee payment is continuing at a great pace. 4. CD-ROM, DVD and the Internet are now the major vectors for disseminating IP information. 5. The value of the ATRs, and their chronological and geographical comparisons, is increasingly limited by the absence of many ATRs each year and the repetition of information already provided in previous ATRs.

40|$|It {{happened}} quite {{by accident}} one day. I {{was ready to}} explain {{to a group of}} uninterested high school students about the importance of dealing with change and conflict. As I looked around the room, I realized that, unless I could capture their interest, what I had to say would be lost in a cacophony of other important information they were hearing from other passionate teachers trying to help them recognize the importance of <b>filing</b> <b>information</b> away until an opportunity to use it presents itself. We as teachers mean well, but we have little opportunity to find creative ways to help students file away important information, sorting it from the trivia they also receive from us. To think {{that they will be able}} to access it later in life is ludicrous. I had been to a bookstore a few days prior and had purchased a wonderful children’s book for my youngest son. I was so enthralled by the book I brought it to school to show some of my colleagues. The title of the book was, Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day! by Judith Viorst. The story is a funny description of a bad day by a young child. It was so cleverly written, every student could identify with one of Alexander’s experiences.
