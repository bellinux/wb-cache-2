5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of <b>funding</b> <b>agencies</b> and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that <b>funding</b> <b>agencies</b> require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

40|$|The {{corrosion}} protection of AA 6063 aluminium alloy by cerium conversion, polyaniline conducting polymer and by duplex coatings has been investigated. The electrochemical behaviour was evaluated in aerated 3. 5 wt. % NaCl. All coatings tested shifted the corrosion and pitting potentials to more positive values, indicating protection against corrosion. The duplex coatings are significantly {{more effective than}} each coating alone: corrosion and pitting potentials were shifted by + 183 and + 417 mV(SCE), respectively, by duplex coatings {{in relation to the}} untreated aluminium alloy. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are in agreement with the electrochemical results, reinforcing the superior performance of duplex coatings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly more so as the response departs from the low field linear regime. In this paper we introduce a new parameter, {{referred to as the}} efficiency in converting electromagnetic energy into thermal energy, which is shown to be remarkably useful in the analysis of the system response, especially when the power loss is investigated {{as a function of the}} applied field amplitude. Using numerical simulations of dynamic hysteresis, through the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz model, we map in detail the efficiency as a function of all relevant parameters of the system and compare the results with simple-yet powerful-predictions based on heuristic arguments about the relaxation time.

40|$|Continuous enzymatic interesterification is an {{alternative}} to chemical interesterification for lipid modification technology which is economically viable for large scale use. A blend of 70 % lard and 30 % soybean oil was submitted to continuous enzymatic interesterification in a glass tubular bioreactor at flow rate ranging from 0. 5 to 4. 5 mL/min. The original mixture and the reaction products obtained were examined to determine melting and crystallization behavior by DSC, and analyzed for regiospecific fatty acid distribution. Continuous enzymatic interesterification changed the mixture, forming a new triacylglycerol composition, verified by DSC curves and variation in enthalpy of melting values. The regiospecific distribution of fatty acids was changed by flow variations in the reactor. In the continuous enzymatic interesterification reaction the flow rate of 4. 5 mL/min, was more advantageous than slower flow rates, reducing acyl migration and increasing process productivity.

40|$|Semiconductor nanowhiskers (NWs) made of III-V {{compounds}} exhibit {{great potential}} for technological applications. Controlling the growth conditions, such as temperature and diameter, {{it is possible to}} alternate between zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) crystalline phases, giving origin to the so called polytypism. This effect has great influence in the electronic and optical properties of the system, generating new forms of confinement to the carriers. A theoretical model capable to accurately describe electronic and optical properties in these polytypical nanostructures can be used to study and develop new kinds of nanodevices. In this study, we present the development of a wurtzite/zinc-blende polytypical model to calculate the electronic band structure of nanowhiskers based on group theory concepts and the k. p method. Although the interest is in polytypical superlattices, the proposed model was applied to a single quantum well of InP to study the physics of the wurtzite/zinc-blende polytypism. By the analysis of our results, some trends can be predicted: spatial carriers' separation, predominance of perpendicular polarization (xy plane) in the luminescence spectra, and interband transition blueshifts with strain. Also, a possible range of values for the wurtzite InP spontaneous polarization is suggested. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.
