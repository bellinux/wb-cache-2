The sustainability of Swiss dairy farms located in the mountainous area might be critical {{as many of them}} show a weak performance in the use of their economic and/or social resources, and sometimes also of their environmental resources. An {{improvement of}} the sustainability of these farms prerequisites to better know on a large scale their sustainable performance and its determinants. For a representative sample of 480 dairy farms, we perform an assessment of their sustainable efficiency with the “sustainable value”, an approach to assess corporate sustainability based on the capital and opportunity cost theories. Using a linear regression, we analyze the determinants of the sustainable efficiency. The results show a tight positive relationship between sustainable performance and pure economic performance. The intensity of the use of <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumptions</b> is found {{to be the most important}} determinant of the sustainable efficiency. Farms with a high sustainable efficiency are those that use their <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumptions</b> in the most efficient way. The part of direct payments in the gross profit is shown to negatively affect the sustainable efficiency. The structural characteristics of the farms and the sociologic characteristics of the farmer managers are shown to hardly influence the sustainable efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the economic}} impact of alternative water policies implemented on the Spanish production system. The methodology comprises two versions of the input-output price model: an average cost formulation and a mark-up formulation. The input-output framework evaluates the impact of the various water policy measures on production prices, <b>consumption</b> prices, <b>intermediate</b> water use and private real income. The results show that a tax on the water used by sectors considerably reduces <b>intermediate</b> water <b>consumption</b> and increases production and consumption prices. On the other hand, according to Jevons' paradox, improvements in technical efficiency, which lead to a reduction in the water requirements of all sectors and an increase in water production, raise water consumption. The combination of a tax on the water used by sectors and an improvement in the technical efficiency of water in the production sphere takes the pressure off prices and significantly reduces <b>intermediate</b> water <b>consumption.</b> Water use Water policy Water taxation Input-output analysis Leontief price model...|$|R
40|$|By the {{analyses}} {{included in this}} paper I tried to quantify – using the input-output method – the amplitude of upstream and downstream linkages between manufacturing industries, structured by technological groups, for Romania and other six EU member countries, for comparison. Since intermediate products are the main carrier of knowledge diffused by high-tech industries towards other industries, by processing data from input-output tables we can obtain {{a measure of the}} inter-industry effects of these activities in an economy. In analyses we used statistical data on <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumptions</b> both from domestic production and imports, obtained from tables of intermediate product flows for 60 economic industries, of which 22 manufacturing ones (tables provided by Eurostat). For Romania, computations show a symmetrical distribution (on the technological ladder) of the intensity of upstream and downstream linkages of processing industries. This intensity is low in the area of low technologies, increases for medium technologies and then diminishes for high technologies. The main downstream intermediate flows of high technological level occur in the office equipment and computer industry and the chemical industry. As for the other ones, the relative level of the supplies of intermediate products provided by high and medium technology industries of Romania is lower in comparison with the other countries under consideration. input-output analysis, technological progress, knowledge spillover...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: In many countries, {{hospitals}} have triple ownership (governmental or public, for-profit, and not-for-profit). Numerous {{studies have been}} performed in order to investigate the differences among these hospitals in accordance to expenditures, presentation of uncompensated therapeutic services, number of outgoing patients and other measurement devices of hospital performance. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the role of ownership on total Factors Productivity changes in Qazvin`s selected hospitals. Materials and Methods: Descriptive-analytic study was conducted in three periods of time from 2005 to 2007 in 8 selected hospitals of Qazvin. Inclusion criteria included the active beds and the value of <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumptions</b> in hospitals. The exclusion criteria included the total number of inpatient and surgical operations. Data collection tool, was researcher-designed checklist. Data were analyzed using DEAP 2 / 1 software and ANOVA, HSD and TUKEY tests. Results: There was {{a significant difference between the}} mean productivity of three hospital groups due to the existence of various ownership(p=% 012), Also a significant difference was observed between the mean of technological efficiency of the three groups of hospitals(p=% 006), No significant differences was found between the mean of technical efficiency of the three groups of hospitals(p=% 23). Conclusion: Cause of the variation in total factor productivity in private hospitals, is due to their suitable production technology which is always improved. But in respect to their efficiency promotion and optimization of production and products, there was no distinguishing difference with other hospitals...|$|R

Input-output data down to 4 -digit Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) trade subgroups are used over an observation period of 1981 – 1996. The results show an increasing trend in average technical efficiency, although there were some fluctuations in the sub-periods. Furthermore, the factors affecting the level of technical efficiency and its growth are identified. The higher technical efficiency ratios come from those construction firms with less intensive capital, larger size, a lower degree of subcontracting, and a lower proportion of <b>intermediate</b> input <b>consumption...</b>|$|R

We check these assumptions against empirical evidence, exploring agglomeration patterns of multinational and domestic firms at the regional level, and constructing an econometric model able to measure the interactions between the two classes of firms.
