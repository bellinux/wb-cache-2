500|$|Vandernoot and Paul {{created a}} strong {{on-screen}} relationship between their characters. David Abramowitz, creative consultant {{from the second}} season onwards, said, [...] "When I saw her and Adrian together, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I died, {{and there was a}} Mount Olympus, {{that the two of them}} would be standing together with thunderbolts around them. They were god-like. They were so beautiful and had such presence." [...] Paul said that he was [...] "detached" [...] from the fictional relationship between Tessa and MacLeod, but that [...] "...it was a good relationship". Later, he said he [...] "...was sad to see it go." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
2500|$|... "an officer {{asked me}} {{and two other}} {{immigrants}} ... whether we wanted to become U.S. citizens. [...] to a federal courthouse and [...] in before a judge. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I was {{going to fight for}} this country, I should be a U.S. citizen." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNYS It isn't that. I'm {{not trying}} to shirk it. <b>I</b> merely <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there had been time--of course, if you really think - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "you've {{changed a}} lot in three months. <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> you had a chance, there'd be no telling where you'd end up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, my dear. Nothing I {{can assure}} you is less probable. But still, Mr. Slope {{may be useful in}} finding how the wind blows, and <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we could give {{something}} else as good to the Quiverfuls--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{becoming}} a professional cricketer, Umesh Yadav unsuccessfully applied {{to join the}} army and the police force. In 2007–2008, having previously only ever played tennis ball cricket, Yadav began bowling with a leather ball and joined Vidarbha, an unfashionable team in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy. Pritam Gandhe, Vidharbha's captain, supported Yadav and ensured he represented Air India in a twenty20 tournament. Of Yadav's early career Gandhe remarked [...] "He was raw and wayward. But he was really quick– too quick. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he lands at least three out of six balls in line with the stumps, he will trouble batsmen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rodney Hogg was {{interested}} in touring South Africa. He met with Ali Bacher in London during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. [...] "I was pretty much in from day one," [...] said Hogg. I was in my mid-30s, and {{the idea was that}} the tour wouldn't happen for another year or two. Had it been on in 1983, I'd have been less interested as I was still in the Test side and doing well at the time.... I was pretty happy with the money on offer. My career was pretty much over by then. Fast bowlers don't last forever. Prime minister [...] Hawke called us traitors. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it was okay for Hawke to trade with South Africa, it was okay for me to go and play cricket there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doll was honorably {{discharged}} from the military in June 1946 and returned to USC in time for summer practice. [...] In July 1946, Braven Dyer wrote that USC had found [...] "a new backfield star." [...] Dyer continued, [...] "Fresh out of the Marines, the lad's name is Doll, Don Doll, that is." [...] Doll had changed his surname from [...] "Burnside" [...] to [...] "Doll" [...] after being {{discharged from}} the military. [...] Doll later explained the reasoning behind his decision:"My stepfather, Adna Doll, raised me {{and as soon as}} I was old enough (and, incidentally, had dough for the legal transfer) I changed my name to his because I was grateful for all Dad had done for me. [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> any honors came my way in football, I'd like to be known by his name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I did, mother, it needn't prevent my {{coming here}} {{for a month or}} two first. It wouldn't be quite yet certainly,--if at all. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am going to settle myself in that way, you'd be glad that we should be {{altogether}} again for a little while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have, therefore, {{brought him}} to you; {{thinking}} that you would make a far better teacher, for a lad like him, than your brothers in the school. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> spoke to the abbot, he might release you from your attendance {{at some of the}} services, for such a purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, for {{no reason}} in particular. <b>I</b> just <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you hadn't, you might like a fish. But {{as long as you}} have breakfasted, of course you don't want one," [...] said Little Joe, his bright eyes {{beginning}} to twinkle. He held the fish out so that Grandfather Frog could see just how plump and nice they were.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, {{the band}} signed {{with a small}} New York record company called A Touch of Class for a two-single deal. Their first single [...] "Electrobix" [...] dealt with gay men's obsessions with working out but proved to be less popular than its B-side, a cover version of Pink Floyd's {{progressive}} rock classic [...] "Comfortably Numb". Matronic commented, [...] "It's one of those songs that people were either gonna love or hate, and that's really, really powerful, because it basically means you're evoking a reaction in everyone. The first time I heard it, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it doesn't make us famous, it'll make us infamous because somebody will shoot us!" [...] Their version of [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] became a hit in many dance clubs and, after sending Pink Floyd themselves a copy, the Scissor Sisters received positive remarks from the song's original writers Roger Waters and David Gilmour. The song proved to be particularly popular in the UK, where various record labels soon {{took an interest in}} the band. In 2003, they decided they would tour Europe where they believed audiences would be more receptive of them and their music than their native US.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have found}} your father," [...] he said, [...] "and your {{carriage}} is waiting. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Reist would {{excuse me for}} half-an-hour----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am glad,' I answered; and as I spoke <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he knew {{everything}} he would understand why my eyes glistened, as I am sure they did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But {{there is}} a {{difference}} between then and now, ma'am. She is distressed now, and <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you were to talk to her about me, and think favourably of me yourself, there might be a chance of winning her round, and getting her quite independent of this Wildeve's backward and forward play, and his not knowing whether he'll have her or no." ...|$|R
60|$|Often <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were {{doomed to}} solitary {{confinement}} {{for life and}} allowed but one book, I would choose the Bible, since, {{in addition to all}} its history and the splendour of its language, it contains the record of the hope of man, and therefore should be sufficient for him. So at least it had proved to be in this case.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} were sincere then, Jo, but lately <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely, and {{sometimes}} there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CHINN Well, sir, I thought that, perhaps--you see, sir, {{he has got}} {{a brother}} in Canada who would help him; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I could ship him off - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How insulting!--Intellectual, and so on; and I {{thought she}} would be just fit {{to live in a}} place where {{everybody}} is literary and intellectual. That is, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> I thought anything." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one of {{them would}} help me with the sea-feather, which seemed awfully heavy, two of us could {{certainly}} swim to the boat with four legs and two arms between us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] said he, [...] "ever sin I {{first saw}} thee <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might choose {{of all the}} world, thou only wouldst I choose for--for my true lady, {{to serve as a}} right knight should." [...] Here he stopped, frightened at his own boldness. Lady Alice stood quite still, with her face turned away. [...] "Thou--thou art not angered at what I say?" [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said nothing, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{to myself}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it was, Master Harry {{did not quite}} {{appreciate}} the performance, and small blame to him. At any rate, his teeth were chattering a little.|$|R
60|$|COADE. Of {{course it}} is. (Crestfallen.) But I see I {{was just the}} same nice old lazy Coady as before; and <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a second chance, I could do things. I have often said to you, Coady, that it was owing to my being cursed with a {{competency}} that I didn't write my great book. But I had no competency this time, and I haven't written a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} girl, slowly and thoughtfully, [...] "I haven't. I wanted to, at fust; and then, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he truly meant {{what he said}} {{he would be willing to}} wait." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{the trouble}} lay there {{he would take}} the opportunity. It brightened him somewhat, the {{necessity}} of replying to the question. It appeared that his wife was in the best of health.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{forgotten}} all the harsh things {{you said to}} me from time to time about Jimmy Crocker? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> you knew who I was, you would have nothing more to do with me." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Alicia came in, {{and with}} her a man whom I had never before seen. Yet I {{instantly}} bethought myself of a lean black snake, with a glittering and evil eye, which I had seen in Mrs. Montressor's garden two summers agone, and which was like to have bitten me. John, the gardener, had killed it, and <b>I</b> verily <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it had a soul, it must have gotten into this man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{a retired}} admiral of the British navy. You will find {{my name in}} the Navy List. There is my card. I have here my pension papers. I get L850 a year. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>if</b> you were to hold these papers it would be {{security}} enough that I should pay you. You could draw my pension, and repay yourselves at the rate, say, of L500 a year, taking your five per cent interest as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I {{have not}} pained you, Bell. I have been long {{thinking}} of this, but I am {{well aware that}} my own manner, even to you, has not been that of a lover. It is not in me to smile and say soft things, as Crosbie can. But I do not love you the less on that account. I have looked about for a wife, and <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could gain you I should be very fortunate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Why, {{he told me}} I {{had better}} dig it all up first; but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> I planted part first, those things would be growing while I am digging {{up the rest of}} the ground.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am your {{neighbor}} over yonder,' said I, nodding towards my house. 'I {{see that you}} have only just moved in, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I could be of any help to you in any--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{should not}} have said {{anything}} to you yet, only it pained {{me to think that}} there was anything between you--any aversion, I mean. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you knew, you would try and overcome it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> then <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the lioness did {{not cover}} thirty feet at every jump I {{was not in}} a {{condition}} to judge distance. She ran away from Don {{as if he had been}} tied and reached the thicket below a hundred yards ahead of him. And when Don leaving his brave pack far up the slide entered the thicket the lioness came out on the other side and bounded up the bare slope of yellow shale.|$|R
3000|$|... (P 4) I kept on {{gambling}} {{not because}} I {{want to win}} back all the money but it is because I want to win back all the trust, self-esteem and good relationships. <b>I</b> have always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have money, I will have all these things back.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish,' said Claire, fretfully, {{leading the}} way down the grillroom stairs, 'that you wouldn't let all London sponge on you like this.
