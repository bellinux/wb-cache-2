30|$|Synthetic <b>elastomers</b> can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{thermoplastic}} <b>elastomers</b> and cross-linked <b>elastomers,</b> based on the type of ‘cross-link’ used to join their molecular chains. Unlike cross-linked <b>elastomers,</b> where the cross-link is a covalent bond created during the vulcanization process, the cross-link in thermoplastic <b>elastomers</b> is a weaker dipole or hydrogen bond,or takes place in one of the phases of the material. Linear thermoplastic <b>elastomers</b> usually consist of two separated microphases: crystalline, hydrogen-bonded hard segments and amorphous soft segments. The crystalline or hard segments function as cross-linkers which provide mechanical strength and stiffness, whereas soft segments provide the flexibility (Hiki et al. [2000]).|$|R

25|$|After {{the last}} of the Kellogg {{interests}} of Pullman-Kellogg were spun off, and after the railcar manufacturing plants were sold, and with the formal dissolution of the old Pullman Company (the operating company from the 1944 split), the remaining portions of the Pullman interests were spun off in May 1985 by Waste Management, Inc., into a new Pullman Company. In November 1985, Pullman bought Peabody International and the new company took the new name of Pullman Peabody. In April 1987 (after Pullman Technology was sold to Bombardier), the name was changed back to Pullman Company. In July 1987 the company acquired Clevite Industries. By 1996, Pullman Co., with its Clevite subsidiary, was almost solely a supplier of automotive <b>elastomer</b> (rubber) parts, and in July 1996 the company was sold to Tenneco.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} color changes and force degradation of orthodontic elastomeric ligatures in different stretching patterns during a 8 -weeks period. METHODS: Two <b>elastomers</b> with the minimum and two with the maximum color changing, and gray <b>elastomers</b> of two brands (American Orthodontics and Ortho Technology) were selected according to an opinion poll with clinicians and color changes after 4 weeks of intraoral use were evaluated. These <b>elastomers</b> were mounted on special jigs fabricated using a CAD-CAM technique, underwent different stretching patterns and the force was measured in 0, 24 hours, 2, 4 and 8 weeks. During in vivo part of the study, force levels of <b>elastomers</b> were measured after 4 weeks on a material testing machine. Data were analyzed with four-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: All the <b>elastomers</b> showed color changing but the degree of color stability was significantly different. The mean force degradation was higher in 1 -mm stretch groups. After 8 weeks, the average residual force of <b>elastomers</b> was 1. 45 ± 0. 18 N and the maximum force decay was seen in the <b>elastomers</b> that exhibited the maximum initial force. CONCLUSION: There is significant relationship between the stretching pattern and the amount of residual force of <b>elastomers.</b> <b>Elastomers</b> with higher initial forces exhibited higher percentages of force loss after 8 weeks. It seems that there is a relationship between initial color and color changing of <b>elastomers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Thermoplastic <b>elastomers</b> (TPE), {{sometimes}} referred to as thermoplastic rubbers, are a class of copolymers or a physical mix of polymers (usually a plastic and a rubber) which consist of materials with both thermoplastic and elastomeric properties. While most <b>elastomers</b> are thermosets, thermoplastics are in contrast relatively easy to use in manufacturing, for example, by injection molding. Thermoplastic <b>elastomers</b> show advantages typical of both rubbery materials and plastic materials. The benefit of using thermoplastic <b>elastomers</b> is the ability to stretch to moderate elongations and return to its near original shape creating a longer life and better physical range than other materials. The principal difference between thermoset <b>elastomers</b> and thermoplastic <b>elastomers</b> is the type of cross-linking bond in their structures. In fact, crosslinking is a critical structural factor which imparts high elastic properties.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{desirable}} for biomedical applications, soft degradable <b>elastomers</b> having balanced amphiphilic behaviour are rarely {{described in the}} literature. Indeed, mainly highly hydrophobic <b>elastomers</b> or very hydrophilic <b>elastomers</b> with hydrogel behaviours are found. In this work, we developed thermoset degradable <b>elastomers</b> based on the photo-cross-linking of poly(lactide) -poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(lactide) (PLA-PEG-PLA) triblock prepolymers. The originality of the proposed <b>elastomers</b> comes from the careful choice of the prepolymer amphiphilicity and from the possible modulation of their mechanical properties and degradation rates provided by cross-linkers of different nature. This is illustrated with the hydrophobic and rigid 2, 4, 6 -triallyloxy- 1, 3, 5 -triazine compared to the hydrophilic and soft pentaerythritol triallyl ether. Thermal properties, mechanical properties, swelling behaviours, degradation rates and cytocompatibility have been evaluated.
