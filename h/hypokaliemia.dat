40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 54 -year-old {{alcoholic}} female patient who was hositalized for neurologic alterations along with a severe hyponatremia (plasma Na+: 97 m-Eq/ 1). She suffered from potomania and was given, a few days before admission, a thiazide diuretic for hypertension. A careful correction of plasma Na+ levels was initiated over a 48 -hour period (rate of correction < 10 mEq/l/ 24 h) in order to avoid brain demyelination. After a 2 -day period of clinical improvement, her neurologic condition started to deteriorate. By the 5 th day of admission, she became tetraplegic, presented pseudobulbar palsy, ataxia, strabism, extrapyramidal stiffness and clouding of consciousness. Scintigraphic and MRI investigations demonstrated pontine and extrapontine lesions associated with Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy. After correction of ionic disorders (hyponatremia, <b>hypokaliemia)</b> and vitamin B (thiamine) deficiency, the patient almost completely recovered without notable disabilities. This case illustrates that profound hyponatremia, in a paradigm of slow onset, can be compatible with life. It also demonstrates that demyelinating lesions, usually considered as a consequence of a too fast correction of hyponatremia, may occur despite the strict observance of recent guidelines. There is increasing evidence to suggest that pontine swelling and dysfunction may sometimes occur in alcoholic patients even in absence of disturbance in plasma Na+ levels. It is therefore of importance, while managing a hyponatremic alcoholic patient, to identify additional risk factors (<b>hypokaliemia,</b> hypophosphoremia, seizure-induced hypoxemia, malnutrition with vitamin B deficiency) for brain demyelination and to correct them appropriately...|$|E

40|$|Primary aldosteronism {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} hypertension. However, its {{incidence}} seems to be underestimated. It is important to identify this syndrom since the disease is potentially curable. In the present paper, we depict different forms of primary aldosteronism {{as well as the}} diagnostic procedures. When the diagnosis is suspected (hypertension associated to spontaneous or diuretic-induced <b>hypokaliemia),</b> the more efficient screening test is the determination of the aldosteron/renin ratio. Saline infusion or posture tests can thereafter confirm the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis between bilateral and unilateral forms of primary aldosteronism can be made by CT-scanner and the response of aldosterone to the posture test. Such a complex assessment leads to the identification of patients who can be surgically treated. This treatment consists in a unilateral adrenalectomy which can be realised by laparoscopy.

40|$|The {{glucocorticoid}} suppressible hyperaldosteronism (GSH) {{is a rare}} form {{of systemic}} hypertension. We report a family a father and his two children - with this disease.

But the two main features of GSH which distinguish it from other causes of hyperaldosteronism are the prompt reversal of the features of mineralocorticoids excess by glucocorticoid therapy and the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypokaliemic {{periodic}} paralysis is {{an uncommon}} complication of hyperthyroidism occurring sporadically {{almost exclusively in}} young Asian men. The clinical presentation {{is the same as}} in familial hypokaliemic periodic paralysis. Treatment consists of conventional management for thyrotoxicosis. CASE REPORT: A Laotian man aged 42 years had suffered episodes of pain and fatigue in the lower limbs lasting 2 to 7 days over the last few months. The patient was hospitalized with severe limb pain. Clinical examination found severe motor deficit involving all four limbs. Laboratory findings induced <b>hypokaliemia</b> (1. 8 mmol/l) and hyperthyroidism (free thyroxin 36 pmol/l, TSH < 0. 005 mlU/l). Thyroid echography revealed multinodular goitre with two heterogeneous nodules. Strong uptake was seen on the scintigram. The motor deficit regressed within 8 hours and the kaliemia was restored with 1. 50 g KCl. The patient was discharged with carbimazole (30 mg/d). Three months later he was euthyroid and symptom free. Total thyroidectomy was performed and L-thyroxin prescribed. The patient remains symptom-free at the last follow-up, 5 months after thyroidectomy. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of hypokaliemic periodic paralysis involves the ATPase-dependent sodium-potassium pump whose activity is stimulated by thyroid hormones.

40|$|IntroductionBoth type 1 Myotonic Dystrophy (Steinert disease) and Brugada {{syndrome}} may {{be complicated}} by conduction disturbances and sudden death. ST elevation {{in the right}} precordial leads {{is the hallmark of}} Brugada syndrome but may be seen in some myopathies. Mutations in DMPK gene in Steinert pts may lead to cytosolic accumulation of muted toxic RNA or altered alternate splicing of some RNA potentially causing sodium channel dysfunctions. The prevalence of Brugada ECG pattern in Steinert disease is unknown. Methodswe perform ajmaline challenge test (1 mg/kg over 5 min) during electrophysiological (EP) testing in a population of 44 Steinert disease pts (27 men, 41 ± 15 years old) without ST elevation at baseline. Left ventricular EF was normal in each case. The presence of type 1 ST elevation (> 2 mm J elevation with coved ST and negative T wave) after ajmaline challenge was correlated to clinical, ECG and electrophysiological variables. Results 8 pts (18 %) present type 1 ST elevation in the right precordial leads after ajmaline infusion. Brugada pattern was more often seen in men: 7 / 27 (26 %) vs 1 / 17 (6 %) (p= 0. 09). Patients with negative ajmaline test presented more often with fascicular block: 13 / 35 (27 %) versus none (p= 0. 03). Brugada pattern was not correlated to age, symptoms, PR interval, QRS, QT or QTc durations, HV interval (at baseline or after ajmaline), presence of bundle branch block, of late potentials at SA-ECG or inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias at EP study. Nine pts were implanted with a pace maker and four with an ICD. Significant or symptomatic bradycardia did not happen in any non implanted pts, while only one pt presented with malignant ventricular arrhythmias during the 6. 3 ± 2. 6 years follow-up (ventricular fibrillation with <b>hypokaliemia</b> in an ajmaline negative pt).

Presence of type 1 ST elevation under class 1 drug in Steinert disease do not seem to have some significant clinical or ECG correlations...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Tissue {{expose to}} {{excessive}} levels of circulating thyroid hormones results in thyrotoxicosis. In most cases, thyrotoxicosis {{is due to}} hyper-activity of the thyroid gland. Cardiovascular and myopathic manifestations are predominant clinical features in most hyperthyroid patients, aged 60 years and older. Some of patients have apathetic hyperthyreoidism which presents with weight loss, small goiter, severe depression and without clinical features of increased sympathetic activity [3, 6]. About 50 % of patients with cardiovascular manifestations have no evidence of underlying heart disease. Cardiac problems resolve when euthyreoid state is established [3]. Three treatment modalities are available in hyperthyreodism, namely medicament therapy, surgery and radioactive iodine. Antithyroid drug therapy complications, can be mild such as rash, which is managed without cessation of therapy by antihistamines administration. On the other hand, very serious complications such as agranulocytosis, necessitate immediate discontinuation of the medication and appropriate treatment. Although extremely rear, it is life-threatening with highly variable recovery time. CASE REPORT A 62 -year-old woman with recurrent hyperthyroidism was admitted after treatment of agranu locytosis due to antithyroid drugs in another institution with G-CSF. The patient presented with clinical features of apathetic hyperthyroidism with extremely elevated thyroid hormone levels (total and free T 4) and suppressed TSH. Radioactive iodine (5 mCi) was administered after increased thyroid uptake was confirmed. Echocardiography on admission was normal. ECG revealed moderately inverted T waves in standard and V 1, V 2 precordial leads. Laboratory analysis revealed mild normocytic anemia with normal white blood cell count, <b>hypokaliemia</b> and normal concentration of creatine phosphokinase lactic dehidrogenase and mildly elevated aspartate transaminase in sera. Chest X-ray was consistent with pulmonary emphysema. Because the worsening of ECG changes she was transferred to Coronary unit. The diagnosis of non-Q myocardial infarction was confirmed and treatment with nitrates and beta-adrenergic antagonists was instituted. Four weeks later she became euthyroid and coronarography was performed. Subepicardial coronary arteries were normal (Figure 1). She was dismissed, and still euthyroid three months later. DISCUSSION Agranulocytosis is very rare but very serious complication of antithyroid drug therapy. It can be detected in about 0. 1 - 1 % patients {{during the first three}} months of treatment. Sudden appearance, heralded by sore throat and fever, prompt physicians to seek white blood cell and differential count [1 - 3]. Confirmation of diagnosis urges cessation of drug therapy and appropriate antibiotic treatment. Recently, it was reported that recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) is to be effective in shortening the recovery time in the neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy and also in patients with other types of neutropenia [5]. Tamai at al. [7] confirmed positive outcome in 34 patients treated with rhG-CSF compared to corticosteroid treatment. Hematologic laboratory abnormalities disappear 7 - 10 days after secession of therapy. Patients completely recover two to three weeks later. Fatal outcome was also described [1 - 5]. Thyroid hormones have profound effects on cardiovascular physiology, especially on heart rate, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. In patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac output is much higher than in normal persons. This is the result of direct effect of thyroid hormones on cardiac muscle contractility, heart rate and decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Excessive thyroid hormone secretion increases cardiac Na-K-activated plasma membrane ATP-ase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-activated ATP-ase with resultant in increase myocardial contractility [6 9]. Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disorder in hyperthyroidism but paroxysmal tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are not rare. This can be explained by increased heart rate, cardiac output, blood volume, coronary artery flow and peripheral oxygen consumption in thyreotoxicosis [9]. Patients with coronary arteriosclerosis can develop angina pectoris during thyreotoxic stage, which can be explained by imbalance between cardiac demand and supply. Myocardial damage is often in thyrotoxic patients with chronic hart failure, together with myocardial infarction in patients without coronary disease [2, 6]. Congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation are relatively resistant to digitalis treatment because of high metabolic turn over of medication and excessive myocardial irritability in hyperthyro-idism [6]. Cardiovascular and myopathic manifestations predominate in older hyperthyroid patients (over 60 years) and some of them can have only few symptoms of hyperthyroidism [1 - 3]. Thyrotoxic state characterized by fatigue, apathy, extreme weakness, low-grade fever and sometimes congestive heart failure are designated as apathetic hyperthyroidism. Such patients have small goiters, mild tachycardia and often cool and dry skin with few eye signs [6]. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation [9]. Unstable angina and non-Q myocardial infarction (non ST elevation) are acute manifestation of coronary artery disease. The acute coronary syndrome of unstable angina, non-Q myocardial infarction and Q-wave myocardial infarction have atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries as a common pathogenic substrate. Errosions or ruptures of unstable atherosclerotic plaque triggered pathophysiologic processes, resulted in thrombus formation at the site of arterial injury. This leads to abrupt reduction or cessation through the affected vessel. Clinical manifestations of unstable angina and non-Q myocardial infarction are similar and diagnosis of non-Q myocardial infarction is made on the basis of elevated serum markers indicative of cardiac necrosis, detected in peripheral circulation. Acute coronary syndrome ranging from unstable angina to myocardial infarction an non-Q myocardial infarction represents increasingly severe manifestations of the same pathophysiologic processes [10, 11]. In conclusion, these 62 -year-old woman presented with apathetic form of recurrent hyperthyroidism associated with two serious complications life-threatening agranulocytosis and acute coronary syndrome...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome}} is a clinical state resulting from prolonged, inappropriate exposure to excessive endogenous secretion of Cortisol and hence excess circulating free cortisol, characterized by {{loss of the}} normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion [2]. The etiology of Cushing's syndrome may be excessive ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland, ectopic ACTH secretion by nonpituitary tumor, or excessive autonomous secretion of cortisol from a hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. Other than this broad ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent categories, the syndrome {{may be caused by}} ectopic CRH secretion, PPNAD, MAH, ectopic action of GIP or catecholamines, and other adrenel-dependent processes associated with adrenocortical hyperfunction. CASE REPORT A 31 year-old men with b-month history of hyperpigmentation, weight gain and proximal myopathy was refereed to Institute of Endocrinology for evaluation of hypercortisolism. At admission, patient had classic cushingoid habit with plethoric face, dermal and muscle atrophy, abdominal strie rubrae and centripetal obesity. The standard laboratory data showed hyperglycaemia and <b>hypokaliemia</b> with high potassium excretion level. The circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion was blunted, with moderately elevated ACTH level, and without cortisol suppression after low-dose and high-dose dexamethason suppression test. Urinary 5 HIAA was elevated. Abdominal and sellar region magnetic resonance imaging was negative. CRH stimulation resulted in ACTH increase of 87 % of basal, but without significant increase of cortisol level, only 7 %. Thoracal CT scan revealed 14 mm mass in right apical pulmonary segment. A wedge resection of anterior segment of right upper lobe was performed. Microscopic evaluation showed tumor tissue consisting of solid areas of uniform, oval cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally located nuclei. Stromal tissue was scanty, and mitotic figures were infrequent. Tumor cells were immunoreactive for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, and ACTH. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on glucocorticoid supplementation. Signs of Cushing's syndrome were in regression, and patient remained normotensive and normoglycaemic without therapy. DISCUSSION A multitude of normal nonpituitary cells from different organs and tissues have been shown to express the POMC gene from which ACTH is derived. The tumors most commonly associated the ectopic ACTH syndrome arise from neuroendocrine tissues, APUD cells. POMC gene expression in non-pituitary cells differs from that in pituitary cells both qualitatively and quantitatively [8], Aggressive tumors, like small cell cancer of the lung (SCCL) preferentially release intact POMC, whereas carcinoids rather overprocess the precursor, releasing ACTH and smaller peptides like CLIP. Some tumors associated with ectopic ACTH syndrome express other markers of neuroendocrine differentiation like two specific prohormone convertases (PCs). Assessment of vasopressin (V 3) receptor gene expression in ACTH-producing nonpituitary tumors revealed bronchial carcinoid as a particular subset of tumors where both V 3 receptor and POMC gene may be expressed in pattern indistinguishable from that in corticotroph adenoma [9]. In most, but not all, patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome, cortisol is unresponsive to high-dose dexamethason suppression test, what is used as diagnostic tool. It is not clear if the primary resistance resulted from structural abnormality of the native glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a low level of expression, or some intrinsic property of the cell line [9]. It appears that ectopic ACTH {{syndrome is}} made of two different entities. When it is because of highly differentiated tumors, with highest level of pituitary-like POMC mRNA, expressing PCs, high level of V 3 receptors and GR, like bronchial carcinoids, it might be called ectopic corticotroph syndrome. In contrast, when it is caused by aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors, with much lower expression of V 3 receptor, like SCCL, it might be called aberrant ACTH secretion syndrome. Carcinoid tumors have been reported {{in a wide range of}} organs but most commonly involve the lungs, bronchi, and gastrointestinal tract. They arise from neuroendocrine cells and are characterized by positive reactions to markers of neuroendocrine tissue, including neuron specific enolase, synaptophysin, and chromogranina [11]. Carcinoid tumors are typically found to contain numerous membrane-bound neurosecretory granules composed of variety of hormones and biogenic amines. One of the best characterized is serotonin, subsequently metabolized to 5 -hydrohy-indolacetic acid (5 -HIAA), which is excreted in the urine. In addition to serotonin, carcinoid tumors have been found to secrete ACTH, histamine, dopamine, substance P, neurotensin, prostaglandins and kallikrein. The release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances is thought to cause carcinoid syndrome, which manifestations are episodic flushing, weezing, diarrhea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease. These tumors have been classified as either well-differentiated or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. The term „pulmonary tumorlets" describes multiple microscopic nests of neuroendocrine cells in the lungs [12]. Pulmonary carcinoids make up approximately 2 percents of primary lung tumors. The majority of these tumors are perihilar in location, and patients often presents with recurrent pneumonia, cough, hemoptisis, or chest pain. The carcinoid syndrome occurs in less than 5 percent of cases. Ectopic secretion of ACTH from pulmonary carcinoid accounts for 1 percent of all cases of Cushing's syndrome. They are distinct clinical and pathologic entity, generally peripheral in location. Although they are usually typical by standard histologie criteria, they have mush greater metastatic potential than hormonally quiescent typical carcinoids [13]. Surgical treatment therefore should be one proposed for more aggressive malignant tumors. In all cases of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome with regular pituitary MRI and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling, thin-section and spiral CT scanning of the chest should be routine diagnostic procedure [14], We present thirty-one year old patient with typical pulmonary carcinod with ACTH ectopic secretion consequently confirmed by histology...|$|E
