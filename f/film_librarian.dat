40|$|The stereotypical {{image of}} the female {{librarian}} as an uptight spinster has prevailed in popular culture. This paper examines the portrayal of the librarian stereotype in movies from two different eras: the 1940 s/ 1950 s and the 2000 s. The historical antecedents, social and economic status of women are examined, {{and the influence of}} computers and technology in the library is considered. Common traits that typify the <b>film</b> <b>librarian,</b> along with the inclusions of computers in the library, are identified and analyzed. Approaches to combatting the stereotypes are discussed and applied to the movies in order to discover any progression of the image in 60 years. It is concluded that while there has been some progress in the characterization of librarians in movies, overall there has been little change in 60 years...|$|E

That means it’s underpaid and undervalued!” In Party Girl, a film from 1995, Judy reflects on what was a common assessment of the librarian’s profession for women throughout the 20 th century. What are the common traits of this condescending image? What are its social roots? and has the librarian’s offensive image changed or improved over the years or has it remained the same? This article begins to explore the visual images and stereotypes appearing in films produced {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. Of the four-hundred-odd <b>films</b> featuring <b>librarians,</b> I will focus here on three in which the female librarian is the main character, two from the 1950 s and one from the mid 1990 s: Storm Center (Daniel Taradash, 1956), Desk Set (Walter Lang, 1958) and Party Girl (Daisy von Scherler Mayer, 1995) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{result was}} a 16½-minute {{documentary}} film, narrated by the actor Will Geer, and consisting of both moving images and Dick's photographs {{of the region and}} its people. [...] The film, titled Men and Dust, was released in conjunction with the Association of Documentary Film Producers in New York; Lee Dick, his wife, is credited as producer under the aegis of Dial Films. The score, by Fred Stewart (an actor), and narration included both informational and more suggestive narration; a comment by Paul Bowles on the film's use of sound provides a useful description: One does not remember any music as such, but rather a constant sound of human voices, talking, singing, or humming. The idea of the possibility of human ascendancy over the deplorable conditions shown is thus made more vivid. Dick's film proved to be his most influential effort; it is cited in modern scholarship on the region's history, and his photographs of the miners and their families were displayed in a New York gallery to positive reviews. [...] Film scholar William Alexander, documenting films of the American left wing, has said that Men and Dust is [...] "affecting and powerful" [...] through its [...] "mind-jogging changes of stance."

His books are what compelled me to do this." [...] Machen's stories are specifically mentioned in the <b>film</b> by the <b>librarian</b> character. Del Toro is a long-standing admirer of Machen and said his work was also an influence on El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) and Hellboy II: The Golden Army both of which also feature fairy creatures.
