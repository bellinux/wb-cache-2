5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E
5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs were that the original estimate of £12M was not based on any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. <b>Extra</b> <b>costs</b> of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to late delivery and under-performance. Siemens guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. Siemens had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which were up to 42 years old, in operational condition to keep services running. The <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These costs would continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation noise levels in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of an arch bridge was viewed as wasteful in respect to the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> associated with building this type of bridge. Other designs which were less expensive in nature were rejected in favour of the more expensive tied arch design.

The design envisaged the future railway line run on the new bridge piers for part of the distance underneath the motorway structure, thus saving some of the high costs associated with strengthening the bridge {{to be able to take}} a cantilevered bridge – estimated at around NZ$20 million in <b>extra</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The board {{also wanted}} to {{introduce}} ten-minute headway and, unlike the other routes, remove the conductor. It was also decided to build the terminus at Ankers gate, based on studies {{of the number of}} people walking past each station. The city engineer consequently recommended building double track along the whole line. The city council approved building the line on 28 October 1926, but without double track all the way. However, the decision of where to place the terminal stop in the city was delayed. In the end, the board voted to build the line to the railway station, in part because the calculations of <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> were not documented well enough.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, amidst {{uncertainty}} over <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> {{involved with the}} computers, the Government of New South Wales rejected an offer for extra funding from the Commonwealth Government. The State Government requested additional funds to cover servicing, technical support, upgraded power supplies, software licensing, security and teacher training associated with installing the computers. After failing to secure assistance, the State Government then requested an extension to the 9 October deadline, for applications {{in the second round}} of funding. After being denied an extension, the State Government said it had been forced to refuse the offer until the extent of its financial crisis was clarified in the 2008 mini-budget.|$|E

In financial markets, Lonmin's share prices initially rose by over 9%, but later receded as investors were made aware of the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> now incurred in wages while the company was already in the midst of struggling with its balance sheet and the unprofitable mine shafts.

25|$|On 24 November 2016, the Canadian {{government}} announced that starting from 25 November 2016, Mexican nationals {{can apply for}} the eTA online. However, Mexicans entering Canada before 1 December would continue to need a visa. On the same day, Mexican nationals could no longer apply for a visa online and had to apply on paper through a visa application centre. The visa requirement was lifted on 1 December as planned and the issuance of visas to Mexican nationals ceased, although Statistics Canada predicts that the net cost of lifting the visa requirement is over C$262 million in the next decade, which includes the additional immigration enforcement resources and the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of processing asylum claims.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques. From 1991, the NIH permitted patents {{to be taken out}} on anonymous gene fragments. This created <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> and impediments to creating new treatments and tests. Although in principle rights holders could come together to make a deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent deals that would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that human genes were not patentable.|$|E

25|$|Before IBAN, differing {{national}} standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Trade were reticent about {{allowing}} a Municipal Authority, {{in this case}} Bradford, to build a railway which was located outside its area of jurisdiction, and was not connected to a railway which started within its area. However, on 30 December 1903, a transfer order was granted, with powers to borrow up to £30,000 to fund the project. In May 1904, the Board of Trade agreed to a change to standard gauge, and borrowing powers were increased to £66,000 in 1908, because of the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of building the wider formation. The document was signed by Winston Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade. In addition to the main reservoir contract, John Best was awarded a contract to build the light railway to Lofthouse for £23,000, and a tramway from Lofthouse to Angram for £5,385.|$|E
25|$|Thermally {{lethargic}} {{technologies like}} coal and nuclear are physically incapable of fast ramping. Capital intensive {{technologies such as}} wind, solar, and nuclear are economically disadvantaged unless generating at maximum availability since the LCOE is nearly all sunk-cost capital investment. Intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar, may incur <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> associated with needing to have storage or backup generation available. At the same time, intermittent sources can be competitive if they are available to produce when demand and prices are highest, such as solar during summertime mid-day peaks seen in hot countries where air conditioning is a major consumer. Despite these time limitations, leveling costs is often a necessary prerequisite for making comparisons {{on an equal footing}} before demand profiles are considered, and the levelized-cost metric is widely used for comparing technologies at the margin, where grid implications of new generation can be neglected.|$|E
