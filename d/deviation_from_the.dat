The S-B IV adopted new classification terminology. After this test was published, psychologist Nathan Brody lamented that IQ tests had still not caught up with advances in research on human intelligence during the twentieth century.|$|E

In addition we identified that in isolation from specific legal relations arising on the basis of the regulatory norms there are no <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> declarative norms. However in case of violation of regulatory norms the information contained in the declarative norm can be refuted. Consequently <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> latter take place during the violation of regulatory norms.

5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it.

When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E

5|$|Sitting in Paris, the Tribunal of Arbitration {{finalized}} {{its decision}} on 3 October 1899. The award was unanimous, but gave no {{reasons for the}} decision, merely describing the resulting boundary, which gave Britain almost 90% of the disputed territory. The Schomburgk Line was, with small deviations, re-established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela. The first <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Schomburgk line was that Venezuela's territory included Barima Point {{at the mouth of}} the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second was drawing the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela a substantial territory east of the line – territory which Britain had originally refused to include in the arbitration. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into the vault above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} {{to promote the}} Sino-Roman connection for tourism, but Dubs' synthesis of Roman and Chinese sources has not found acceptance among historians, {{on the grounds that}} it is highly speculative and reaches too many conclusions without sufficient hard evidence. DNA testing in 2005 confirmed the Indo-European ancestry of a few inhabitants of modern Liqian; this could be explained by transethnic marriages with Indo-European people known to have lived in Gansu in ancient times, such as the Yuezhi and Wusun. A much more comprehensive DNA analysis of more than two hundred male residents of the village in 2007 showed close genetic relation to the Han Chinese populace and great <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Western Eurasian gene pool. The researchers conclude that the people of Liqian are probably of Han Chinese origin. The area lacks archaeological evidence of Roman presence.|$|E

On the return journey, Frost learned that the naval force had received no signals apart from the signal flare, and {{had spent much of}} the time hiding from a German naval patrol that had nearly discovered them. The journey back to Britain was uneventful, with the force being escorted by four destroyers and a flight of Spitfires.|$|E

5|$|Planning for {{the freeway}} began in 1954, with the {{proposal}} for a freeway from Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway, later I-5, via Broad and Mercer streets added to the city's comprehensive plan in 1957. Funded by a bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1960, plans were drawn for the newly renamed Bay Freeway to serve a multi-purpose stadium at the Seattle Center via an elevated structure. Citizen groups voiced {{their opposition to the}} project at public hearings in 1967, forcing the Seattle Engineering Department to consider other designs. After determining that a cut-and-cover tunnel would not be feasible, a second series of public hearings to discuss the impact of an elevated option were held in 1970, leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched in opposition to the freeway. The lawsuit ended in November 1971, with a King County Superior Court judge ruling that a major <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> voter-approved 1960 plan occurred, forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue the project. On February 8, 1972, the Bay Freeway project was rejected by a 10,000-vote margin in a municipal referendum, alongside the repeal of the R.H. Thomson Expressway. Mercer Street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by the rejected freeway, culminating in the Mercer Corridor Project in 2012, which widened the street into a boulevard.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} façade is {{the great}} south front, a two-storey colonnade of Corinthian columns superimposed on Tuscan, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The columns are not stone, but wood coated in stucco. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747–51; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle's patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and {{for much of the}} work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment). The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio's Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms would be on the first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to service rooms. Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible here since the house was a partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.|$|E
