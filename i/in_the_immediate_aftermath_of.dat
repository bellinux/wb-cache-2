5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the executions, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that up to}} 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty.

His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions.
