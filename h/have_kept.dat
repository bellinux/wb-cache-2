5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|Humans <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> {{honey bee}} colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E

But I can keep silence no longer, for these charges and suggestion have now been repeated by public men who have not scrupled to use their position to inflame the overstrained feelings of the people.|$|E
5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, {{including}} cardiac conditions {{and a range of}} eye issues.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these had she been underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control teams would <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the ship afloat.|$|E

Bush stated that {{opponents of the}} Act's reauthorization were [...] "wrong" [...] and that [...] "the Patriot Act <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> us safe, plain and simple. The metadata program <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> us safe, plain and simple. There's been no violation of civil liberties." ...|$|R
50|$|The Arakanese {{language}} retains r- {{separate from}} y-, whereas the two fall together in most Burmese dialects and indeed most Burmish languages. Tavoyan <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> kl- distinct. No dialect <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> ry- distinct from r-, {{but this may}} be an independent innovation in the various dialects. Merguiese is apparently the least well studied Burmese dialect.|$|R
5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|The United States is {{a melting}} pot {{consisting}} of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music. Some nationalities have produced local scenes in {{regions of the country}} where they have clustered, like Cape Verdean music in New England, Armenian music in California, and Italian and Ukrainian music in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} {{also resulted in}} tidal heating of its interior, which could <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy was {{permitted}} to retain Regina Elena and her three sisters. The Italian Navy could <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the ships in service indefinitely, but they could not be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system. Nevertheless, she was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that could <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Bolton were relegated on goal {{difference}} {{at the end}} of the 1997–98 Premiership campaign. They finished on the same number of points as Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> them up. The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after this}} loss, England could <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> their chances alive by winning their final pool match against Spain. However, {{they were unable}} to do this, losing 1–0, and {{finishing}} the First Round with a record of 1–0–2. The U.S. also lost their next match 5–2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1–0–2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990. Spain advanced to the four-team Final Round, finishing fourth. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc may not <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record {{to play at}} a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} Premier League debut against West Ham United in August 2009 and played {{regularly}} during the 2009–10 season, scoring {{three times to}} help them achieve top flight survival. In September 2010, he signed a new contract which would <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> him at the club until the summer of 2015, and was once again a regular in the Wolves team during the 2010–11 season, scoring four Premier League goals, his highest tally for four seasons. On 19 May 2011, Jarvis was awarded both Supporters' Player of the Season award and Players' Player of the season awards.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators in particular <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs {{have also been}} important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
