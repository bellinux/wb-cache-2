50|$|On 1 December 1948 it was redesignated the 603d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, under {{direct control}} of the 7402d Aircraft Control and Warning Group. Its mission was to provide early warning radar and <b>direction-finding</b> <b>network</b> to support {{tactical}} air operations of USAFE and to provide navigational aids to friendly aircraft.|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} <b>direction-finding</b> <b>network</b> for {{the detection}} of lightning cloud-to-ground strikes has been installed along the east coast of the United States. Most of the lightning occurring from Maine to Florida and as far west as Ohio is detected. Time, location, flash polarity, stroke count, and peak signal amplitude are recorded in real time. Flash locations, time, and polarity are displayed routinely for research and operational purposes. Flash density maps have been generated for the summers of 1983 and 1984, when the network only extended to North Carolina, and show density maxima in northern Virginia and Maryland...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{is described in}} which isolated radar echoes associated with clusters of lightning strikes are used to validate and improve the location accuracy of a lightning-direction-finding network. Using this technique, site errors of a magnetic <b>direction-finding</b> <b>network</b> for locating lightning strikes to ground were accurately determined. The technique offers advantages over existing techniques in that large sample sizes are readily attainable over a broad area on a regular basis; the technique can also provide additional constraints to redundant data methods such as that described by Orville (1987). Since most lightning strike networks have either partial or full weather radar coverage, the {{technique is}} practical for {{all but a few}} users...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} <b>direction-finding</b> <b>network</b> for {{the detection}} of lightning cloud-to-ground strikes has been installed along the east coast of the United States. Time, location, flash polarity, stroke count, and peak signal amplitude are recorded in real time. The data were recorded from Maine to North Carolina and as far west as Ohio; analyses were restricted to flashes within 300 km of a direction finder. Measurements of peak signal strength have been obtained from 720, 284 first return strokes lowering negative charge. The resulting distribution indicates that few negative strokes have peak currents exceeding 100 kA. Measurements have also been obtained of peak signal strength from 17, 694 first return strokes lowering positive charge. These strokes have a median peak current of 45 kA, with some peak currents reaching 300 - 400 kA. The median peak signal strength and the peak current, double from summer to winter for both negative and positive first return strokes. The polarity of ground flashes is observed to be less than 5 percent positive throughout the summer and early fall, then increases to over 50 percent during the winter, and returns to less than 10 percent in early spring. The percent of positive flashes with one stroke is observed to be approximately 90 percent throughout the year. The percent of negative flashes with one stroke is observed to increase from 40 percent in the summer to approximately 80 percent in January, returning to less than 50 percent in the spring...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{lightning}} {{may improve}} rain estimates made from infrared {{images of a}} geostationary satellite. We address this proposition through a case from the Cooperative Huntsville Meteorological Experiment (COHMEX). During the afternoon and evening of 13 July 1986 waves of showers and thunderstorms developed over and near the lower Tennessee River Valley. For the shower and thunderstorm region within 200 km of the National Weather Service radar at Nashville, Tennessee, we measure cold-cloud area in a sequence of GOES infrared images covering all but {{the end of the}} shower and thunderstorm period. From observations of the NASA/Marshall <b>direction-finding</b> <b>network</b> in this small domain, we also count cloud-to-ground lightning flashes and, from scans of the Nashville radar, we calculate volume rain flux. Using {{a modified version of the}} Williams and Houze scheme, over an area within roughly 240 km of the radar (the large domain), we identify and track cold cloud systems. For these systems, over the large domain, we measure area and count flashes; over the small domain, we calculate volume rain flux. For a temperature threshold of 235 K, peak cloud area over the small domain lags both peak rain flux and peak flash count by about four hours. At a threshold of 226 K, the lag is about two hours. Flashes and flux are matched in phase. Over the large domain, nine storm systems occur. These range in size from 300 to 60, 000 km(exp 2); in lifetime, from about 2 1 / 2 h to 6 h or more. Storm system area lags volume rain flux and flash count; nevertheless, it is linked with these variables. In essential respects the associations were the same when clouds were defined by a threshold of 226 K. Tentatively, we conclude that flash counts complement infrared images in providing significant additional information on rain flux...|$|E
