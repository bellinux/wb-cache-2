25|$|The <b>horn</b> <b>fly,</b> as can {{be gleaned}} from its taxonomic {{designation}} Haematobia irritans, is an irritant to livestock. Beyond this, incessant biting is compounded by loss of blood, and results in such detrimental effects on host physiology as to include reduction in milk production, efficiency, and rate of gain.

There is some controversy over whether the <b>horn</b> <b>fly</b> is a disease vector, with at least one source asserting that the flies can be an intermediate host of Stephanofilaria stilesi, a parasite of cattle in North America.|$|E

25|$|Haematobia irritans, the <b>horn</b> <b>fly,</b> is a {{small fly}} (about {{half the size of}} a common housefly) {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758. It is of the genus Haematobia which is the European genus of bloodsucking flies. Haematobia irritans is a native of Europe but has been introduced to North America and is considered a potentially dangerous livestock pest.|$|E
25|$|Found {{primarily}} {{in and around}} the states surrounding Kansas. Haematobia irritans is not native to the U.S. and originally came from Europe. It can live in any similarly climatized area, as evidenced by its most recent spread to Argentina and Uruguay. In the U.S., the active time of the <b>horn</b> <b>fly</b> is between April and October and, in a warm fall, even as late as mid-November. The flies are often most abundant from June through mid-July with a second population peak in mid-to-late August.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the <b>horn</b> <b>fly.</b> Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the <b>horn</b> <b>fly</b> by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance. In addition, methoprene in the form of sustained release bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|E

40|$|<b>Horn</b> <b>flies</b> {{from wild}} populations were {{collected}} on cattle and exposed to filter papers impregnated with cypermethrin, permethrin, or diazinon and mortality was assessed after two hours. Resistance to cypermethrin was detected in all populations, with resistance ratios (RR) ranging from 27. 6 to 91. 3 -fold. Permethrin bioassays provided apparently low levels of resistance (RR< 5), however, resistant flies were found in 96. 9 % of the populations based on diagnostic concentrations. From both pyrethroid bioassays, resistance was detected in 97. 4 % of the populations. On the other hand, a high susceptibility to diazinon (RR d 1. 1) was detected in all populations. Pyrethroid products, most cypermethrin (92. 3 %) and deltamethrin (66. 7 %), were used in all ranches controlling <b>horn</b> <b>flies</b> (97. 5 %). Insecticide treatments, usually incorrectly applied, were routinely delivered by manual backpack sprayers in most ranches (84. 5 %). This profile of insecticide use helps to explain the widespread resistance of <b>horn</b> <b>flies</b> to pyrethroids in the state {{as well as their}} high susceptibility to the organophosphate. Inadequate control practices contribute to aggravate the resistance problem and its consequences. 200...|$|R
25|$|The first beetles to be {{imported}} to Australia came from Hawaii. Here, dung beetles, particularly the species Onthophagus gazella, {{had already been}} successfully introduced from Africa {{in order to help}} biologically control the numbers of <b>horn</b> <b>fly.</b> It was thought that these beetles would be a safe source since the only parasite present in Hawaii that does not already exist in Australia is the giant liver fluke, Fasciola gigantean, the eggs of which do not survive ingestion by beetles. Samples of O. gazella were shipped to the CSIRO research base in Canberra, where they were kept under quarantine and observed before potential release. Unfortunately, direct importation from Hawaii was found to be unviable since it was discovered that the beetles were infested with potentially harmful pyemotid mites. For this reason, these particular beetles were never released onto Australian pastures.|$|E
25|$|Fly control : Introducing dung beetles as a {{means to}} control fly populations was first {{utilised}} in Hawaii as a biological control against the <b>horn</b> <b>fly</b> (Haematobia irritans irritans). It was found that 96% fewer flies emerged from dung pads in open pastures with a dung beetle fauna in Hawaii compared to controls. It was surmised that the introduction of dung beetles to Australia would also have a reducing effect on the number of bush flies (Musca vetustissima) and the blood-sucking buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua). In addition to dung beetles, predacious beetles of the Histerid family, which are less sensitive to changes in soil moisture, were introduced to Australia as another means of controlling fly populations during periods of relative inactivity by dung beetles. However, these beetles were found to make little difference to the abundance of flies, so their introduction was discontinued in 1971.|$|E

25|$|Despite its pest {{status and}} notoriety, the red {{imported}} fire ant can be beneficial. The ant {{is an effective}} insect predator, so it {{may serve as a}} biological agent against other pest species, especially in sugarcane fields. Pest insects the ant kills include: boll weevils (Anthonomus grandis) in cotton crops, sugarcane borers (Diatraea saccharalis) in sugarcane fields, <b>horn</b> <b>flies</b> (Haematobia irritans) in manure, velvetbean caterpillars (Anticarsia gemmatalis) in soybeans, and whiteflies that are found in greenhouses. A number of studies indicate that red imported fire ants do not interfere or attack insects of economic importance in cotton fields, which has resulted in many farmers in the southeastern regions of the United States viewing red imported fire ants as beneficial. However, some scientists have suggested that the beneficial status of the red imported fire ant is hard to predict when geography, plant size, season, soil moisture and the use of insecticides are not considered. These factors may lower the efficacy of red imported fire ants as pest control agents. Another factor is that workers are indiscriminate and kill beneficial insects such as predators that eat <b>horn</b> <b>flies</b> and other pests in pastures and predators of aphids and scale insects. They also reduce the efficacy of parasitic wasps against pest species by eating the larvae and pupae.|$|R
