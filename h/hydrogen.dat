5|$|At room temperature, <b>hydrogen</b> bromide is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} the <b>hydrogen</b> halides apart from <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride, since <b>hydrogen</b> cannot form strong <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak <b>hydrogen</b> bonding is present in solid crystalline <b>hydrogen</b> bromide at low temperatures, similar to the <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous <b>hydrogen</b> bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, <b>hydrogen</b> {{chloride}} is a colourless gas, {{like all}} the <b>hydrogen</b> halides apart from <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride, since <b>hydrogen</b> cannot form strong <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak <b>hydrogen</b> bonding is present in solid crystalline <b>hydrogen</b> chloride at low temperatures, similar to the <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the <b>hydrogen</b> halides except <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride, since <b>hydrogen</b> cannot form strong <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between <b>hydrogen</b> and iodine at room temperature to give <b>hydrogen</b> iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} <b>hydrogen</b> halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—NMR {{experiments}} {{can provide}} distances between pairs of <b>hydrogens</b> of a protein molecule. The problem of identifying the coordinates of such <b>hydrogens</b> by exploiting {{the information on}} the distances is a Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). In a previous work, we defined an artificial backbone of <b>hydrogens</b> related to the protein backbones, where a particular ordering was given to the <b>hydrogens.</b> This ordering allows to formulate the MDGP as a combinatorial optimization problem, to which we refer as the Discretizable MDGP (DMDGP) and that we efficiently solve by an exact algorithm, the Branch and Prune (BP) algorithm. Once the coordinates of the <b>hydrogens</b> have been found, the problem of finding the remaining backbone atoms (N, Cα and C) is another MDGP. In this short paper, we propose a simple method for solving the MDGP related to the backbone atoms N, Cα and C of a protein, where the coordinates of the <b>hydrogens</b> previously found by the BP algorithm are exploited.

5|$|H2 {{reacts with}} every {{oxidizing}} element. <b>Hydrogen</b> can react spontaneously and violently {{at room temperature}} with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding <b>hydrogen</b> halides, <b>hydrogen</b> chloride and <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride, which are also potentially dangerous acids.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by <b>hydrogen</b> bonding, resembling water more than <b>hydrogen</b> chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier <b>hydrogen</b> halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. <b>Hydrogen</b> fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E

50|$|For some experiments, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to identify the labile <b>hydrogens</b> on a compound, that is <b>hydrogens</b> that can easily exchange away as H+ ions on some positions in a molecule. With addition of D2O, {{sometimes referred to as}} a D2O shake, labile <b>hydrogens</b> exchange away and are substituted by deuterium (2H) atoms. These positions in the molecule then do not appear in the 1H-NMR spectrum.|$|R
25|$|Oxygen is more {{electronegative}} than carbon, {{thus the}} <b>hydrogens</b> alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. They {{are far less}} acidic than <b>hydrogens</b> alpha to carbonyl groups (such as in ketones or aldehydes), however.|$|R
50|$|In {{the above}} case, the {{dehydrogenase}} has transferred a hydride while releasing a proton, H+, but dehydrogenases can also transfer two <b>hydrogens,</b> using FAD as an electron acceptor. This would be depicted as AH2 + B ↔ A + BH2.A double bond is normally formed {{in between the}} two atoms that the <b>hydrogens</b> were taken from, {{as in the case}} of succinate dehydrogenase.

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing <b>hydrogen</b> gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate <b>hydrogen</b> gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the <b>hydrogen</b> bonds in the water and producing <b>hydrogen</b> gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the <b>hydrogen</b> gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary <b>hydrogen</b> gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate <b>hydrogen.</b> The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used.

40|$|AbstractResults of a Fourier transform-ion {{cyclotron}} resonance study are reported concerning the reactivity of protonated perdeuteromethane and deuteronated methane, generated under varying pressure conditions in an external chemical ionization ion source, toward ammonia. The competition between proton and deuteron transfer from both protonated perdeuteromethane and deuteronated methane to ammonia exhibits chemically distinguishable <b>hydrogens.</b> The chemical behavior of protonated methane {{appears to be}} compatible with the theoretically predicted stable structure with CS symmetry, involving a three-center two-electron bond associating two <b>hydrogens</b> and the carbon atom.

40|$|AbstractThe isotopic {{exchange}} of amide <b>hydrogens</b> in proteins in solution strongly {{depends on the}} surrounding protein structure, thereby allowing structural studies of proteins by mass spectrometry. However, during electrospray ionization (ESI), gas phase processes may scramble or deplete the isotopic information. These processes have been investigated by on-line monitoring of the exchange of labile deuterium atoms in homopeptides with <b>hydrogens</b> from a solvent suitable for ESI. The relative contribution of intra- and inter-molecular exchange in the gas phase could be studied from their distinct influence on the well-characterized exchange processes in the spraying solution. The deuterium content of individual labile <b>hydrogens</b> was assessed from the isotopic patterns of two consecutive collision- induced dissociation fragments, as observed with a 9. 4 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. Results demonstrate that gas phase exchange in the high-pressure region between the capillary and the skimmer cause substantial depletion of the isotopic information of penta-phenylalanine and penta-aspartic acid. For penta-alanine and hexa-tyrosine, the amide <b>hydrogens</b> located close to the N-terminus are depleted from deuterium during mass analysis. Amide <b>hydrogens</b> located close to the C-terminus still retain the information of the isotopic state in solution, but they are redistributed by intra-molecular exchange of the amide <b>hydrogens</b> with the C-terminal hydroxyl group...|$|R
5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as <b>hydrogen.</b> In <b>hydrogen</b> astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the <b>hydrogen</b> atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of <b>hydrogen</b> (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies <b>hydrogen</b> transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce <b>hydrogen,</b> and methanogenic Archaea that consume <b>hydrogen.</b> The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces <b>hydrogen</b> that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the <b>hydrogen</b> concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} <b>hydrogen</b> and helium, most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the gas phase, because <b>hydrogen</b> becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes <b>hydrogen</b> to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the <b>hydrogen</b> data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena.
