5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> approaching the planet than when the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> shorter when the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by <b>Earth,</b> <b>is</b> described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E

Rare <b>earths</b> <b>are</b> used practically in almost all aspects of life and these applications are due to their outstanding properties, mainly spectroscopic and magnetic.

5|$|Although the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} body within {{the solar system}} known to support life, {{evidence}} suggests that {{in the distant past}} the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.

5|$|Climate is {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} planet from the Sun {{and the only}} object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> the densest planet in the Solar System and {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E

5|$|Human {{cultures}} have developed many {{views of the}} planet. <b>Earth</b> <b>is</b> sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the Gaia Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium.
