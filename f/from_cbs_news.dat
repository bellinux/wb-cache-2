40|$|We studied whether {{cannabinoid}} CB 1 receptor {{gene disruption}} (to yield CB 1 −/− mice) affects the electrically evoked tritium overflow from vas deferens and atrial pieces preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline (NA) (‘noradrenaline release') and from cerebral cortex slices preincubated with [3 H]-choline (‘acetylcholine release'). NA release was higher by 37 % in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 −/− mice than in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 +/+ mice. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 inhibited, and the CB 1 receptor inverse agonist/antagonist SR 141716, increased NA release in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 +/+ mice without affecting it in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 −/− mice. Atrial NA release {{did not differ}} between CB 1 +/+ and CB 1 −/− mice nor did WIN 55, 212 - 2 affect NA release in either strain. Cortical acetylcholine (Ach) release did not differ between CB 1 +/+ and CB 1 −/− mice. WIN 55, 212 - 2 inhibited, but SR 141716 did not affect, Ach release in the cortex <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 +/+ mice. Both drugs did not alter Ach release in the cortex <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 −/− mice. Tritium content did not differ between CB 1 +/+ and CB 1 −/− mice in any preparation. In conclusion, the increase in NA release associated with CB 1 receptor deficiency in the vas deferens, which cannot be ascribed to an alteration of tritium content of the preparations, suggests an endogenous tone at the CB 1 receptors of CB 1 +/+ mice in this tissue. Furthermore, the effect of WIN 55, 212 - 2 on NA release in the vas deferens and on cortical Ach release involves CB 1 receptors, whereas the involvement of non-CB 1 –non-CB 2 receptors can be excluded...|$|R

40|$|Highly porous {{cellulose}} beads (CBs) {{of various}} mean sizes were successfully prepared from regenerated cellulose of paper wastes. The drug delivery characteristics of CBs with different mean sizes were investigated using curcumin {{as the model}} drug under controlled conditions. The loading capacity and efficiency of curcumin onto CBs were substantially influenced by factors such as their morphological characteristics, curcumin concentration, and duration of loading. The release kinetic profiles of curcumin <b>from</b> <b>CBs</b> of different mean sizes were investigated in media of pH values resembling digestive juices and intestinal fluids. Release kinetic models were used to simulate and elucidate release kinetics and mechanisms of curcumin <b>from</b> <b>CBs</b> under specific conditions. The loading capacity and efficiency of curcumin onto CBs could be enhanced via the optimization of curcumin solution concentration and the morphological characteristics of CBs, whereas the release kinetic profiles of curcumin <b>from</b> <b>CBs</b> could be modulated by varying the mean diameter of CBs.

40|$|Umbilical {{cord blood}} (CB) {{has been widely}} used instead of bone marrow (BM) and {{peripheral}} blood (PB) for stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, problems of sustained immunodeficiency after CB transplantation remain to be resolved. To elucidate the mechanism of immunodeficiency, we compared the characteristics of B cells differentiated in vitro from CD 34 + cells of CB with those of PB. Purified CD 34 + cells <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> and PB were cultured on murine stroma cell-line MS- 5 with stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for 6 weeks. The B-cell precursors (pre-B cells) that differentiated in this culture system, were analysed as to their immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable region gene repertoire and the expression of B-cell differentiation-related genes. CD 10 + CD 19 + pre-B cells were differentiated from both PB and CB. Although the usages of IgH gene segments in pre-B cells differentiated <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> and PB were similar, the N region was significantly shorter in CB-derived than PB-derived cells. Productive rearrangements were significantly fewer in cells of CB than PB in the third week. Among a number of B-cell differentiation-related genes, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) gene was not expressed in CB-derived cells during the culture. These results indicated that immature features of pre-B cells <b>from</b> <b>CB,</b> such as lack of TdT expression, and a short N region and few productive rearrangements in the IgH gene, might cause the delay in mature B-cell production...|$|R

We analyzed particle emissions from common indoor sources (candles burning (CB), toasting bread (TB), frying sausages (FS)) and lung function in 55 healthy volunteers (mean age 33. 0 years) in a randomized cross-over controlled exposure study. Lung-deposited particle surface area concentration (PSC), size-specific particle number concentration (PNC) up to 10 µm, and particle mass concentration (PMC) of PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were determined during exposure (2 h). FEV 1, FVC and MEF 25 %– 75 % was measured before, 4 h and 24 h after exposure. Wilcoxon-rank sum tests (comparing exposure scenarios) and mixed linear regression using particle concentrations and adjusting for personal characteristics, travel time and transportation means before exposure sessions were performed. While no effect was seen comparing the exposure scenarios and in the unadjusted model, inverse associations were found for PMC <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> and FS in relation to FEV 1 and MEF 25 %– 75 %. with a change in 10 µg/m 3 in PM 2. 5 <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> being associated with a change in FEV 1 of − 19 mL (95 %-confidence interval:− 43; 5) after 4 h.
