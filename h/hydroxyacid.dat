5000|$|Serendipity {{followed}} de Duve {{for another}} major discovery. After confirmation of lysosome, de Duve's team {{was troubled by}} the existence of another enzyme urate oxidase in rat liver cell fraction. He was convinced {{that it did not}} belong to lysosome because it is not an acid hydrolase, typical of lysosomal enzymes, but still had similar distribution as acid phosphatase. In 1960 he further found that other enzymes such as catalase and D-amino acid oxidase were similarly distributed in cell fraction, and they were believed to be mitochondrial enzymes. (W. Bernhard and C. Rouillier had described such extra-mitochodrial organelles as microbodies, and believed that they were precursors to mitochondria.) de Duve discovered that these three enzymes exhibited similar chemical properties and were similar to those of other peroxide-producing oxidases. He was sceptical of referring to them as microbodies because, as he noted, [...] "too little is known of their enzyme complement and of their role in the physiology of the liver cells to substantiate a proposal at the present time". He suggested that these enzymes belonged to the same cell organelle, but different from previously known organelles. But it would take some years before he publicised his hypothesis, as strong evidences were still lacking. In 1955 his team demonstrated similar cell fractions with same biochemical properties from the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis, from which it was indicated that these particles were new cell organelles unrelated to mitochondria. He presented his discovery {{at a meeting of the}} American Society for Cell Biology in 1955, and formally published in 1966 in which he created the name peroxisomes for the organelles as they are involved in peroxidase reactions. In 1968 he achieved the first large-scale preparation of peroxisomes, confirming that l-α <b>hydroxyacid</b> oxidase, d-amino acid oxidase, and catalase were all the unique enzymes of peroxisomes. de Duve and his team went on to show that peroxisomes play important metabolic roles, including the β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids by a pathway different from that in mitochondria, and that they are members of a large family of evolutionarily related organelles present in diverse cells including plants, and protozoa, where they carry out distinct functions and have been given specific names, such as glyoxysomes and glycosomes.|$|E

D-Amino acid oxidase and <b>hydroxyacid</b> oxidase activities were demonstrated in unfixed cryostat sections with the cerium-diaminobenzidine-cobalt-hydrogen peroxide procedure, in which cerium ions capture hydrogen peroxide, the product of both enzymes. In a second step reaction decomposition of cerium perhydroxide gives rise to a diaminobenzidine polymer complexed with cobalt ions. D-Amino acid oxidase and <b>hydroxyacid</b> oxidase activities were found in peroxisomes of liver parenchymal cells, and only D-amino acid oxidase in peroxisomes of proximal tubular cells of kidneys of control humans. The activities of these enzymes were not detectable in livers and kidneys of Zellweger patients.

40|$|SUMMARY Using the rat middle {{cerebral}} artery occlusion model, alterations in the eicosanoid synthetic capacity of brain microvessels following ischemia were studied by radiochromatography. Brain microves-sels of normal rats predominantly produced <b>hydroxyacids</b> with relatively {{small amounts of}} PGD 2 and PGE 2 from exogenous arachidonic acid.

The eicosanoid synthetic capacity of the brain microvessel, especially of hydroxy-acids, was significantly enhanced 24 and 72 hours after the onset of ischemia.

40|$|The {{chemical}} conversion of simvastatin from the lactone (SVL) to the <b>hydroxyacid</b> (SVA) form {{is becoming an}} intriguing issue associated with the pharmacological use of SVL. On this matter, recent findings suggest that SVL complexation with cyclodextrins (CDs) may be a useful strategy to affect its aqueous solubility and chemical stability. In this work, a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method able to selectively identify and quantify SVL and SVA has been set up, validated and applied to follow SVL hydrolysis {{in the presence of}} HPβCD. The combination of stability results with simvastatin/HPβCD stability constants achieved from UV-vis measurements and solubility/dissolution studies allowed to get an insight into SVL/HPβCD, SVA/HPβCD and SVL/SVA equilibria taking place in aqueous solution. Results show that in the presence of HPβCD the aqueous SVL/SVA equilibrium is shifted versus the <b>hydroxyacid</b> form. UV-vis results, showing that the lactone and the open-ring form of simvastatin interact with HPβCD in a similar extent, suggest that hydrolysis occurs also on SVL/HPβCD complex, thus supporting a mode of interaction that does not involve the lactone ring. This hypothesis is strengthened by NMR analysis performed on SVA, HPβCD and their inclusion complex, which indicates that the lactone ring is not included in HPβCD hydrophobic cavity. Finally, results suggest that particular attention must be paid to SVL lactonization in aqueous solution when using CD-based formulations and in demonstrating their effective benefit for a specific therapeutic use...|$|E

An analysis of the crystal structure of mammalian LDHs showed that the amide of the nicotinamide cofactor formed a water-bridged hydrogen bond to S 163. The LDH of Plasmodium falciparum is not inhibited by its substrate and, uniquely, in this enzyme the serine is replaced by a leucine. In the S 163 L mutant of human LDH-M 4 pyruvate inhibition is, indeed, abolished and the enzyme retains high activity.
