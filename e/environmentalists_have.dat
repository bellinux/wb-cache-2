25|$|Hershey is {{introducing}} new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots {{for the upcoming}} Easter season.

50|$|Citing the {{presence}} of tigers in two wild-life sanctuaries, <b>environmentalists</b> <b>had</b> put forth a proposal to declare Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary and Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary as tiger reserves.

25|$|The main {{public concern}} {{regarding}} the ozone hole {{has been the}} effects of increased surface UV radiation on human health. So far, ozone depletion in most locations has been typically a few percent and, as noted above, no direct evidence of health damage is available in most latitudes. If {{the high levels of}} depletion seen in the ozone hole were to be common across the globe, the effects could be substantially more dramatic. As the ozone hole over Antarctica has in some instances grown so large as to affect parts of Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa, <b>environmentalists</b> <b>have</b> been concerned that the increase in surface UV could be significant.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Program's cap {{and trade}} program has been hailed as {{successful}} by the EPA, industry, economists and certain environmental {{groups such as the}} Environmental Defense Fund, while skeptical <b>environmentalists</b> <b>have</b> argued that reduction in emissions occurred due to broad trends unconnected to the program. The EPA has used what is called the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the effect of the Acid Rain Program (ARP). The output from the model says that annual emissions of sulfur dioxide were reduced by 8 million tons (from 17.3 to 9.3), nitrogen oxides by 2.7 million tons (from 7.6 to 5), and mercury by 10 tons (from 52 to 42). However, it is difficult to estimate the emissions which would have occurred without the ARP. For example, the EPA updated its analysis to reflect the effect of low-sulfur coal becoming more economical due to reduced transportation, leading the EPA to reduce its estimate of the impact of ARP by sulfur dioxide emissions by one million tons.|$|E
500|$|For many years, geologists, {{biologists}} and <b>environmentalists</b> <b>have</b> advocated for {{expansion of the}} monument and its transformation into a national park. Part of that goal was reached in 2000 when the monument was expanded 13-fold from [...] to its current size to encompass the entire Great Rift zone and its three lava fields. The entire addition is called the Backcountry Area while the two older parts are called the Developed Area and Wilderness Area. Opposition by cattle interests and hunters to a simple expansion plan led to a compromise of having the addition become a national preserve in 2002 (which allows hunting, not ordinarily permitted in national parks and monuments in the U.S.). Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve is co-managed by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, both under the Department of the Interior. In March 2017, the Idaho Senate {{voted in favor of}} petitioning Congress to designate Craters of the Moon a national park.|$|E

500|$|<b>Environmentalists</b> <b>have</b> criticised the Delhi {{government}} {{for not doing}} enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues. Most of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it; however, , awareness, particularly among the foreign diplomatic community and high-income Indians, was noticeably increasing. Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution – Delhi has the third highest quantity of trees among Indian cities and the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. In 1996, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its [...] "bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives". The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.|$|E

2500|$|Dune {{has been}} called the [...] "first {{planetary}} ecology novel on a grand scale". After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. Dune responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life forms adapted to live with limited water. Dune was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as A Door into Ocean (1986) and Red Mars (1992). <b>Environmentalists</b> <b>have</b> pointed out that Dunes popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international Earth Day.|$|E
