5|$|A new, ADA-compliant station named Arthur Kill, {{near the}} {{southern}} terminus {{of the present}} line, opened on January 21, 2017 after numerous delays. The station is sited between, and replaced the Atlantic and Nassau stations, which were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> condition of all the stations on the line. The Arthur Kill station is able to platform a four-car train. The MTA has provided parking for 150 automobiles across the street adjacent to the station. Ground was broken for the $15.3 million station on October 18, 2013. The constructor for the project, John P. Picone, Inc., was awarded the contract on July 31, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste is inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|Destruction was {{heaviest}} in Belize and totaled $250million (2001USD). Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance {{from the government and}} the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E

5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> {{parts of the country}} where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues to be pursued to today despite several changes of governments.|$|E

25|$|According to data {{collected}} by the Pan-American Health Organization based on multi-purpose household surveys, the share of water expenditures in household expenditures in urban areas of Paraguay was the lowest among 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in the late 1990s. The share was on average 1.4% and 1.7% for urban households <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> income decile, showing an unusually low difference between the average and poor households. These shares are actually the same or even higher in rural areas, reflecting the unusual high levels of cost recovery in rural areas in Paraguay. Rural households spend on average 1.2% on water, and households <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> decile in rural areas spend 2.3% on water. Therefore, despite high levels of cost recovery, tariffs apparently remain affordable.|$|E

40|$|W. Arthur Lewis {{argued that}} a new {{international}} economic order emerged between 1870 and 1913, and that global terms of trade forces produced rising primary product specialization and de-industrialization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery. More recently, modern economists argue that volatility reduces growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery. This paper assess these de-industrialization and volatility forces between 1782 and 1913 during the Great Divergence. First, it argues that the new economic order had been firmly established by 1870, and that the transition took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> century before, not after. Second, based on econometric evidence from 1870 - 1939, we know that while a terms of trade improvement raised long run growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rich core, it {{did not do so}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery. Given that the secular terms of trade boom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery was much bigger over the century before 1870 than after, it seems plausible to infer that it might help explain the great 19 th century divergence between core and periphery. Third, the boom and its de-industrialization impact was only part of the story; growth-reducing terms of trade volatility was the other. Between 1820 and 1870, terms of trade volatility was much greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery than <b>the</b> core. It was still very big after 1870, certainly far bigger than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core. Based on econometric evidence from 1870 - 2000, we know that terms of trade volatility lowers long run growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery, and that the negative impact is big. Given that terms of trade volatility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> periphery was even bigger during the century before 1870, it seems plausible to infer that it also helps explain the great 19 th century divergence between core and periphery. ...|$|R

25|$|White flight {{has been}} {{observed}} in low socioeconomic decile schools in New Zealand. Data from the Ministry of Education found that 60,000 New Zealand European students attended low-decile schools (situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> areas) in 2000, and had fallen to half that number in 2010. The same data also found that high-decile schools (which are in the wealthiest areas) had a corresponding increase in New Zealand European students. The Ministry claimed demographic changes were behind the shifts, but teacher and principal associations have attributed white flight to racial and class stigmas of low-decile schools, which commonly have majority Maori and Pacific Islander rolls.|$|E

25|$|Disparate, gendered {{access to}} {{resources}} appears to be strongly linked to socioeconomic status. Specifically, poorer families are sometimes forced to ration food, with daughters typically receiving less priority than sons (Klasen and Wink 2003). However, Klasen’s 2001 study revealed that this practice is less common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> families, but rises dramatically in the slightly less poor families. Klasen and Wink’s 2003 study suggests that this is “related to greater female economic independence and fewer cultural strictures among the poorest sections of the population.” In other words, the poorest families are typically less bound by cultural expectations and norms, and women {{tend to have more}} freedom to become family breadwinners out of necessity.|$|E
