Powder processing (PM) resulted in macrocrack-free material containing no or only few microcracks. The PM materials contained quasi-equilibrium pores and large concentrations of oxygen. Average room temperature flexure strengths of 270 MPa were obtained. At 1, 200 C in air, flexure strengths {{as high as}} 600 MPa were observed. These high values are attributed to crack healing and incipient plasticity. Ingot metallurgy (<b>IM)</b> <b>materials</b> contained much less oxygen than their PM counterparts.

40|$|Abstract. Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{is potentially}} {{capable of producing}} homogeneous titanium alloys at relative low cost compared to ingot metallurgy (IM). There are many established PM methods for consolidating metal powders to near net shapes {{with a high degree}} of freedom in alloy composition and resulting microstructural characteristics. The mechanical properties of titanium and its alloys processed using a powder metallurgical route have been studied in great detail; one major concern is that ductility and toughness of materials produced by a PM route are often lower than those of corresponding <b>IM</b> <b>materials.</b> The aim of this paper is to review the fracture toughness of both PM and IM titanium alloys. The effects of critical factors such as interstitial impurities, microstructural features and heat treatment on fracture toughness are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to analyze the mechanical properties and thermal stability for rapidly solidified and extruded 5083 aluminum alloy (RS). Compression tests were performed in order to estimate flow stress and strain rate sensitivity relation for 5083 alloy in the temperature range of 20 ◦C to 450 ◦C. For the comparison purposes, conventionally cast and extruded industrial material (IM) was studied as well. Deformation tests performed at room temperature conditions show that rapidly solidified material exhibits about 40 % higher yield stress (YS= 320 MPa) than conventionally cast material (YS= 180 MPa), while the deformation at 450 ◦C results in significant decrease of flow stress parameters for RS material (YS= 20 MPa) in comparison to <b>IM</b> <b>material</b> (YS= 40 MPa). Strain rate sensitivity parameter determined for high temperature conditions indicates superplasticity behavior of RS material. Structural observations show that under conditions of high-temperature deformation there are no operating recrystallization mechanisms. In general, grain size below 1 µm and size of reinforcing phases below 50 nm is preserved within the used deformation temperature range...|$|E
40|$|Concern {{about eating}} biotechnologically {{produced}} foodstuffs is embedded within the complex relationship between food, science, politics, and everyday eating practices. In this paper I consider how this concern is expressed less at the reflexive level of opinions and attitudes and {{more at the}} nonreflexive level of eating practices. Therefore, I draw upon literatures that talk of a practical everyday aesthetic and literatures that assert {{the significance of the}} material to geographical work, and go on to argue for the significance of a material connective aesthetic within eating practices. This argument is developed empirically and theoretically by considering to what extent consumers can discuss the edibility of different types of carrots in terms of superficial material qualities, integral material qualities, and the immaterial. Crucially, the process of edibility formation is thus understood as relationally embedded in the material environment. This provokes a realisation for an ethics and a politics of (<b>im)</b> <b>material</b> connectivities. This work contributes to geographical work in which an embodied affective ethic is employed, by arguing that the transversal qualities of the material are as significant as the transversal qualities of ‘affect’. It is relevant to those studying consumption, biogeographies, and nonreflexive practices. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the current excesses of {{plutonium}} (both weapon grade and reactor grade) and other transuranium elements, a concept of inert matrix fuel (IMF) has been proposed for an uranium free transmutation of fissile actinides which excludes continuous uranium-plutonium conversion in thermal reactors and advanced systems. Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a promising candidate for inert matrix (<b>IM)</b> <b>materials</b> due to its high melting point (2827 C), high thermal conductivity (13 W/K {center_dot} m at 1000 C), good neutronic properties, and irradiation stability However, MgO reacts with water and hydrates easily, which prevents it from being used in light water reactors (LWRs) as an IM. To improve the hydration resistance of MgO-based inert matrix materials, Medvedev and coworkers have recently investigated the introduction of a secondary phase that acts as a hydration barrier. An MgO-ZrO{sub 2 } composite was specifically studied and the results showed that the composite exhibited improved hydration resistance than pure MgO. However, ZrO{sub 2 } is insoluble in most acids except HF, which is undesirable for fuel reprocessing. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of ZrO{sub 2 } is low and typically less than 3 W {center_dot} m{sup - 1 } {center_dot} K{sup - 1 } at 1000 C. In search for an alternative composite strategy, Nd{sub 2 }Zr{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, an oxide compound with pyrochlore structure, has been proposed recently as a corrosion resistant phase, and MgO-Nd{sub 2 }Zr{sub 2 }O{sub 7 } composites have been investigated as potential <b>IM</b> <b>materials.</b> An adequate thermal conductivity of 6 W {center_dot} m{sup -} 1 {center_dot} K{sup - 1 } at 1000 C for the MgO-Nd{sub 2 }Zr{sub 2 }O{sub 7 } composite with 90 vol% MgO was recently calculated and reported. Other simulations proposed that the MgO-pyrochlore composites could exhibit higher radiation stability than previously reported. Final optimization of the composite microstructure was performed on the 70 vol% MgO-Nd{sub 2 }Zr{sub 2 }O{sub 7 } composite that burnup calculations had shown to have the closest profile to that of MOX fuel. Theoretical calculations also indicated that a homogeneous 70 vol% MgO composite could achieve the desired microstructure that would result in satisfying the dual requirements of good thermal properties...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that some discontinuously {{reinforced}} metal matrix composites, MMCs, with precipitation hardenable matrices, like 6061 Al with SiC whiskers or particles, show faster aging behavior than the unreinforced alloys.

40|$|Mimetic fandom is a {{surprisingly}} understudied mode of (culturally masculinized) fan {{activity in which}} fans research and craft replica props. Mimetic fandom {{can be considered as}} (in) authentic and (<b>im)</b> <b>material,</b> combining noncommercial status with grassroots marketing or brand reinforcement as well as fusing an emphasis on material artifacts with Web 2. 0 collective intelligence. Simply analyzing mimetic fandom as part of fannish material culture fails to adequately assess the nonmaterial aspects of this collaborative creativity. Two fan cultures are taken as case studies: Dalek building groups and Daft Punk helmet constructors. These diverse cases indicate that mimetic fandom has a presence and significance that moves across media fandoms and is not restricted to the science fiction, fantasy, and horror followings with which it is most often associated. Mimetic fandom may be theorized as an oscillatory activity that confuses binaries and constructions of (academic/fan) authenticity. This fan practice desires and pursues a kind of ontological bridging or unity—from text to reality—that is either absent or less dominant in many other fan activities such as cosplay, screen-used prop collecting, and geographical pilgrimage. Fan studies may benefit from reassessing the place of mimesis, especially in order to theorize fan practices that are less clearly transformative in character...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{continues}} the discussion we had opened {{with the paper}} “Etherospermia, the sky seeding art and science project”, presented during last year’s IAC in Beijing. Here the invented word Skypoietic is constructed using poietic (from Greek: ποιητικός "creative") meaning productive or formative. In Plato’s Symposium Diotima presents how mortals strive for immortality in relation to poiesis. In all creating and bringing forth upon the beautiful {{there is a kind}} of making/creating or poiesis. In this genesis there is a movement beyond the temporal cycle of birth and decay.

40|$|Critically revisiting the ‘equality versus difference’ dualism that {{is inscribed}} in the feminist canon of the last decades is an {{important}} task for feminist ethico-political discussions today. The theoretico-political tension between claims of equality and difference still troubles feminist discussions and thus {{needs to be addressed}} by contemporary research. Yet, moving beyond the persisting antagonism cannot be done by either moving outside the problematic relation or by choosing one term over the other. It is, as Joan W. Scott noted, impossible to choose between equality and difference, so that other ways of tackling the problem are needed. This article suggests a new line of flight for feminist politics in respect to this founding paradox from a feminist new materialist/posthuman(ist) perspective. Via an affirmative reading of Irigaray's cosmopolitical concern of Sharing the World (2008) and a critical investigation into the structuring ‘anthropological limit’ (Derrida) of her sexual difference thinking, the author pushes the dualistic framework of equality versus difference towards a thought of ‘nonmimetic sharing’ and ‘staying with the trouble’. In her argument, she turns to the differential worldings of Grosz's ‘differing’, Barad's ‘quantum’ and Haraway's ‘terran’ in order to open up ethico-political alternatives to engage difference(s) differently. The article ultimately argues that by affirming all multifaceted (<b>im)</b> <b>material</b> worlding entanglements, significant new insights can be gained for both theorizing differentiality as ethico-onto-epistemological ‘becoming-with’ and for practising this world of/as difference(s) in a more ‘response-able’ manner...|$|E

These projects were developed through an experimental practice of &# 039;atmospheric-making,&# 039; which involves reciprocal capacities of affecting and being affected by atmospheres.

40|$|In diagramming the recent, global {{proliferation}} in quotidian cartographic {{technologies and}} practices, this thesis {{is concerned with}} the re-imagining of durable geographic motifs and refrains; those of maps and mappings. Conceptually, the thesis works to explore and interrogate the underplayed non-representational registers of cartography. Specifically, this entails unsettling the assumed ontological security of maps as representational artefacts, at the same time accentuating their affective and virtual vectors through an attentiveness to their spatial emergence and performance. In doing so, maps are rendered here not as mimetic, static grids of existence, but as intensive performances, productive of an unqualified geographic and political potential; that is to say, spaces of the virtual. Empirically, these conceptual concerns are worked through a series of fieldwork traces that animate and narrate a number of quite distinct yet resonant cartographic performances; namely geographic encounters with a counter-cartography group in North Carolina; a digital, open-source mapping organisation in both the UK and Peru and finally with two examples of an institutional cartography: Google and Ordnance Survey. Through these mappings, these fieldwork traces, what the thesis works towards is a micropolitical diagramming of contemporary cartographic practices, a diagramming that complicates deliberately the representational certitude of maps, but moreover, one that affirms the (<b>im)</b> <b>material,</b> anticipatory and minor geopolitics of mapping; a mapping of and for the everyday; a mapping of and for the vernacular.

40|$|Purpose: Experiments on rapidly {{solidified}} (RS) and industrially manufactured (IM) Al- 6 Mn- 3 Mg alloy {{were performed}} to test the effect of RS on the structure and mechanical properties of the material. Design/methodology/approach: Annealing of as-extruded RS and IM samples was performed at 500 °C {{in order to test}} the stability of structural components and related hardness of the materials. Mechanical properties of as-extruded RS and IM materials as well as the samples preliminarily annealed at 500 °C / 6 h were tested by compression at 20 °C- 500 °C. Structural investigations were performed using analytical transmission electron microscopy techniques. Findings: The flow stress for RS-samples was found to be about 240 MPa higher at 293 K than that for <b>IM</b> <b>material.</b> However, the difference between the flow stress values observed for RS and IM samples was remarkably reduced at higher deformation temperatures. Annealing at 500 °C was found to result in reduction of the RS-material hardness due to the recovery process and slightly marked coarsening of Al 6 Mn particles. The particles observed in both as extruded and RS-samples annealed 500 °C / 7 days were at least 10 -times smaller than that for the industrial material. Practical implications: Due to refined structure and the negligible particle coarsening at high annealing temperatures, the products made from RS Al- 6 Mn- 3 Mg alloy can be used at high service temperature applications. Originality/value: Hardening of non-heat-treatable Al- 6 Mn- 3 Mg alloy is possible due to effective refining of Al 6 Mn particles using the rapid solidification and adequate consolidation procedure of RS-powders. The highest flow stress was observed for RS samples tested at room temperature. However, increasing deformation temperature was found to result in reduced difference between the flow stress values received for RS and IM materials...|$|E

Die Ptychographie bietet die Möglichkeit, neben der generierten Brechungsindexänderung im photorefraktiven Material auch die für die Generation genutzte Intensitätsverteilung des Laserstrahls zu bestimmen. Es wird sowohl die Abhängigkeit der Brechungsindexänderung von der Zeit der Generation als auch die Abhängigkeit von der Polarisation des Lasers gemessen. Durch den Vergleich der gewonnenen Werte mit einer numerischen Simulation des photorefraktiven Effekts werden mikroskopische Parameter der lichtinduzierten Ladungswanderung ermittelt. Zudem wird aus der polarisationsabhängigen ptychographischen Messung das Raumladungsfeld und die korrespondierende Ladungsdichte <b>im</b> <b>Material</b> berechnet.

In {{the present}} thesis the novel {{microscopy}} technique of ptychography {{is applied to}} the investigation of photorefractive materials.

In one part of the experiment the time dependence of the refractive index change versus the generation time is investigated, in {{the other part of the}} experiment the dependence of the refractive index change to the polarisation of the laser beam is examined. Microscopic parameters of the photorefractive charge migration are determined with the utilisation of a numerical simulation of the photorefractive effect and its comparison with the measurement.

Few studies {{evaluated the}} association of V 617 F Jak- 2 mutation with the risk of thrombosis in patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the studies that assessed the risk of thrombosis associated with V 617 F Jak- 2 in patients with ET or <b>IM.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and reference lists of retrieved articles. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and pooled. Results: We included 21 studies involving patients with essential thrombocythaemia and 6 studies patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis. In essential thrombocythaemia patients, V 617 F Jak- 2 was associated with a significant increased risk of thrombosis (OR 1. 92, 95 % CI 1. 45 - 2. 53), both of venous (OR 2. 49, 95 % CI 1. 71 - 3. 61) and arterial (OR 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 2. 43) vessels. In idiopathic myelofibrosis patients, the risk of thrombosis associated with V 617 F Jak- 2 tended to be increased (OR 1. 76, 95 % CI 0. 91 - 3. 41).

40|$|Background: Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) is {{the main}} {{etiology}} of infectious mononucleosis (IM) syndrome that is characterized by fever, sore throat, and lymph adenopathy. Since, this virus could {{be associated with a}} number of malignancies, some hematologic disorders, and chronic fatigue syndrome, identification of IM is very important. The aim of study was to evaluate the specificity, as well as sensitivity of the two different methods that is, serology versus molecular diagnosis that are currently used for diagnosis of <b>IM.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: In this study, during a period of 3. 5 years, 100 suspected patients as case group and 100 healthy individuals as a control group were studied. Fifty samples in each group were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and all the samples including case group and control group were carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: In 76 % of patients and in 20 % of the healthy individuals, samples were detected EBV DNA by PCR. On the other hand, 68. 5 % of the samples belong to the case group and 46 % in the control group showed positivity by ELISA. Conclusion: By comparing the two methods, since PCR is very expensive and time consuming, and the percentages of difference ranges are narrow, ELISA could be applied as a first, easiest, and preliminary diagnostic test for IM. In addition, this test could be applied in various phases of the disease with a higher sensitivity comparing to PCR. Although PCR is routinely used for diagnosis of various infectious agents, it is considered as an expensive test and merely could be used after 1 - 2 weeks from the onset of the illness...|$|R
40|$|In the 1980 s archaeologists {{embraced the}} rapidly {{expanding}} field of computer modelling and visualisation {{as a vehicle}} for data exploration. Against this backdrop 'virtual archaeology' was conceived. The term was originally intended to describe a multidimensional approach to the modelling of the (<b>im)</b> <b>material</b> structures and processes of field archaeology. It described how technology could be harnessed in order to achieve new ways of documenting, interpreting and annotating primary archaeological discoveries and processes. Despite their initial promise, these digital technologies failed to have the impact upon archaeological fieldwork that might have been expected. Even with the prevalence of digital devices on all archaeological excavations, the documentation, interpretation and subsequent narration of archaeological processes have retained their analogue character. While the archaeological record is now primarily digital, its sections, plans, drawings and photographs are facsimiles of the analogue technologies that preceded them. This retention of analogue conventions is increasingly {{out of step with the}} general prevalence and diversity of digital technologies as mediators of professional and private life. It is also challenged by 21 st-century advances towards technologies that allow for complex engagements with and representations of physical matter and facilitate the interplay between digital and material worlds.

We go on to suggest that digital archaeology, conceived as a form of practice rather than as a toolset, represents a locus for theory generation and critical thinking. Failure to recognise the skills and ideas that have emerged in response to digital technologies has led to an under-appreciation of the contribution that digital forms of practice have made to our understanding of archaeological practice and knowledge creation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the lung {{surfactant}} system after exposure to nitrogen dioxide. For this purpose rats were exposed to nitrogen dioxide atmospheres of 0. 8, 5 and 10 ppm. After exposure a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and the structure and function of the surfactant components analysed. Additionally the components were analysed in the model of the isolated lung and the isolated type II pneumocytes. All components of the surfactant system were increased in their amount depending on concentration and duration of the exposure. On the level of the isolated type II pneumocytes an increased rate of phospholipid synthesis was found after NO_ 2 -inhalation whereas the secretion activity was decreased. Because the number of type II cells were increased in NO_ 2 -exposed lungs the increased amount of surfactant components are due to the elevated number of these cells. Exposure in vivo and in vitro of the surfactant-phospholipids and the surfactant-protein A (SP-A) showed for both components an impaired function. Especially for the SP-A, a modulator of the surfactant system, its lipid-protein aggregation, its secretion inhibition activity and its mannose-binding ability were reduced. Thus the study shows the impairment of the surfactant system after inhalation of nitrogen dioxide. (orig.) Ziel der durchgefuehrten Untersuchungen war die Analytik des Surfactant-Systems der Lunge nach Exposition mit Stickstoffdioxid. Dazu wurden Ratten NO_ 2 -Atmosphaeren von 0. 8, 5 und 10 ppm ausgesetzt und in der Folge die <b>im</b> <b>Material</b> der bronchoalveolaeren Lavage enthaltenen Surfactant-Komponenten strukturell und funktionell untersucht. Ergaenzend wurde das Modell der isolierten Lunge wie das der isolierten Pneumocyten II betrachtet. NO_ 2 bewirkte fuer alle Komponenten des Surfactant-Systems eine Steigerung der Menge in Abhaengigkeit von der Dauer und der Konzentration der Noxe. Auf der Ebene der isolierten Pneumocyten bewirkte das NO_ 2 eine gesteigerte Syntheserate der Phospholipide, wogegen der Sektetionsprozess inhibiert war. Da nach NO_ 2 -Exposition die Zahl der Typ II Zellen in der Lunge extrem erhoeht ist, wird der vermehrte Anteil der Surfactant-Komponenten durch die erhoehte Anzahl der Typ II Zellen bewirkt. In vivo- und in vitro-Expositionen der Phospholipid-Komponente und des Surfactant-Proteins A (SP-A) zeigten, dass beide Komponenten funktionell eingeschraenkt sind. Speziell fuer das SP-A, das funktionell Steuerungsaufgaben im Surfactant-System besitzt, waren die Ausbildung von Protein-Lipid-Aggregaten (Oberflaechenaktivitaet), die Inhibierung der Sekretion von Surfactant aus isolierten Pneumocyten und die Mannose-Bindungsfaehigkeit (Makrophagen-Stimulation) stark eingeschraenkt. Somit konnte der schaedigende Einfluss von Stickstoffdioxid auf das Surfactant-System der Lunge nachgewiesen werden. (orig.)

A {{series of experiments}} were performed to determine the mechanism of failure in compressively loaded laminated plates {{in the presence of}} stress gradients generated by a circular cutout. Real time holographic interferometry and in-situ photomicrography of the hole surface, were used to observe the progression of failure. The test specimens are multi-layered composite flat plates, which are loaded in compression. The plates are made of two material systems, T 300 /BP 907 and IM 7 / 8551 - 7. Two different lay-ups of T 300 /BP 907 and four different lay-ups of IM 7 / 8551 - 7 are investigated. The load on the specimen is slowly increased and a series of interferograms are produced during the load cycle. These interferograms are video-recorded. The results obtained from the interferograms and photo-micrographs are substantiated by sectioning studies and ultrasonic C-scanning of some specimens which are unloaded prior to catastrophic failure, but beyond failure initiation. This is made possible by the servo-controlled loading mechanism that regulates the load application and offers the flexibility of unloading a specimen at any given instance in the loadtime history. An underlying objective of the present investigation is the identification of the physics of the failure initiation process. This required testing specimens with different stacking sequences, for a fixed hole diameter, so that consistent trends in the failure process could be identified. It is revealed that the failure is initiated as a localized instability in the 0 ? plies at the hole surface, approximately at right angles to the loading direction. This instability emanating at the hole edge and propagating into the interior of the specimen within the 0 ? plies is found to be fiber microbuckling. The microbuckling is found to occur at a local strain level of [ [...] . ] 8600 [mu]strain at the hole edge for the <b>IM</b> <b>material</b> system. This initial failure renders a narrow zone of fibers within the 0 ? plies to loose structural integrity. Subsequent to the 0 ?-ply failure, extensive delamination cracking is observed with increasing load. The through thickness location of these delaminations is found to depend on the position of the 0 ? plies. The delaminated portions spread to the undamaged areas of the laminate by a combination of delamination buckling and growth, the buckling further enhancing the growth. When the delaminated area reaches a critical size, about 75 - 100 % of the hole radius in extent, an accelerated growth rate of the delaminated portions is observed. The culmination of this last event is the complete loss of flexural stiffness of each of the delaminated portions leading to catastrophic failure of the plate. The levels of applied load and the rate at which these events occur depend on the plate stacking sequence. A simple mechanical model is presented for the microbuckling problem. This model addresses the buckling instability of a semi-infinte layered half-plane alternatingly stacked with fibers and matrix, loaded parallel {{to the surface of the}} half-plane. The fibers are modelled using Bernoulli-Navier beam theory, and the matrix is assumed to be a linearly elastic foundation. The predicted buckling strains are found to overestimate the experimental result. However, the dependence of the buckling strain on parameters such as the fiber volume fraction, ratio of Youngs moduli of the constituents and Poisson's ratio of the matrix are obtained from the analysis. It is seen that a high fiber volume fraction, increased matrix stiffness, and perfect bonding between fiber and matrix are desirable properties for increasing the compressive strength...|$|E
40|$|In diesem Beitrag wird eine methodologische Position für die FOUCAULTsche Diskursanalyse vorgestellt und eine darauf aufbauende Schrittfolge für eine empirische Diskursanalyse skizziert. Anhand eines Anwendungsbeispiels wird diese Methodologie veranschaulicht. Es wird hervorgehoben, dass Diskursanalysen – um vollständige Analysen zu sein – soweit vorangetrieben werden müssen, dass sie (1) den Systemcharakter des Regelsystems in einer diskursiven Formation erfassen und (2) daran anschliessend die Tiefenstruktur der diskursiven Formation freilegen. Zur Theoriebasis der FOUCAULTschen Diskursanalyse zählt der französische Kontext des Strukturalismus/Poststrukturalismus. Es wird argumentiert, dass der Poststrukturalismus nicht als Überwindung des Strukturalismus, sondern als eine kritische Öffnung des Strukturalismus zu verstehen ist. Damit können Strukturen in Diskursen auf eine diskursive Praxis bezogen werden und das Strukturkonzept kann (z. B. zur Interdiskursivität und zu Jacques DERRIDAs Strukturalitätsbegriff hin) geöffnet werden. Die strukturalistische Perspektive wird damit fortgesetzt und radikalisiert, aber nicht aufgegeben. Die FOUCAULTschen Theoreme werden hier verknüpft mit den Arbeiten von Michel PÊCHEUX und (insbesondere für die empirische Kultur- und Wissenssoziologie) den Arbeiten von Pierre BOURDIEU. Die praktische Diskursanalyse wird als theoriefundierte und <b>im</b> <b>Material</b> reflexiv vorgehende Kopplung von Dekonstruktion/Rekonstruktion vorgestellt. Sie ist insofern eine rekonstruktive {{qualitative}} Methodologie. Am Ende setzt sich der Beitrag kritisch mit solchen Diskursanalysen auseinander, die weder den Systemcharakter der diskursiven Praxis systematisch erfassen noch die diskursive Tiefenstruktur (Episteme bzw. Sozio-Episteme) erfassen wollen. Diese bleiben entweder Diskurskommentierungen oder einfach phänomenologisch und damit jeweils vorstrukturalistisch. A methodological {{position for}} a FOUCAULTian discourse analysis is presented. A sequence of analytical steps is introduced and an illustrating example is offered. It is emphasized that discourse analysis has to discover the system-level of discursive rules and the deeper structure of the discursive formation. Otherwise the analysis will be unfinished. Michel FOUCAULTs work is theoretically grounded in French structuralism and (the so called) post-structuralism. In this paper, post-structuralism is not conceived {{as a means for}} overcoming of structuralism, but as a way of critically continuing the structural perspective. In this way, discursive structures can be related to discursive practices and the concept of structure can be disclosed (e. g. to inter-discourse or DERRIDAs concept of structurality). In this way, the structural methodology is continued and radicalized, but not given up. In this paper, FOUCAULTs theory is combined with the works of Michel PÊCHEUX and (especially for the sociology of knowledge and the sociology of culture) Pierre BOURDIEU. The practice of discourse analysis is theoretically grounded. This practice can be conceived as a reflexive coupling of deconstruction and reconstruction in the material to be analyzed. This methodology therefore can be characterized as a reconstructive qualitative methodology. At the end of the article, forms of discourse analysis are criticized that do not intend to recover the system level of discursive rules and that do not intend to discover the deeper structure of the discursive formation (i. e. episteme, socio-episteme). These forms merely are commentaries of discourses (not their analyses), they remain phenomenological and are therefore: pre-structuralist. Se presenta una posición metodológica para un análisis del discurso foucaultiano. Se introducen una sucesión de pasos analíticos y se ofrece un ejemplo ilustrativo. Se enfatiza que el análisis del discurso tiene que descubrir el sistema-nivel de las reglas discursivas y la estructura más profunda de la formación discursiva. De otra forma el análisis será incompleto. El trabajo de Michel FOUCAULT se fundamenta teóricamente en el estructuralismo y en el así llamado post-estructuralismo francés. En este artículo, el post-estructuralismo no se concibe como un medio para superar de estructuralismo, sino como una manera de continuar críticamente la perspectiva estructural. De esta manera, las estructuras discursivas pueden relacionarse a la práctica discursiva y puede descubrirse el concepto de estructura (por ejemplo, el inter-discurso o el concepto de estructuralidad de DERRIDA). De este modo, la metodología estructural es continuada y radicalizada, pero no abandonada. En este artículo, la teoría de FOUCAULT se combina con los trabajos de Michel PÊCHEUX y (sobre todo para la sociología de conocimiento y la sociología de cultura) Pierre BOURDIEU. La práctica del análisis del discurso se fundamenta teóricamente. Esta práctica puede concebirse como un acoplamiento reflexivo de deconstrucción y reconstrucción en el material que se analiza. Esta metodología puede caracterizarse, por consiguiente, como la metodología cualitativa reconstructiva. Al final del artículo, se critican las formas de análisis del discurso que no recuperan el nivel de sistema de las reglas discursivas y no descubren la estructura más profunda de la formación discursiva (por ejemplo, la episteme, socio-episteme). Estas formas son meros comentarios de discursos (no su análisis) y siguen siendo fenomenológicos; por consiguiente, son pre-estructuralistas...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} how, as {{a writer}} and curator, to deal with imagination that is present in some contemporary art, without compromising the quality of an artistic study, but by trying to view it from the imagined (or imagining) angle, since time, space, form and meaning are all created on the basis of that notion. What is often interpreted as 'mental' or 'cognitive reflection' or 'speculation' can equally be referred to as 'imagination' that deals with the artistic investigation of (un) realities at different levels. Even though 'imagination' is not medium-specific, it is, apparently, (still) easier to achieve in constellation art than in architecture or a painting. Imagination in image is not a representation of a daydream or the illustration of a fantasy, nor does it inject life into an object. We do well not to view it in a mimetic manner, because the very transformation to a (re) presentation, a metaphor, a theme, format or symbol could well obliterate it. Given that imagination is something that is realized at image level, it can solely act as a suggestive proposal in a representation, because then (to date at least) the artistic difference with an artistic study of (un) realities can be experienced as a shift and can, possibly, be conceived as such after a period of time. This does not mean, though, that an artistic study with a surplus of imagination could not be integrated architecturally, for example, but that the invitation by an in-stitution is crucial, so that the artist can pitch his/her artistic research in an actual 'imaginative ' manner. Even if that temporary aspect has already been addressed at the drawing board, it requires adjusting even when it is deemed finished'. While imagination can be observed by a viewer or listener, it can equally be projected onto something which it is not. However, this should not be equated with apparent formalism' that can behave in a humorous way, even when quasi sterile, not least because imagination is still often consigned to the bin, or else deemed a source of inspiration, both as a canon and a margin. Imagination is neither moralistic, nor spiritual for that matter. Imagination structures 'some -things ' and 'no -things ' in a staggered manner, thus exposing an innovative dimension observable within, and from, an artistic study. Imagination creates imaginative space and time that enter into dialogue with the location and an era, and with its own artistic research of specific, or less specific, (un) realities. An artistic study and a suggestive proposal are entwined {{at the level of the}} image, but can be observed as an imagining image. Throughout my research of the work of artists such as Bracha L. Ettinger, Peter Buggenhout, Joëlle Tuerlinckx, Adriaan Verwee, Paul Hendrikse, Julia Spinola and others, throughout my own curatorial research, including the exhibitions Gorge (l) (KMSKA, 2006) and Time Space Poker Face (Be-Part, 2013) and throughout my practice {{as a writer}}, I have examined how artistic research and imagination function in contemporary art. Especially as a false twin that is shifted to the level of the image and that, via a (closed) constellation, finds access through a method similar to, or one that has leanings towards, écriture automatique in an opening or innovative way. In other words, what is normally split or made hybrid is done within the constellation itself without the need for repairs. In simplified terms, while artistic research is organised, imagination is triggered and allowed a time and place. This borderlinking-in-differentiation, a concept borrowed from Bracha L. Ettinger, and which in this context, is tested and deployed in another environment and time, I call bi-modernist, or bi-sexual at another level. I argue, inter alia, that there has apparently never been modernism, except in specific art forms, which complicates the relationship with postmodernism or re-modernism. In other words, a (life-) style, an idea, an architectural structure or an acceleration of media/technology is often closer to 'nature' than to 'modernism'. My research shows that the reason for this is because the step of bi-modernism has been skipped, something which, incidentally, cannot be included in a manifesto or scientific report, unless suggestively, because mankind apparently, finds it difficult, if not impossible, to suppress the propensity to follow, or resist, this (verbatim), but inversion is not subversion. Imagination and interaction with imagination stir the sadomasochistic reflex in/of man and his/her way of dealing with subjects, objects and things, thus allowing for another game, namely that of bi-modernism. From the moment imagination becomes sublime, there is (mental) carnage; from the moment it becomes beautiful or ugly, something has not been dealt with. It may well be that, for some, imagination is experienced as being beautiful or ugly, or sublime or threatening, but a perception is not the same as the artwork. Since this is very difficult to study, the group exhibitions I prepare as a curator, or the texts I write in dialogue with art should be seen, or read, in two ways: both as a way of addressing artistic imagination in contemporary art, which in itself handles different (un) realities at different levels, and as a way of handling certain worlds that hardly can, or want to, incorporate, or come to grips with, this imagination, as a result of which imagination, as a way of dealing with (un) realities, is sometimes relegated to the role/lack of role of 'Messiah' either in the past, or the future. The issue therefore seems to be one related to imagination, namely how to escape aggression in the face of the imagined (imagining) image, however tangible or intangible that image may be, and that is where imagination comes in again. Imagination can, thus, also be seen as a survival strategy that can indeed be press-ganged, or even eliminated, by a culture, with all the consequences that this entails if that is done en masse. 'Imagination' can sometimes be relegated to a lack of role, both in the periphery and mainstream, similar to minority groups, for example, who are encouraged to develop an identity, or are fashioned as having a clear identity, in which case imagination is installed more as a buffer with a view to being used as a source of inspiration, scout (of an ostensibly 'dangerous' area) or dustbin. This does not mean that it always affects whether an artist is included in a canon or not - it may do, but not necessarily so  but it does mean that the situation on the periphery, or in the centre, is fairly similar to this imagining dimension of their (<b>im)</b> <b>material</b> work: what is established as 'normality', what can usually be interpreted as a reconstruction of a real or phantasmic 'home'  and this right across the socio-economic divide  homelessness is always projected outdoors, even if that home is frequently sought out or is, in fact, faced with that very problem. I believe that this cannot, therefore, be solved by a certain social class (elitist or anti-elitist). It appears that a parallel imagined (or imagining) world which is never closed off from dealing with (un) realities, necessary, however useless art and interaction with it may seem. Of course, there is no such thing as a 'perfectly imagined (imagining) ' artwork, but it is also about an awareness of the pressure acting on it, something which the work itself usually indicates, either directly or indirectly. Imagination appears to structure artistic research in such a way as to ensure that its replacement, representations or metaphors, are at some point rendered unusable in terms of renewal and preservation, as a result of which a bi-modernism is always near at hand. Thanks to the introduction of bi-modernism as staggered imagination of image, which, except for (some) contemporary art forms and a specific interaction with it, is conceived almost exclusively as a phantasmic, complex or mythical portrayal of man and interaction with objects/things at the moment, it is clear that meaningless art, the imagined (imagining) image, does have a function: it creates investigative, experimental and imaginative artistic space and time and introduces man to a bi-modernism. This study does not reflect on the level of queer studies, nor is a (future) portrayal of man put forward, because it is the researchers experience that when that is done, at least invariably, people are more acquiescent. It does not mean that if something is imagined, created or written, people will interact with it. It may indeed be devoured in a cannibalistic manner, but the latter will always guarantee a solution to the problem in the literal sense. Put differently, in dialogue with contemporary art, the researcher sought ways to interact with art. There is no point in resorting to terminology of 'authenticity', because it is precisely 'in' this connection that 'originality' is easily related to 'origin' (any form), which is not only a non-imaged (imagining) manipulation of history, but also shows that there is apparently no way of connecting to the present or an (im) possible future, or the real and unreal situation of a location, for that matter. Most anti-artistic ritual spaces, or those that block interaction with the artistic dimension, easily elicit a non-imaginary interaction with (un) realities, as if one would prefer to deny people (humanity) and their interaction with other people, objects and things any artistic knowledge and interaction with it. This research does not, unless sporadically, refer to ritual space, but should be read as a curators and writers interaction with the elementary level of artistic imagination in some works/oeuvres of contemporary art. The me-person who occasionally comes into play, keeps her personal opinions to herself, but can be understood as the position (or lack thereof) of a choice in favour of (interaction with) artistic imagination in contemporary art, which can apparently meet with resistance, sometimes from different quarters even: everyone appears to be afraid of losing their credibility, but they do not appear to shrink back from trivialising someone/ something. And that is exactly where imagination-related intervention / manipulation / the importance of political, commercial or (inter) personal or collective worlds in contemporary art and the related interaction can be experienced. status: publishe...|$|E
