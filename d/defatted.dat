25|$|Fat-free (<b>defatted)</b> {{soybean meal}} is a {{significant}} and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes. The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Traditional non-fermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto and tempeh.|$|E
2500|$|Soybeans are a {{globally}} important crop, providing oil and protein. In the United States, {{the bulk}} of the harvest is solvent-extracted with hexane, and the [...] "toasted" [...] <b>defatted</b> soymeal (50% protein) then makes possible the raising of farm animals (e.g. chicken, hog, turkey) on a large industrial scale. Soybean products are used in a large variety of processed foods.|$|E
2500|$|A {{high-quality}} hamburger patty is made {{entirely of}} ground (minced) beef and seasonings; {{these may be}} described as [...] "all-beef hamburger" [...] or [...] "all-beef patties" [...] to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated <b>defatted</b> beef trimmings (which the company Beef Products Inc, calls [...] "lean finely textured beef"), advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include {{salt and pepper and}} others like as parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or Worcestershire sauce. Many name brand seasoned salt products are also used.|$|E
2500|$|Livestock {{and poultry}} are raised on animal feed, {{much of which}} is {{composed}} of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops. For example, approximately 43% of a canola seed is oil. What remains after oil extraction is a meal that becomes an ingredient in animal feed and contains canola protein. Likewise, {{the bulk of the}} soybean crop is grown for oil and meal. The high-protein <b>defatted</b> and toasted soy meal becomes livestock feed and dog food. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed. In 2011, 49% of the US maize harvest was used for livestock feed (including the percentage of waste from distillers grains). [...] "Despite methods that {{are becoming more and more}} sensitive, tests have not yet been able to establish a difference in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals depending on the type of feed they are fed. It is impossible to tell if an animal was fed GM soy just by looking at the resulting meat, dairy, or egg products. The only way to verify the presence of GMOs in animal feed is to analyze the origin of the feed itself." ...|$|E

50|$|Soy protein {{concentrate}} {{is produced by}} immobilizing the soy globulin proteins while allowing the soluble carbohydrates, soy whey proteins, and salts to be leached from the <b>defatted</b> flakes or flour. The protein is retained {{by one or more}} of several treatments: leaching with 20-80% aqueous alcohol/solvent, leaching with aqueous acids in the isoelectric zone of minimum protein solubility, pH 4-5; leaching with chilled water (which may involve calcium or magnesium cations), and leaching with hot water of heat-treated <b>defatted</b> soy meal/flour.|$|E
50|$|Soy {{protein is}} a protein that is {{isolated}} from soybean. It {{is made from}} soybean meal that has been dehulled and <b>defatted.</b> Dehulled and <b>defatted</b> soybeans are processed into three kinds of high protein commercial products : soy flour, concentrates, and isolates. Soy protein isolate has been used since 1959 in foods for its functional properties. Recently, soy protein popularity has increased due to its use in health food products, and many countries allow health claims for foods rich in soy protein.|$|E
50|$|Soy {{molasses}} is brown viscous syrup with {{a typical}} bittersweet flavor. A by-product of aqueous alcohol soy protein concentrate production, soy molasses is a concentrated, desolventized, aqueous alcohol extract of <b>defatted</b> soybean flakes.|$|E
5000|$|Globally, about 2 {{percent of}} soybean meal {{is used for}} soy flour and other {{products}} for human consumption. [...] Soy flour “provides the basis for some soy milks and vegetable protein”, and is marketed as full-fat, low-fat, <b>defatted</b> and lecithinated types.|$|E
50|$|Some meat analogues include mycoprotein-based Quorn (which usually uses {{egg white}} as a binder; only Vegan Burger is {{suitable}} for vegans), and modified <b>defatted</b> peanut flour and Valess (which {{is a sort of}} cheese, made from cow milk and seaweed).|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process for HVP {{varies depending on}} the desired organoleptic properties of the end product. In general, common vegetable raw materials used {{in the production of}} HVP include <b>defatted</b> oil seeds (soy, rapeseed), and protein mainly from maize, wheat, pea, and rice.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{processes}} result in a product that is 70% protein, 20% carbohydrates (2.7 to 5% crude fiber), 6% ash and about 1% oil, but the solubility may differ. One tonne of <b>defatted</b> soybean flakes will yield about 750 kg of soybean protein concentrate.|$|E
50|$|Peanut flour, <b>defatted,</b> {{is listed}} as being very {{nutritional}} and is very low in saturated fat and cholesterol. It {{is also a good}} source of dietary fiber, thiamin, folate, potassium and zinc, and a very good source of protein, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} the bread {{produced}} depends on the viscoelastic properties of gluten, the protein content and protein composition. Containing about 12% total protein in <b>defatted</b> flour compared to 11% in common wheat, durum wheat yields 27% extractable, wet gluten compared to 24% in common wheat.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that African breadfruit is a good adjunct in brewing {{because it is a}} source of {{fermentable}} sugars. For success with the brewing, see the study of Nwabueze et al. (2011). They find that the yield production of ethanol is enhanced when its <b>defatted</b> seeds are used.|$|E

5000|$|Peanut flour is {{made from}} crushed, fully or partly <b>defatted</b> peanuts. Peanut flour, {{depending}} on the quantity of fat removed, is highly protein-dense, providing up to 31.32g per cup (60g). Culinary professionals use peanut flour as a [...] thickener for soups, a flavor and aromatic enhancer in breads, pastries and main dishes.|$|E
50|$|Textured or {{texturized}} {{vegetable protein}} (TVP), {{also known as}} textured soy protein (TSP), soy meat, or soya chunks is a <b>defatted</b> soy flour product, a by-product of extracting soybean oil. It is often used as a meat analogue or meat extender. It is quick to cook, with a protein content far greater than certain meats.|$|E
50|$|Soy {{protein isolate}} {{is a highly}} refined or {{purified}} form of soy protein with a minimum protein content of 90% on a moisture-free basis. It is made from <b>defatted</b> soy flour which has had most of the nonprotein components, fats and carbohydrates removed. Because of this, it has a neutral flavor and will cause less flatulence than soy flours.|$|E

5000|$|The {{discontinued}} Canadian formula had {{a different}} taste which reflected the [...] "Canadian taste preference" [...] (according to the Consumer Relations department of Kellogg's in Canada). The Canadian formula included rice, wheat gluten, sugar/glucose-fructose, <b>defatted</b> wheat germ, salt, malt (corn flour, malted barley), vitamins (thiamin hydrochloride, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, folic acid, d-calcium pantothenate), iron, and BHT added to the package material to maintain product freshness.|$|E
50|$|Rice Feed Ingredients/HullsFeed {{ingredients}} {{have expanded}} with products {{supported by the}} Research and Technical Center. <b>Defatted</b> rice bran, mill feed and hulls are sold to both the livestock and pet food industries as ingredients. Some rice hulls are burned for energy and the ash is used as an absorbent. Rice hulls are also used as a pressing aid in fruit juices extraction and as bedding in poultry houses.|$|E
50|$|Soy flour {{is made by}} {{grinding}} soybeans into a fine powder. It {{comes in}} three forms: whole or full-fat (contains natural oils); <b>defatted</b> (oils removed) with 50% protein content and with either high water solubility or low water solubility; and lecithinated (lecithin added). A history of soy flour and grits has been published. As soy flour is gluten-free, yeast-raised breads made with soy flour are dense in texture.|$|E
50|$|Soy flour or <b>defatted</b> soy flour (50% protein) glue which {{originally}} {{replaced the}} more expensive casein glue for Douglas fir plywood is re-emerging as the glue of choice to replace toxic urea formaldehyde and phenol formaldehyde resin glues with a formaldehyde-free soy glue. Soy protein is used for emulsification and texturizing. Specific applications include adhesives, asphalts, resins, cleaning materials, cosmetics, inks, pleather, paints, paper coatings, pesticides/fungicides, plastics, polyesters, and textile fibres.|$|E
50|$|A strict {{trimming}} process {{is essential to}} the rich taste. Legs of beef are thoroughly <b>defatted</b> and seasoned with a dry rub of coarse salt and spices, such as juniper berries, cinnamon and nutmeg. They are then left to cure for a few days. A drying period of between one and three months follows, depending on the weight of the particular bresaola. The meat loses up to 40% of its original weight during aging.|$|E
