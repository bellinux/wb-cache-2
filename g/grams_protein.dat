40|$|ABSTRACT The {{dietary intake}} and {{biochemical}} status of vitamin B- 6 in 476 apparently healthy Dutch elderly people (aged 65 - 79 y), {{who were not}} using drugs known to affect vitamin B- 6 metabolism, were evaluated. Intake of vitamin B- 6 per <b>gram</b> <b>protein</b> was related to bio-chemical data, namely plasma pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate (PLP) and cofactor stimulation of aspar-tate aminotransferase in erythrocytes (AST-AC). Based on a cutoffpoint of 2. 02 for AST-AC,-. # 9 % of the elderly people not using vitamin B- 6 supplements had a marginal vitamin B- 6 status. About 7 % were using vitamin B- 6 supplements. Dietary intake ofvitamin B- 6 per <b>gram</b> <b>protein</b> was negatively related to AST-AC. Vitamin B- 6 intakes per <b>gram</b> <b>protein</b> higher than 0. 020 mg were necessary to ensure an AST-AC value < 2. 02. At high PLP values AST-AC hardly varied. The results seem to indicate a higher requirement of vitamin B- 6 in elderly people than in younger adults. Am J C/in Nutr l 989; 50 : 39 1 - 9.

40|$|The Development of Non-Milk Based Formulated Drinks For Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women. Background: The {{pregnant}} and breastfeeding women need a greater nutrition intake compared to normal women. At {{second and third}} trimester of pregnancy, and during breastfeeding, a woman should have additional nutrient for approximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per day. Recently, various formula drinks for {{pregnant and}} breastfeeding women {{are available in the}} market, however most of these formulas are expensive. Objectives: To develop non-milk based formula drinks for pregnant and breastfeeding women which contained adequate amount of additional macro and micro nutrients had good sensory quality and had long self life. Methods: Initially, 13 kinds of drinks were formulated. The drinks contained aproximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 <b>grams</b> <b>protein.</b> They were analyzed for nutrient contain, microbiology and sensory quality in order to vote the best 5 formulas at the laboratory scale. The formulated drinks were packaged and sealed in 150 mL plastic cups. To know the self life of the drinks, storage was carry out in the room, incubator and refrigerator temperature during 12 months. Results: From sensory test, it was concluded that the best five drinks were kweni formula, chocholate formula, ginger formula, guava-orange formula and red bean formula. One cup of 150 ml formulated drink, had 140 - 150 Kcal energy and 8 <b>grams</b> <b>protein.</b> Therefore, to fulfill additional requirements for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the drinks should be consumed 2 cups a day. Conclusions: The formula drink developed could provide additional energy, protein, vitamin and mineral needed by pregnant and breast feeding women.

40|$|Preterm infants are {{difficult}} to adequately nourish due to their immature organ systems and prematurity related illnesses. Human milk is accepted as the preferred feed for the preterm infant but needs to be supplemented with protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals to meet the metabolic needs of the infant. Currently available commercial fortifiers {{do not meet the}} recommended protein intakes suggested in the literature. This thesis tested the hypothesis that preterm infants fed a human milk fortifier with a protein content of 1. 8 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per 100 ml expressed breast milk would experience greater weight gain than infants fed the current nursery practice amount – 1. 0 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per 100 ml expressed breast milk. Criteria for eligibility of infants in this study were birth at 28 – 32 weeks gestation and a planned breast milk diet. Power analysis indicated that to detect a clinically significant weight gain increase of 3. 31 grams per day, 60 infants in total would be required. After parental consent was obtained, 60 infants were randomised into the study between February 2012 and February 2013, with 31 in the High protein group and 29 in the Standard group. Multiple births were randomised as individual infants. Infants in the High protein group received a human milk fortifier (FM- 85, Nestle) enriched with Protifar (Nutricia) which provided 1. 8 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per 100 ml expressed breast milk. Infants in the Standard group received a human milk fortifier (FM- 85) that was equivalent to standard care and provided 1 gram protein per 100 ml expressed breast milk. The Standard diet was made isocaloric to the High Protein by the addition of carbohydrate (PolyJoule, Nutricia). The study period for infants began at randomisation and ceased when the naso-gastric tube was removed. Infants were weighed daily by care staff and weekly by trained research personnel. Length and head circumference – important measures of growth – were assessed weekly. Lean mass gain, which is better associated with adult metabolic health outcomes than adipose tissue gain in the in-hospital period, was also assessed weekly. Blood and urine chemistry markers were assessed weekly and every two weeks, respectively, as an assessment of protein nutritional status. A weekly sample of breast milk was collected if supply was abundant. Lean mass was assessed using Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy, which was validated for use in preterm infants as part of this thesis. Breast milk was assessed for protein content to ensure that intake calculations were based on true, not assumed values. There were no differences in the primary outcome of weight gain or the secondary outcomes of length gain, head circumference gain or small for gestational age at discharge status. There was a significant trend for increased lean mass as a percentage of body weight in the high protein infants (p= 0. 03). Blood urea nitrogen and urine urea measurements were significantly higher in the High protein infants. Base excess measurements were significantly decreased in High protein infants however no infants experienced metabolic acidosis. Increasing the protein content of human milk fortifier to 1. 8 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> did not increase weigh gain, length gain or head circumference gain in preterm infants born at 28 – 32 weeks gestation. While the intervention was well tolerated it is the conclusion of this thesis that the protein content of human milk fortifier {{does not need to be}} increased to 1. 8 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per 100 ml expressed breast milk.

It is intended to provide additional food and prevent deteriorating impact of nutritional status of the target. The main objective {{of the study was}} to determine the impact of PMT {{for children}} on malnutrition and growth as compared with that for children not receiving PMT. The design of the study is case control. Case was children of poor family who had or ever had received PMT for three months provided by SSN-HS in the last six months. Control was children of near poor families but who had never received PMT. Matching criteria for case and control were age, sex, and residence of the family. The study was conducted in West Java, Central Java, South Kalimantan covering 1014 cases and 1014 controls and their families. Data on child collected were current weight and height, and retrospective weight in the last 10 months. Other data collected were characteristics of chlidren and therir families including socioeconomic status, clinical examination, dietary intake including food suplement. Program implementation of PMT varied among study areas on selection criteria for child beneficiaries in addition to poor families, duration of PMT, method of distribution, type of food. There were similar characteristics between case and control in age, sex, breastfeeding, morbidity except for socioeconomic status of the family, age of father, educational attainment of parents. Foods distributed for 6 - 11 month old samples included supplementary food, foodstuff, cooked (rice/flour porridge+egg). Foods for 12 - 23 month old samples more varied than food suplement for 6 - 11 months old children. Nutrient content of food distributed was 268 Kcal for energy and 9. 2 <b>grams</b> <b>protein,</b> below the recommended nutrient content of PMT 360 - 430 Kcal and 9 - 15 <b>grams</b> <b>protein.</b> Dietary intake were similar in both groups consisting of energy around 46 % RDA and protein 67 - 73 % RDA (excluding breast milk). This finding shows that part of PMT became substitute rather than supplement. Cases had significantly lower nutritional status in W/A and H/A anthropometric indices than control except for W/H. Growth pattern as analyzed using retrospective data found that there was faltering growth pattern in both groups. Period between three months prior to PMT to the baseline showed that more decreasing Z-score was significantly (repeated measures of ANOVA) greater in case than in control group. Three months during PMT, there was still further decreasing mean Z-score in both groups although it was not as great as three months before. This finding showed that PMT was able to prevent deteriorating nutritional status among child beneficiaries of poor families but was not able to improve their nutritional status.

Two experiments were conducted to assess ruminal escape protein using an in situ rumen technique for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and smooth bromegrass (Bromus inennis Leyss.). Whole-plant, leaf, and stem samples were harvested at specific stages of maturity in 1987. Duplicate samples of each grass were incubated for 12 h in situ. Escape protein values were expressed as concentration [grams escape protein per kilogram dry matter (DM) adjusted for acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) ] and {{as a percentage of}} total plant protein concentration (<b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per kilogram DM adjusted for ADIN) to characterize protein composition.

Detergent-solubilized membranes were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation into three components. The medium density fraction contained chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, and fucoxanthin. This fraction was purified by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography, and contained chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, and fucoxanthin in a molar ratio of 2. 4 : 1. 0 : 4. 8. Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of the isolated complex demonstrated that light energy absorbed by chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin was coupled to chlorophyll a fluorescence. Upon denaturation, the apoprotein yielded a polypeptide doublet at 17. 5 to 18. 0 kilodaltons which accounted for 30 to 40 % of the toal membrane protein.

To determine if nephrotic patients can adapt successfully to a protein-restricted diet, nephrotic (glomerular filtration rate, 52 +/- 15 ml/min; urinary protein [Uprot. ], 7. 2 +/- 2. 2 grams/d) and control subjects completed a crossover comparison of diets providing 0. 8 or 1. 6 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> (plus 1 gram protein/gram Uprot.) and 35 kcal per kg per day. Nitrogen balance (BN) was determined and whole body protein turnover measured during fasting and feeding using intravenous -[1 - 13 C]leucine and intragastric -[5, 5, 5 - 2 H 3]leucine. BN was positive in both nephrotic and control subjects consuming either diet and rates of whole-body protein synthesis, protein degradation, and leucine oxidation did not differ between groups. In both nephrotic and control subjects anabolism was due to a suppression of whole-body protein degradation and stimulation of protein synthesis during feeding. The principal compensatory response to dietary protein restriction was a decrease in amino acid oxidation and this response was the same in both groups. With the low protein diet leucine oxidation rates during feeding correlated inversely with Uprot. losses (r = - 0. 83; P < 0. 05). Conclusions: (a) a diet providing 0. 8 gram protein (plus 1 gram protein/gram Uprot.) and 35 kcal per kg per day maintains BN in nephrotic patients; (b) nephrotic patients activate normal anabolic responses to dietary protein restriction (suppression of amino acid oxidation) and feeding (stimulation of protein synthesis and inhibition of protein degradation); (c) the inverse correlation between leucine oxidation and Uprot. losses suggests that proteinuria is a stimulus to conserve dietary essential amino acids...|$|E
40|$|DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A LIGHT WEIGHT, ENERGY DENSE, READY TO EAT (RTE) BAR Jacob Wilhelm-Maria Heick Providing {{additional}} {{calories in}} the form of an RTE bar to endurance athletes will increase performance and muscle re-synthesis, reduce muscle breakdown, and shorten recovery time. An RTE bar containing a blend of dairy proteins and carbohydrates will create a product with superior functionality, including bioactive and immunity enhancing properties from dairy derived ingredients. The protein will provide benefits {{in the form}} of easily digestible calories, essential amino acids and physical satiate. A formulation was developed and optimized, resulting in a final product that meets the required nutritional profile: 400 kcal, 25 <b>grams</b> <b>protein</b> per 100 gram serving size. The desired physical characteristics were achieved through processing by both conventional baking and freeze drying. The latter method improves the stability and functionality of the RTE bar. In order to meet the protein requirements of the RTE bar without compromising sensory properties, a unique protein source was developed. Using high concentrations of conventional protein sources like Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) resulted in stale off-flavors and unappealing textures. Milk Protein Precipitate (MPP) was developed for this formulation. MPP is a curd-like ingredient created through the combined heat and acid precipitation of dairy proteins. MPP can be used effectively in high concentrations provides a subtle dairy flavor. MPP delivers a balance of casein and whey, similar to that found in milk. The effectiveness of the RTE bar formulation as a post exercise recovery food was evaluated in a human studies experiment conducted on the Cal Poly campus. The human subjects study utilized 34 Cal Poly students in a single-blind cross-over design experiment. The study compared the effects of this high protein RTE bar against a calorically equal carbohydrate bar. The bars were administered after subjects completed the pre-assigned hikes on three consecutive days. Following the cross-over design, subjects received the alternate bar in the second period of the experiment. Several blood markers involved in metabolism and inflammation were measured before and after the two treatment periods. No blood marker showed a statistically significant difference between bars, but several trends were observed. Body weight and fat percent were also unaffected by bar composition...|$|E
