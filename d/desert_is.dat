5|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{thought of}} as a barren and empty landscape. It has been portrayed by writers, film-makers, philosophers, artists and critics as a place of extremes, a metaphor for anything from death, war or religion to the primitive past or the desolate future.|$|E

The city was possibly constructed by King Amaziah of Judah, an 8th-century BCE ruler who fortified the Judean kingdom and went to war with neighbouring Edom in the northern Arabah, or his son Uzziah whose construction of towers in the <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> mentioned by the second Book of Chronicles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people think}} of deserts as {{consisting}} of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes {{because that is the}} way they are often depicted on TV and in films, but deserts do not always look like this. Across the world, around 20% of <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Desert</b> {{greening}} <b>is</b> {{the process}} of man-made reclamation of deserts for ecological reasons (biodiversity), farming and forestry, but also for reclamation of natural water systems and other Life support systems. It is done by various methods. So far only arid and semi-arid <b>desert</b> <b>are</b> meant when using the expression. Icy <b>deserts</b> <b>are</b> considered unsuitable.Desert greening is an important topic as it can help solve global water, energy, and food crises. It pertains to roughly 32 million square kilometres of land.|$|R
5|$|A <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> not {{the kind}} of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari <b>Desert</b> <b>is</b> used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} {{stations}} include the 354megawatt (MW) Solar Energy Generating Systems {{power plant in}} the USA, Solnova Solar Power Station (Spain, 150MW), Andasol solar power station (Spain, 100MW), Nevada Solar One (USA, 64MW), PS20 solar power tower (Spain, 20MW), and the PS10 solar power tower (Spain, 11MW). The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave <b>Desert,</b> <b>is</b> the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction. Many other plants are under construction or planned, mainly in Spain and the USA. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave <b>Desert</b> <b>is</b> among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan <b>Desert</b> <b>is</b> stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} horse latitudes at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara <b>Desert</b> <b>is</b> of this type. Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.|$|E

5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara <b>Desert</b> <b>is</b> huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E

25|$|Formed {{approximately}} 8000 years ago, the Chihuahuan <b>Desert</b> <b>is</b> {{a relatively}} dry desert, {{although it is}} slightly wetter than the Sonoran Desert to the west. The Chihuahuan Desert spreads across the southeastern portion of the region, covering from southeastern Arizona, across southern New Mexico, and the portion of Texas included in the Southwest.
