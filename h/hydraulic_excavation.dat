50|$|The {{municipality}} {{has three}} main archeological sites. Ixtépete contains a Teotihuacan style pyramid which is twenty meters long, sixteen meters wide and 1.83 meters high. Construction phases of this pyramid date {{back from the}} 5th century to the 10th century. El Grillo {{is located in the}} Tabachines housing subdivision in the north of the Valley of Atemajac. This site has a series of fourteen tombs arranged along an arroyo which is now dry. La Coronilla is located in an area called La Experiencia. In and around the city of Zapopan, there have been finding of ancient tombs. One example is when about a dozen pre-Hispanic objects were found during a <b>hydraulic</b> work <b>excavation</b> at Ciudad Granja, in Zapopan, Jalisco. A pot, a vase and anthropomorphic figures are among the items discovered. These objects are of the Shaft Tombs Tradition which developed between 100 BCE and 500 CE in western Mexico. Further excavations are planned to search for a shaft tomb. The initial discovery was made by construction workers in May 2009 while doing maintenance work.|$|R

40|$|A few lithic {{percussion}} tools, probably {{related to}} construction and craftsmanship, {{are stored in}} the National Museum of Archaeology of Valletta (Malta). Dated to the Temple Period (about 4000 - 2500 BCE), many are typologically similar to artefacts from the continental area, but others look distinctive and probably developed in loco in response to specific needs. This paper examines five stone hammers with different hafting methods (three of them show grooves or holes and two both grooves and holes). A huge double hand grip percussion tool belongs to a different and unusual typology: the double grip allowed two opposite-standing men, steadily holding it, to strike with strength on other surfaces, probably when heavy blows were needed. Grooved stone hammers are widespread in various European regions and are mostly associated with mining activities. In the Maltese archipelago the limestone lacks ore deposits, and thus their presence may be reflect other uses, although still associated {{to the work of}} stone on stone: earthworks, quarrying, finishing of stone surfaces, <b>hydraulic</b> works, <b>excavation</b> of burial and rituals structures, and others. The double grip lithic percussor (ID 9120) has no precise parallel and may be unique. This paper aims to fill a gap in the current literature about prehistoric lithic tools, as in many studies the focus is often placed on the results of specific activities rather than on the typological features of the artefacts that made these activities possible...|$|R

40|$|Waterjet {{technology}} finding broad application {{potential in}} different areas, due to having low cutting force required {{and the possibility}} of flexible and multi-directional cutting, is used as an alternative method over the conventional cutting systems. Waterjet technology, used firstly in excavation processes of soft rocks in mining, has increased its usability with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavation</b> of coal. Nowadays, it is commonly used for block cutting in quarries and processing of natural stones for the purposes of decorative production. The method has the potential use in drilling and tunneling processes too. Recently, investigations have been carried out to enhance the usability of the technology in milling processes. In this study, an assessment of some applications of waterjet technology in mining is presented. Additionally, the technology is compared with other cutting systems used in mining in terms of various aspects as well. As a result of the study, it is determined that the cutting process with waterjet technology could be efficiently used in mining sector because of the advantages such as little material losses, not requiring any additional processes after cutting, eliminating the dust, increasing the fragmentation efficiency of rock or coal, decreasing the costs resulted from wear...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{design and}} testing of a {{portable}} pumping system {{for use in the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavation</b> of commercial crab pots buried by ocean sediment was undertaken. The resulting portable system retained the four major components of the pumping systems presently used by commercial fishermen: engine, pump, fire hose, and nozzle. Because present systems are too heavy and unwieldy for use on smaller crab boats, a system of more modest proportions yet equivalent excavating capacity was sought. By using a more effective waterjet nozzle, it became possible to employ a one-cylinder pump-engine combination easily portable by two men. The portable pump and engine were purchased and a nozzle manufactured. The system package was assembled, tested for system flow characteristics, then field tested. The system performed well in a simulation experiment, digging a sizable hole on a sand flat. Limited testing aboard ship indicates that the system performs adequately there as well. Along with meeting the design criteria of performance, durability, portability, and corrosion resistance, the system may be simply fabricated using a metal lathe and basic welding equipment. The cost of the system is comparable to that of presently used systems. Analysis of phenomena associated with crab pot pumping, such as hose drag and nozzle reaction forces, was also performed...|$|E
40|$|Slope {{excavation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial steps in the construction of a <b>hydraulic</b> project. <b>Excavation</b> project quality assessment and excavated volume calculation are critical in construction management. The positioning of excavation projects using traditional instruments is inefficient and may cause error. To improve the efficiency and precision of calculation and assessment, three-dimensional laser scanning technology was used for slope excavation quality assessment. An efficient data acquisition, processing, and management workflow was presented in this study. Based on the quality control indices, including the average gradient, slope toe elevation, and overbreak and underbreak, cross-sectional quality assessment and holistic quality assessment methods were proposed to assess the slope excavation quality with laser-scanned data. An algorithm was also presented to calculate the excavated volume with laser-scanned data. A field application and a laboratory experiment were carried out to verify the feasibility of these methods for excavation quality assessment and excavated volume calculation. The results show that the quality assessment indices can be obtained rapidly and accurately with design parameters and scanned data, and the results of holistic quality assessment are consistent with those of cross-sectional quality assessment. In addition, the time consumption in excavation quality assessment with the laser scanning technology can be reduced by 70 %– 90 %, as compared with the traditional method. The excavated volume calculated with the scanned data only slightly differs from measured data, demonstrating the applicability of the excavated volume calculation method presented in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical and {{deformation}} {{characteristics of}} pile-anchor retaining structure was analyzed by using numerical simulation method. The rationality of numerical model was also verified through comparing measured data in field test and numerical results. On {{the basis of}} this numerical model, Mechanical and deformation characteristics of pile-anchor retaining structure under three different construction procedures were analyzed individually. The results show that: the maximum horizontal displacement of pile is controlled effectively by applying anchoring force, and the global horizontal displacement of pile increases as well. Forced state of pile is changed from being bended on one side to being bended on both sides, and maximum moment value decreases heavily. Therefore, anchor cable reinforcement should be arranged at the head of construction procedure of pile-anchor retaining structure. The later anchoring force be applied, the closer inflection point nears the pile top. Engineering situation A certain waterway was a secondary <b>hydraulic</b> structure.

40|$|In this study, an {{approach}} to estimate the swelling potential of clay-sulfate rocks in tunneling is presented. Swelling of clay-sulfate rocks leads to damage in tunnels that is difficult and costly to repair. Swelling {{is caused by the}} transformation of the sulfate mineral anhydrite into gypsum, which involves an increase in rock volume in a system open to water flow. Knowledge of the hydrogeological situation and the groundwater flow systems at the tunnel is essential to better understand the swelling processes. The present study was conducted for the Chienberg tunnel in Switzerland. It investigates the hydrogeological situation of four zones in this tunnel crossing the Triassic Gipskeuper formation. In two of them, heavy swelling occurred after tunnel excavation, while in the other two no swelling occurred. In addition, the groundwater flow systems before and after tunnel excavation are investigated based on numerical flow modeling. The findings suggest that in certain situations after tunnel excavation, depending on geological and changing <b>hydraulic</b> conditions, the <b>excavation</b> damaged zone around the tunnel provides a "hydraulic short circuit" between the weathered Gipskeuper and the anhydrite-bearing strata of the unweathered Gipskeuper. As a result, water from the weathered Gipskeuper gets in contact with anhydrite, triggering its transformation into gypsum and, thus, rock swelling. The results of the study may also contribute to improved swelling experiments in the laboratory and a more reliable planning of restoration measures in tunnels that are damaged by rock swelling.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a shared control design framework for improving operator efficiency and performance on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavation</b> tasks. The framework {{is based on}} blended shared control (BSC), a technique whereby the operator?s command input is continually augmented by an assistive controller. Designing a BSC control scheme is subdivided here into four key components. Task learning utilizes nonparametric inverse reinforcement learning to identify the underlying goal structure of a task as a sequence of subgoals directly from the demonstration data of an experienced operator. These subgoals may be distinct points in the actuator space or distributions overthe space, from which the operator draws a subgoal location during the task. The remaining three steps are executed on-line during each update of the BSC controller. In real-time, the subgoal prediction step involves utilizing the subgoal decomposition from the learning process in order to predict the current subgoal of the operator. Novel deterministic and probabilistic prediction methods are developed and evaluated for their ease of implementation and performance against manually labeled trial data. The control generation component involves computing polynomial trajectories to the predicted subgoal location or mean of the subgoal distribution, and computing a control input which tracks those trajectories. Finally, the blending law synthesizes both inputs through a weighted averaging of the human and control input, using a blending parameter which can be static or dynamic. In the latter case, mapping probabilistic quantities such as the maximum a posteriori probability or statistical entropy {{to the value of}} the dynamic blending parameter may yield a more intelligent control assistance, scaling the intervention according to the confidence of the prediction. A reduced-scale (1 / 12) fully hydraulic excavator model was instrumented for BSC experimentation, equipped with absolute position feedback of each hydraulic actuator. Experiments were conducted using a standard operator control interface and a common earthmoving task: loading a truck from a pile. Under BSC, operators experienced an 18 % improvement in mean digging efficiency, defined as mass of material moved per cycle time. Effects of BSC vary with regard to pure cycle time, although most operators experienced a reduced mean cycle time...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{machines}} {{being in}} operational service with military units of  engineer troops are fit to their purpose and their application is relevant in modern conditions. Maintenance of operating conditions in engineering equipment which was produced earlier by the USSR enterprises is {{considered as a}} rather complicated task {{due to lack of}} spare parts because their production has been discontinued. One of the approaches used for maintenance of engineering equipment combat capabilities is modernization of operating drive systems that presupposes replacement of mechanical systems in working element drives by hydrostatic drives which are realized while using modern element base. Usage of hydraulic units in drive systems being in mass production for replacement of mechanical systems manufactured earlier in small batches makes it possible to reduce labour inputs for maintenance and repair of machines. The paper presents some possibilities for development of operating drive systems in engineering equipment. The proposed approach is given through an example of  engineering obstacle-clearing vehicle (IMR- 2 M) and excavation machines (MDK- 3 and MDK- 2 M). Application of a hydraulic drive in working elements of the excavation machines permits to withdraw from cardan  shafts, a gear box, a rotary gear and an overload clutch. A hydraulic motor of the cutter and thrower drive is mounted  on a working element gearbox. While executing modernization of <b>hydraulic</b> systems in <b>excavation</b> machines a pump unit has been proposed for the cutter and thrower drive which consists of a controlled pump and a system for automatic maintenance of the pump operational parameters. While developing the operating drive systems in engineering equipment in accordance with the proposed requirements it is possible to simplify drive systems of working elements and  ensure reliable machinery operation in the units of engineer troops.  </p...|$|R
