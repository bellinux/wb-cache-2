5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> present but not to a significant degree. The <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> still found across all languages.|$|E

30|$|Although {{spillover}} <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> {{likely to}} occur, {{the question is}} to what extent it invalidates a DiD application. What {{is required for the}} identification of a treatment <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> that second round, or indirect <b>effects,</b> <b>are</b> of a lower order of magnitude compared to the direct effect. At least in large data sets, a significant treatment <b>effect</b> should <b>be</b> discernible even if the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> biased to some extent.|$|R
30|$|The {{review of}} {{literature}} and experiments indicate the presence of Pre-Darcy effect. Contributing factors to Pre-Darcy <b>effect</b> <b>are</b> discussed and some reasons causing this <b>effect</b> <b>are</b> postulated. The experiments also show that this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> significant.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} reasons to think this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> real. Firstly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in such {{a wide range of}} patients, medical and surgical, unselected and selected. Secondly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> very {{consistent}} in terms of the degree of difference (10-15%). Thirdly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in many developed countries on several continents, all of which have a ‘Saturday/Sunday weekend concept’.|$|R
5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass <b>Effect</b> <b>was</b> ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation. In 2015, Mass <b>Effect</b> <b>was</b> added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Among {{women living}} closely together, {{it was once}} thought that the onsets of {{menstruation}} tend to synchronize. This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> first described in 1971, and possibly explained {{by the action of}} pheromones in 1998. Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E

50|$|The {{next set}} of {{substituent}}s are the halogens, for which the substituent <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still positive but much more modest. The {{reason for this is}} that while the inductive <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still negative, the mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, the meta <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much larger than the para effect, due to the fact that the mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).|$|R
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|BUDD held {{a public}} meeting was on 24 July 1997, at which 99% of the {{approximately}} 300 people who attended voted against the original planning application, which had been submitted in May following several months of preparation. A 4,317-name petition to the same <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> submitted to the council three months later. Marches and rallies also took place.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> achieved by only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} semantically related primes and phonologically similar primes were investigated. Tasks for {{processing}} targets were either lexical decision or vowel detection. SOA's (stimulus onset asynchrony) were 200 ms or 800 ms. The reaction time {{results indicated that}} semantic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> found only in lexical decision tasks and phonological priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> only in vowel detection tasks. It was also revealed that only semantic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> found in shorter SOA conditions, and both semantic and phonemic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> shown in longer SOA conditions. The necessity for further investigation including other factors of priming <b>effects</b> <b>was</b> suggested. 原著Original国立情報学研究所で電子...|$|R

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{predicts that}} the path of light will follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star. This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.|$|E
5|$|ILM's {{computer}} graphics division {{was responsible for}} creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis. Meyer's idea for the <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> influenced by The Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a lens flare simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture mapped to the surface.|$|E

5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron interferometric experiments. Also a transverse dragging <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> observed, i.e. when the medium is moving at right angles to the direction of the incident light.|$|E
5|$|The Yosemite Firefall, {{in which}} the embers from a bonfire were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point to create a {{spectacular}} <b>effect,</b> <b>was</b> ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be inconsistent with park values. The firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass <b>Effect</b> <b>was</b> completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass <b>Effect,</b> <b>was</b> introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E

50|$|A {{corollary}} of the Pygmalion <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{the golem}} <b>effect,</b> in which low expectations {{lead to a}} decrease in performance; both <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> forms of self-fulfilling prophecy. By the Pygmalion effect, people internalize their positive labels, and those with positive labels succeed accordingly. The idea behind the Pygmalion <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> that increasing the leader's expectation of the follower's performance will result in better follower performance. Within sociology, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> often cited with regard to education and social class.|$|R
5000|$|Glucocorticoids such as {{cortisol}} affect carbohydrate, fat, {{and protein}} metabolism, and have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and vasoconstrictive <b>effects.</b> Anti-inflammatory <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by blocking {{the action of}} inflammatory mediators (transrepression) and inducing anti-inflammatory mediators (transactivation). Immunosuppressive <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by suppressing delayed hypersensitivity reactions by direct action on T-lymphocytes. Anti-proliferative <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by inhibition of DNA synthesis and epidermal cell turnover. Vasoconstrictive <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by inhibiting the action of inflammatory mediators such as histidine.|$|R
5|$|The {{prescribing}} information {{notes that}} hypertension, sometimes severe, {{was observed in}} some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The frequency of this adverse <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> under 1% and not significantly higher than found with placebo. A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is safe to use in people {{with a variety of}} serious cardiac conditions.|$|E
5|$|This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> {{exploited}} in the Tesla turbine, {{patented by}} Nikola Tesla in 1913. It {{is referred to}} as a bladeless turbine because it uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Boundary layer turbines are also known as cohesion-type turbine, bladeless turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl).|$|E
5|$|A {{spin-off}} novel, Deus Ex: Icarus <b>Effect,</b> <b>was</b> {{written by}} Swallow. It {{was a story}} set {{around the same time}} as the main game, following new characters Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso as they uncover a hidden conspiracy. First announced in July 2010, it was published by Titan Books on February 22, 2011. A second novel by Swallow, Deus Ex: Fallen Angel, was released as a free online download alongside the release of the Director's Cut: the novel details Malik's early life in Hengsha. A film adaptation was also announced, planned by Eidos Montréal and CBS Films: based on the story of Human Revolution, Scott Derrickson was attached as director and co-writer, C. Robert Cargill as co-writer, and Roy Lee and Adrian Askarieh as producers.|$|E
