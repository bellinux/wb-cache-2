40|$|International audienceSince {{it is an}} {{unsupervised}} {{data analysis}} approach, clustering relies solely on {{the location of the}} data points in the data space or, alternatively, on their relative distances or similarities. As a consequence, clustering can suffer from the presence of noisy data points and outliers, which can obscure the structure of the clusters in the data and thus may <b>drive</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithms to yield suboptimal or even misleading results. Fuzzy clustering is no exception in this respect, although it features an aspect of robustness, due to which outliers and generally data points that are atypical for the clusters in the data have a lesser influence on the cluster parameters.

40|$|Partnership ties shape {{friendship}} networks {{through different}} social forces. First, partnership ties <b>drive</b> <b>clustering</b> in friendship networks: {{individuals who are}} in a partnership tend to have common friends and befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed in many attributes (e. g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily, however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine months (N = 2, 250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and explain a striking amount of homophil...|$|E

This paper proposes a semi-supervised clustering algorithm termed as the Probabilistic and Graphical Model based Genetic Algorithm <b>Driven</b> <b>Clustering</b> with Instance-level Constraints (Cop-CGA). In Cop-CGA, all prior knowledge about pairs of instances that should or should not be classified into the same groups is denoted as a graph and all candidate clustering solutions are sampled from this graph with different orders to assign instances into a certain number of groups. We illustrate how to design the Cop-CGA to guarantee that all can-didate solutions satisfy the given constraints and demonstrate the usefulness of background knowledge for genetic algorithm <b>driven</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithm through experiments on several real data sets with artificial hard constraints. One advantage of Cop-CGA is both positive and negative instance-level constraints can be easily incorporated.

40|$|We {{investigate}} cluster synchronization in coupled map {{networks in}} the presence of heterogeneous delays. We find that while parity of heterogeneous delays plays a crucial role in determining the phenomenon of cluster formation, the synchronizability of network predominantly gets affected by the amount of heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in delays induces a rich cluster patterns as compared to the homogeneous delays. The complete bipartite networks stands as an extreme example of this richness, where instead of robust ideal <b>driven</b> <b>clusters,</b> versatile cluster patterns are observed for which we provide arguments using the Lyapunov function analysis. Furthermore, interplay between the number of connections in the network and the amount of heterogeneity has important role in deciding cluster formation. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} of robust kinetic parameter estimation applied to absolute flow quantification in dynamic PET imaging. Kinetic parameter estimation is formulated as a nonlinear least squares with spatial con-straints problem (NLLS-SC) where the spatial constraints are computed from a physiologically <b>driven</b> <b>clustering</b> of dynamic images, {{and used to}} reduce noise contamination. An ideal clustering of dynamic images depends on the underlying physiology of functional regions, and in turn, physiological processes are quantified by kinetic parameter estimation. Physiologically <b>driven</b> <b>clustering</b> of dynamic images is performed using a clustering algorithm (e. g. K-means, Spectral Clustering etc) with Kinetic modeling in an iterative handshaking fashion. This gives a map of labels where each functionally homogenous cluster is represented by mean kinetics (cluster centroid). Parametric images are acquired by solving the NLLS-SC problem for each voxel which penalizes spatial variations from its mean kinetics. This substantially reduces noise in the estimation process for each voxel by utilizing kinetic information from physiologically similar voxels (cluster members). Resolution degradation is also substantially minimized as no spatial smoothing between heterogeneous functional regions is performed. The proposed framework is shown to improve the quantitative accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion (MP) PET imaging, and in turn, has the long-term potential to enhance capabilities of MP PET in the detection, staging and management of coronary artery disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Analysis {{of human}} brain {{development}} is a crucial step for improved understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders. We focus on normal brain development as is observed in the multimodal longitudinal MRI/DTI data of neonates to two years of age. We present a spatio-temporal analysis framework using Gompertz function as a population growth model with three different spatial localization strategies: voxel-based, data <b>driven</b> <b>clustering</b> and atlas <b>driven</b> regional analysis. Growth models from multimodal imaging channels collected at each voxel form feature vectors which are clustered using the Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM). Clustering thus combines growth information from different modalities to subdivide the image into voxel groups with similar properties. The processing generates spatial maps that highlight the dynamic progression of white matter development. These maps show progression of white matter maturation where primarily, central regions mature earlier compared to the periphery, but where more subtle regional differences in growth can be observed. Atlas based analysis allows a quantitative analysis of a specific anatomical region, whereas data <b>driven</b> <b>clustering</b> identifies regions of similar growth patterns. The combination of these two allows us to investigate growth patterns within an anatomical region. Specifically, analysis of anterior and posterior limb of internal capsule show that there are different growth trajectories within these anatomies, and {{that it may be}} useful to divide certain anatomies into subregions with distinctive growth patterns.
