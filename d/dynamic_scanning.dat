40|$|The {{problem of}} how to {{dynamically}} schedule a receiver to detect multiple emitters is modeled as a sensor resource allocation problem. It is shown how to specify a variety of receiver-based <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> scheduling strategies that dynamically focus a sensor in different frequency bands so as to develop and maintain good information about an emitter environment. We contrast dynamic and 'ixed" scheduling policies, show how to incorporate emitter priorities, and we use simulation analyses to provide insights into the design and behavior of the policies. We explain how a 'response surface methodology" can be used to design optimal <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> schedulers. Moreover, we introduce the idea of using the 'imultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation" method for optimal <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> scheduler design when there are many emitters. Next, it is shown how to characterize and analyze stability properties (e. g., boundedness) of a variety of <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> scheduling methods. We discuss a 'hniversal stab ilizing mechanism" for dynamic sc an schedulers and propose two <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> scheduling methods that exploit emitter environment information {{in order to try to}} optimize scheduler performance.

50|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{projects}} was a more sophisticated development of the rather modest MRI techniques available {{in the early eighties}} - mainly with respect to speed and specificity. Already in 1985 the group presented a major breakthrough for the future development of MRI in both science and medicine. The invention of a rapid imaging principle, the FLASH MRI (fast low angle shot) technique, allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH acquisition technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging. Examples include breathhold imaging of the abdomen, electrocardiogram-synchronized quasi-real time movies of the beating heart, <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> of contrast media uptake, 3D imaging of complex anatomic structures such as the brain that allow for unprecedented high spatial resolution and arbitrary view angles, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the vasculature. Other achievements extended to MRI and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques based on stimulated echoes - another invention from 1984.|$|E

40|$|Selective {{removal of}} the {{pituitary}} adenoma has not been advocated in dogs with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism because the pituitary adenoma is usually not visualized on routine computed tomography (CT). Dynamic pituitary CT scanning is aimed at the detection of the pituitary flush and, indirectly, at the presence and position of the adenoma. The first aim of this retrospective study was to compare findings of a multiple slice <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> protocol with those of a single slice dynamic protocol using a single slice CT scanner. The second aim was to compare the CT findings with surgical findings, and surgical findings with histopathological findings. Computed tomography with single and multiple slice <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> protocols was performed in 86 dogs with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism. Thirty dogs underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and pituitary specimens were collected as tumor, normal, mixed and neurohypophyseal samples and processed for histology. The pituitary flush was not detected more frequent in multiple slice <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> series than in single slice <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> series. However, in non-enlarged pituitaries, the flush was seen significantly more frequently than in enlarged pituitaries. Prediction {{of the nature of}} the tissue during hypophysectomy by the surgeon was inconclusive. In conclusion, when using a single slice CT scanner, both single or multiple slice <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> protocols can be used for localization of the neurohypophyseal flush, and, indirectly, the adenoma. However, based on this study, the aim of surgery in dogs with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism remains total adenohypophysectomy, and when the neurophypophysis is recognized, it may be left in situ...|$|E

The basic principles of frequency detection in <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Scanning</b> Force Microscopy are revised and the precise response of a typical frequency detection unit to thermal fluctuation of the cantilever is analysed in detail. A general relation for thermal frequency noise is found as a function of measurement bandwidth and cantilever oscillation. For large oscillation amplitude and low bandwidth, this relation converges to the result known from the literature, while for low oscillation amplitude and large bandwidth we find that the thermal frequency noise is equal to the width of the resonance curve and therefore stays finite, contrary to what is predicted by the relation known so far.

40|$|Fast {{developments}} in semiconductor industry {{have led to}} smaller and cheaper integrated circuit (IC) components. As the designs become larger and more complex, larger amount of test data is required to test them. This results in longer test application times, therefore, increasing cost of testing each chip. This thesis describes an architecture, named <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Scan,</b> that allows to reduce this cost by reducing the test data volume and, consequently, test application time. The <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Scan</b> architecture partitions the scan chains of the IC design into several segments {{by a set of}} multiplexers. The multiplexers allow bypassing or including a particular segment during the test application on the automatic test equipment. The optimality criteria for partitioning scan chains into segments, as well as a partitioning algorithm based on this criteria are also introduced.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the accuracy of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) measurements using a <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> protocol after bolus inhalation of 15 O 2. The method of analysis was optimized by investigating potential reuse of myocardial blood flow (MBF), perfusable tissue fraction, and blood and lung spillover factors derived from separate 15 O-water and C 15 O scans. METHODS: Simulations were performed to assess the accuracy and precision of OEF for a variety of models in which different parameters from 15 O-water and C 15 O scans were reused. Reproducibility was assessed in 8 patients who underwent one 10 -min <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> after bolus injection of 1. 1 GBq of 15 O-water, two 10 -min <b>dynamic</b> <b>scans</b> after bolus inhalation of 1. 4 GBq of 15 O 2, and a 6 -min static scan after bolus inhalation of 0. 8 GBq of C 15 O for region-of-interest definition. RESULTS: Simulations showed that accuracy and precision were lowest when all parameters were determined from the 15 O 2 scan. The optimal accuracy and precision of OEF were obtained when fixing MBF, perfusable tissue fraction, and blood spillover to values derived from a 15 O-water scan and estimating spillover from the pulmonary gas volume using an attenuation map. Optimal accuracy and precision were confirmed in the patient study, showing an OEF test-retest variability of 13 % for the whole myocardium. Correction of spillover from pulmonary gas volume requires correction of the lung time-activity curve for pulmonary blood volume, which could equally well be obtained from a 15 O-water rather than C 15 O scan. CONCLUSION: Measurement of OEF is possible using bolus inhalation of 15 O 2 and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>scan</b> protocol, with optimal accuracy and precision when other relevant parameters, such as MBF, are derived from an additional 15 O-water scan...|$|R
40|$|Searchers {{typically}} adopt random-appearing scan patterns when inspecting homogeneous surfaces, {{presumably because}} {{the absence of}} critical features (pattern irregularities and edges) precludes development of systematic and efficient scanning strategies. The present research attempted to determine whether available modeling tools were appropriate for developing optimal scanning aids for homogeneous displays. Three experiments were conducted to test two critical assumptions that underlie existing models of visual scanning. The first experiment tested the assumption that a static visual lobe, obtained in a task in which the eyes remained fixated at a single location, {{was the same as}} a dynamic visual lobe, obtained in a task in which the eyes moved before and after the display presentation. The dynamic lobe was slightly smaller, but no different in shape than the static lobe. The second experiment tested the Independence Model, according to which information acquired in a given fixation cannot be combined with information acquired in a subsequent fixation. Each trial consisted of two tachisoscopic presentations of overlapping portions of the same homogeneous field, controlling target presence on each fixation. Detection performance was compared between conditions on which the target was present on one or two display presentations. The results were consistent with Independence Model. In the third experiment, the Independence Model was tested in a multiple-fixation continuous <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> task. The subjects 2 ̆ 7 unexpected inability to fixate accurately at specified locations precluded a direct test of the Independence Model, however a Static Independence Model was constructed using a single-fixation continuous lobe model to predict target-detection at each fixation within the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> task. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> performance differed systematically from predictions of the Static Independence Model, reflecting an apparent shift in allocation of attentional resources to the center and away from {{the top and bottom of}} the display. The attentional shift was embodied in a Dynamic Independence Model which better predicted <b>dynamic</b> <b>scanning</b> performance. Although there was considerable individual variation, the results suggest the requirement to fixate at specified locations may have interfered with target-detection performance at certain target locations. Implications for the development of optimal scanning aids for homogeneous display were discussed. ...|$|E
