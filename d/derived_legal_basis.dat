40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} extraterritorial {{application of}} acquis communautaire on merger control. The {{aim of this}} work is to take down current state of development of law in this area, identify actual questions and problems and introduce methods that could possibly solve those problems. The introductory chapter defines the theme and goals of this work and deals with resources used. The second chapter explains the European legal regulation system of merger control. Council Regulation (EC) No 139 / 2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings holds {{a central role in}} this system. European Commission is a competition authority of European Communities and in order to protect competition on common market it proceeds also against companies that operate outside European territory. The third chapter explores the ways how European Commission <b>derives</b> a <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> of such extraterritorial jurisdiction. The most appropriate means of jurisdictional derivation regarding merger control appears to be an effects doctrine. Next chapter identifies problems connected with extraterritorial application of European competition law, such as conflict of jurisdictions, limits of national competition laws, multijurisdictional merger thicket, substantial differences in laws and different market [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Copyright law and {{intellectual}} property rights have {{been the focus of}} many news stories over the last decade. Rapid change in the publish-ing and communication industries is leading to a rethinking of the current copyright law and renewed consideration of the original intent of copyright law. The ease of copying and file sharing via the Web makes copyright protection difficult in a web-based culture of free and open access. Innovative, collaborative environments offer a new form of copyright that encourages sharing while providing some protections to authors. Even as these innova-tions are gaining momentum, projects like the Google Print Library Project keep copyright front and center in the news. Here’s a look back at the origins of copyright, with a snapshot of what is happening now. HOW HAS COPYRIGHT EVOLVED? While we don’t know what ancient scholars would have thought about copyright, it is probably safe to assume that plagiarism was frowned upon. In any case, until the inven-tion of the printing press, the copying and distribution of creative works was difficult. The Statute of Anne in England is thought to be the first copyright law. The statute was printed in 1710 and provided for the protec-tion of authors from the republishing and reprinting of their works by booksellers. Prior to this statute, publishing in England was largely in the hands of booksellers or station-ers who had been empowered in 1557 by the Crown to destroy books with seditious or heretical content. In the United States, copyright <b>derives</b> its <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> from the US Constitution, Article I...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to cross-pillar litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|R
