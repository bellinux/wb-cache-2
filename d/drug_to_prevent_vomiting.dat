50|$|Reliability of {{the drugs}} method highly depends on chosen drugs and {{additional}} measures {{such as the use}} of antiemetics <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>vomiting.</b> Average fatality rate for overdoses in the U.S. is estimated to be only 1.8%. At the same time, assisted suicide group Dignitas reported no single failure among 840 cases (fatality rate 100%), where an overdose of pentobarbital, the active agent in former hypnotic medication Nembutal, was used in combination with antiemetic drugs.|$|R
5000|$|Because no {{currently}} available antiemetic is especially effective by itself, and successful control is often elusive, experts recommend a multimodal approach. Anaesthetic strategies <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>vomiting</b> include using regional anaesthesia wherever possible and avoiding medications that cause vomiting. Medications <b>to</b> treat and <b>prevent</b> postoperative nausea and vomiting {{is limited by}} both cost and the adverse effects. People with risk factors probably warrant preventative medication, whereas a [...] "wait and see" [...] strategy is appropriate for those without risk factors.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} for patients not to eat or drink for up to 12 hours before the procedure. This is <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>vomiting,</b> which can result in aspiration, and also cause severe bleeding from the insertion site of the catheter. Failure to follow this simple preparation may result in dangerous consequences. In general, small amounts of water can be consumed up to 2 hours before the exam. Patients should try to schedule the exam {{at a time when}} they will be having symptoms and will not need to drive for 2 to 3 days.|$|R
25|$|A {{single dose}} of the {{corticosteroid}} drug dexamethasone may be given during surgery <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> post-operative <b>vomiting.</b> A systematic review found that a dose of dexamethasone during surgery can <b>prevent</b> <b>vomiting</b> in {{one out of every}} five children who receives the drug.

Ondansetron has recently been studied as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy in treatment of acute gastroenteritis with mild to moderate dehydration.

25|$|In 1997, {{ondansetron}} was {{the subject}} of a meta-analysis case study published in the British Medical Journal. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 patients receiving ondansetron, published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous ondansetron 4mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>vomiting</b> within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron's antiemetic efficacy.|$|R

Most of the book does consist of these color plates, and at the bottom of each page are the scientific (genus and species) names. The Latin words encountered form a fitting counterpoint to the fascination of the photographs. If a living being happens to belong to a notorious genus, that name appears as a bold entry in the Webster dictionaries. Butterflies do not fare very well in this regard, but their genus names ought to be as deserving as those of mammals or plants used for human food...|$|R
