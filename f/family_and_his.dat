He had at least five siblings: two {{brothers}} and three sisters.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was born}} on April 5, 1900, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was the second son of Caroline (née Brown; 1874–1942) and John Edward Tracy (1873–1928), a truck salesman.

5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.|$|E
5|$|Dennie {{was born}} on August 30, 1768, in Boston, Massachusetts to Joseph Dennie, {{a member of a}} well-to-do {{merchant}} <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife Mary Green, whose father was Bartholomew Green, Jr. The Greens were a prominent printing family in colonial America; the progenitor of the family, Samuel Green, emigrated from England with John Winthrop {{and was one of the}} first printers in the colonies. Having moved to Lexington at the age of seven, Dennie returned to Boston in 1783 to study bookkeeping and later clerk in a counting house. He began preparing to enter Harvard College in 1785, under the guidance of Reverend Samuel West. West had a significant impact on Dennie, fostering his pupil's interest in literature, as well as instilling in Dennie a decidedly pro-British mindset.|$|E
5|$|His {{young son}} {{came to the}} throne as James III, {{resulting}} in another minority, with Robert, Lord Boyd emerging {{as the most important}} figure. In 1468 James married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. In 1469 the King asserted his control, executing members of the Boyd <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brothers, Alexander, Duke of Albany and John, Earl of Mar, resulting in Albany leading an English backed invasion and becoming effective ruler. The English retreated, having taken Berwick for the last time in 1482, and James was able to regain power. However, the King managed to alienate the barons, former supporters, his wife and his son James. He was defeated at the Battle of Sauchieburn and killed in 1488.|$|E

50|$|Hermann Möller (13 January 1850 in Hjerpsted, Denmark - 5 October 1923 in Copenhagen) was a Danish {{linguist}} {{noted for}} his work in favor of a genetic relationship between the Indo-European <b>and</b> Semitic language <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> version of the laryngeal theory.|$|R
50|$|Prince Vasily Vasilyevich Golitsyn (Василий Васильевич Голицын; 1643-1714) was a Russian aristocrat and statesman of the 17th century.

5|$|In November 2016, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin {{published}} and brand new {{and up to}} date book, with the foreword written {{by a member of}} Joseph Merrick's family - 'Joseph: The Life, Times and Places of the Elephant Man'. Peeling back the layers of myth, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin has looked into the early life of Merrick and his family in her hometown of Leicester, and presents for the first time, detailed information about Josephs <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> burning ambition to be self-sufficient rather than survive on the charity of others.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Eddie Gottlieb {{sold the}} Warriors {{franchise}} for $850,000 (equal to about $ today) {{to a group}} of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco, and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach, Bob Feerick. This also meant, however, that the team broke apart, as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> job at IBM in Philadelphia, and Tom Gola was homesick, requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season. With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year. Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Richard von Weizsäcker {{was born}} on 15 April 1920 in the New Castle in Stuttgart, the son of diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker, {{a member of the}} noted Weizsäcker <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife Marianne (née von Graevenitz). Ernst von Weizsäcker was a career diplomat and a {{high-ranking}} official in the Foreign Ministry in the 1930s. The youngest of four children, Weizsäcker had two brothers, the physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Heinrich von Weizsäcker, and also a sister, Elisabeth. In 1967, Elisabeth married Konrad Raiser, the former Secretary General of the World Council of Churches. His grandfather Karl von Weizsäcker was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Württemberg, and was ennobled in 1897 and raised to the hereditary title of Baron (Freiherr) in 1916.|$|E

5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> initials are over the fireplace. The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys {{and there are two}} wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|A {{new era of}} castle {{construction}} {{began when}} the daimyo Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle from 1576 to 1579. Earlier fortifications of the Kamakura and Muromachi periods were crude large scale structures; Azuchi, however, with rich ornamentation and a keep rising seven stories high, became the prototype for castle construction of the period. The style of Azuchi Castle marked {{a shift in the}} function of the castles from a place that was merely a fortress and military garrison to a political, cultural and economic center. The newer style castles functioned as home to the daimyo, his <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> most loyal retainers. Because of the expense of building such a lavish structure, castles in the style of Azuchi, functioned also to highlight the power and prestige of the daimyo. These new castles were built of wood and plaster on a stone foundation. Generally the main keep or tenshu was positioned at the highest point, surrounded by a series of interlocking baileys with walls, small towers and pathways. Residential buildings were located in one of the outer circles. The daimyo conducted his business in the citadel.|$|E
5|$|As his musings {{developed}} {{along these}} lines, Hazlitt continued to contribute miscellaneous articles to various periodicals. In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; and he felt that he could write it. His writing career was now moving in this direction (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E
25|$|After his death, Buddha's {{cremation}} relics {{were divided}} amongst 8 royal <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> disciples; centuries later {{they would be}} enshrined by King Ashoka into 84,000 stupas.

5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers {{was more interested in}} the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able to}} retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Barbera {{was born}} at 10 Delancey Street in the Little Italy (Lower East Side) section of Manhattan, New York, to {{immigrants}} Vincent Barbera (of Lebanese origin) and Francesca Calvacca, born in Sciacca, Agrigento, Sicily, Italy, and he grew up speaking Italian. His family moved to Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York when he was four months old. He had two younger brothers, Larry and Ted, both of whom served in World War II. As {{a member of the}} United States Army, Larry participated in the invasion of Sicily. Ted was a fighter pilot with the United States Army Air Forces and served in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. Barbera's father, Vincent, was the prosperous owner of three barbershops who squandered the family fortunes on gambling. By the time Barbera was 15, his father had abandoned the <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> maternal uncle Jim became a father figure to him.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{frustrating}} for the midfielder, who was sidelined {{for two months}} by knee and head injuries and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli match fixing scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus' relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, many stars (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players' future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing his <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> commitment to the club as reasons for his decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club {{until the end of}} the season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.|$|E

5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake chase The Lich through a {{dimensional}} portal where they meet Prismo, a wish granter, who tells them that the Lich wished for the extinction of all life. This leads Finn to wish that the Lich had never existed. Finn is then transported to an alternate timeline, {{where he is a}} normal human living with his <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dog, Jake, on a farm. In the alternate reality, Finn discovers a magical ice crown, which he attempts to use to repay his family's debt. After placing it on his head, he is magically imbued with power over ice and snow. Prismo tells Jake that if he can change The Lich's original wish, everything will go back to normal. Jake—with help from Prismo—eventually wishes that the Lich had actually desired for Finn and Jake to return home. Thus, the world is righted again.|$|E
5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized as not only a surrogate son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created to supplant Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be a surrogate son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, he crosses a moral boundary that other androids stay within. The contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E
