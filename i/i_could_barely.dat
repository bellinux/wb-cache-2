I didn't quite register it right. It was as if I had forgotten it was a comedy since the shoot. I got all embarrassed because I'd never really had such a positive response before." ...|$|E
500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> hear myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E

6000|$|I fancy this gloomy ramble {{is caused}} by a twinge of age; I put on an under-shirt {{yesterday}} (it was the only one <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find) that <b>barely</b> came under my trousers; and just below it, a fine healthy rheumatism has now settled like a fire in my hip. From such small causes do these valuable considerations flow! ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{set down}} again, a-shaking all over, {{and got out}} my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees --something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> hear a [...] "me-yow! me-yow!" [...] down there. That was good! Says I, [...] "me-yow! me-yow!" [...] as soft as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and then <b>I</b> put out the light and {{scrambled}} {{out of the window}} on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.|$|R
500|$|The HIV storyline {{came to an}} end {{on-screen}} in 2003, when {{executive producer}} Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E
500|$|... "Yours" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} six minutes and thirty-nine seconds. It is set in common time in the key of F major and has a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Chapman's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of C4 to the high note of G5. The radio edit of the song has a length of four minutes and fifty seconds and {{contains}} a new verse (I’ve walked the valley of death’s shadow/So deep and dark that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> breathe/I’ve had {{to let go of}} more than I could bear/And questioned everything that I believe/But still even here/in this great darkness/A comfort and hope come breaking through/As I can say in life or death/God we belong to you) which Chapman wrote in the weeks following the death of his daughter Maria, who had died on May 21, 2008 after having been accidentally hit by a car driven by her brother. Lyrically, the song describes the omnipotence of God and how [...] "God owns everything and is ever present in every place".|$|E
500|$|Test {{pilot and}} naval aviator Captain Eric Brown {{evaluated}} the first prototype and found [...] "the controls in cruising flight were very heavy and, in fact, lateral control was so solid that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> move the ailerons {{with one hand}} at [...]" [...] In bad weather a pilot circling a carrier while waiting to land would {{have been forced to}} fly such a wide circuit that he could not always keep the carrier in sight. The later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and artificial feel to the stick from a spring, as an interim measure but Brown found [...] "the second prototype was much less the pleasant aircraft to fly as the stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed." [...] The Spearfish lacked any sort of stall warning, which would have been a problem in operational use as the stall and approach speeds were fairly close. For the landing, the aircraft proved quite docile.|$|E
60|$|The Crimean war {{had just}} broken out. Of course {{there had to}} be a war, I said to myself: we couldn't have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out. I waited for the earthquake. It came. And it made me reel when it did come. He was {{actually}} gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment! Better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain--think of it! I thought my hair would turn white.|$|R

60|$|The side of {{the ship}} made an opaque belt of shadow on the darkling glassy shimmer of the sea. But I saw at once {{something}} elongated and pale floating very close to the ladder. Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> form a guess a faint flash of phosphorescent light, which seemed to issue suddenly from the naked body of a man, flickered in the sleeping water with the elusive, silent play of summer lightning in a night sky. With a gasp I saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet, the long legs, a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a greenish cadaverous glow. One hand, awash, clutched the bottom rung of the ladder. He was complete but for the head. A headless corpse! The cigar dropped out of my gaping mouth with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in the absolute stillness of all things under heaven. At that I suppose he raised up his face, a dimly pale oval {{in the shadow of the}} ship's side. But even then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>barely</b> make out down there the shape of his black-haired head. However, it was enough for the horrid, frost-bound sensation which had gripped me about the chest to pass off. The moment of vain exclamations was past, too. I only climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside.|$|R
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{commented that}} this episode {{might have been}} the [...] "best Tracy [...] episode of the season" [...] {{explaining}} that Tracy Morgan [...] "delivered one genius non sequitur after another describing the comically over-the-top horrors of his childhood. [...] The insane, eminently quotable one-liners were flying so fast and so furious that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> keep up with them." [...] In regards to Jack's love triangle, Rabin opined that this arc [...] "could easily have worn out its welcome long ago" [...] but that Alec Baldwin, Julianne Moore, and Elizabeth Banks [...] "have kept lively and vibrant." [...] In conclusion, he gave it an A− grade rating. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive about Liz getting engaged, noting that she has become a woman, and concluded that [...] "it will no doubt be one of television's most memorable weddings" [...] if Liz and Wesley get married. Nick Catucci of New York magazine said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was good, [...] "aybe the best episode ever." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel said that Banks played her role [...] "perfectly", but that he was still not convinced that Sheen's Wesley is the right man for Liz.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's profile {{continued}} to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack– a lonely limousine driver looking for love– after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that [...] "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> {{remember what it was}} about as I left", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as [...] "heavy handed" [...] and [...] "predictable", but [...] "intriguing and at least partially successful".|$|E

I just {{had to look at}} it again with my lawyer and <b>I</b> <b>barely</b> <b>could</b> get through it. It's about the last four years, when I was in mental institutions, rehabs, hurting myself, being in the hospital. It just starts to show how a successful guy and self-made man has everything go down the toilet because of a drug habit. It's the only thing standing between him being multi-multimillionaire. But I'm off the drugs now. Now it's just eating." ...|$|R
6000|$|WELL, I catched {{my breath}} and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd GOT to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too--seemed a week before {{we got to the}} stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't hardly any {{strength}} left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|As for Nora, being thus thrown {{unexpectedly}} {{into the}} dangerous society of that gruesome animal, the Oriel undergraduate, I think I may venture to say (from my subsequent experience) {{that she was}} not wholly disposed to regard the creature as either so objectionable or so ferocious as she had been previously led to imagine. We got on together so well that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the Professor growing visibly wrathful about the corners of the mouth: {{and by the time we}} reached the barges, he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> be civil enough to say Good morning to me when we parted.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Manson {{announced}} she was stepping away from music, claiming she got {{sick of the}} music industry's new practices and had found more excitement in acting. Manson said she thought about abandoning the music business as soon as 2008, when her mother developed dementia, and later died, saying that [...] "I didn't want to make music, didn't feel creative. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] at their son's memorial. According to Manson, [...] "we were all in so much pain, but it {{meant so much to}} them that I could sing that song and so much to me that I was able to do something. It made me realise how much music sustains people. I don't know why I'd turned my back on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shoop played Nurse Karen Bailey, who is scalded {{to death}} by Myers in the {{hospital}} therapy tub. Featured in the only nude scene in the film, Shoop discussed filming the scene in an interview: [...] "Now that was hard! The water was freezing cold, and poor Leo Rossi and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> keep our teeth from chattering! The water was also pretty dirty and I ended up with an ear infection." [...] Gifford and Alicia played minor supporting roles as head nurse Mrs. Virginia Alves and orderly Janet Marshall. Actor Lance Guest played an EMS driver, Jimmy [...] The Last Starfighter director Nick Castle stated in an interview, [...] "When I {{was assigned to the}} film, Lance Guest was the first name I wrote down on my list for Alex after seeing him in Halloween II." [...] Castle adds, [...] "He possessed all the qualities I wanted the character to express on the screen, a kind of innocence, shyness, yet determination." [...] Future Saturday Night Live and Wayne's World star Dana Carvey also appears briefly in a non-speaking role, wearing a blue baseball cap and receiving instructions from the TV reporter.|$|E
2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
