2500|$|Klebold {{walked down}} the steps toward the cafeteria. He came up to Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, [...] "Sure. I'll help you," [...] then shot Kirklin in the face, {{critically}} wounding him. Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when Klebold and Harris' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had crawled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of the cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. Klebold shot Rohrbough, who was already fatally wounded by the shots previously fired by Harris, at close range through the upper left chest and then stepped over the injured Sean Graves to enter the cafeteria. Officials speculated that Klebold went to the cafeteria {{to check on the}} propane bombs. Harris shot down the steps at several students sitting near the cafeteria's entrance, severely wounding and partially paralyzing 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris.|$|E
6000|$|The woman hesitated uncertainly. Gross stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> [...] "All right, mother. This is war time. We can't {{stand out}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. Sowerby?" [...] said Miss Dunstable, walking almost <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> {{to welcome}} him. [...] "Better late than never." ...|$|E
50|$|Sound Transit {{measures}} ridership {{by using}} the infrared sensors built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along, you old savage," [...] said Ian, with a good-humoured nod; [...] "I {{want your}} help. Go round {{to the front}} and shove <b>into</b> <b>the</b> passage. <b>The</b> <b>doorway's</b> wide enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A view of {{the open}} hall looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>doorway</b> to <b>the</b> close hall ...|$|R
60|$|Of course Del Torre {{was too far}} off to {{hear this}} exhortation. Lilly also waved to him--and watched him pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> far below.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the trouble?" [...] asked Will Dicks, and {{his father}} stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> {{to hear what the}} young bridge tender might have to say.|$|E
60|$|With {{shouts of}} fury the crowd rushed {{up just as}} the door opened. Edgar and Albert stepped back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> while the girl ran upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, in there!" [...] cried Whopper, poking {{his head}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> small <b>doorway.</b> He could not see, for the cabin inside was dark.|$|R
5000|$|Letter [...] "A" [...] carvings were eminent {{within the}} house, {{specifically}} {{at the entrance}} porch and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> of each bedrooms inside the living room. Circular amulets of St. Benedict could also be noticed at each doors, windows, and eaves of the house. The house was 2nd Transition, Post 1860s, Bahay na Bato, wherein the ground floor was made out of masonry, second floor was made out of wood, and the roofing is in galvanizes iron sheet, with very thick gauge.|$|R
60|$|The senator’s son struck one of {{the matches}} and held it aloft. By its faint rays the boys {{were able to see}} some {{distance}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workshop <b>into</b> which <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> opened. Only machines and work-benches met their gaze. On a nail hung a lantern.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{had been}} {{thinking}} all the afternoon that he was better, and I had gone down to dinner cheered. I turned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> and told Fulk to come and see.|$|E
6000|$|... "Silencio!" [...] roared {{one of the}} guards, {{and poked}} his rifle end <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> [...] "I will shoot the first {{prisoner}} who dares to speak again!" [...] he added in Spanish.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{contemplated}} the wretched animal, that moved {{no more than}} an effigy: it sat with ears pricked and its sharp muzzle pointed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> and suddenly snapped at a fly like a piece of mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{confines}} of the irregular site, the various functions of the Khanqah were interwoven into an architecturally rich building complex. The elegant facade has an imposing arched entrance that projects <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> is set back in a marble recess covered with a hood of stalactites. A block of pharaonic stone engraved with hieroglyphics was used for the doorsill.|$|R
50|$|Ro-langs {{are unable}} to bend at the waist; to exploit this weakness, many {{buildings}} in early Tibetan architecture were built with very low door frames. The belief was that the Ro-lang, unable to bend, would simply run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> low <b>doorway,</b> and be unable to enter the building.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{so excited}} I {{did not see the}} danger of the {{swordfish}} coming aboard. But Captain Dan did. He swept <b>the</b> girls back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cabin <b>doorway,</b> and pushed Mrs. R. C. into a back corner of the cockpit. Strange it seemed to me how pale Dan was! ...|$|R
60|$|As he neared Wood Street {{two men who}} {{had been}} {{watching}} his approach stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of a saloon, and as he passed they stepped out again behind him. One upon either side they seized him.|$|E
6000|$|Doubtfully HAYWOOD goes. And MALISE stands {{scratching}} his head; [...] then slipping the bill {{into one of}} the volumes to remind him, he [...] replaces them {{at the top of the}} pile. The Boy again advances [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{while this}} little company went homewards a sound {{arose in the}} quiet street as of people running. Instantly {{all three of them}} pressed {{themselves}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of a house and crouched down. Martin lifted his ear and listened.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the battle}} that follows, Tambor opens a portal known as <b>the</b> <b>Doorway</b> of Death, a way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> limbo, as Groan distracts Diek. Unfortunately, Diek manages to push Tambor {{into his own}} Doorway, and as a furious Groan hurls Diek bodily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> portal, <b>the</b> <b>Doorway</b> of Death closes, sealing their fates. Meanwhile, as Jimmy and Gordo manage to free the {{children}} from their prison, Stump falls into a hole and disappears.|$|R
60|$|And time sped on. From {{the towers}} of the cathedral came booming the hour of nine. The shadows in the narrow street were long and dark, only a pale thin reflex of the cold light of <b>the</b> moon struck <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open <b>doorway</b> and <b>the</b> white corridor, and {{detached}} de Marmont's pale face from the surrounding gloom.|$|R
60|$|As I took {{a parting}} look at First Witch in turning away, the red marks round her {{eyes seemed to}} have already grown larger, and she hungrily and thirstily looked out beyond me <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>doorway,</b> to see if Jack was there. For, Jack came even here, and the {{mistress}} had got into jail through deluding Jack.|$|R
6000|$|As Mr. Snagsby blows {{his nose}} and coughs his cough of sympathy, a step is heard without. Mr. Bucket throws his light <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and says to Mr. Snagsby, [...] "Now, {{what do you say}} to Toughy? Will HE do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Eustace jumped, and {{instantly}} bought {{a copy of}} the paper, stepping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of a shop where they sold masonic jewels of every size and hue, in order to read it. The very first thing that his eye fell on was an editorial paragraph.|$|E
60|$|To {{think was}} to act. No sooner had the {{policeman}} jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> than I dodged {{through the crowd}} and hurried across the street. Reaching the opposite side, I ran into an alley. It was long and led directly into the back garden of a handsome stone mansion.|$|E
60|$|Led by Mr. Pike and {{watching}} our chance between seas, we searched {{the deck and}} rails between the forecastle-head and the for'ard-house and found no devils. <b>The</b> mate stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forecastle <b>doorway,</b> and his light-stick cut like a dagger through the dim illumination of the murky sea-lamp. And we saw the devils. Nosey Murphy had been right. There were three of them.|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen in}} which he cooked and slept had no other {{entrance}} save that <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> courtyard being closed by a heap of fallen stones from above. Two or three narrow slits in the wall allowed light and air to enter. Malcolm saw that escape at night, after {{he had once been}} shut in, was impossible, and that in the daytime he could not pass out by the gate; for even if by a sudden surprise he overpowered the sentry there, he would be met {{at the bottom of the}} path by the two men who were always stationed as guards to the horses, and to give notice of the approach of strangers.|$|R
60|$|People rushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{street to}} get out of the way of the cowboys. Others stared and made gestures. Booted men on the porch of the Yellow Mine stamped noisily as they trooped to get inside. Voices of alarm and mirth rang out. Pan took only a {{fleeting}} glance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wide <b>doorway.</b> He saw nothing, thought nothing. His stride quickened as he passed Black's store, where more men crowded to get inside.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little boy}} and girl had now crowded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> {{on either side of}} their mother, {{clinging}} to her skirts while they [...] "made faces" [...] at the Americans. Clarette turned to drive the children away and in the act allowed Patsy and Ajo to glance past her into the hut.|$|E
6000|$|... [He {{bends over}} WELLWYN's hand; then, {{with a bow}} to ANN goes [...] out; his tattered figure can be seen through the window, [...] passing in the wind. WELLWYN {{turns back to the}} fire. The [...] figure of TIMSON {{advances}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> no longer holding [...] in either hand a waterproof leg-piece.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I!" [...] {{said another}} voice. There was Reddy Fox {{grinning}} at them. Johnny Chuck dove <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> {{of his house}} with Peter Rabbit at his heels, for there was nowhere else to go. Jimmy Skunk just stood still and chuckled. He knew that Reddy Fox didn't dare touch him.|$|E
6000|$|Snagsby's {{confusion}} increased. He {{seemed to}} be wanting to keep {{his face to the}} visitors {{and at the same time}} glance over his shoulder. [...] "I will," [...] he considered, [...] "I will enquire, my lady." [...] He backed a little, and seemed inclined to close the door upon them. Lady Beach-Mandarin was too quick for him. She got herself well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open <b>doorway.</b> [...] "And of whom are you going to enquire?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{third day}} after the {{incubator}} ceremony we set forth toward home, but scarcely had the head of <b>the</b> procession debouched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open ground before the city than orders were given for an immediate and hasty return. As though trained for years in this particular evolution, the green Martians melted like mist <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spacious <b>doorways</b> of <b>the</b> nearby buildings, until, {{in less than three}} minutes, the entire cavalcade of chariots, mastodons and mounted warriors was nowhere to be seen.|$|R
50|$|Shin married Kim Kyung-mi (Linda Kim), a Korean-American woman 12 {{years his}} junior at the Grand Hyatt Seoul on May 26, 2013. His wife is {{studying}} for a doctorate in music in the United States, and Shin related on his show Entertainment Weekly that he bumped <b>into</b> her in <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of a building {{and fell in love}} at first sight.|$|R
