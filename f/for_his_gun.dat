5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape {{who was able to}} provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man {{was the one who had}} killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E
25|$|Nahom Tsegazab {{was shot}} in the right biceps and abdomen. He fell to {{the ground in front of}} 207Danzig Street and reached <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> {{recklessly}} firing eleven rounds at Owusu, who retreated through the crowd. One of these bullets struck Owusu in the leg.|$|E
50|$|Reinhard {{was known}} not only <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns,</b> but also <b>for</b> <b>his</b> ability to shoot them. He {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} shooters in his area and also won many national competitions, including the 1877 National Shoot. He also only used <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> in <b>his</b> contests. He would never use a gun in a competition unless he had made it himself.|$|R
60|$|That done {{he resumed}} his march, but the weather retarded him more and more. The heavy and {{continuous}} rains had reduced the roads {{to such a}} condition that his artillery fell behind, and he was compelled to call a halt once more, at Deruta, and wait there four days <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> to overtake him.|$|R
50|$|Mugsy announces Rocky's {{entertainment}} just as Bugs {{pops out}} of the cake, disguised as a flapper. During the entertainment, Mugsy, distracted by Bugs' disguise, nudges Rocky so he falls over, making Rocky punch him up the jaw. Just as Rocky comes up to Bugs {{to tell him he}} loves him, Bugs kicks Rocky up the jaw, making him drop <b>his</b> <b>guns.</b> The third kick has Rocky so deep under his hat that he has to feel the floor <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> and fire aimlessly.|$|R
25|$|On {{the same}} day or the next day, Abu Sakkar, an al-Nusra Front {{commander}} infamous for eating a dead Syrian soldier's heart {{when he was the}} commander of the Farouq Brigades in 2013, was stopped at an Ahrar ash-Sham checkpoint while driving on the road between the towns of Salqin and Harem. The Ahrar fighters attempted to arrest him when he resisted arrest and drove away toward Harem, resulting in a pursuit by the Ahrar militants. Upon reaching the town, Abu Sakkar attempted to reach <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> and was fatally shot by his pursuers.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the blind}} lady points Manni towards the {{homeless}} {{man with his}} money, who passes on the cyclist's bike. Manni chases him with a gun, inadvertently causing a head-on collision between the white BMW, Mr. Meier, {{and the man who}} stole Lola's moped. Mr. Meier, Lola's dad and the thief apparently die in the crash. Manni manages to retrieve his money, trading it <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b> Lola reaches the supermarket, but cannot find Manni. She shouts his name but there is no response. A little farther away, a car pulls up with Manni and Ronnie inside, who shake hands. Manni, no longer in need of the 100,000 marks, asks Lola what is in the bag she is carrying, only for the film to end in a freeze-frame on Lola's reaction.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} this episode is a play on the name of 1970s {{television}} series The Partridge Family. The end music is the theme to the 1960s series The Avengers, and the song playing when Homer is sitting and watching things go by while he is waiting five days <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> is [...] "The Waiting" [...] by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Petty rarely let his music be used on television, but being a fan of The Simpsons, he allowed them to use it.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{photographs}} of B.E.2ds supplied to Belgium {{make it clear}} that not only were these re-engined with Hispano engines, but {{at least some of them}} had the pilot and observer's seating positions reversed, giving the latter a much better field of fire <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun(s).</b> At least some Belgian B.E.2cs were similarly modified, at least one even being fitted with a Scarff ring over the rear cockpit.|$|R
25|$|He {{depended}} {{on the east coast}} trade <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> and gunpowder, which passed through the territory of his rivals, making supplies expensive and unreliable. Instead he turned to the west coast, sending his nephew Molenga to the Ovimbundu and Portuguese traders around Benguela in Angola, and a trader there called Coimbra became his supplier. The Luba people to his north-west had controlled the west coast trade, but Msiri took it over and halted their southwards expansion.|$|R
60|$|Even now he did {{not feel}} safe, though rejoined by a large number of convalescents; and, drawing rations <b>for</b> <b>his</b> troops from the stores of the citadel, he retired with the army to Salamanca. Having reorganized his force, {{procured}} fresh horses <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns,</b> and rested the troops for a few days; Massena advanced to cover Ciudad Rodrigo, and to raise the siege of Almeida--which Wellington had begun without loss of time--and, with upwards of 50,000 men, Massena attacked the British at Fuentes d'Onoro.|$|R
500|$|Fourteen {{cameras were}} used to film the Palio di Siena footage, which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using {{helicopters}} were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence [...] "involving either people or animals." [...] To shoot the foot chase in Siena in April 2008 four camera cranes {{were built in the}} town, and a cable camera was also used. Framestore worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000 strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into. The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.|$|E
500|$|Opening {{with the}} {{disclaimer}} [...] "No mythological creatures were harmed {{in the making}} of this video", Kesha appears sitting next to two unicorns pouring champagne while having a conversation on how she was elected to the parliament of Uzbekistan, [...] "So I grabbed the bear by the throat and I looked him right in the eyes, and I said, 'Bear, you have till the count of zero to put some pants on and apologize to the president.'" [...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra. The music fades in the background as the two then {{make their way to the}} center of the dance floor and exchange words ("Well, well, well. If it isnâ€™t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't appreciate you slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", as she sits with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} claimed Vanzetti's [...]38 revolver {{had originally}} {{belonged to the}} slain Berardelli, {{and that it had}} been taken from his body during the robbery. No one testified to seeing anyone take the gun, but Berardelli had an empty holster and no gun on him when he was found. Additionally, witnesses to the payroll shooting had described Berardelli as reaching <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> on his hip when he was cut down by pistol fire from the robbers.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know much}} about the upper story, so I spare you that. Emily had a hankering for one of the pretty old mullioned-windowed rooms-- the mullion chambers, as she named them; but Griff pounced on them at once, the inner <b>for</b> <b>his</b> repose, the outer <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> and <b>his</b> studies--not smoking, <b>for</b> young men were never {{permitted}} to smoke within doors, nor indeed in any home society. The choice of the son and heir was undisputed, and he proceeded to settle his possessions in his new domains, where they made an imposing appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not till Sebastian came <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns,</b> and John Collins played him {{the same}} dog's tricks as he'd played me with my ironwork. Week in, week out, two of three serpentines would be flawed in the casting, and only fit, they said, to be re-melted. Then John Collins would shake his head, and vow he could pass no cannon for the King's service that were not perfect. Saints! How Sebastian stormed! I know, for we sat on this bench sharing our sorrows inter-common.|$|R
50|$|The raid was {{supposed}} to destroy a bridge over a Fjord but was unsuccessful {{when one of the}} Norwegians dropped the magazine <b>for</b> <b>his</b> machine <b>gun,</b> alerting the German guards.|$|R
2500|$|While {{awaiting}} {{his trial}} date, Short {{was free to}} come and go as he pleased. He was feeling well enough by May 21, 1891 to board a train for Chicago with Johnson. This {{was going to be an}} extensive stay, as his wife accompanied Short on the trip. The racing season was about to begin and Johnson and Short both owned a string of horses that would be running at Washington Park in Chicago. During his several visits to Chicago, Short and Hattie always stayed at the Leland Hotel. Short was accosted in the lobby of the Leland by a drunken attorney named James J. Singleton during late October 1891. According to the report, Short did not have his pistol, but managed to give Singleton a few kicks which knocked him down, and then Short picked him up, and pushed him out [...] "into the frosty night air." [...] Short then went upstairs <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> in case Singleton decided to return. While Short was gone, an actor named William F. Hoey (1854â€“1897) walked into the hotel lobby. The actor turned out to resemble closely the lawyer Short had just kicked out. Short saw Hoey, thought he was Singleton, and charged at him with his pistol. A quick-thinking hotel clerk named Ed Kennedy jumped between the two men and prevented a homicide. When Short realized his mistake, he apologized to the actor and treated him to drinks and a late supper.|$|E
60|$|Then Beasley, with desperate, frantic action, jerked <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
60|$|Kells made a {{movement}} {{as if to}} go <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b> But it failed. His hand was a shaking leaf.|$|E
60|$|Berruyer {{saw that}} the {{position}} was a formidable one and, ignorant {{of the number of}} the defenders, sent back <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns,</b> and contented himself for the time by clearing the rest of the town of its defenders. These, however, as they issued out, were rallied by Cathelineau and his officers. They assured the peasants that the day was not yet lost, that the church would hold out for hours, and that d'Elbee would soon arrive, with his force from Chollet, to their assistance.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{seemingly}} modest credentials, Bolle set {{his mark}} upon the squadron. The Fokker Dr.I triplane supplied was a plane of limited speed but great maneuverability and climb rate. Its slower speed {{made it more}} difficult to close to short distance for gunnery against faster fighters. Bolle's solution was the use of an Oigee telescopic sight <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns.</b> He also painted distinctive white stripes on his upper wings, to denote his leadership role, along with a yellow fuselage band edged by black and white to honor his old cavalry regiment.|$|R
60|$|Darry Nodley hesitated {{and thought}} at first to feel <b>for</b> <b>his</b> own <b>gun.</b> But then he changed his mind. He saw that Chet was {{thoroughly}} aroused, and saw, too, that Jack Blowfen was coming up.|$|R
60|$|At {{this instant}} Dan Baxter leaped {{to his feet}} and ran <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun,</b> while Bill Harney and Lemuel Husty did the same.|$|E
60|$|Presently Steele stopped. Andrews rose {{right in}} front of the Ranger, and there, like the madman he was, he went <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Dave and Roger. Both were {{sleeping}} so peacefully Phil hated to disturb them. He reached <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> {{and looked out}} again.|$|E
60|$|Dave {{uttered the}} cry loudly, {{and on the}} instant Barringford leaped to <b>his</b> feet, {{reaching}} <b>for</b> <b>his</b> ever-ready <b>gun</b> as he did so. The Dutch trapper was also awake in short order, and Henry followed.|$|R
25|$|Preparations were {{completed}} by April 23, {{and on that}} day General Burnside communicated directly with Colonel White and repeated <b>his</b> demand <b>for</b> surrender, again offering to release the prisoners on parole. Colonel White once more refused, so Burnside on April 24 ordered General Parke to begin the bombardment as soon as possible. Parke waited until nightfall to open the embrasures <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> behind the dunes. The bombardment began at dawn on April 25. At first, the gunners in the fort manned their pieces and replied vigorously, but {{they were unable to}} inflict damage on the Federal guns protected by the dunes.|$|R
5000|$|Schuyler's tactics {{required}} Burgoyne {{to build}} a road through the wilderness <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> and troops, a task that took about two weeks. They moved out of Skenesboro on July 24, and reached Fort Edward on July 29, finding that Schuyler had already abandoned it, in a retreat that ended at Stillwater, New York. [...] Before he left Skenesboro, Burgoyne was joined by about 500 Indians (mostly Ottawas, but also Fox, Mississauga, Chippewa, and Ojibwe, as well {{as members of the}} Iroquois) from the Great Lakes region under the leadership of St. Luc de la Corne and Charles Michel de Langlade.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who was that?" [...] demanded Snap as, in the darkness, he felt <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b> The {{fire was}} {{practically}} out, and the hollow was intensely gloomy.|$|E
60|$|Lawson howled like a dog. With barbarous and insane fury, with sheer {{impotent}} folly, {{he swept}} a clawing hand <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>gun.</b> Duane's shot broke his action.|$|E

50|$|On 25 March 1918 at Ervillers, France, Lance-Corporal Cross {{volunteered to}} make a {{reconnaissance}} {{of the position of}} two machine-guns which had been captured by the enemy. With the agreement of his sergeant he crept back alone with only a service revolver to what had been his section's trench and was now the enemy's. He surprised seven soldiers who responded by throwing down their rifles. He then marched them carrying the machine guns complete with the tripods and ammunition to the British lines. He then handed over the prisoners and collected teams <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>guns</b> which he brought into action immediately, annihilating a very heavy attack by the enemy.|$|R
