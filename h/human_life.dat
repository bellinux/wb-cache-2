5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a <b>human</b> <b>life</b> was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} targets chosen by the HOPE study was Callisto. The {{possibility}} of building a surface base on Callisto was proposed, because of the low radiation levels at its distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only Galilean satellite for which human exploration is feasible. The levels of ionizing radiation on Io, Europa, and Ganymede are hostile to <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> and adequate protective measures {{have yet to be}} devised.|$|E

If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, {{also known as}} tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E

The {{subsequent}} advent of <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> {{and the development of}} agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E

As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E

Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007.
