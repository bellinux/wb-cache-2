40|$|In {{the recent}} years, fire {{incident}} involved in parking lot had already causing serious verhicle and property loss, in addition, in people death and injuries. Fire hazard {{can not be}} ignored. Foam suppression system is most used for parking lot protection according to fire regulation and practice at present. However, based on foam expansion rate, foam suppression system could divide into two classified as low and high expansion foam；Also, it could classify as low, medium and high expansion foam according to NFPA standard. If category by system, foam could be separate as fixed and portable system. Due to protective object has a different selection in foam system, discharge outlet and expansion rate etc. Therefore, it is urgently need to establish an Optimize foam suppression design and installation method. The research is scheduled for one year program. National Fire Administration, Central Police University, Fire Equipment Association and Professional Fire Engineer, are all invited to compose of a strong research team. The major objective of the project is to evaluate the effective for apply foam suppression system in asset and property protection. Including effective evaluation, site survey, foam discharge, 25 ％ foam recovery time and expansion rate test for foam system using for parking lot, and set up an optimize foam system design and testing procedure. The contributions of the study are listed as follows： （ 1 ）Doing fire cases collation is helpful to understand fire root causes and good for set up a fire fighting methodology and measures for fire response. （ 2 ）Completed literature, regulation and standard research and analysis for parking lot, will assist National Fire Administration to establish a practical regulations for fire suppression design and inspection. （ 3 ）It could make fire suppression system <b>drawing</b> <b>review</b> and site survey more practical and consistent. It is Advantageous for fire fighter safety inspection and fire protection engineering design. The material also {{could be used as}} training course handout for students. （ 4 ）Conducted foam suppression and foam concentrate expansion rate site test, in order that people could fully understand how to prepare testing instrument, set up the equipment, personnel mission, and test procedure.
