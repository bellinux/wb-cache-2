30|$|For biodiesel, CN {{has been}} found to {{increase}} with an increasing weight percentage of saturated and long chain fatty ester. In fact, methyl <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 18 : 0), which is of relevance to biodiesel, have been found to possess the highest CN (> 80) (Knothe 2008). In the present study, methyl esters of long chain saturated fatty acids namely stearic acid (C 18 : 0) and palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) were also present in the transesterified yeast oil. The calculated CN was found to be 56.6 (Table 5), and within the range suggested by the standard norms. The TAN and FFA content as determined experimentally according to EN 14214 were estimated to be 0.2 mg KOH g- 1 and 0.1 %, in accordance with the biodiesel standards. Other chemical properties of biodiesel evaluated were the concentration of linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) and wt % of FAMEs having[*]≥[*] 4 double bonds. From the fatty acid profile of the yeast SCO, {{it can be seen that}} the concentration of C 18 : 3 (0.1 %) was well below the specified limit of 12 max and fatty esters with[*]≥[*] 4 double bonds were not detected in the transesterified oil (Table 5). These values are in the acceptable range of international biodiesel standard norms suggesting the possible suitability of biodiesel from strain 3589 when grown on glucose.|$|E
40|$|Lower adipose-ChREBP and de novo {{lipogenesis}} (DNL) {{are associated}} with insulin resistance in humans. Here, we generated adipose-specific ChREBP knockout (AdChREBP KO) mice with negligible sucrose-induced DNL in adipose tissue (AT). Chow-fed AdChREBP KO mice are insulin resistant with impaired insulin action in the liver, muscle, and AT and increased AT inflammation. HFD-fed AdChREBP KO mice are also more insulin resistant than controls. Surprisingly, adipocytes lacking ChREBP display a cell-autonomous reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport that is mediated by impaired Glut 4 translocation and exocytosis, not lower Glut 4 levels. AdChREBP KO mice have lower levels <b>of</b> palmitic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> hydroxy <b>stearic</b> <b>acids</b> (PAHSAs) in serum, and AT. 9 -PAHSA supplementation completely rescues their insulin resistance and AT inflammation. 9 -PAHSA also normalizes impaired glucose transport and Glut 4 exocytosis in ChREBP KO adipocytes. Thus, loss of adipose-ChREBP is sufficient to cause insulin resistance, potentially by regulating AT glucose transport and flux through specific lipogenic pathways...|$|R

30|$|This study {{presented}} a newly mixed micelle structure of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) (mPEG-PLA) diblock copolymers and Solutol HS 15, which {{was expected to}} manifest increased drug loading efficiency, superior {{to those of the}} individual components, and at least maintain the efficacy of propofol. Solutol HS 15, the main component of which is the polyethylene glycol 660 <b>ester</b> <b>of</b> 12 -hydroxy <b>stearic</b> <b>acid,</b> is a low molecular weight surfactant and recommended as non-ionic solubilizing agent to be added to injection solutions [22]. Its relatively bulky lipophilic portion might allow it for better drug solubilization. This micellar structure involved not only the modification of particles to hide the inner structure to prevent recognition by the physiological system, but also a new means of preparing micelles with higher drug LC from a copolymer with a low molecular weight surfactant. Therefore, the micelle preparation, propofol solubilization, and in vitro micelle properties were investigated by the size measurement, drug LC, encapsulation efficiency (EE), physical stability, and in vitro drug release. The in vivo pharmacological effect of propofol-loaded mixed micelles was also evaluated.|$|R

Several supported nickel oxide catalysts with nickel loading up to 25 wt. % were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and reduced using hydrogen. The catalysts were then characterized by BET, TPR, H 2 pulse chemisorption, TPD, XRD, and ICP-AES. Characterization studies revealed that only dispersed nickel oxide was present up to 15 wt. % nickel loading on γ-Al 2 O 3. The acidity of the supports depends on nickel loading of oxidized catalysts and increases with increasing nickel loading up to 15 wt. %. n-Pentadecane, n-hexadecane, n-heptadecane, n-octadecane, and l-octadecanol were identified as products <b>of</b> hydrodeoxygenation <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> with n-heptadecane being primary product.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{hydrophobic}} material, the surface of natural limestone with the high content of calcite (> 95 %), was treated with 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3 and 4 % <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid.</b> Two methods were used for modification: the solution method and the dry coating. The obtained products were characterized using the thermal analysis (DT/TG), X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by the evaluation of floating test. Results of floating test showed that when the solution method was applied, the hydrophobicity arrived at above 99 % when the amount <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> was 1. 5 %, while with the dry coating the same hydrophobicity was achieved with 3 % <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid.</b> From {{the position of the}} principal exothermic peak (> 310 °C) at DTA curves, for calcites modified with dry coating and with the solution method, it can be concluded that with both modification processes, the same active sites exist at the calcite surface onto which <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> may be chemisorbed. However, the position and the intensity of the other exothermic peaks, indicate the differences in bonding <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> at the calcite surface during the solution method and the dry coating...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembled multilayers <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> were {{obtained}} by evaporating a drop <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> dissolved in organic solvent onto a cleaned glass slide. X-ray diffraction and scanning force microscopy (SFM) {{were used to determine}} the bulk structure and to study the surface at molecular level. In samples prepared from decane solution, at least two crystalline forms (A + C and B + C, but seldom A + B + C) coexist and the molecules at the surface appear arranged according to a two-dimensional non-centered rectangular lattice. After annealing of the samples at 80 degrees C (slightly above the melting point <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid),</b> the C-form exists singly: accordingly, the molecular arrangement at the surface reverts to an hexagonal pattern. A periodic buckling superstructure is also observed by SFM in non-annealed samples. Moreover, X-ray diffraction results indicate that recrystallization processes occur...|$|R
5000|$|N-Stearoylethanolamine is the amide <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> (18:0) and ethanolamine. It has pro-apoptotic activity. It {{operates}} {{independently of}} the known cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors targeted by anandamide.|$|R
40|$|Decreased {{membrane}} rigidity {{is one of}} {{the characteristics}} of malignant cells, resulting in part from the desaturation <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> into oleic acid. In this study we investigated the influence <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> on tumour cell inhibition in vitro and tumour development in vivo. <b>Stearic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited the colony-forming ability of 4 out of 5 rat and two human tumour continuous cell lines in vitro. In contrast, the colony-forming ability of rat fibroblasts was not inhibited and that of human foetal lung fibroblasts was inhibited at a higher dose than that required to inhibit human tumour cell lines. Using a model of rat mammary carcinoma induced by nitroso-methyl urea (NMU) the subcutaneous injection <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> at weekly intervals prevented tumour development in 5 to 10 rats. Using iodostearic acid twice weekly, 11 of 19 rats were alive and tumour free at week 22 whilst all of 14 animals injected with NMU alone had died of tumour by the 16 th week. The ratio <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> to oleic <b>acids</b> in erythrocyte membranes was significantly reduced in the tumour-bearing rats, but was normal in tumour-free animals treated with <b>stearic</b> or iodostearic <b>acid.</b> These preliminary data indicate that <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits tumour development in rats...|$|R
