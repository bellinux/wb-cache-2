Click-evoked and spontaneous OAEs were recorded in parallel with TBOAEs to facilitate cross-comparisons and the generalization of results. Findings for click-evoked and spontaneous OAEs were comparable with most literature data. High reliability for TBOAEs was established for high and mid stimulus levels at all frequencies tested with reference to test-retest prevalence rate, test-retest occurrence, intra-subject test-retest difference and correlation coefficient. Derived <b>half-octave</b> <b>band</b> analysis at the frequency corresponding to the stimulus was found to reflect real TBOAE performance more reliably than broadband analysis. No significant difference between short- {{and long-term}} reliabilities was noted from all results. Similar test-retest reliabilities for high-level TBOAEs and click-evoked OAEs was obtained, suggesting that TBOAEs could potentially contribute to clinical assessment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

We measure the FWHM of the spots produced by VISFLAT exposures using linear ramp filters crossed with narrow <b>band</b> <b>filters.</b> We do this for eight different pairings of narrow band and linear ramp filters. We then compare results from 1995 and 2008, and find negligible change in the bandpass FWHM for all eight filter pairs tested. Any change in the combined bandwidth is less than about 1 % of the bandwidth. Our constraints on any changes in the narrow <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> (taken alone) are less strong, but we can rule out bandwidth changes larger than about 5 % for typical narrow <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> (16 % for the narrowest filter, F 656 N). 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two prime contributions. First, digital filters {{for both}} intermediate and base <b>band</b> <b>filtering</b> for mobile communication are presented. Second, a local clock for on-chip clock generation is introduced. The intermediate frequency filter is a digital alternative to today's analog filters. It is a narrow <b>band</b> <b>filter</b> {{designed for the}} American digital mobile telephone system according to the IS- 54 specification. The digital base <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> are designed for use in some wide band research systems. Both the narrow band and the wide <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> use a wave digital lattice structure realized with bit-serial arithmetic. The clock generator is developed to increase the throughput in bit-serial designs such as the intermediate and the wide <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> above. It is a counter based clock generator i. e the counter stops a ring oscillator after the correct number of cycles has been generated. The generator is a digital alternative to analog on-chip generators as for instance PLL's. The clock is local and occupies only a small area. Several clock generators can, therefore, be used on the same die. All work presented in this thesis is fabricated and tested in a standard 5 volt CMOS processes. The IS- 54 filter is a a twelfth order narrow <b>band</b> <b>filter</b> with 20 kHz band width and a center frequency of 95 kHz. The wide-band filters are designed for two different systems; the first system is designed for 20 MHz modulated band width {{and the second is}} designed for 2 MHz modulated band width. The clock generator is used in all the filter designs and it is also tested separately in a 385 MHz clock generator. The power consumption is low. Another more important property with respect to the power consumption is that the clock generator is suitable for low supply voltage applications. The on-chip clock generator has been tested down to 0. 7 volts in a standard 5 Volts CMOS process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaximum sound {{pressure}} levels {{are commonly used}} for environmental noise and building acoustics measurements. This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors when combined with octave <b>band</b> <b>filters,</b> one-third octave <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for octave <b>band</b> <b>filters,</b> and when Bt≈ 3 for one-third octave <b>band</b> <b>filters.</b> Four different commercially-available sound level meters are used to quantify the variation in measured maximum levels using tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between sound level meters when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in octave bands or one-third octave bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different sound level meters, it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|R

One of such difficult classes that indeed requires lots of multipliers is the narrow <b>band</b> <b>filter.</b> In proposed method, {{it is possible to}} design a narrow <b>band</b> FIR <b>filter</b> with multipliers much less than Remez method, a typical conventional method. In the first step of the proposed method, a pair of mother filters that are basic for the desired filter are defined. In the next step, scaled filters of the mother filters will be taken. Finally, we take an appropriate cascade connection of the scaled filters and make it the approximation model of the desired characteristics of nar-row <b>band</b> FIR <b>filter.</b> By a numerical experiment, the proposed method is shown to be supeior to Remez method, as stated above...|$|R
