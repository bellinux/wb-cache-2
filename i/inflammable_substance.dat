60|$|A second {{peculiarity}} of airship war as {{it first}} came to the world that also made for social collapse, was the ineffectiveness of the early air-ships against each other. Upon anything below they could rain explosives in the most deadly fashion, forts and ships and cities lay at their mercy, but unless they were prepared for a suicidal grapple they could do remarkably little mischief to each other. The armament of the huge German airships, big as the biggest mammoth liners afloat, was one machine gun that could easily have been packed up on a couple of mules. In addition, when it became evident that the air must be fought for, the air-sailors were provided with rifles with explosive bullets of oxygen or <b>inflammable</b> <b>substance,</b> but no airship at any time ever carried as {{much in the way of}} guns and armour as the smallest gunboat on the navy list had been accustomed to do. Consequently, when these monsters met in battle, they manoeuvred for the upper place, or grappled and fought like junks, throwing grenades fighting hand to hand in an entirely medieval fashion. The risks of a collapse and fall on either side came near to balancing in every case the chances of victory. As a consequence, and after their first experiences of battle, one finds a growing tendency on the part of the air-fleet admirals to evade joining battle, and to seek rather the moral advantage of a destructive counter attack.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{structured}} and refined, but flexible tools {{are needed to}} deal with issues as the information management on the web and the semantic interoperability. Many issues {{in the field of}} knowledge organisation and information management {{can be traced back to}} meaning delimitation. There are opposite needs and tendencies: on one hand thereâs the necessity to share a common and stable meaning of the terms in order to guarantee communication within a community. On the other hand, openness to further exploration of meaning should also be ensured to do not impoverish its richness and complexity. The term âbenzeneâ could be defined in different ways. A biologist may consider its toxicity and the different routes on which it can enter an organism. An engineer would consider it as a fuel for combustion engine. A physicist may see it as a volatile and inflammable liquid. A fire brigade can consider benzene as a dangerous <b>inflammable</b> <b>substance</b> that cannot be extinguished by water, but only with foam. A chemist may see it as the precursor of a class of chemical compounds, etc. Benzene could be thus defined in several different ways depending on the context in which it is considered. But we should also underline that all these definitions share a common premise: âbenzeneâ is first of all a substance (that can have toxic effects, be used as fuel, that can also cause accidents, etc.). This semantic trait seems to be unavoidable. Starting from this premise and referring also to suggestions coming from the development of applied ontologies a new environmental thesaurus format containing some innovative elements has been designed and is currently available. The goal is the development of a thesaurus aiming to become an advanced tool to be applied for environmental information management, to sustain environmental policy and research. To achieve this result EARTh has been conceived as a tool able to deal with the specific features of the environment sector (multidisciplinary character, high complexity, bio-cultural implications, etc.).

Occupying only a narrow strip along the Pacific Coast of California, these trees are {{considered}} to be the oldest, largest, and most impressive of all living things. Prior to the California gold rush, the redwood forest had grown to enormous size and great age Then, about {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, the pioneers of California began to use redwood lumber. These pioneers found that the redwood had many remarkable qualities. One such quality was that the redwood contained a natural preservative, making it resistant to decay. The fact that it contained no highly <b>inflammable</b> <b>substances,</b> such as pitch or resin, made the redwood also resistant to fire and therefore quite useful as a building material. For three summers I worked at Humboldt Redwoods State Park as a park aid, greeting campers and helping to maintain the park.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find a new method for usage of the {{hazardous}} waste coming from the aluminium scrap recycling factories. It is generally considered that non-metallic residues (NMR) are process waste and subject to disposal after residual metal has been recovered from primary dross. NMR are impurities, which are removed from the molten metal in the process of dross recycling, and it could be defined as a hazardous waste product. Processing of NMR created in the aluminium scrap recycling companies is one of the most challenging tasks due to its toxic nature - in accordance with the Basel Convention, Annex III, marking of this waste is H 4. 3 (reaction with water results in highly <b>inflammable</b> <b>substances)</b> and H 10 (reaction with water results in increased concentration of toxic gases, for instance, ammonia). The new alkali activated materials, which could be defined as porous building materials, were created by using calcined illite clay from local site and NMR. Solution of sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3 +nH 2 O) modified by commercially available alkali flakes (NaOH) was used as an activating solution. Polymerization mechanism of raw materials in alkaline media was investigated by using FTIR and XRD. Physical and thermal properties of the obtained materials were tested. Density of the obtained materials was in the range 550 - 675 kg/m 3, but the total porosity was from 73 to 78 %. The compressive strength of the materials was in range from 1. 4 to 2. 0 MPa.

40|$|Industrial {{plants are}} complex systems {{and it is}} such a complexity, due to {{numerous}} connections, equipment and components, together with the complexity of their operations that makes them particularly vulnerable (local vulnerability) to earthquakes. Activities carried out in process plants can also be arranged in series, which means that process activities are realized with specific sequence and boundary conditions. Consequently, the âfailureâ of a single element can get out of order the entire system. This is of fundamental importance for the seismic vulnerability of a plant (general vulnerability). Seismic action can cause serious accidents to industrial plants as shown in several occasions. The actual worldwide situation of major-hazard plants against earthquakes should be considered as critical. For instance, in Italy about 30 % of industrial plants with major accident hazards are located in areas with a high seismic risk. In addition, in case of a seismic event, the earthquake can induce the simultaneous damage of different apparatus, whose effects can be amplified because of the failure of safety systems or the simultaneous generation of multiple accidental chains. A representative example is certainly the Izmit Earthquake in Turkey (Erdik and Durukal, 2000), which induced severe damages to Tupras refinery (area of the plant, farm tanks, and landing place). An example of domino effect caused by a structural collapse was the breakdown of a concrete chimney that caused a big release of dangerous substances and damages to surrounding equipment. In a plant, an earthquake can cause many dead as consequence of components collapses, similarly to what happens to buildings; moreover, the consequences deriving from a seismic event, such as economic losses for interruption of the production, environmental damages due to releases of dangerous substances, damages to persons due to explosions, fires and release of toxic substances, have also to be taken into account. Therefore, the usual safety requirements applied to civil buildings for ultimate and serviceability limit states, together with the consequences of exceptional actions, are generally unsuitable for structures belonging to industrial plants. As a matter of fact, a critical damage for a process safety that can cause even a modest release of <b>inflammable</b> <b>substances,</b> such as a flange opening or a welding breaking, can result unessential under structural point of view, but, at the same time, might cause considerable accidental chains. Consequently, for process industry it is necessary to associate the indirect consequences caused by possible accidents (i. e. a seismic event) to the direct structural damages. During the last years, in order to increase safety against earthquakes, passive control techniques (PCT) have been developed, which are based on the concept of reducing the seismic action instead of increasing the strength (Housner et al., 1997). These techniques that for civil constructions are nowadays considered a consolidated alternative design tool, can also be used for seismic protection of industrial structures. Unfortunately a very limited number of applications to industrial plants components have been realized. For this reason, in the present chapter the applicability of such a technique is investigated, aiming at providing general applicability criteria. An example of base isolation of a steel storage tank is also presented, whose effectiveness is investigated by a wide numerical and experimental activity...|$|R
40|$|Tunnels {{have long}} been used for {{speeding}} up road and rail connections between places separated by natural barriers and for reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. Not surprisingly, Italy with its particular orography and geographic position, has the largest tunnel length in Europe (more than 1900 km, not including city metro tunnels), and equal to 27 % of the European total. However, in parallel with an always increasing interest for underground transportation structures, {{there is also an}} increasing concern for possible fire emergencies occurring inside tunnels and critical underground infrastructures, taking into account the peculiar geometry of infrastructures. In recent years serious accidents such as the fires in the Mont Blanc, Gotthard and Tauern tunnels have led to increasing attention to safety in tunnels. The transport of dangerous <b>substances</b> (<b>inflammable</b> and toxic) by road and rail is widespread in Italy and incidents involving this type of transport present an additional serious problem. Even if the last two decades have often seen drops in road accidents and a consistently high level of safety, recent accidents have shown that some types of commercial products, depending on their chemical composition, can cause large fires with severe evolving scenarios. If vehicles carrying hazardous <b>substances</b> (<b>inflammable</b> or toxic) were to be involved the accident scenarios could assume catastrophic proportions. The distribution of areas with high concentrations of plants at major risk in Italy generates a large flux of vehicles in the ADR category on the national road network. Although the rail network has different characteristics it is also subject to the risk of tunnel accidents, in particular {{because of the presence of}} very long tunnels. Finally, the case of fires in urban subway systems cannot be neglected. In this context, the major problem is due to the high density of passengers and the possibility of large concentrations of toxic combustion products in the underground stations. Notwithstanding extensive studies on fire simulation in tunnel, reported in scientific literature, there is still a substantial lack of information on the different toxic products from combustion of light or heavy vehicles. In particular, there is a need for reliable test methods suitable to provide toxic products yields connected to defined accidental fire scenarios. The objectives of the present paper are the experimental determination of thermal profiles inside and outside the gallery, under different thermal power emission and the qualitative and quantitative determination of toxic compounds of smoke from burning vehicles in a tunnel. Experimental techniques used to measure compounds from fire range in size from bench-top apparatus for testing small specimens, up to full scale tests. Regardless of the scale, it is important that fire reaction runs are carried out in conditions that closely replicate the type of fire to which the vehicle could be exposed. In particular, one of the main results of this work lies in providing an effective and reliable analytical methodology to optimize the analysis of toxic compounds of interest in tunnel fire scenarios...|$|R
