25|$|On 14 June 1561 Kranich {{was granted}} denization by Elizabeth I. In London he practised medicine, and {{became known as}} 'Dr Burcot'. His {{abilities}} as a physician were well thought of by some, including John Somers, who wrote from court to Sir Nicholas Throckmorton on 29 August 1562 that 'My Lady Marquis' was seriously ill with jaundice, and that although some physicians had despaired of her, 'Burcot, the Dutchman, at a pinch is like to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> if he may be suffered'.|$|E
25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E

This may <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> in rain or frosty weather & he proposes to have different sized revolvers to apply at every hill & every vale according to their angle with ye Horizon... I verely believe he would sooner give up all his cornish business & interest than be deprived of carrying the thing into execution.|$|E

500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There {{was a time}} when I expected to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good.</b> But that was a long while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E
500|$|From the West, Vivekananda revived {{his work}} in India. He {{regularly}} corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, [...] "Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes {{of the town of}} Khetri and teach them religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying [...] "Ramakrishna, O Lord!"—unless you can <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> to the poor". In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical Brahmavadin to teach the Vedanta. Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of The Imitation of Christ was published in Brahmavadin in 1889. Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896. He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted {{the rest of her life}} to the education of Indian women and India's independence.|$|E
2500|$|In November of 1933, the {{minister}} Goebbels nominated me {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer without obtaining my prior agreement. I was not consulted. I accepted this honorary office because I hoped that I {{would be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> and prevent worse misfortunes, if from now onwards German musical life were going to be, as it was said, [...] "reorganized" [...] by amateurs and ignorant place-seekers.|$|E

2500|$|Suffering financially, the Leader {{was sold}} on in March 1938 to Paul Holmes. Although no {{immediate}} changes {{were taken in}} the paper's editorial stance, editorialist John Work later recalled [...] "for a little while I could write socialist editorials, but it soon appeaered that, while I could write socialist editorials, I was expected not to make much {{use of the word}} 'socialism.' I stayed on, knowing that I could still <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> work for the cause, and not knowing but that the socialists might again get control of the paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Neumann, a {{philosophy}} professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario {{expressed support for}} the boycott. Neumann stated that [...] "If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good,</b> then I think it's reasonable and perhaps justified." [...] He argued that a boycott is not anti-semitic, stating that [...] "It targets Israeli, not Jewish, professors." [...] He further stated that [...] "People may always have bad motives underlying good motives. And it's not absolutely impossible {{that some of these}} people have anti-Semitic feelings deep down, but do I think that plays a large part? No, I certainly do not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early humanists saw no {{conflict}} between reason and their Christian faith (see Christian Humanism). They inveighed against {{the abuses of}} the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [...] "secular" [...] carried no connotations of disbeliefthat would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply {{to be in the}} world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base, however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.|$|E

2500|$|After {{arriving}} in Basutoland, Gordon met with Prince Masupha {{to persuade him}} to lay down his arms and to accept his father's protectorate plan rather than have his kingdom annexed to the Orange Free State. Faught wrote that Gordon was only in South Africa for a short time, but one of his enduring legacies is the existence of Lesotho, which otherwise would have been annexed to the Orange Free State and whose people would have thus suffered from apartheid in the 20th century. After his return from South Africa, Galbraith remarked that Gordon had a [...] "strange combination of melancholia, resignation and mysticism" [...] that he was destined by God both to do something great and to die soon. During this time, Leopold who was most anxious to fire Stanley with his ever-increasing demands for more money, constantly wrote to Gordon asking him to be his agent in the Congo. Gordon had come to distrust Leopold, but he came to believe that perhaps he could <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> in the Congo.|$|E
2500|$|In episode 28 of the show's tenth series, the {{character}} returns to Holby City Hospital, and is disappointed to discover her late husband's charity is in decline. Asher has {{commented on the}} storyline: [...] "She's horrified when {{a young man with}} Asperger's syndrome can't have a routine operation because they don't have the necessary equipment. Lady Byrne then discovers that the boss of Charles' charity has been investing cash instead of putting it to good use." [...] The hospital's Chief Executive Officer, Jayne Grayson, convinces her to take over as Executive Chairman of the charity. [...] "Jayne sees that she has the strength to run the show," [...] Asher explained. [...] "Lady Byrne is reluctant at first, but realises that she can <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> and keep the family name going - and she does a rather excellent job of it." [...] Asher was able to contribute to the storyline in the planning stages, due to her real-world experience with Asperger syndrome. [...] "As president of The National Autistic Society, Asperger's is something I've worked with for 25 years. When Holby approached the society about this plot concerning the boy with Asperger's syndrome, they said, 'Do you realise the woman involved in this storyline is our president?'. So I was able to help out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Quran at its {{several places}} {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone (...) [...] Again, those who deny resurrection and afterlife, and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) {{and is about to}} escape the body? (...) [...] It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to Godto go back to life to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> deeds; but this will never be granted (...) [...] Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: [...] "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense." [...] At another place, the Quran urges mankind: [...] "And die not except in a state of Islam" [...] (...) because [...] "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" [...] (...) [...] Other verses related with this issue are: [...] "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving" [...] (...) [...] "Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
