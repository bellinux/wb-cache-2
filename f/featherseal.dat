40|$|During the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSM) HPFtP/AT {{development}} program, engine hot fire testing {{resulted in}} turbine blade fatigue cracks. The cracks were noted {{after only a}} few tests and a several hundred seconds versus the design goal of 60 tests and > 30, 000 seconds. Subsequent investigation attributed the distress to excessive steady and dynamic loads. To address these excessive turbine blade loads, Pratt & Whitney Liquid Space Propulsion engineers designed and developed retrofitable turbine blade to blade platform <b>featherseal</b> dampers. Since incorporation of these dampers, along with other turbine blade system improvements, there has been no observed SSME HPFTP/AT turbine blade fatigue cracking. The high time HPFTP/AT blade now has accumulated 32 starts and 19, 200 seconds hot fire test time. Figure # 1 illustrates the HPFTP/AT turbine blade platform <b>featherseal</b> dampers. The approached selected was to improve the turbine blade structural capability while simultaneously reducing loads. To achieve this goal, the <b>featherseal</b> dampers were designed to seal the blade to blade platform gap and damp the dynamic motions. Sealing improves the steady stress margins by increasing turbine efficiency and improving turbine blade attachment thermal conditioning. Load reduction was achieved through damping. Thin Haynes 188 sheet metal was selected based on its material properties (hydrogen resistance, elongation, tensile strengths, etc.). The 36, 000 rpm wheel speed of the rotor result in a normal load of 120 #/blade. The featherseals then act as micro-slip dampers during actual SSME operation. After initial design and analysis (prior to full engine testing), the <b>featherseal</b> dampers were tested in P&W's spin rig facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. Both dynamic strain gages and turbine blade tip displacement measurements were utilized to quantify the <b>featherseal</b> damper effectiveness. Full speed (36, 000 rpm), room temperature rig testing verified the elimination of fundamental mode (i. e, modes 1 & 2) resonant response. The reduction in turbine blade dynamic response is shown for a typical turbine blade. This paper discusses the design and verification of these dampers. The numerous benefits associated with this design concept warrants consideration in existing and future turbomachinery applications...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} High-Pressure Fuel Turbopump/Alternate Turbopump (HPFTP/AT) {{turbine blade}} {{development}} program, unique turbine blade design features were implemented to address 2 nd stage turbine blade high cycle fatigue distress and improve turbine robustness. Features included the addition of platform <b>featherseal</b> dampers, asymmetric blade tip seal segments, gold plating of the blade attachments, and airfoil tip trailing edge modifications. Development testing shows these features have eliminated turbine blade high cycle fatigue distress and consequently these features are currently planned for incorporation to the flight configuration. Certification testing will begin in 1999. This presentation summarizes these features...|$|E
