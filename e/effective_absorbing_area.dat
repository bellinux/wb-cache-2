A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} ionosphere, which can be affected by powerful HF waves, is applied for simulations of the large-scale middle-latitude F-layer modification by HF waves.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} ionosphere, developed earlier, is applied to investigate the large-scale mid-latitude F-layer modification by HF radio waves with different powers. Simulations are performed for the point with geographic coordinates of the "Sura" heating facility (Nizhny Novgorod, Russia) for autumn conditions. The calculations are made for distinct cases, in which the <b>effective</b> <b>absorbed</b> power has different values belonging to the 5 – 100 MW range, both for nocturnal and daytime conditions. The frequency of powerful HF waves is chosen {{to be close to}} the most effective frequency for the large-scale F 2 -layer modification.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} belowground competition for moisture and nutrients is limited. In this study, we used an earth impedance method to determine the root <b>absorbing</b> <b>area</b> of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) trees, making measurements in stands of differing density (2 -, 4 - and 6 -m inter-tree spacing). We compared <b>absorbing</b> root <b>area</b> index (RAIabsorbing; based on the impedance measure) with fine root area index (RAIfine; based on estimates of total surface area of fine roots) and related these results to investment in conductive roots. Root <b>absorbing</b> <b>area</b> was a near-linear function of tree stem diameter at 1. 3 m height. At the stand level, RAIabsorbing, which is analogous to and scaled with transpiring leaf area index (maximum stomatal pore area per unit ground area; LAItranspiring), increased proportionally with basal area across the three stands. In contrast, RAIfine was inversely propotional to basal area. The ratio of RAIabsorbing to LAItranspiring ranged from 7. 7 to 17. 1, giving an estimate of the relative aboveground versus belowground resource exchange areas. RAIabsorbing provides a way of characterizing ecosystem functioning as a physiologically meaningful index of belowground <b>absorbing</b> <b>area.</b> © The Author 2010.

40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} the design, modeling and optimization of a miniaturized self-calibrated pyrometer to detect infrared radiation (in 5 - 20 µm range of wavelengths) {{in order to}} measure the real temperature of objects without contact. The microsystem consists of a thermally insulated <b>absorbing</b> <b>area</b> and two thermopiles with the hot junctions in the <b>absorbing</b> <b>area</b> and the cold junctions on a heat sink (i. e. the silicon bulk). The complete microsystem is in silicon planar technology and each thermopile has a different reference temperature, biased by a Peltier microstructure near to the cold junction of the thermopile. A silicon die passivated with a silicon nitride membrane is the ground floor of all microsystem. The <b>absorbing</b> <b>area,</b> a black gold strip on the silicon nitride membrane is obtained by anisotropic etching of the bulk silicon {{from the back of the}} wafer. The pyrometer microsystem is composed by: the IR optical filter on the top, the electronic system built in CMOS technology added by Multi-Chip-Module (MCM) techniques and the pyrometer. Application of a network of pyrometers in textile industry is the final goal...|$|R

30|$|We {{developed}} and demonstrated {{the use of}} an <b>effective</b> <b>absorbing</b> boundary condition for finite difference simulation of tsunamis. The new PML boundary condition for LLW tsunamis was empirically extended to LDW tsunamis and was shown to be very effective in reducing artificial reflections of tsunamis at the model boundaries. The effectiveness of the PML boundary condition may be sensitive to the PML damping parameters, but we confirmed that it is rather robust and a set of same PML parameters previously used in the modeling of seismic waves (Zhang and Shen 2010) work efficiently for tsunami waves as well.|$|R
30|$|In this report, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} an {{alternative}} and more effective boundary condition based on the perfectly matched layer (PML) method for finite difference numerical modeling of tsunami propagation. The PML method was originally proposed for numerical simulations of electromagnetic waves (Berenger 1994) and is known {{to be one of the}} most <b>effective</b> <b>absorbing</b> boundary conditions for wave-related equations. The PML method uses an absorbing region surrounding the model area. Within the full wavefield, only variables with a component of movement perpendicular to the model boundary are attenuated to avoiding artificial reflection. Waves moving parallel to the model boundary are unchanged.|$|R

There are a number of available highly <b>effective</b> <b>absorbing</b> boundary conditions (ABCs) to simulate an infinite unbounded computational domain.

However, accurate {{predictions of the}} characteristics of ground and structural responses to train-induced vibrations remain a major challenge. Essentially, the absorbing boundary condition has significant effects on the dynamic response behaviours of wave-soil-structure interaction in unbounded media. An in-house 2 -D finite element model has been developed for time-domain simulation of stress wave propagation and dynamic responses of structures with the use of different boundary conditions.

40|$|We have numerically {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} parameter mismatch and noise on the loss of chaos synchronization in unidirectionally coupled one-dimensional maps. Through a first transverse bifurcation of an unstable periodic orbit embedded in the synchronous chaotic at-tractor (SCA), this attractor becomes weakly stable. In the regime of weak synchronization, any small parameter mismatch and noise transform the SCA into a bubbling attractor or a chaotic transient. In this case, the quantities of interest are the average interburst interval of the bubbling attractor and the average lifetime of the chaotic transient. They are found to scale with the mismatching parameter and the noise intensity. Furthermore, the scaling results for the cases of parameter mismatch and noise are quantitatively the same. We also give the theoretical background for the scaling by comparing our numerical results with the-oretical results. For the bubbling case, the maximum bursting amplitude is another quantity of interest. We discuss the abrupt increase in the maximum bursting amplitude that results from the sudden increase {{in the size of}} the <b>absorbing</b> <b>area,</b> confining the bursting, through an interior crisis. This is in contrast with the case of symmetric coupling, in which no such crisis occurs for the <b>absorbing</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

Four different companies with eight departments in open-plan offices participated in the project. Beside acoustics also working environment, organization and architectural themes was investigated. Among the main findings were that even though all the offices met the requirement on minimum <b>absorbing</b> <b>areas</b> (0, 9 x Floor area), the questionnaires in the same offices showed a certain dissatisfaction with the general acoustic conditions. Measurements and computer simulations (with the ODOEN software) was used to calculate the new ISO 14257 parameters DLf and DL 2 for all the workplaces. At the present stage of project the DLf and DL 2 parameters spreads somewhat and shows weak correlation with experienced acoustical conditions between the different workplaces. The same yields for the proposed parameter concerning local acoustic on the individual workplaces. Proposals for interventions have been optimized using the computer models and knowledge from the questionnaires. New measurements and questionnaires will be made after realization of the interventions.

40|$|Numerical {{computation}} of {{wave propagation}} {{in a large}} domain usually requires significant computational effort. Hence, the considered domain must be truncated to a smaller domain of interest. In addition, special boundary conditions, which absorb the outward travelling waves, need to be implemented in order to describe the system domains correctly. In this work, the linear one dimensional wave equation is approximated by utilizing the Fourier Galerkin approach. Furthermore, the artificial boundaries are realized with absorbing boundary conditions. Within this work, a systematic work flow for setting up the wave problem, including the absorbing boundary conditions, is proposed. As a result, a convenient modal system description with an <b>effective</b> <b>absorbing</b> boundary formulation is established.
