500|$|<b>Iodine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (IF3) is an {{unstable}} yellow solid that decomposes above −28°C. It is thus little-known. It {{is difficult to}} produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine {{all the way to}} the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with xenon difluoride is necessary. Iodine trichloride, which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I2Cl6, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at −80°C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to [...] and [...] ions.|$|E
500|$|Iodine monofluoride (IF) is {{unstable}} at {{room temperature}} and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and iodine pentafluoride, and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in trichlorofluoromethane at −45°C, with <b>iodine</b> <b>trifluoride</b> in trichlorofluoromethane at −78°C, or with silver(I) fluoride at 0°C. Iodine monochloride (ICl) and iodine monobromide (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Humphry Davy in 1813–4 {{not long after the}} discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that Justus von Liebig was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine {{at room temperature}} and purified by fractional crystallisation. Both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold, though not boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid, since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I–Cl bond occurs and I+ attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine. When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into [...] and [...] anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.|$|E

Assignment - of the vibrational frequencies of the {{have been made}} and approximate stretching force constants calculated. Shifts in {{the positions of the}} stretching modes of with changing cation are discussed. The vibrational spectrum of iodyl fluoride indicates the presence of a polymeric structure and various possible arrangements are suggested. The synthesis of complexes involving the iodyl ion, have been attempted. Colorimetric measurements, in the isoperibol mode, of the enthalpies of hydrolysis of the dioxodifluoroiodate salts, <b>iodine</b> oxide <b>trifluoride,</b> iodyl fluoride, <b>iodine</b> pentafluoride and 'hexafluoroiodate compounds, are reported. Using these and ancillary data the enthalpies of formation of the compounds have been calculated. Enthalpies of Solution of iodic acid at varying dilutions have been measured in order to supplement the data needed in the determination of the enthalpy of formation of iodine pentafluoride. The value thus derived is in good agreementwith those found from/methods. 'Thermochemical' radii of the ionsand IF- have been calculated from accepted procedures inorder to determine the lattice energies of the salts. Additional lattice energies and enthalpies of formation of other salts containing these anions are thus reported. <p...|$|R

40|$|Uranium oxide tetrafluoride {{reacts with}} the Lewis acid pentafluorides BiF 5, NbF 5 and TaF 5 {{to produce the}} fluorine-bridged adducts UOF 4. 2 BiF 5, UOF 4. 3 NbF 5 and UOF 4. 3 TaF 5. These {{complexes}} have been prepared by the reactions of UOF 4 with the pentafluorides in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid solvent or by fusing together UOF 4 /MF 5 mixtures. They have been characterized by elemental analysis, vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction {{and it has been}} shown that, in these complexes, UOF 4 possesses fluoride-ion donor properties. The first examples of compounds formed between uranyl fluoride and a Lewis acid pentafluoride are reported. The reaction of anhydrous UO 2 F 2 with SbF 5 in anhydrous HF produces UO 2 F 2. 3 SbF 5 which, on heating in vacuo at 125 C, gives UO 2 F 2. 2 SbF 5. On heating to 245 C this 1 : 2 adduct loses both SbF 5 ligands simultaneously to produce anhydrous UO 2 F 2. The crystal structure of the 1 : 3 adduct has been determined from single-crystal X-ray studies which have shown it to be a fluorine bridged network. The structure can be described in terms of zig-zag chains of UO 2 groups linked to SbF 6 units with Sb 2 F 11 units attached as side-chains to the uranium with significant ionic contributions to the bondings. Solutions of UOF 4 with SbF 5 in anhydrous HF are unstable for periods of longer than a few hours at room temperature. On standing these orange solutions lose their colour and crystals of uranium hexafluoride appear. The reaction seems to produce a uranyl fluoride - antimony pentafluoride complex but this has not been fully characterized. Xenon difluoride reacts violently with <b>iodine</b> dioxide <b>trifluoride</b> at room temperature to give XeF 2. IF 5 and IO 2 F. However, a Raman study has shown that, if the reaction is controlled by employing low-temperature procedures, XeF 2 /IO 2 F 3 complexes are formed.
