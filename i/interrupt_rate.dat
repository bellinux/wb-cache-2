2500|$|The {{breaking}} capacity is the maximum current that can safely be {{interrupted by the}} fuse. [...] This should be higher than the prospective short-circuit current. Miniature fuses may have an <b>interrupting</b> <b>rating</b> only 10 times their rated current. Some fuses are designated High Rupture Capacity (HRC) and are usually filled with sand or a similar material. Fuses for small, low-voltage, usually residential, wiring systems are commonly rated, in North American practice, to interrupt 10,000 amperes. Fuses for commercial or industrial power systems must have higher interrupting ratings, with some low-voltage current-limiting high <b>interrupting</b> fuses <b>rated</b> for 300,000 amperes.

50|$|There {{are many}} methods that {{hardware}} may use {{to increase the}} interrupt latency that can be tolerated. These include buffers, and flow control.

50|$|Interrupts provide low {{overhead}} and good latency at low load, but degrade significantly at high <b>interrupt</b> <b>rate</b> unless care {{is taken to}} prevent several pathologies. These are various forms of livelocks, when the system spends all of its time processing interrupts {{to the exclusion of}} other required tasks. Under extreme conditions, a large number of interrupts (like very high network traffic) may completely stall the system. To avoid such problems, an operating system must schedule network interrupt handling as carefully as it schedules process execution.|$|E
50|$|As {{drivers are}} most often {{implemented}} by a 3rd party, most operating systems also have a polling mode that queries for pending interrupts at fixed intervals or in a round-robin fashion.

A polling mode may be enabled dynamically {{when the number of}} interrupts or the resource use caused by an interrupt, passes certain thresholds. When these thresholds are no longer exceeded, an OS may then change the interrupting driver, interrupt, or interrupt handling globally, from an interrupt mode to a polling mode. <b>Interrupt</b> <b>rate</b> limiting in hardware usually negates the use of a polling mode, but can still happen during normal operation during intense I/O if the processor is unable switch contexts quickly enough to keep pace.|$|E

The shield material also helps control the shape of the electric field distribution inside the interrupter, which contributes to a higher open-circuit withstand voltage rating.

Furthermore, our technique is generic and therefore applicable to all types of disk IO controllers which, unlike networking, don’t receive anonymous traffic.

40|$|CPU clock speeds grow at an {{exponential}} rate, {{and already}} surpass 2 GHz. At {{the same time}} operating system clock interrupt rates remain at a typical 100 Hz, with scheduling quanta of 50 - 200 ms. As operating systems measure time in these clock ticks, this leads to loss of resolution. One consequence of this situation is that the operating system scheduler can no longer differentiate between processes that do not use too much CPU, because they all use less than a single tick. Another consequence is that the system unnecessarily gives up the opportunity to support applications that require relatively fine-grain real-time support, because the latencies involved are by necessity multiples of a clock tick. The solution is therefore to increase the clock <b>interrupt</b> <b>rate</b> substantially, and reduce the scheduling quantum length. We analyze the overheads and benefits involved in this, and show that a general-purpose system {{can go a long}} way towards providing soft real-time support, at the cost of only modest overheads...|$|E

Device hybrid interrupt-polling and interrupt coalescing are two common techniques used in generalpurpose operating systems to mitigate this problem. Adaptive schemes based on local knowledge have been proposed for each technique above. However, all the schemes proposed so far are designed using heuristics. In addition, the capabilities of the proposed schemes have not been systematically compared. In this paper, we first analyze the capabilities of these schemes by investigating the relationship between key system parameters and system goodput in different packet protocol processing modes under heavy traffic load. Then we propose a robust device hybrid interrupt-polling (RHIP) scheme which achieves high system goodput, low packet loss and good latency with low consumption of CPU cycles, compared to other schemes.

Breaking capacity current corresponds to a voltage, so an electrical apparatus may {{have more than one}} breaking capacity current, according to the voltage. Breaking current may be stated in terms of the total current or just in terms of the alternating-current (symmetrical) component.

50|$|An OS {{maintains}} catalogues {{of objects}} it manages such as threads, mutexes, memory, and so on. Updates to this catalogue must be strictly controlled. For this reason {{it can be}} problematic when an interrupt handler calls an OS function while the application is {{in the act of}} also doing so. The OS function called from an interrupt handler could find the object database to be in an inconsistent state because of the application's update. There are two major approaches to deal with this problem: the unified architecture and the segmented architecture. RTOSs implementing the unified architecture solve the problem by simply disabling interrupts while the internal catalogue is updated. The downside of this is that interrupt latency increases, potentially losing interrupts. The segmented architecture does not make direct OS calls but delegates the OS related work to a separate handler. This handler runs at a higher priority than any thread but lower than the interrupt handlers. The advantage of this architecture is that it adds very few cycles to interrupt latency. As a result, OSes which implement the segmented architecture are more predictable and can deal with higher <b>interrupt</b> <b>rates</b> compared to the unified architecture.|$|R
