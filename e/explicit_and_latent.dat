In particular, we look at the use of a recently developed method called orthonormal explicit topic analysis, which combines <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> <b>latent</b> models of semantics. Although, it remains unclear how topic model may be applied to the case of grammar induction, we show that it is not impossible and that this may allow the capture of subtle semantic distinctions that are not captured by other methods. ...|$|E

40|$|The ICT {{environment}} {{went through}} notable changes, which {{have had an}} irreversible and strong influence on both ICT innovation processes {{and the role of}} end-users. In this context, technology developers are increasingly expected to take users’ experiences with technology into account during the process of developing applications or frameworks. As technology is more and more embedded in users’ daily lives, they seek out those personalized values to satisfy their own, situational needs. As a result, a thorough insight in users’ expectations and experiences at various levels (both <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> more <b>latent)</b> <b>and</b> in different contexts (eg. mobile) has become a crucial determinant for the successful development, introduction and adoption of new ICTs. To this end, our paper focuses on the increased importance of Quality of Experience (QoE). It provides a conceptual model for QoE and furthermore discusses the prevalent gap that still exists between QoE and Quality of Service (QoS). Our main objective is to present a new methodology for correlating user experience to QoS parameters. This methodology was tested {{in the context of an}} exploratory interdisciplinary study on QoE-measurement. This new approach goes beyond QoS-parameters and aims to also grasp the social and contextual dimensions of users’ experiences...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{engages with}} debates about whether {{comprehensive}} prior specification of criteria and standards {{is sufficient for}} informed professional judgement. A preoccupation has emerged with the specificity and explication of criteria intended to regulate judgement. This has resulted in criteria compliance {{in the use of}} defined standards to validate judgements and improve reliability and consistency. Compliance has become a priority, the consequence being the prominence of explicit criteria, to the lack of acknowledgement of the operation of <b>latent</b> <b>and</b> meta-criteria within judgement practice. This paper examines judgement as a process involving three categories of assessment criteria in the context of standards-referenced systems: <b>explicit,</b> <b>latent</b> <b>and</b> meta-criteria. These are understood to be wholly interrelated and interdependent. A conceptualisation of judgement involving the interplay of the three criteria types is presented with an exploration of how they function to focus or alter assessments of quality in judgements of achievement in English and Mathematics.

However, writing clear yet nuanced descriptors or specifications is a continuing challenge. We examine an illustrative case of an assessment expertise project in dentistry at the University of Hong Kong to examine the role of standards descriptors within an overarching, programme-level assessment strategy. The project centred on examiner judgement during in situ clinical assessment tasks. Key to validity and reliability is making such judgements defensible, visible and accessible to students and examiners. Articulation of <b>latent</b> expertise <b>and</b> ‘connoisseur’ use of clinical performance criteria addressed the notion of accessibility. Connoisseurship extends beyond knowing the stated or explicitly defined criteria, to ‘know-how’ in using <b>explicit,</b> <b>latent</b> <b>and</b> meta-criteria.

40|$|Sexual {{offending}} {{by young}} people is increasingly viewed as a social problem that requires a strong response, {{but there is little}} research on the legal treatment of youthful sex offenders. On the one hand, these youths may be viewed as potential future sex offenders; on the other hand, because of their youth and immaturity they may be considered more reformable than adults and their behaviour more excusable. This article builds on an archival study of 385 sexual offence cases, which were disposed in court and by conference and formal caution, in South Australia from 1995 to 2001. Drawing on the transcripts of 55 cases sentenced by judges (i. e. the most legally serious offences), we analyse sentencing discourses and outcomes using both the <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> <b>latent</b> content of the sentencing remarks. Specifically, we explore the judges' orientations and aims when sentencing adolescent sex offenders, how judges reconcile the seriousness of offending and the youthfulness of offenders and how they balance the competing interests of victims and offenders. Two major findings emerge. First, the cases fell in a three-way typology patterned by the victims' age, the context of the offence and the offender's criminal history. Second, our study suggests that while youth court judges consider sexual offending against children as very serious and are concerned by future offending, they do not adopt a punitive approach, but rather a therapeutic and rehabilitative perspective at sentencing.

40|$|Product {{innovation}} is increasingly {{considered to be}} a central source for competitive advantage and a crucial driver for economic growth. Corporations are trying to face the challenges of global competition by launching new products that better satisfy <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> <b>latent</b> user needs and desires, and that have improved performance, superior functionality, lower cost, higher symbolic and emotional value, and sustainable impact on the environment. In this scenario, companies are seeking to understand how new products may be conceived and developed successfully. Managing product development is a major challenge because of its inherent uncertain, complex and multidisciplinary nature. Product development requires the management of creative resources and experimental processes with uncertain outputs. Also, it requires the management of many different types of interfaces: both interactions between different units within a firm (marketing, research, manufacturing, etc.) and interactions with external actors, being them users, suppliers, partners, designers, or universities. The interfaces today cross the borders of countries and continents. Different types of knowledge, competencies, attitudes and values have to work together. In the last years the list of challenges has been extended by the emergence of communities of experts who are developing new ideas and even products beside traditional firms. It becomes more important to understand how they work and how companies can cooperate with them. Research on product development management is challenged by this uncertain, complex and multidisciplinary nature. In order to understand the dynamics of new product conception and development, scholars have increasingly to operate across different disciplines: strategy, management of innovation, technology and R&D management, project management, research policy, marketing, design, anthropology, sociology, organization, operations management, etc...|$|E
40|$|Market-oriented {{approach}} to customer {{development has been}} strongly associated innovativeness and new product success. There is also evidence to suggest customer-led approach, or responding to explicit customer needs, impedes innovation. This thesis investigates whether the increasingly popular Lean Startup Methodology (LSM) favours customer-led or market-oriented {{approach to}} discovering and learning about customer needs. The study was conducted using a participatory action research methodology. The LSM {{was used as a}} framework for investigating the commercial value of two researched projects originating from within Victoria University. The LSM was also applied to a third project founded by the Master of Advanced Technology Enterprise (MATE) team. The LSM process is shown to assist in the discovery of both <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> <b>latent</b> customer needs. However, which one the framework favours depends on whether the product or the market is the primary driver of the validation process. In one instance the entrepreneur is deliberately looking to discover a present market need in order to align it with a pre-defined solution, while the alternative is to study the market in order to identify an opportunity followed by the development of a specific solution. The latter is shown to support becoming market oriented. The findings also suggest Domain Knowledge plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining market-oriented approach to customer development. Domain knowledge aids in understanding market data in order to extract novel and meaningful insights. Establishing close relationships with emerging customers and „lead users‟ in a particular market is shown to be an effective method of compensating for a lack of domain knowledge. What‟s more, the presence of preconceived prototypes is shown to negatively impact on the entrepreneur‟s ability to approach customer development in a market-oriented manner. By drawing on the MATE team‟s experiences, this thesis aims to provide practical lessons for individuals and teams that are looking to take a market-oriented approach to customer development...|$|E

Our system, QM-search, will have an unlimited number of these, which will be customizable by the digital librarian for the target community and collections, and even customizeable from user to user or search to search. Some basic examples of quality indicators that digital libraries might be able to exploit would be activations (views online or check-outs in circulation), selection (compilation in bookmark lists online or additions to course reserves lists), extent of review (from a peer-reviewed journal, conference, or not?), or citation-based metrics. The ouput of QM-search will be in a completely generalized XML format, with the search results represented as a structure based on the structure specified in the input organization spec. This XML output can be transformed into presentation HTML resembling anything from a linear Google-like search results list to an A 9 -like column display to more exotic groupings and breakdowns.

40|$|Interpersonal {{forgiveness}} {{has been}} identified as an important way of overcoming the hurts and offenses that often occur during social interaction, thereby helping to maintain valuable relationships. In adults, it has been associated with greater psychological and even physical health. Because children also experiences hurts and offenses in their social interactions, forgiveness is arguably as important for children as it is for adults. However, studies of children’s forgiveness have not flourished to the extent that studies of adults’ forgiveness have. This thesis proposes that one reason for the lack of research on children’s forgiveness is the absence of appropriate measures of children’s forgiveness. Existing measures of preadolescent children’s forgiveness are argued to be potentially unsatisfactory for stand-alone use with preadolescent child samples for a variety of reasons, including limitations of self-report methodology, developmental difficulties for children in responding to self-report questionnaires and reporting on emotional responses, the need for child-focused research methods, and uncertainty over children’s interpretation of the term ‘forgive’. An initial study of children’s everyday understandings of the term ‘forgive’ suggested that they tended to emphasise overt responses to apology and that single-item explicit measures may therefore be unsuitable to measure emotional forgiveness in preadolescent samples. However, children’s descriptions of emotional and behavioural aspects of forgiving informed the development of a pictorial measure, the Children’s Forgiveness Card Set, designed to overcome potential difficulties children may experience in responding to traditional questionnaire measures. A pilot study examining children’s interpretation of Card Set illustrations in response to a hypothetical scenario suggested children generally interpreted illustrations as intended; some adjustments were, however, implemented for some illustrations. A second pilot study tested interpretability by asking children to categorise illustrations as forgiving, unforgiving, or having nothing to do with forgiving. Children frequently categorised general emotional responses as having nothing to do with forgiving, possibly due to the omission of a hypothetical scenario. An experimental study therefore re-examined validity of the Card Set by assessing children’s Card Set responses to a hypothetical scenario with manipulation of transgressor apology (apology vs. no apology). While Card Set responses correlated with an explicit measure, unexpectedly they were not predicted by apology nor correlated with perceived transgressor remorse. A final experimental study comprised a factor analysis and comparison of the Card Set with a latent questionnaire measure and an explicit measure. Following elimination of one card, Card Set responses were found to correlate with both the <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> <b>latent</b> measure but again were not predicted by apology; however this was also true of emotion-based responses on the latent measure. Interactions were found between apology and participant age and between apology and the order of presentation of the Card Set. Overall, results suggest that the Children’s Forgiveness Card Set may be a useful measure of children’s underlying emotional forgiveness, as opposed to overt, deliberative or decisional forgiveness. This measure therefore contributes a potential way to assess differences in children’s overt forgiveness and underlying emotional responses to transgression, including differential prediction of these types of forgiveness in children.

40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{focus on}} data publication and discovery in materials science and related fields, the global view of materials data is highly sparse. This sparsity encourages training models on {{the union of}} multiple datasets, but simple unions can prove problematic as (ostensibly) equivalent properties may be measured or computed differently depending on the data source. These hidden contextual differences introduce irreducible errors into analyses, fundamentally limiting their accuracy. Transfer learning, where information from one dataset is used to inform a model on another, {{can be an effective}} tool for bridging sparse data while preserving the contextual differences in the underlying measurements. Here, we describe and compare three techniques for transfer learning: multi-task, difference, <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> <b>latent</b> variable architectures. We show that difference architectures are most accurate in the multi-fidelity case of mixed DFT and experimental band gaps, while multi-task most improves classification performance of color with band gaps. For activation energies of steps in NO reduction, the explicit latent variable method is not only the most accurate, but also enjoys cancellation of errors in functions that depend on multiple tasks. These results motivate the publication of high quality materials datasets that encode transferable information, independent of industrial or academic interest in the particular labels, and encourage further development and application of transfer learning methods to materials informatics problems...|$|R
