25|$|He was {{relatively}} sparing in {{his use of}} camera movements and close-ups, preferring static medium or long shots, with his players framed against dramatic vistas or interiors lit in an Expressionistic style, although he often used panning shots and sometimes used a dramatic <b>dolly</b> <b>in</b> (e.g. John Wayne's first appearance in Stagecoach).

25|$|With the cloning of a sheep {{known as}} <b>Dolly</b> <b>in</b> 1996 by somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT), {{the idea of}} human cloning became a hot debate topic. Many nations outlawed it, while a few scientists promised to make a clone {{within the next few}} years. The first hybrid human clone was created in November 1998, by Advanced Cell Technology. It was created using SCNT - a nucleus was taken from a man's leg cell and inserted into a cow's egg from which the nucleus had been removed, and the hybrid cell was cultured, and developed into an embryo. The embryo was destroyed after 12 days.|$|E

25|$|Collins's seminal {{recording}} {{is considered}} by many to be Anthems in Eden, released in 1969 (and the first to be credited to Shirley and Dolly Collins). It featured a suite of songs centred on the changes in rural England brought about by the First World War. Dolly Collins created arrangements featuring David Munrow and various other players from his Early Music Consort. The highly unusual combination of ancient instruments included rebecs, sackbuts, viols and crumhorns. Several critics have suggested that it is impossible to imagine that electric accompaniment for traditional song, as successfully purveyed by Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, could have developed quite as it did without the pioneering Anthems in Eden. All these recordings strove to marry a deep love and understanding of the English folk music heritage with a more contemporary attitude to musical settings. Anthems in Eden was followed by Love, Death and the Lady, also co-credited with <b>Dolly,</b> <b>in</b> 1970.|$|E

500|$|The use of film, {{rather than}} digital, cameras {{added to the}} [...] "old-fashioned" [...] nature of the production. Two main Panavision cameras, a {{high-speed}} Arri 435 camera capable of shooting at 150 frames per second, a Steadicam, and VistaVision cameras for visual effect shots were among the equipment used to bring the book to the big screen. As {{with the use of}} specific colors, the different cameras and shooting setups would help serve the story points. When Bella was with Edward, the camera was moved on a <b>dolly,</b> <b>in</b> a very rigid, straight line to reflect how their relationship was [...] "perfect". When Bella is with Jacob, the Steadicam provided a fluid and organic style; and when she is with her schoolmates, a slangy visual language was reflected by a handheld.|$|E
500|$|The inland U.S. {{state of}} New Mexico has {{experienced}} impacts from 81known tropical cyclones and their remnants. There have been 68known tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific that affected the state, {{compared to only}} 13such Atlantic hurricanes.

2500|$|The {{tropical}} storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula near Cancún early on July21, leaving at least 17people dead in Guatemala, and {{one person in}} the Yucatán.
