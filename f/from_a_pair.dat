5|$|With {{a history}} {{stretching}} {{to the time}} following World War I, Roanoke Regional Airport has evolved <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of dirt runways and a single hangar to a fully equipped, modern airport serving multiple commercial airlines. Today the airport features a terminal building completed in 1989, a pair of asphalt runways, and a control tower completed in 2005 that serves {{the residents of the}} greater Roanoke Valley.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E

To {{pay for her}} treatments, Hsin attends an {{underground}} lottery in which participants either win money or lose an organ, depending on tiles chosen <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of vases. One man wins the lottery but selects a bad tile, and his body is found later that day. Scully performs an autopsy and finds {{that he had been}} selling body parts, noticing his numerous surgical scars.

5|$|Torosaurus is a ceratopsid genus first {{identified}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of skulls in 1891, {{two years}} after the identification of Triceratops. The Torosaurus genus resembles Triceratops in geological age, distribution, anatomy and physical size and it has been recognised as a close relative. Its distinguishing features are an elongated skull and the presence of two fenestrae, or holes, in the frill. Paleontologists investigating dinosaur ontogeny (growth and development of individuals over the life span) in the Hell Creek Formation, Montana, US, have recently presented evidence that the two represent a single genus.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E

5|$|The {{shipping}} channel {{approaching the}} Fox River in Green Bay was changed {{a number of}} times in order to accommodate vessels of increasing draft. The Army Corps of Engineers also modified the channel in the mid 1920's. The Green Bay Harbor Entrance buoy was established in 1927 to mark this point until the Bureau of Lighthouses could obtain funds for a more permanent solution. The acetylene buoy emitted a flash of 0.3 seconds duration every 3 seconds and had a wave-activated bell. The light {{is one of the few}} on the Great Lakes still powered by submarine cable. It is issued <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of 300mm Tideland Signal ML300 acrylic optics mounted on the gallery railing. Because the light is too far out to be seen well from shore, the only good view of it is from a boat.|$|E

25|$|Under {{moderate}} usage, {{a pair of}} pointe shoes will typically last through ten {{to twenty}} hours of wear. For dance students, this often translates into weeks or months of serviceable use <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of pointe shoes. Professional dancers typically wear out pointe shoes much more quickly; a new pair may wear out in a single performance. As a result, most professional ballet companies provide shoe allowances for their dancers to defray the cost of frequent shoe replacement.|$|E

There is variation between individual trees in the timing of flowering, and in the shade and brightness of the flowers. In isolated populations genetic drift has resulted in local variation: many of the trees growing around the Rotorua lakes produce pink-shaded flowers, and the yellow-flowered cultivar 'Aurea' descends <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> discovered in 1940 on Mōtiti Island in the Bay of Plenty.|$|E

Chasing one around in circles, rearing and bucking like a wild mustang, until he finally runs him off of a cliff, he sneaks up behind the other and nudges him with his nose over the ledge and into the watering hole. He then nose prods the now clothed young woman back to her father.|$|E

From these he obtained four ducklings, but these latter, when grown up, proved infertile, and did not breed again.

25|$|In {{handwritten}} text, {{the actual}} {{form of the}} extra marking may vary <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of dots {{to a pair of}} short vertical bars, to a single horizontal bar, or to a wavy line resembling a tilde. In practice, almost any diacritic situated above the base glyph (for example, á ā ã) would probably be interpreted as a carelessly written pair of dots (ä). However, in computerized character sets, these alternatives are incorrect. The front-vowel counterpart of u using the glyph y rather than ü is carried over from Swedish, and additionally avoids confusion in cursive script with ii, which is common in Finnish.|$|E
25|$|The Lithobiomorpha, {{also known}} as stone centipedes, {{represent}} the other main group of anamorphic centipedes; they also reach a mature segment count of 15 trunk segments. This group has lost the compound eyes, and sometimes has no eyes altogether. Instead, its eyes have a single ocellus {{or a group of}} ocelli. Its spiracles are paired and can be found laterally. Every leg-bearing segment of this organism has a separate tergite, these alternating in length apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of long tergites on each of segments 7 and 8. It also has relatively short antennae and legs compared to the Scutigeromorpha. Two families are included, the Henicopidae and Lithobiidae.|$|E
