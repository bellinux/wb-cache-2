2500|$|The [...] "calotype", or [...] "talbotype", was a [...] "developing out" [...] process, Talbot's {{improvement}} {{of his earlier}} photogenic drawing process {{by the use of}} a different silver salt (silver iodide instead of silver chloride) and a developing agent (<b>gallic</b> <b>acid</b> and silver nitrate) to bring out an invisibly slight [...] "latent" [...] image on the exposed paper. This reduced the required exposure time in the camera to only a minute or two for subjects in bright sunlight. The translucent calotype negative made it possible to produce as many positive prints as desired by simple contact printing, whereas the daguerreotype was an opaque direct positive that could only be reproduced by copying it with a camera. On the other hand, the calotype, despite waxing of the negative to make the image clearer, still was not pin-sharp like the metallic daguerreotype, because the paper fibres degraded the printed image. The simpler salted paper process was normally used when making prints from calotype negatives.|$|E
2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and <b>gallic</b> <b>acid</b> found in the wood.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the synergistic antibacterial effect of phenolic compound mixtures against Listeria monocytogenes in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium, and to select the best mixture for testing their antibacterial activity in a meat model system. In BHI medium, the most effective mixtures were those of <b>gallic</b> and caffeic <b>acids,</b> <b>gallic</b> and protocatechuic <b>acids,</b> and rutin and quercetin. At the concentration of 200 mg/L, the mixtures of gallic and protocatechuic, then <b>gallic</b> and caffeic <b>acids,</b> and quercetin and rutin {{reduced the number of}} inoculated cells. At the concentration of 100 mg/L, only the quer-cetin and rutin mixture produced the same synergistic effect. These combinations were se-lected for testing in meat. At 20 °C, 100 mg/L of gallic and protocatechuic, then <b>gallic</b> and caffeic <b>acid,</b> and rutin and quercetin mixtures decreased the growth of L. monocytogenes, as compared to the control.

40|$|The {{influence}} of seven phenolic compounds, normally present in wine, {{on the growth}} and arginine deiminase system (ADI) of Lactobacillus hilgardii X 1 B, a wine lactic acid bacterium, was established. This system provides energy for bacterial growth and produces citrulline that reacts with ethanol forming the carcinogen ethyl carbamate (EC), found in some wines. The {{influence of}} phenolic compounds on bacterial growth was compound dependent. Growth and final pH values increased in presence of arginine. Arginine consumption decreased in presence of protocatechuic and <b>gallic</b> <b>acids</b> (31 and 17 %, respectively) and increased in presence of quercetin, rutin, catechin and the caffeic and vanillic phenolic acids (between 10 and 13 %, respectively). ADI enzyme activities varied in presence of phenolic compounds. Rutin, quercetin and caffeic and vanillic acids stimulated the enzyme arginine deiminase about 37 - 40 %. Amounts of 200 mg/L <b>gallic</b> and protocatechuic <b>acids</b> inhibited the arginine deiminase enzyme between 53 and 100 %, respectively. Ornithine transcarbamylase activity was not modified at all concentrations of phenolic compounds.

40|$|Chlorogenic acid (CGA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} polyphenols in the human diet and is suggested to be a potential antiatherosclerotic agent due to its proposed hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CGA on atherosclerosis development in ApoE 2 / 2 mice and its potential mechanism. ApoE 2 / 2 mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet without (control) or with CGA (200 and 400 mg/kg) or atorvastatin (4 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. During the study plasma lipid and inflammatory parameters were determined. Treatment with CGA (400 mg/ kg) reduced atherosclerotic lesion area and vascular dilatation in the aortic root, comparable to atorvastatin. CGA (400 mg/ kg) also significantly decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol as well as inflammatory markers. Supplementation with CGA or CGA metabolites-containing serum suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) -induced lipid accumulation and stimulated cholesterol efflux from RAW 264. 7 cells. CGA significantly increased the mRNA levels of PPARc, LXRa, ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 as well as the transcriptional activity of PPARc.

40|$|Fructophilic {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (FLAB) are strongly associated to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of Apis mellifera L. worker bees due to the consumption of fructose as a major carbohydrate. Seventy-seven presumptive {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) were isolated from GIT of healthy A. mellifera L. adults, which were collected from 5 different geographical locations of Apulia region (Italy). Almost all the isolates showed fructophilic tendencies, which were identified as Lactobacillus kunkeei (69 %) or Fructobacillus fructosus (31 %). A high-throughput phenotypic microarray, targeting 190 carbon sources, {{was used to determine}} that 83 compounds were differentially consumed. Phenotyping grouped the strains into two clusters, reflecting growth performance. The utilization of phenolic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, syringic or <b>gallic</b> <b>acids,</b> as electron acceptors was investigated in fructose based medium.
