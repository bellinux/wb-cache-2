5|$|Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, overall {{commander}} on the Western Front, {{reported to}} Hitler in October 1943 regarding the weak defences in France. This {{led to the}} appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall, with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> many of these obstacles to be placed at the high-tide mark. The terrain at Utah is flat, offering no high ground on which to place fortifications. The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to , depending on the tides. The Germans flooded the flat land behind the beach by damming up streams and opening the floodgates {{at the mouth of the}} Douve to admit seawater.|$|E

5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> many of these obstacles to be placed at the high water mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the Luftwaffe and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support. The Luftwaffe could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

Given the Allied air supremacy (4,029 Allied aircraft assigned to operations in Normandy plus 5,514 aircraft assigned to bombing and defence, versus 570 Luftwaffe planes stationed in France and the Low Countries), booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) were set up in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. <b>He</b> <b>ordered</b> machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Allenby's {{plan was}} to avoid {{fighting}} in or near Jerusalem but to cut all road access {{to the city and}} force the Ottoman Army to evacuate it. <b>He</b> <b>ordered</b> two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J. Hill) and the 75th Division (Major General P. C. Palin), and two mounted divisions; the Yeomanry and the Australian Mounted Divisions to begin the advance.

5|$|At 11:30 Sefik told Kemal {{that the}} ANZACs had a beachhead of around , {{and that he}} would attack towards Ari Burnu, in {{conjunction}} with the 19th Division. Around midday Kemal was appraised that the 9th Division was fully involved with the British landings at Cape Helles, and could not support his attack, so at 12:30 <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> two battalions of the 77th Infantry Regiment (the third battalion was guarding Suvla Bay) to move forward between the 57th and 27th Infantry Regiments. At the same time <b>he</b> <b>ordered</b> his reserve 72nd Infantry Regiment to move further west. Within the next half-hour the 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments started the counter-attack, supported by three batteries of artillery. At 13:00 Kemal met with his corps commander Esat Pasha and convinced him of the need to react in strength to the ANZAC landings. Esat agreed and released the 72nd and 27th Infantry Regiments to Kemal's command. Kemal deployed the four regiments from north to south; 72nd, 57th, 27th and 77th. In total, Turkish strength opposing the landing numbered between ten thousand and twelve thousand men.|$|E
