5|$|Greatly {{expanding}} his {{familiarity with}} historical and social subjects, Kogălniceanu also {{began work on}} his first volumes: a pioneering study on the Romani people and the French-language Histoire de la Valachie, de la Moldavie et des Valaques transdanubiens ("A History of Wallachia, Moldavia, and of Transdanubian Vlachs", the first volume in a synthesis of Romanian history), {{both of which were}} first published in 1837 inside the German Confederation. He was becoming repulsed by the existence of Roma slavery in his country, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study,</b> cited the example of active abolitionists in Western countries.|$|E
5|$|His mysticism is {{informed}} by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman used <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of schizophrenia. He co-wrote {{the book with}} James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E

5|$|Willard Spiegelman, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other explanations, and William Ober claims that Keats's description of indolence may have arisen {{from the use of}} opium.|$|E
5|$|Chartwell is {{a country}} house {{near the town of}} Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the {{property}} in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study,</b> he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965.|$|E
5|$|M {{is another}} {{character}} {{who is more}} fully realised {{than in the previous}} novels, {{and for the first time}} in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|E

5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> carrel {{when he was a}} graduate student in the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> {{and promotion of}} the concept of a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|They {{are named}} after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German {{engineer}} who pioneered {{the study of}} machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, {{as well as in}} graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E

5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E
5|$|While {{vacationing in}} Vail, Colorado, Ford was hospitalized {{for two days}} in July 2006 for {{shortness}} of breath. On August 15 he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for testing and evaluation. On August 21, {{it was reported that}} he had been fitted with a pacemaker. On August 25, he underwent an angioplasty procedure at the Mayo Clinic. On August 28, Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On October 13, he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, but due to poor health and on the advice of his doctors he did not attend. The previous day, Ford had entered the Eisenhower Medical Center for undisclosed tests; he was released on October 16. By November 2006, he was confined to a bed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{spent the}} summer after college in the San Juan {{volcanic}} field of Colorado working with volcanologist Pete Lipman <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of two extinct calderas. This work became {{the inspiration for the}} first phase of his graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San Juans. Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes. Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a geophysical survey of Mount Augustine in Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the felsic (silicic) magmas with less-viscous mafic (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation aircraft.|$|E

50|$|He {{attended}} French {{schools from}} 1840, {{but was not}} very bright <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>studies.</b> He was then sent to the Gymnasium Bommel, where his uncle was the rector where he studied up to 1855. From 1855 to 1860, Pleyte studied theology at the Opzoomer college of Utrecht University. He found the subject of theology to his liking and did well <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>In</b> 1860, he completed his education successfully.|$|R

25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning {{the first thing he did}} was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E
