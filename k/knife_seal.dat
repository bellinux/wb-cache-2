40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to provide {{additional}} data to supplement the work reported in NASA/CR- 2015 - 218868 (Berdanier and Key, 2015 b). The aim of that project was to characterize the fundamental flow physics and the overall performance effects due to increased rotor tip clearance heights in axial compressors. Data have been collected in the three-stage axial research compressor at Purdue University with a specific focus on analyzing the multistage effects resulting from the tip leakage flow. Three separate rotor tip clearances were studied with nominal tip clearance gaps of 1. 5 percent, 3. 0 percent, and 4. 0 percent based on a constant annulus height. Overall compressor performance was previously investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, and 68 percent) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations. This study extends the previously published results to include detailed steady and time-resolved pressure data at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 percent corrected speedline for the intermediate clearance level (3. 0 percent). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each stator row are supported by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data were combined with existing three-component velocity measurements to identify a novel technique for calculating blockage in a multistage compressor. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 percent corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements reveal new knowledge about the trajectory of the tip leakage flow through the rotor passage. Further, these data extend previous measurements identifying a modulation of the tip leakage flow due to upstream stator wake propagation. Finally, a novel instrumentation technique has been implemented to measure pressures in the shrouded stator cavities. These data provide boundary conditions relating to the flow across the shrouded stator <b>knife</b> <b>seal</b> teeth. Moreover, the utilization of fast-response pressure sensors provides a new look at the time-resolved pressure field, leading to instantaneous differential pressures across the seal teeth. Ultimately, the data collected for this project represent a unique data set which contributes to build a better understanding of the tip leakage flow field and its associated loss mechanisms. These data will facilitate future engine design goals leading to small blade heights in the rear stages of high pressure compressors and aid in the development of new blade designs which are desensitized to the performance penalties attributed to rotor tip leakage flows...|$|E
40|$|As {{fuel prices}} soar ever higher, {{aircraft}} manufacturers and their airline customers {{demand that the}} next generation of engines used on their aircraft push the limits of efficiency and capability. This study consists of a computational examination of two currently accepted methods of axial compressor performance improvement in terms of surge margin and efficiency, rotor casing treatments and stator land seals. ADPAC and Fluent CFD solvers were used in the analysis of circumferential groove casing treatments and two types of stator seals, one typical of a front stage stator and one typical of a rear stage stator. The computational solutions and visualizations allowed for greater understanding of the complex flows inherent in each of these features. It was found that rotor tip vortex control plays a large part in the surge margin gains from a circumferential groove casing treatment. The efficiency gains of <b>knife</b> <b>seals</b> were dependent primarily on the gap size of the seals...|$|R

GCYLT (gas cylindrical seals [...] turbulent), SPIRALI (spiral-groove seals [...] incompressible), KTK (knife to <b>knife)</b> Labyrinth <b>Seal</b> Code, and DYSEAL (dynamic seal analysis) are covered. CGYLT uses G-factors for Poiseuille and Couette turbulence coefficients. SPIRALI is updated to include turbulence and inertia, but maintains the narrow groove theory. KTK labyrinth seal code handles straight or stepped seals. And DYSEAL provides dynamics for the seal geometry...|$|R
50|$|Another {{widely used}} method to seal through glass with low {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion {{is the use}} of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp. The disadvantage here is that the tip of the edge which is a local point of high tensile stress reaches through the wall of the glass container. This can lead to low gas leakages. In the tube to tube <b>knife</b> edge <b>seal</b> the edge is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall.|$|R
50|$|If {{large parts}} of copper are to be fitted to glass like the water cooled copper anode of a high power radio {{transmitter}} tube or an x-ray tube historically the Houskeeper <b>knife</b> edge <b>seal</b> is used. Here {{the end of a}} copper tube is machined to a sharp knife edge, invented by O. Kruh in 1917. In the method described by W.G. Houskeeper the outside or the inside of thecopper tube right to the knife edge is wetted with glass and connected to the glass tube. In later descriptions the knife edge is just wetted several millimeters deep with glass, usually deeper on the inside, and then connected to the glass tube.|$|R
40|$|Labyrinth {{air seal}} static and dynamic {{performance}} was evaluated using solid, abradable, and honeycomb lands with standard and advanced seal designs. The effects on leakage of land surface roughness, abradable land porosity, rub grooves in abradable lands, and honeycomb land cell size and depth were studied using a standard labyrinth seal. The effects of rotation on the optimum <b>seal</b> <b>knife</b> pitch were also investigated. Selected geometric and aerodynamic parameters for an advanced seal design were evaluated to derive an optimized performance configuration. The rotational energy requirements were also measured {{to determine the}} inherent friction and pumping energy absorbed by the various <b>seal</b> <b>knife</b> and land configurations tested in order to properly assess the net seal system performance level. Results indicate that: (1) seal leakage can be significantly affected with honeycomb or abradable lands; (2) rotational energy absorption does not vary significantly {{with the use of}} a solid-smooth, an abradable, or a honeycomb land; and (3) optimization of an advanced lab seal design produced a configuration that had leakage 25 % below a conventional stepped seal...|$|R
40|$|Major program {{objectives}} were the continued development of NiCrAlY feltmetal and honeycomb systems for <b>knife</b> edge <b>seal</b> {{applications in the}} 1144 to 1366 K temperature range, and to initiate abradable seal material evaluation for blade tip seal applications in the 1366 to 1589 K temperature range. Larger fiber size, higher density feltmetal showed greatly improved erosion resistance with a slight reduction in abradability compared to the baseline feltmetal. Pack aluminide coating of the honeycomb extended the oxidation resistance and slightly improved the abradability of this material. Evaluation through selected abradability, erosion and oxidation testing, and pertinent metallography led to selection of a plasma sprayed yttria stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2) /CoCrAlY layered system as the system with the most potential to meet the 1589 K requirement for blade tip seals. This system demonstrated structural integrity, erosion resistance, and some degree of abradability...|$|R

40|$|A sample return {{container}} {{is being}} developed by Honeybee Robotics to receive samples from a derivative of the Champollion/ST 4 Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism or other samplers and then hermetically seal samples for a sample return mission. The container is enclosed in a phase change material (PCM) chamber to prevent phase change during return and re-entry to earth. This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for interfacing, transfer-ring and sealing samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths. The drill based sampler indexes each canister to the sample transfer position, below the index interface for sample transfer. After sample transfer is completed, the sampler indexes a seal carrier, which lines up seals with the openings of the canisters. The sampler moves to the sealing interface and seals the sample canisters one by one. The sealing interface can be designed to work with C-seals, <b>knife</b> edge <b>seals</b> and cup seals. Again, the sampler provides all sealing actuation. This sample return container and co-engineered sample acquisition system are being developed by Honeybee Robotics {{in collaboration with the}} JPL Exploration Technology program...|$|R
40|$|A pendulum-type {{test device}} {{has been built}} for use in {{studying}} rubs between a turbine or compressor blade tip or labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>knife</b> edge and specimens of abradable gas path seal materials. The device allows measurement of the rub energy dissipated in a single wear event, along with friction and normal forces and wear. Subsequent rubs over the same surface can also be monitored, with microscopic observation of the rub surface being possible after any of the passes. The device was used in tests of several potential abradable materials, ranging from porous to fully dense. It was shown that the rub energy dissipated in initial and subsequent passes is a fundamental parameter {{in the evaluation of}} material abradability. Rub energy was found to be influenced by such factors as: density and tensile (or yield) strength of the abradable material, prior densification or work hardening of the rub surface, and the sharpness of {{the leading edge of the}} blade tip...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA dense cermet {{membrane}} {{consisting of}} tantalum metal and yttria-stabilized zirconia {{has been developed}} for separation of hydrogen from hydrogen containing gas mixtures. Ta/YSZ membrane without secondary phase {{can be obtained by}} mechanical polishing after high vacuum sintering. As-prepared membrane showed dense structure with continuous channel of tantalum. Hydrogen permeation experiments were conducted using different cell to investigate the optimum sealing method. Hydrogen fluxes through these cermet membranes were measured in the region of 350 – 500  °C. The permeation flux increased monotonically with increasing the temperature. The highest hydrogen flux was 1. 2  ml/min⋅cm 2 for a cermet membrane of 0. 5  mm cm thick at 300 °C using 100 % H 2 as the feed gas and Ar as the sweep gas.

5000|$|In 1817 Kelly {{anchored}} in Otago Harbour. The local chief Korako failed to ferry over Māori from Whareakeake {{who wanted to}} receive their share of Tucker's gifts. When Kelly, Tucker and five others later went in an open boat along the coast to Whareakeake, the Māori there attacked them, killing Tucker and two others because of this slight, {{but also because of}} the general souring of relations since the incident of 1810. Kelly and the remainder retreated to the Sophia, only to find it occupied by Māori, intent - they believed - on attacking them. Armed with <b>sealing</b> <b>knives,</b> the Tongata Bulla drove the invaders off, resisted another attack, then destroyed [...] "all their navy" [...] and burnt [...] "the beautiful city of Otago". The death toll remains much disputed, but while Kelly probably exaggerated the extent of his revenge, it seems likely he killed several people wholly innocent of the killing of his men.|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{interface}} clearances is {{the most}} cost effective method of enhancing turbomachinery performance. Seals control turbomachinery leakages, coolant flows and contribute to overall system rotordynamic stability. In many instances, sealing interfaces and coatings are sacrificial, like lubricants, giving up their integrity {{for the benefit of}} the component. They are subjected to abrasion, erosion, oxidation, incursive rubs, foreign object damage (FOD) and deposits as well as extremes in thermal, mechanical, aerodynamic and impact loadings. Tribological pairing of materials control how well and how long these interfaces will be effective in controlling flow. A variety of seal types and materials are required to satisfy turbomachinery sealing demands. These seals must be properly designed to maintain the interface clearances. In some cases, this will mean machining adjacent surfaces, yet in many other applications, coatings are employed for optimum performance. Many seals are coating composites fabricated on superstructures or substrates that are coated with sacrificial materials which can be refurbished either in situ or by removal, stripping, recoating and replacing until substrate life is exceeded. For blade and <b>knife</b> tip <b>sealing</b> an important class of materials known as abradables permit blade or knife rubbing without significant damage or wear to the rotating element while maintaining an effective sealing interface. Most such tip interfaces are passive, yet some, as for the high-pressure turbine (HPT) case or shroud, are actively controlled. This work presents an overview of turbomachinery sealing. Areas covered include: characteristics of gas and steam turbine sealing applications and environments, benefits of sealing, types of standard static and dynamics seals, advanced seal designs, as well as life and limitations issues...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} carried out to address {{issues related to the}} observed cracking of the titanium knife edges on the labyrinth seals of the high pressure fuel pump (HPFP) in the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Thermal shock experiments were carried out using a jet specimen with geometry similar to the knife edge geometry. These tests demonstrate that cracking of the titanium alloy is possible in a situation involving repeated thermal cycles over a wide temperature range, as might be realized during a rub in the liquid hydrogen fuel pump. High speed rub interaction tests were conducted using a representative <b>knife</b> edge and <b>seal</b> geometry over a broad range of interaction rates. Alternative materials were also experimentally evaluated. These tests provide information which can be used to design improved labyrinth seals for the HPFP of the SSME. In particular, plasma-sprayed aluminum-graphite was found to be significantly better than aluminum alloy seals used at present from the standpoint of rub performance. Ion nitriding of the titanium alloy knife edges was also found to improve rub performance compared with the untreated baseline knife edge material...|$|R
