500|$|Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new {{technique}} at the time which Corsaro believed {{was going to be}} the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent. To ensure this, Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24-track <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> and a Sony F1 two-track for the 12-bit mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's [...] "R room". Corsaro then placed gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 tube microphone, with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano, while Rodgers also played a Synclavier. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: [...] "Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left".|$|E
50|$|In practice, AAD was {{uncommon}} and DAD {{was very}} rare, as many companies (especially the well-known classical music labels) used <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> (which was not prohibitively {{more expensive than}} analog <b>tape</b> <b>recorders)</b> during the editing or mixing stage.|$|R

2500|$|Built {{with the}} intent for {{eventual}} interstellar travel, Voyager 2 included a large, [...] parabolic, high-gain antenna (...) to transceive data via the Deep Space Network on the Earth. Communications are conducted over the S-band (about 13cm wavelength) and X-band (about 3.6cm wavelength) providing data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter, and then ever-decreasing as the distance increased, because of the inverse-square law. When the spacecraft is unable to communicate with Earth, the <b>Digital</b> <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorder</b> (DTR) can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} Galileo high-gain antenna meant that data storage {{to the tape}} {{recorder}} for later compression and playback was absolutely crucial {{in order to obtain}} any substantial information from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. In October 1995, Galileo four-track, 114-megabyte <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> which was manufactured by Odetics Corporation, remained stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and sent commands to shut it off. Though the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction possibly damaged a length of tape {{at the end of the}} reel. This section of tape was subsequently declared [...] "off limits" [...] to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase, in order to focus solely on recording data sent from the Jupiter probe descent.|$|E

50|$|As <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> only became widely {{available}} in the late 1970s, almost all recordings prior to this date that appear on CD will be AAD or ADD—having been digitally remastered. This means that the original analog master tape has been converted (transcribed) to digital. It does not always imply {{that there has been}} any additional editing or mixing, although this may have taken place.|$|R

50|$|Orbiting Mars at an {{approximate}} speed of 3.4 km/s, the spacecraft would travel around Mars in a north to south, polar orbit. As the spacecraft circles the planet, horizon sensors indicate {{the orientation of}} the spacecraft while the reaction wheels would maintain {{the orientation of the}} instruments, towards Mars. The chosen orbit was also sun-synchronous, allowing the daylit side of Mars to always be captured during the mid-afternoon of each Martian Sol. While some instruments could provide a real-time data link when Earth was in view of the spacecraft, data would also be recorded to the <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> and played back to Earth each day. Over 75 gigabytes of scientific data was expected to be yielded during the primary mission, much more than any previous mission to Mars. The end of the operable life for the spacecraft was expected to be limited by the supply of propellant and the condition of the batteries.|$|R

40|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the musical Gambler, a dancer steps across the stage through a tunnel of light {{projected}} by a laser and scanning mirrors. He reaches up into the projected light so that his fingers interrupt the beam to create stripes on the tunnel wall.

Members of the audience sit beneath the beams, but the safety of the performers depends on synchronizing the limelight (stage lighting) and the laser beams with the music to an accuracy of less than 40 ms. Erie Woolfson, an ex-member of pop group Alan Parsons Project, composed the music, which is reproduced from <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> A master <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> produces a time code and feeds it to the main lighting panel.
