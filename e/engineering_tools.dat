5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E

The DNA binding region of a TAL effector can be combined with the cleavage domain of a meganuclease to create a hybrid architecture combining the ease of engineering and highly specific DNA binding activity of a TAL effector with the low site frequency and specificity of a meganuclease.|$|E
25|$|Andijan {{remains an}} {{important}} industrial city in independent Uzbekistan. There are 48 large industrial plants and about 3,000 small and medium enterprises in the city.

Local industries were appointed to respond to war needs, assisting the country to provide the battle and home fronts with all materials needed. In the post-war years, Akmolinsk became a beacon of economic revival in {{the west of the}} Soviet Union ruined by the war. Additionally, many Russian-Germans were resettled here after being deported under Joseph Stalin's rule.|$|E

25|$|Although biofuel {{demand has}} risen to over one billion liters (about 260 million US gallons) yearly, {{fermentation}} remains a largely inefficient method of butanol production. Under normal living conditions, Clostridium bacterial communities have a low yield of butanol per gram of glucose. Obtaining higher yields of butanol involves manipulation of the metabolic networks within bacteria to prioritize the synthesis of the biofuel. Metabolic engineering and genetic <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> allow scientists to alter the states of reactions occurring in the organism, utilizing advanced techniques to create a bacterial strain capable of high butanol yield. Optimization can also be accomplished by the transfer of specific genetic information to other uni-cellular species, capitalizing on the traits of multiple organisms to achieve {{the highest rate of}} alcohol production.|$|E
