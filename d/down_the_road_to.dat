5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 36 {{hours of the}} Battle of Sharon between 04:30 on 19 September and 17:00 on 20 September, the EEF {{infantry}} continued fighting and marching forward, forcing the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills to retreat. The Eighth Ottoman Army virtually ceased to exist, excepting its Asia Corps, which together with the Seventh Ottoman Army {{was still in the}} Judean Hills between Nablus and Beisan, having lost most of their transport. The XXI Corps continued their advanced north–east to drive the enemy into and through the foothills towards Messudieh Junction, and then <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Jenin where they were captured by Australian light horse during the night of 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods {{east of the}} main road, and {{had more time to}} prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down the road or into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue coat that fooled Conger into thinking he was from Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates down the road, and captured McCausland's two pieces of artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} months of 1941, British and Belgian colonial forces {{attacked}} Italian East Africa from the colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. By the end of March, they had seized the town of Gambela and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Saïo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General Carlo De Simone and later General Pietro Gazzera. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Saïo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrolling, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the South African Air Force put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were moving <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> the rear. Many soldiers on foot {{were on the}} road. Champney tried repeatedly but in vain to get these men to stop and turn around. The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed {{that none of the}} retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried in vain to reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E
5|$|When the East India Company {{was taken}} over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, Whitehall until 1868, when it moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> the new India Office, which {{occupied}} part of the building still used by today's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in South Kensington, which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the Museum of Modern Art through the summer and spring.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division), {{which had}} been {{attached}} to the infantry in the Judean Hills, was ordered to rejoin their division at Jenin. The brigade doubled back to turn <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Jenin, arriving on dusk at 18:00 on 22 September to relieve the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which then withdrew to Afulah. The 4th Light Horse Brigade remained at Jenin until 22 September, when it was ordered back to Afulah, where they arrived at midday on 23 September. The 5th Light Horse Brigade was still at Jenin on 25 September, {{the last day of}} the Battle of Megiddo, when it was ordered to send a regiment to reinforce the 4th Light Horse Brigade's pre-dawn attack on Samakh. They charged against a well prepared German and Ottoman rearguard during the Battle of Samakh. Later in the day, one squadron of the 8th Light Horse Regiment, 3rd Light Horse Brigade approached Tiberias along the road from Nazareth, while a squadron from the 12th Light Horse Regiment, advanced north from Samakh. Together they captured Tiberias and 56 prisoners, half of which were German. The next day Allenby held a corps commanders' conference at Jenin where he ordered the pursuit to Damascus. Infantry from the 7th Brigade of the 3rd (Lahore) Division were detached to the Desert Mounted Corps to relieve the mounted and cavalry divisions of their garrison duties. The infantry took over the captured areas, marching via Jenin, and Nazareth, to arrive at Samakh on 28 September.|$|E
25|$|When {{their defense}} broke, some Confederates fled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Lynchburg while others retreated toward Appomattox Court House. When the {{retreating}} artillerymen stopped to {{fire at the}} Union cavalry from both directions, a group of Custer's cavalrymen broke up this further Confederate resistance.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{just won}} the race for Kholm, and {{positioned}} a mixed battlegroup of around 4,500 soldiers {{under the leadership of}} Generalmajor Scherer, but the group had virtually no artillery or anti tank guns. By 28 January 1942, the Soviets had closed the ring around Kholm and drove additional forces from the 218th Division under the divisional commander, Generalmajor Ukermann, back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Loknya, where the remainder of the division was still arriving.|$|E
25|$|The Wilderness Road {{served as}} a great path of {{commerce}} for the early settlers in Kentucky, {{as well as for}} coffles of slaves being transported through Tennessee to the new plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Horses, cattle, sheep and hogs herded in the other direction found waiting markets in the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Hogs in groups of 500 or more were driven <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> market. Beef in Eastern markets had become a main source of income for farmers in Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|When Lt.

Dagwell's company, under fire but with no one hit, charged the Confederates, sending them retreating <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Fairfax Station. Dagwell, Holmes and a few troops pursued the last of the fleeing Confederates, killing one and capturing a few others.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 1781, loyalist militia {{under the}} command of militia colonels David Fanning and Hector McNeill {{captured}} Governor Thomas Burke and thirteen high-ranking Whig officials in a daylight raid on Hillsborough on September 12, 1781.

He then stole a gold-coloured BMW by killing all four of its occupants. A short distance down the road he stopped beside a couple in a white Toyota and, drawing his weapon, ordered the male occupant into the boot of the BMW. After shutting the boot, he fired two shots into the windscreen of the Toyota, killing the female driver.|$|E

Emperor Napoleon I of France assigned the division to an ad hoc corps led by Marshal Jean Lannes. In the Battle of Abensberg on 20 April 1809, the corps fell upon the brigades of Ludwig Thierry and Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny near Rohr in Niederbayern. After initial resistance, the outnumbered and outgeneraled Austrians were soon fleeing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> Rottenburg an der Laaber with the cuirassiers slashing at the fugitives.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian sniper {{attacks and}} the need to clear every {{building}} led the 3 Para to be slowed in their attempts to link up with the Royal Marines. When Stockwell learned of the ceasefire to come into effect in five hours' time at 9:00 pm, he ordered Colonel Gibbon and his Centurions to race down and take al-Qantarah with all speed in order to improve the Allied bargaining position. What followed was a confused series of melee actions <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> al-Qantarah that ended with the British forces at al-Cap, a small village four miles north of al-Qantarah at 2:00am, when the ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, Fitz Lee {{attempted}} {{to attack the}} Union supply depot at White House, but Sheridan's arrival relieved the garrison there. On June 21, Sheridan crossed over the Pamunkey River, leading 900 wagons toward the James River. On June 24, Torbert's division escorted the wagons as Gregg's division followed a parallel route, protecting the right flank. At about 8 a.m., Gregg's division pushed back Confederate pickets {{to the north and}} entrenched to the west of Samaria Church (identified in Federal reports as St. Mary's Church). From 3 to 4 p.m., Hampton's five brigades attacked Gregg's two.
