40|$|Background: By {{the year}} 2030 {{the number of}} {{diabetic}} patients {{is expected to reach}} 366 million worldwide (World Health Organization [WHO], 2013). Methods: It was an intervention-facility based. The study focused on designing and implementing an educational and training program for <b>health</b> <b>educators</b> and to assess its effects on achievements of diabetes health educators; at Diabetic Health Centers in Khartoum State, Sudan; 2007 - 2010. The study population composed of diabetes <b>health</b> <b>educators</b> working in Diabetic Health Centers. Their total number was (36) and all were included in the study. Pre and post tests were done. Data was entered using SPSS. Parametric methods including t-test to assess result of training program before and after intervention were used. P-value ? 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Thirty six diabetes <b>health</b> <b>educators</b> attended the program. There was a significant statistical difference (p= 0. 001) between mean of Pre and post test concerning knowledge of diabetes <b>health</b> <b>educators.</b> To my knowledge there were no studies done, before, in Sudan to evaluate knowledge of diabetes <b>health</b> <b>educators</b> after attending an educational program in order to compare results with.
