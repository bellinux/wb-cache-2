40|$|The {{scheme of}} photon-number {{tomography}} {{is discussed in}} the framework of star-product quantization. The connection of dual quantization scheme and observables is reviewed. The quantizer and <b>dequantizer</b> operators and kernels of star product of tomograms in photon-number tomography scheme and its dual one are presented in explicit form. The fidelity and state purity are discussed in photon{number tomographic scheme, and the expressions for fidelity and purity are obtained in the form of integral of the product of two photon-number tomograms with integral kernel which is presented in explicit form. The properties of quantumness are discussed in terms of inequalities on state photon{number tomograms. Comment: the paper is submitted for publication in AIP Conference Serie...|$|E
40|$|Compressed sensing (CS) and 1 -bit CS cannot {{directly}} recover quantized {{signals and}} require time consuming recovery. In this paper, we introduce Hamming compressed sensing (HCS) that directly recovers a k-bit quantized signal of dimensional n from its 1 -bit measurements via invoking n times of Kullback-Leibler divergence based nearest neighbor search. Compared with CS and 1 -bit CS, HCS allows {{the signal to}} be dense, takes considerably less (linear) recovery time and requires substantially less measurements (O(log n)). Moreover, HCS recovery can accelerate the subsequent 1 -bit CS <b>dequantizer.</b> We study a quantized recovery error bound of HCS for general signals and “HCS+dequantizer ” recovery error bound for sparse signals. Extensive numerical simulations verify the appealing accuracy, robustness, efficiency and consistency of HCS...|$|E

The general properties of such sets are determined. An explicit description of all the minimum self-dual sets of <b>dequantizers</b> and quantizers for a qubit system is derived. The connection between some known sets of <b>dequantizers</b> and quantizers and the derived formulae is presented. Comment: 13 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{formalism}} of quantizers and <b>dequantizers,</b> we {{show that}} the characters of irreducible unitary representations of finite and compact groups provide kernels for star products of complex-valued functions of the group elements. Examples of permutation groups of two and three elements, {{as well as the}} SU(2) group, are considered. The k-deformed star products of functions on finite and compact groups are presented. The explicit form of the quantizers and <b>dequantizers,</b> and the duality symmetry of the considered star products are discussed.

40|$|DCT based JPEG {{compression}} is {{a widely}} used standard for lossy image compression. DCT concentrates energy into lower order coefficients. It removes redundancy between neighbouring pixels which leads to uncorrelated transform coefficients which can be encoded independently. There is high computational complexity in DCT. DHT is a real valued transform whose forward and inverse transforms are same except for a an inclusion of a scale factor in the inverse transform. DHT reduces the computational complexity of JPEG compared to DCT. DHT doesn’t require a <b>dequantizer</b> at the decoder, since a new quantization technique known as energy quantization is used. It speeds up the encoding procedure, reduces hardware as well as makes the implementation simpler. The quality of the reconstructed image is very good which is verified using MATLAB i. e. the PSNR is improved and the MSE is reduced...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{following}} the Compressed Sensing paradigm, we study {{the problem of}} recovering sparse or compressible signals from uniformly quantized measurements. We present {{a new class of}} convex optimization programs, or decoders, coined Basis Pursuit <b>DeQuantizer</b> of moment p (BPDQp), that model the quantization distortion more faithfully than the commonly used Basis Pursuit DeNoise (BPDN) program. Our decoders proceed by minimizing the sparsity of the signal to be reconstructed while enforcing a data fidelity term of bounded lp-norm, for 2 < p < infini. We show that in oversampled situations the performance of the BPDQp decoders are significantly better than that of BPDN, with reconstruction error due to quantization divided by racine(p 1). This reduction relies on a modified Restricted Isometry Property of the sensing matrix expressed in the lp-norm (RIPp); a property satisfied by Gaussian random matrices with high probability. We conclude with numerical experiments comparing BPDQp and BPDN for signal and image reconstruction problems...|$|E
40|$|Mutually {{unbiased}} bases (MUBs) {{are considered}} {{within the framework}} of a generic star-product scheme. We rederive that a full set of MUBs is adequate for a spin tomography, i. e. knowledge of all probabilities to find a system in each MUB-state is enough for a state reconstruction. Extending the ideas of the tomographic-probability representation and the star-product scheme to MUB-tomography, <b>dequantizer</b> and quantizer operators for MUB-symbols of spin states and operators are introduced, ordinary and dual star-product kernels are found. Since MUB-projectors are to obey specific rules of the star-product scheme, we reveal the Lie algebraic structure of MUB-projectors and derive new relations on triple- and four-products of MUB-projectors. Example of qubits is considered in detail. MUB-tomography by means of Stern-Gerlach apparatus is discussed.

40|$|Some {{nonlinear}} generalizations {{of classical}} Radon tomography were introduced by Asorey et al (2008 Phys. Rev. A 77 042115), where the straight {{lines of the}} standard Radon map are replaced by quadratic curves (ellipses, hyperbolas and circles) or quadratic surfaces (ellipsoids, hyperboloids and spheres). We consider here the quantum version of this novel nonlinear approach and obtain, by the systematic use of the Weyl map, a tomographic encoding approach to quantum states. Nonlinear quantum tomograms admit a simple formulation {{within the framework of}} the star-product quantization scheme and the reconstruction formulae of the density operators are explicitly given in a closed form, with an explicit construction of quantizers and <b>dequantizers.</b> The role of symmetry groups behind the generalized tomographic maps is analyzed in some detail. We also introduce new generalizations of the standard singular <b>dequantizers</b> of the symplectic tomographic schemes, where the Dirac delta-distributions of operator-valued arguments are replaced by smooth window functions, giving rise to the new concept of thick quantum tomography. Applications in quantum state measurements of photons and matter waves are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{relation between}} the tomographic description of quantum states and the convolution algebra of certain discrete groupoids represented on Hilbert spaces will be discussed. The realizations of groupoid algebras based on qudit, photon-number (Fock) states and symplectic tomography quantizers and <b>dequantizers</b> will be constructed. Conditions for identifying the convolution product of groupoid functions and the star product arising from a quantization–dequantization scheme will be given. A tomographic approach to construct quasi-distributions out of suitable immersions of groupoids into Hilbert spaces will be formulated and, finally, intertwining kernels for such generalized symplectic tomograms will be evaluated explicitly...|$|R
40|$|Symplectic {{and optical}} joint {{probability}} representations {{of quantum mechanics}} are considered, in which the functions describing the states are the probability distributions with all random arguments (except the argument of time). The general formalism of quantizers and <b>dequantizers</b> determining the star product quantization scheme in these representations is given. Taking the Gaussian functions as the distributions of the tomographic parameters the correspondence rules for most interesting physical operators are found and the expressions of the dual symbols of operators {{in the form of}} singular and regular generalized functions are derived. Evolution equations and stationary states equations for symplectic and optical joint probability distributions are obtained. Comment: 13 pages, 0 figure...|$|R

We present {{a new class of}} convex optimization programs, or decoders, coined Basis Pursuit <b>DeQuantizer</b> of moment p (BPDQp), that model the quantization distortion more faithfully than the commonly used Basis Pursuit DeNoise (BPDN) program. Our decoders proceed by minimizing the sparsity of the signal to be reconstructed subject to a data-fidelity constraint expressed in the ℓp-norm of the residual error for 2 ≤ p ≤ ∞. We show theoretically that, (i) the reconstruction error of these new decoders is bounded if the sensing matrix satisfies an extended Restricted Isometry Property involving the Iρ norm, and (ii), for Gaussian random matrices and uniformly quantized measurements, BPDQp performance exceeds that of BPDN by dividing the reconstruction error due to quantization by √(p 1). This last effect happens with high probability when the number of measurements exceeds a value growing with p, i. e., in an oversampled situation compared to what is commonly required by BPDN = BPDQ 2. To demonstrate the theoretical power of BPDQp, we report numerical simulations on signal and image reconstruction problems...|$|E
40|$|Columns of d 2 ×N {{matrices}} {{are shown}} to create {{different sets of}} N operators acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space. This construction corresponds to a formalism of the star-product of operator symbols. The known bases are shown to be partial cases of generic formulas derived using d 2 ×N matrices {{as a source for}} constructing arbitrary bases. The known examples of the SIC-POVM, MUBs, and the phase-space description of qubit states are considered from the viewpoint of the unified approach developed. Star-product schemes are classified with respect to associated d 2 ×N matrices. In particular, unitary matrices correspond to self-dual schemes.
