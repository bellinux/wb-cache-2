40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to {{illustrating}} the potential application of enzymes for recycling wet-blue shavings. Two approaches were made in parallel. To recycle wet-blue shavings, the classical method uses grinding, followed by agglomeration and drying. In the present work, grinding was not done, instead an acidic protease-pepsin was used followed by a cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The resultant paste was then pressed and dried. Practically no chromium was released to the aqueous medium. The agglomerate proved to be useful in shoemaking. The second approach made use of an alkaline protease which completely digested the wet-blue shavings and separated the chromium from the leather. The chromium could then be removed and the protein hydrolysate used as a replacement product for <b>hide</b> <b>finishing.</b> Pilot assays demonstrated the viability of this technology for the leather industry.

50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The <b>hides,</b> when <b>finished</b> pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather—and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|R

500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with <b>hide</b> glue, <b>finishing</b> with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|R

Here the architectural monster rears its back and shoulders on an equal scale and this whole unregarded world of colossal consistent symmetry and <b>hidden</b> high <b>finish</b> gives you the measure of the vast total treasure of items and features. The outward face of all sorts of inward majesties of utility and ornament here above all correspondingly reproduces itself; the expanses of golden travertine--the freshness of tone, the cleanness of surface, in the sunny air, being extraordinary--climb and soar and spread under the crushing weight of a scheme carried out in every ponderous particular. Never was such a show of wasted art, of pomp for pomp's sake, as where all the chapels bulge and all the windows, each one a separate constructional masterpiece, tower above almost grassgrown vacancy; with the full and immediate effect, of course, of reading us a lesson on the value of lawful pride. The pride is the pride of indifference as to whether a greatness so founded be gaped at in all its features or not. My friend and I were alone to gape at them most often while, for the unfailing impression of them, on our way to watch the casting of our figure, we extended our circuit of the place. To which I may add, as another example of that tentative, that appealing twitch of the garment of Roman association of which one kept renewing one's consciousness, the half-hour at the little foundry itself was all charming--with its quite shabby and belittered and ramshackle recall of the old Roman [...] "art-life" [...] of one's early dreams. Everything was somehow in the picture, the rickety sheds, the loose paraphernalia, the sunny, grassy yard where a goat was browsing; then the queer interior gloom of the pits, frilled with little overlooking scaffoldings and bridges, for the sinking fireward of the image that was to take on hardness; and all the pleasantness and quickness, the beguiling refinement, of the three or four light fine [...] "hands" [...] of whom the staff consisted and into whose type and tone one liked to read, with whatever harmless extravagance, so many signs that a lively sense of stiff processes, even in humble life, could still leave untouched the traditional rare feeling for the artistic. How delightful such an occupation in such a general setting--those of my friend, I at such moments irrepressibly moralised; and how one might after such a fashion endlessly go and come and ask nothing better; or if better, only so to the extent of another impression I was to owe to him: that of an evening meal spread, in the warm still darkness that made no candle flicker, on the wide high space of an old loggia that overhung, in one quarter, the great obelisked Square preceding one of the Gates, and in the other the Tiber and the far Trastevere and more things than I can say--above all, as it were, the whole backward past, the mild confused romance of the Rome one had loved and of which one was exactly taking leave under protection of the friendly lanterned and garlanded feast and the commanding, all-embracing roof-garden. It was indeed a reconciling, it was an altogether penetrating, last hour.|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, iron entered {{building}} at a large enough scale for it to be considered the first new material since pre-history. By the 1850 s, a comprehensive set of ideas for the use of metals in construction had been developed, invented, debated and tested for all parts of habitable structures. This study proposes that iron came to building along two interconnected but distinct paths. One way was through processes of imitation and substitution dependant on lessons from other technologies alongside gradual evolution and refinement – approaches familiar to designers. The other route involved unprecedented innovations arising from original new ideas – the path of inventors. Investigating these overlapping routes that inaugurated a new era of building using iron, is a central theme in reviewing the developments, inventions and discoveries that were translated into optimistic proposals and practical solutions. The work calls upon original manuscripts and drawings from this early period as well as published material from disparate sources before specialist periodicals covering issues related to building emerged. A systematic analysis of British patents records up until the mid 1850 s and accounts of new developments in the contemporary press, form a major and original part of the investigation. Analysis of surviving structures and reports of accidents and failures in structures using new techniques of fabrication and building will help contextualize the paths that lead to the implementation of new ideas. Acceptance of iron as a legitimate material for building went through phases of early unqualified optimism to guarded scepticism as a result of unanticipated disasters. In the main, builders, unfettered by aesthetic inhibitions, were opportunistic and pragmatic. They learnt to absorb the new material where it clearly offered advantages. Architects, particularly in Britain, went in the opposite direction, becoming progressively more coy at embracing the possibilities offered by iron. The research looks at how, despite the existence of a comprehensive vocabulary of iron construction that had been developed, tried and tested by the mid 1850 s, architects, in Britain at least, were reluctant to embrace visible iron, while being open to its use performing essential duties behind <b>finishes,</b> <b>hidden</b> from view. These conservative attitudes in the country that initiated many early ideas for the use of iron in building will be contrasted with divergent attitudes in different contexts in Europe, the USA and further afield...|$|R
5000|$|The largest find of Iguanodon {{remains to}} that date {{occurred}} on 28 February 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium, {{at a depth}} of 322 m, when two mineworkers, Jules Créteur and Alphonse Blanchard, accidentally hit on a skeleton that they initially took for petrified wood. With the encouragement of Alphonse Briart, supervisor of mines at nearby Morlanwelz, Louis de Pauw on 15 May 1878 started to excavate the skeletons and in 1882 Louis Dollo reconstructed them. At least 38 Iguanodon individuals were uncovered, most of which were adults. In 1882, the holotype specimen of I. bernissartensis {{became one of the first}} ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display. It was put together in a chapel at the Palace of Charles of Lorraine using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process. This specimen, along with several others, first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in July 1883. In 1891 they were moved to the Royal Museum of Natural History, where they are still on display; nine are displayed as standing mounts, and nineteen more are still in the Museum's basement. The exhibit makes an impressive display in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, in Brussels. A replica of one of these is on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. Most of the remains were referred to a new species, I. bernissartensis, a larger and much more robust animal than the English remains had yet revealed, but one specimen was referred to the nebulous, gracile I. mantelli (now Dollodon bampingi). The skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known. Found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform Bernissartia.The science of conserving fossil remains was in its infancy, and new techniques had to be improvised to deal with what soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease".
