5|$|In 1966, Lawrence Binnie {{became the}} club's first {{official}} manager, {{prior to his}} appointment {{the board of directors}} took responsibility for management roles. After de-merging with Clydebank Juniors, the club spent ten seasons in Division Two before being moved by league reconstruction to a new Second Division for the 1975–76 season, now the third tier with the creation of the Premier Division {{at the top of the}} Scottish Football League. During this period, the club progressed past the group stage of Scottish League Cup for the first time since it was inaugurated in 1947. The year beforehand saw the club appoint its most famous manager, Alex Ferguson, who was at the club during 1974 before moving to St Mirren. In 1979–80, East Stirlingshire won promotion to the First Division, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the club was promoted in the league. Managed by Billy Lamont, the club finished runners-up by one point to rivals Falkirk in the Second Division. The clubs shared the top two spots in the league for most of the season and entered the final match equal on points, with East Stirlingshire required to better Falkirk's result to win the championship due to an inferior goal difference. However, Falkirk won its match and East Stirlingshire drew and so finished second.|$|E

In return, the deposed King promises his son to be his witness on his wedding day. In these circumstances, Alexander I agreed to postpone his projected marriage until the restoration of peace. Two days later, Constantine I and his relatives arrived to the small port of Oropos and take the path of exile; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that Alexander I was in contact with his family.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Brother Mouzone captures Dante, {{and forces}} him to reveal Omar's hiding place. Dante gives in, in {{contrast}} with Brandon, who never cracked.

Brother Mouzone sets Dante free and returns to New York, while Omar is tasked with disposing of Mouzone's gun, {{as well as the}} shotgun that killed Stringer. Both weapons are later thrown into the harbor. Omar is shown to be suspicious of the severity of Dante's injuries and his release by Mouzone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he is seen; it is implied that Omar left him for giving him up so easily.|$|E
25|$|New England {{had some}} success moving the ball on their next two drives, but both ended with Bledsoe interceptions. On the second one, {{defensive}} back Eric Turner picked off a pass from Bledsoe and returned the ball 28 yards to the New England 36 with seven {{minutes left in the}} game. From there, Cleveland managed to run the clock down to 3:36 before Stover's 21-yard field goal gave them a two-score lead at 20–10. However, New England put together a 63-yard drive to score on Bahr's 33-yard field goal with 1:33 remaining. New England then recovered the ensuing onside kick, but after gaining a first down, Bledsoe threw four straight incompletions and the ball was turned back to Cleveland on downs.

Among the teams who failed to qualify were two-time winners Uruguay for the second successive tournament and Sweden who finished third in 1994. Russia failed to qualify for the first time since 1978, when they contested as the USSR, after losing to Italy in the play-off round.

25|$|Reagan won 53% of {{the vote}} in {{reliably}} Democratic South Boston. His electoral college victory of 489 electoral votes (90.9% of the electoral vote) was the most lopsided electoral college victory for a first-time President-elect. Although Reagan was to win an even greater Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some currently very strong Democratic counties gave a Republican majority or plurality. Notable examples are Jefferson County in Washington State, Lane County, Oregon, Marin and Santa Cruz Counties in California, McKinley County, New Mexico, Polk County, Iowa and Rock Island County, Illinois. Conversely, this was the last time that the Democrats won Georgia and Maryland until 1992. This election <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a Republican won the presidency without winning Georgia. This is the first time Massachusetts voted for the Republican candidate since 1956. 1980 is one of only two occurrences of a pair of consecutive elections seeing the incumbent President defeated, the other one happening in 1892. This is the only time in the 20th century a party was voted out after a single four-year term.|$|E

I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> we will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop. Anyway there were only two series of Fawlty Towers and, as far as I'm concerned, this rates with it, so I'm sure it'll be shown lots of times".|$|E
