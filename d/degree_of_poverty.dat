500|$|Citing {{the year}} Austen first wrote {{a draft of}} the novel, Wright and Moggach changed the period setting from 1813 (the novel's {{publication}} date) to the late eighteenth century; this decision was partly because Wright wanted to highlight the differences within an England influenced by the French Revolution, as he was fascinated that it had [...] "caused an atmosphere among the British aristocracy of fear". Additionally, Wright chose the earlier period because he hated dresses with an empire silhouette, which were popular in the later period. The decision helped make the film visually distinct from other recent Austen adaptations. In comparison to the popular 1995 BBC version, which featured Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, producer Paul Webster desired to make an adaptation that [...] "doesn't conform to the television drama stereotypes of a perfect clean Regency world". Wright and Moggach opted for a [...] "muddy hem version" [...] of Longbourn, presenting a more rural setting than in previous adaptations out of a desire to depict the Bennets in [...] "very close proximity to their rural life" [...] and to emphasise their relative poverty. While the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> was criticised by some critics, Wright felt that the [...] "mess adds to the drama of the predicament that the family were in", and helps contrast the Bennets, Darcys, and Bingleys.|$|E

60|$|Most of {{the land}} {{is in the hands of}} peasant proprietors, who divide their {{holdings}} among their sons, so that each man's share becomes barely sufficient to support himself and his family. Consequently, when the rainfall is less than usual, immense numbers perish of starvation. It would of course be possible, for a time, to prevent famines by more scientific methods of agriculture, and to prevent droughts and floods by afforestation. More railways and better roads would give a vastly improved market, and might greatly enrich the peasants for a generation. But in the long run, if the birth-rate is as great as is usually supposed, no permanent cure for their poverty is possible while their families continue to be so large. In China, Malthus's theory of population, according to many writers, finds full scope.[35] If so, the good done by any improvement of methods will lead to the survival of more children, involving a greater subdivision {{of the land}}, and in the end, a return to the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> Only education and a higher standard of life can remove the fundamental cause of these evils. And popular education, on a large scale, is of course impossible until there is a better Government and an adequate revenue. Apart even from these difficulties, there does not exist, as yet, a sufficient supply of competent Chinese teachers for a system of universal elementary education.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} “destitution” {{presents}} challenges to several preoccupations <b>of</b> contemporary <b>poverty</b> discourse: the definition <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> (narrowly income-based versus broader multi-dimensional approaches); the measurement <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> (quantitative versus participatory methods); and the temporal dimension (chronic versus transitory <b>poverty).</b> Recognition <b>of</b> the multi-dimensionality <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> {{has rarely been}} reflected in integrated analytical or policy frameworks. The Millennium Development Goals focus on simple quantitative targets, and fail to differentiate between <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> By contrast, this paper argues that destitution is intrinsically a multi-dimensional concept, and it emphasises the severity <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> – in contrast to “chronic poverty”, which emphasises the duration <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> A definition <b>of</b> destitution is proposed with three components: inability to meet subsistence needs, assetlessness, and dependence on transfers.

Relative to poverty, high growth rates delay economic growth thereby constraining the poor’s consumption capacity. A decrease in the growth rate would have both an immediate effect at the micro level and eventually at a macro level for a state’s economy.

40|$|Despite {{that fact}} that South Africa is {{classified}} as a middle income country {{it is estimated that}} at least 22 million people-well over half the population-live in poverty. In 2001, the South African Council of Churches (SACC) joined a broad coalition of civil society organisations calling for the introduction of a Basic Income Grant as a key intervention in the struggle against poverty and inequality. It was envisaged that a monthly transfer of R(and) 100 would provide rapid and sustained relief to all South Africans. The analyses reported in this paper seek to provide an ex ante assessment {{of the impact of the}} Basic Income Grant on the socio-economic conditions of households and industries in the Western Cape. The analyses are conducted using a computable general equilibrium model that is calibrated to a Social Accounting Matrix for the Western Cape Province. The results indicate, ceteris paribus, that when funded exogenously a BIG will achieve substantial reductions in poverty and inequality, but that the universal BIG scenario is only marginally superior to a targeted basic BIG and achieves less poverty alleviation than an enhanced but targeted BIG. If the transfers are funded by increase in tax rates the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> alleviation achieved are greatly reduced, especially if the transfers are funded by an increase in the sales tax rate. When a BIG is funded from tax revenues the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> alleviation from targeting increase enormously such that under some scenarios targeting can nearly double the estimated extent <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> alleviation...|$|R

Moving beyond any notion that minority ethnic communities live ‘parallel lives’, the paper identifies and explores some of the ways in which the new city spaces of Milton Keynes are actively lived, negotiated and understood by the Ghanaian and Somali communities (and particularly by young people from those communities). It highlights the tensions between the ways in which difference is negotiated in practice and attempts to define communities through processes of governance...|$|R

50|$|Long {{was born}} on August 30, 1893, near Winnfield, the seat of {{government}} of Winn Parish, {{a small town in}} the north-central part of Louisiana. He was the son of Huey Pierce Long, Sr. (1852-1937) and the former Caledonia Palestine Tison (1860-1913). At the time of his youth, Winn Parish was a deeply impoverished region whose people, mostly modest Southern Baptists were known for their cantankerous stubbornness and for being outsiders in Louisiana's political system. During the Civil War, Winn Parish had been a stronghold of Unionism in an otherwise solidly Confederate state, in the 1890s a bastion of the Populist Party and in 1912 the majority in Winn Parish had voted for the Socialist Party. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> in Winn Parish was extreme, but in general Louisiana was a very poor state, with the 1930 census showing that one-fifth of the whites in Louisiana were illiterate with rates far higher amongst blacks. As someone who was born and grew up in Winn Parish, Long inherited all of the resentments of its people against the elite in Baton Rouge who ruled Louisiana. Long was the seventh of nine surviving children in a farm-owning middle-class family. He was home-schooled as a young child and later attended local schools, where he was an excellent student and was said to have a remarkable memory. In 1908, upon completing the eleventh grade, Long circulated a petition protesting the addition of a 12th-grade graduation requirement, which resulted in his expulsion.Long won a debating scholarship to Louisiana State University, but he was unable to afford the textbooks required for attendance. Instead, he spent the next five years as a traveling salesman, selling books, canned goods and patent medicines, as well as working as an auctioneer.|$|E
