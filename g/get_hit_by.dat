5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party {{in honor of the}} new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country is a {{platform}} game where players must complete 40 different side-scrolling levels (or 41 in the Game Boy Color version) and recover the Kongs' banana hoard, {{which has been}} stolen by the Kremlings. Each level is uniquely themed and consists of varying tasks such as swimming, riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or swinging from vine to vine. The player begins {{with a minimum of}} six lives. Players lose a life if they <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> any enemy or fall off the screen. To defeat an enemy, players can either execute a roll, jump or hand slap (a move only usable by Donkey Kong). However, some enemies cannot be taken down in this manner, so the player must throw a barrel or use the assistance of an animal. Enemies vary in difficulty, usually becoming tougher to take down as the game progresses. When the player has lost all their lives, the game is over. However, the player can gain additional lives by collecting items scattered throughout the levels, including bananas, golden letters that spell out K–O–N–G, extra life balloons, and golden animal tokens that lead to bonus levels. There are also many secret passages that can lead to bonus games where the player can earn additional lives or other items, as well as gain possible shortcuts through the level.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} {{for each}} battle is {{defeat of the}} enemy army by either completely destroying it or causing the remaining units to flee off the battlefield. Battles are fought {{on a variety of}} landscapes and settings, with specific terrain types granting bonuses or penalties to units. Units also have morale, and will break and flee if they suffer enough damage or <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> specific types of weaponry, and stamina, which will cause them to lose defense and speed when sufficiently drained.|$|E
25|$|At Dover, Earnhardt won {{his second}} pole of the season, setting a new {{qualifying}} speed record of 161.849mph. This {{was the first}} time since 2002 that he had recorded more than one pole during a season. During the race, Earnhardt would lead 80 laps, but would finish 2nd to Jimmie Johnson. The following week at Kansas, he finished 8th. Making his 500th Cup start at Charlotte, Earnhardt led 19 laps early, but finished 15th while battling a tight race car. The following week at Talladega, Earnhardt led 38 laps and was about to receive a push from Austin Dillon to overtake Jamie McMurray on the last lap when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. tapped Dillon, causing that driver to spin out and then <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> Casey Mears, leaving Earnhardt with a 2nd-place finish. The following week at Martinville, Earnhardt earned an 8th-place finish. The next week at Texas, he had a solid night, finishing 2nd to Johnson {{for the third time in}} the season (after Daytona and Dover). The next week at Phoenix, Earnhardt started by being forced to pit with a loose wheel early, putting him a lap down. However, a caution allowed him to use the free pass to get back on the lead lap and salvage a 4th-place finish.|$|E
500|$|As {{characters}} perform special moves, block oncoming attacks, or <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the opponent, their [...] "super meters" [...] {{will gradually}} fill. Portions {{of the super}} meter {{can be used to}} execute enhanced special moves or counter enemy moves. With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend their meter to interrupt a combo and enter a wager battle, dubbed the [...] "clash system", which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter. A clash may be triggered by a player only after they have lost their first life bar. During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning the clash.|$|E

[...] The player must fight through twelve levels {{and destroy the}} System and its defenses. The objective is to shoot down enemies and projectiles and accumulate points. Players start with three lives, and they lose a life if they <b>get</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> an enemy or projectile. After losing a life, gameplay continues with the player reappearing {{on the screen and}} losing all previously accumulated power-ups; the player remains temporarily invincible for a moment upon reappearing on the screen. The game ends when all the player's lives have been lost or after completing the twelfth and final area. However, the player can earn 1-ups (extra lives) throughout the game by accumulating high point scores. Zanac has a continue option which allows players to restart the game from the level in which they lost all their lives.|$|E
