40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine {{the interactive effects of}} Zn, Cu and Mn addition to diets of 0 to 14 -d old broilers on growth performance, bone breaking strength, bone ash percentage and tissue mineral concentrations. Two levels of Zn (0 or 75 ppm, as Zn sulfate), 2 levels of Mn (0 or 100 ppm, as Mn sulfate) and 2 levels of Cu (0 or 7 ppm, as Cu sulfate) were supplemented to corn-soybean meal diets in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Each treatment had 6 replications with 5 chicks each and the initial and final BW were 46 and 382 g. Daily gain, daily feed intake, gain:feed, bone breaking strength and bone and pancreatic Zn concentrations were increased (p< 0. 05) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> supplemental Zn. Bone, liver and pancreatic Mn levels were increased (p< 0. 01) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> supplemental Mn. Bone breaking strength was increased when Zn was added to the <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> or without Cu addition, but the increase was greater in chicks fed the diets without Cu addition (Zn×Cu, p< 0. 05). Bone ash percentage was increased in chicks fed the <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> Zn, Mn, or Cu addition but the increase was not additive (Zn×Mn×Cu, p< 0. 03). Liver Cu level was increased (p< 0. 01) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> Cu addition. Bone and liver Cu levels were decreased (p< 0. 05) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> Zn addition. Bone and pancreas Fe levels were decreased (p< 0. 05) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> added Zn. Bone Zn level was decreased (p< 0. 03) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> added Cu. Liver and pancreatic Mn levels were increased (p< 0. 05) in chicks fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> added Zn. This study indicates that Zn addition is necessary for normal growth and bone strength of chicks and that Zn addition had negative effects on tissue Cu and Fe levels and a positive effect on tissue Mn levels...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of dietary electrolyte balance (dEB) and(or) molasses in <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) on growth performance of nursery and finishing pigs. For Exp. 1, 126 nursery pigs (35 d old and average wt of 22. 5 lb) were used with six pigs/pen and seven pens/treatment. Treatments were a corn-soybean meal-based control and <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> 30 % DDGS without and with 0. 93 % sodium bicarbonate to adjust the dEB back to that of the control diet. Pigs fed the control diet had greater ADG (P 0. 58) in F/G compared to pigs fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> DDGS. Addition of sodium bicarbonate to nursery <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> 30 % DDGS did not improve (P> 0. 3) growth performance. For Exp. 2, a total of 70 gilts (average wt of 196 lb) were assigned with two pigs/pen and five pens/treatment. The pigs were fed experimental diets for 26 d, a common diet for 6 d, and then reassigned to a different treatment for an additional 26 -d assay. The end result was 10 pens/treatment. Treatments were a corn-soybean meal-based control and <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> 40 % DDGS without and with molasses (5 %) and sodium bicarbonate (none, 1, and 2 %).

40|$|Shrimp <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> {{and without}} the antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were stored at 10 Â°, 20 Â°, 28 Â°â€“ 30 Â°, and 40 Â°C for 10 weeks. To monitor lipolysis and lipid oxidation, free fatty acid (FFA) content, {{peroxide}} values (PVs), and malonaldehyde (MAL) levels were measured from the extracted lipids of the stored diets. Fatty acid levels of the diets increased between the initial and final samplings and the increase was higher (8. 4 %) in diets without BHT stored at 40 Â°C after 10 weeks. Peroxide values of the extracted lipids were low and fluctuated monthly between 2. 2 and 7. 4 mmol/kg fat. MAL levels increased in <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> and without BHT except those stored at 10 Â°C for 4 weeks. <b>Diets</b> <b>with</b> BHT stored at 10 Â°C had the lowest (8. 7 mg MAL/kg fat) MAL levels and diets without BHT stored at 40 Â°C for 10 weeks had the highest (16. 9 mg MAL/kg fat). Shrimp fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> BHT gained 5. 7 â€“ 6. 4 Ã— their initial weight after 10 weeks of rearing. Their growth was significantly better than those fed diets without BHT (4 â€“ 6 Ã—) during the 60 -day culture period. Survival was significantly higher in those fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> BHT (87 â€“ 88 %) than those without BHT (75 â€“ 85 %). No hepatopancreatic lesions were seen in shrimp samples fed <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> and without BHT and stored at various temperatures. The incorporation of BHT in shrimp feed is necessary if the feed is to be stored at 40 Â°C for 10 weeks.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that supplementing {{ruminant}} <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> vegetable oils modulated the rumen biohydrogenation and increased polyunsaturated fatty acid in their products.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate whether broiler chicks fed canola meal, as compared <b>with</b> <b>diets</b> of soybean meal, would respond {{to a higher level}} of supplemental calcium. Supplementing canola basal diets and soybean-meal basal <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> additional sulfur from sodium sulfate resulted in little or no change in broiler performance. However, supplementing <b>diets</b> <b>with</b> organic sulfur (cystine) caused a marked decrease in weight gain and feed intake, more severe <b>with</b> a canola <b>diet</b> than <b>with</b> a soybean-meal <b>diet</b> and which could be partially alleviated by increasing the calcium supplementation. A significant cystine-by-calcium interaction showed that feed intake dropped markedly, especially at the higher levels of calcium, as the levels of cystine supplementation increased. Part of the reduced performance, sometimes noted when <b>diets</b> supplemented <b>with</b> canola meal are used, may be due to a reduction in feed intake resulting from an interaction between dietary calcium and sulfur...|$|R
