5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of}} the Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|At a music festival, Sunny is embarrassed when Ringo and Declan Napier (James Sorensen) {{interrupt}} a kiss {{between her}} and Zeke. She runs off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of the}} conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E

5|$|MD7 heads east through {{forest and}} {{scattered}} residential subdivisions through the northern fringe of Joppatowne, where the highway intersects Old Mountain Road and MD152 (Mountain Road). The route crosses Winters Run and intersects Edgewood Road and MD24 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway) in Edgewood. MD7 crosses Haha Branch and meets Abingdon Road at Abingdon, which {{is home to}} the Nelson-Reardon-Kennard House. The highway intersects MD136 (Calvary Road) in between crossings of Bynum Run and James Run, which flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> River. MD7 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway as it passes through the commercial area of Riverside, where the highway meets MD543 (Creswell Road) just south of that highway's interchange with I-95. The road passes through forest with isolated residential subdivisions, one of which is served by Holly Oak Circle, which meets MD7 at a roundabout.|$|E
5|$|The Waikato Māori had {{withdrawn}} to fortified positions at Pikopiko and Paterangi by early 1864. While their positions were under siege, war parties would mount raids on {{small groups of}} British soldiers. On 11 February, soldiers of the 40th Regiment of Foot were bathing in the Mangapiko Stream near Paterangi and were ambushed by a raiding party. Heaphy, commanding some men of the 50th Regiment of Foot, came {{to the aid of}} the defenders and moved to cut off the Māori line of retreat. He then overcame the Māori reserve, before leading his men to the ambush site, to assist the British soldiers. Despite being outnumbered, the British repulsed the Māori and began to pursue them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b> A soldier was wounded and Heaphy and three others went to his aid but Heaphy and one of the others were wounded and a third was killed. Unable to extricate themselves, Heaphy and the remaining fit soldier provided cover to prevent the wounded men from being axed by the Māori. They were eventually relieved by reinforcements but the two wounded men that Heaphy and the soldier were trying to protect, died of their wounds. Despite injuries to his arm, hip and ribs, Heaphy remained in the field for much of the remainder of the day, until the ambushed party was relieved. Following the action at Paterangi, Heaphy was promoted to major; a month later, {{with the end of the}} war in the Waikato, he ceased active duty and returned to civilian life.|$|E
25|$|The Militia and Taranaki Rifle Volunteers {{were called}} up for guard and patrol duty around New Plymouth and in June a 50-man corps of forest rangers was formed within the Taranaki Rifles by Captain Harry Atkinson to follow Māori <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> and clear the country {{surrounding}} New Plymouth of hostile bands. The force was later expanded to two companies and named the Taranaki Bush Rangers.|$|E

25|$|In October 1834 Stirling led a {{detachment}} of 25 armed troopers and settlers including Septimus Roe and Thomas Peel that attacked an encampment of 60-80 Pindjarep Aboriginal people. The Pindjarep fled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> and were later encircled near a crossing on the Murray River at Pinjarra, Stirling {{referred to this}} as the Battle of Pinjarra. Settlers accounts claim between 10-80 aboriginals died compared to aboriginal oral history which claim 150 people died.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Warrandyte became a popular {{destination}} for {{artists of the}} Heidelberg School, who sought subject matter further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b> This {{led to the development}} of an artists camp and small colony. Though not as substantial as the older colonies at Heidelberg and Box Hill, several artists, such as Clara Southern and Walter Withers, who were associated with the Heidelberg School, took up residence in Warrandyte. Others followed, including Penleigh Boyd, Harold Herbert, Jo Sweatman and Gus McLaren.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão was {{alerted to}} {{the attack on the}} presidential home and left his home by car for Dili.

Another party of rebels shot out the tires of Gusmão's car on its way to Dili, but the car continued for some distance before Gusmão, unhurt, abandoned it and ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> to call for help.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} factors, {{apart from the}} reaction of the enemy and the terrain, in a Fireforce operation were the reliability of intelligence and the skill of the operations commander. The majority of successful engagements were enabled by the skills of the Selous Scouts (many of whom were former enemy); they had the capacity to insert observation posts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> without being noticed by the inhabitants. The difficulty of commanding the scene was extreme and good Fireforce commanders were highly prized by the men.|$|E
25|$|The police, Aboriginal {{trackers}} {{and others}} watched the surrounded hotel throughout the night. At about 5 {{o'clock in the}} morning the landlady, Mrs Jones, began loudly wailing over the fate of her son, who {{had been shot in the}} back. She came out from the hotel crying bitterly and wandered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> on several occasions. With the assistance of one of the prisoners she removed her son from the building, and sent him to Wangaratta for treatment. The firing continued intermittently. Bullets lodged in the station buildings and the train.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, the base's inner defences were {{breached}} {{by a third}} bomb-laden truck, whose explosion {{allowed the}} Al-Shabaab fighters to overrun the remaining defenders; the surviving pro-government forces were forced to flee <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> as the militants pursued them. The battle had lasted around 90 minutes, with Al-Shabaab later claiming to have killed more than 67 KDF soldiers and capture several more. Accordingly, the two platoons that had retreated survived, while the two units which had remained at the base and continued to fight were almost completely destroyed.|$|E

The launch sent up a sharp series of whistles, and random shots were for some time fired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Government's war {{policy was}} {{opposed by the}} British commander, General Duncan Cameron, who clashed with Governor Sir George Grey and offered his {{resignation}} in February 1865. He left New Zealand six months later. Cameron, who viewed the war {{as a form of}} land plunder, had urged the Colonial Office to withdraw British troops from New Zealand and from the end of 1865 the Imperial forces began to leave, replaced by an expanding New Zealand military force. Among the new colonial forces were specialist Forest Ranger units, which embarked on lengthy search-and-destroy missions deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b>|$|E
25|$|Msiri's capital Bunkeya and {{surrounding}} villages had a population estimated at 60,000–80,000 in 1891. A year after Msiri's death, it was 10,000–20,000. In {{that part of}} Africa people disperse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> when threatened. For instance, David Livingstone reported twenty years earlier that Mwata Kazembe VIII Chinkonkole Kafuti so tyrannised his people that many had moved away, and he could muster scarcely 1000 men. Continuing the contrast with Msiri, when the assassins sent by Msiri and Tippu Tib advanced on his boma, Chinkonkole Kafuti’s people did not warn him, but let him be taken by surprise.|$|E
25|$|The Stairs Expedition became {{notorious for}} {{the fate of}} Msiri. After three days of {{negotiations}} without progress, Stairs gave Msiri an ultimatum to sign the treaty the next day, 20 December 1891. When Msiri did not appear, he sent his second-in-command, Captain Bodson to arrest Msiri, who stood his ground. Bodson shot him dead, and a fight broke out. The expedition took their wounded and Msiri's body back to their camp where Stairs was waiting, and there they cut off Msiri's head and hoisted it on a pole in plain view as a 'barbaric lesson' to his people. Some of the Garanganze were massacred by the expedition's askaris, {{and most of the}} rest fled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b>|$|E

25|$|The revamped {{offensive}} restarted on 21 August. The {{drive up}} Route 23 came {{up against a}} PAVN bunker complex blocking the road. While most of the tactical air sorties assigned to the operation struck the bunkers, they failed to dislodge the Communists. The two Royalist columns converging on Paksong failed to synchronize their actions. As a result, the PAVN 9th Regiment could fight them in turn. First, it scattered the four Royalist battalions south of them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> and pushed the two Thai battalions back toward Ban Phakkout. Then it intercepted the four guerrilla battalions five kilometers northwest of Paksong. It struck them so hard the four battalions were evacuated for refitting. By 1 September, the failure of this Royalist offensive was evident.|$|E
25|$|The three set up {{a company}} called the Tongariro Timber Company Limited with the {{intention}} to construct the railway and to have branch lines heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> at various points along the route to harvest the native timber along the way. The railway {{was intended to be}} paid for using some of the large sums of money expected to be earned from the timber to be harvested. It was agreed that the land would remain in Maori ownership and that the Tongariro Timber Company Limited would operate the railway. Once the railway was built the company would carry freight other than timber, such as dressed flax and grain, and passengers at Government rates. The railway would connect with a ferry service on Lake Taupo.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b> He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
