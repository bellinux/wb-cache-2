5|$|Astrid Kruse Jensen (born 1975, {{educated in}} the Netherlands and Scotland) specializes in {{photographs}} taken at night which <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> zone between reality and imagination. Carefully combining the effects of artificial light with the surrounding darkness, she creates mysterious images of lakes, swimming pools and solitary figures in the twilight. Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix's figure wears a pileus, and Bartholdi {{at first}} {{considered}} placing {{one on his}} figure as well. Instead, he used a diadem, or crown, to top its head. In so doing, he avoided a reference to Marianne, who invariably wears a pileus. The seven rays form a halo or aureole. They <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents, and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world.|$|E

5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that {{the difficulty of the}} game was raised with the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury Castle, {{also known}} as Arlington Castle, was a private house located in {{southwest}} Portland, Oregon and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed during 1929–1931, the house was designed by Jeter O. Frye to resemble England's Canterbury Castle on the exterior and to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> Art Deco styling of Hollywood of the 1920s on the interior. The house included castle features such as a moat, drawbridge and turret and attracted paying tourists immediately following its completion.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> mythological waters of chaos.|$|E

5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E

A new statuette, designed by Vincent Villafranca, was announced in April 2017 {{to be used for}} the 2016 awards on. The new award, which depicts a tree in front of a full moon, was intended to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> use of trees and night imagery in mythology, fantasy, and horror works.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle {{does not}} seem to be {{primarily}} designed to have a military function, although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region. The castle lacked the usual military features of the time, such as external gatehouses, and its design seems to have been intended to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack. Instead, as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195, the castle appears to have been built with the intention of enforcing the stannary and forest law in Devon. It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon, although in practice its role extended only to governing the Devon stannaries.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{development}} as an action role-playing sequel to , it retained elements from the Final Fantasy series while having its own story and gameplay elements. The producer of The 4 Heroes of Light, Tomoya Asano, returned to produce Bravely Default. The story's writer was Naotaka Hayashi, who {{was brought in}} from 5pb. due to his work on Steins;Gate. The characters designs were handled by multiple artists, including art director Akihiko Yoshida and Atsushi Ōkubo. The game was influenced by western video games and television series, and individual elements were inspired by aspects of the Dragon Quest series and Higurashi When They Cry. The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa.|$|E
5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
