30|$|Despite an {{extremely}} fragmented tibia with large bone defect, this patient had a well-protected ipsilateral fibula which was fractured {{only a few}} centimeters from the distal end. During surgery, we observed that the proximal connection of the peroneal artery was intact and decided that transfer of this large vascularized fibula segment would be an ideal alternative for replacing lost tibial bone. After preparation of the two ends of the tibia, we transferred the vascularized fibula medially {{and placed it in}} between the two poles of the tibia. Our preferred fixation method with a <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator does not allow early weight bearing before callus formation. Conversion to a circular frame after the soft tissues have healed would have been an alternative which is more stable.

Standardised 3 mm diaphyseal bone defects were created in the right tibia of 64 female sheep and stabilised with either a rigid <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator or a more flexible variant. Over a nine week healing period gait parameters were measured using a pressure sensitive platform and interfragmentary movements at the fracture site were monitored. The tibiae were tested biomechanically after sacrifice. All animals unloaded the operated and overloaded the contralateral hindlimb. Callus mineralization and stiffness, as well as limb loading increased during healing whilst interfragmentary movements were reduced.

30|$|A 42 -year-old {{man had a}} {{bilateral}} femoral fractures, liver rupture, right tibial pilon fracture, head injury and left hemothorax {{as the result of}} a motorcycle accident. The treatment adopted was external fixation for all the fractures, according to DCO criteria. The left femoral fracture was bifocal with midcervical involvement and was initially treated by implanting a <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator (Orthofix) with proximal screws along the femoral neck. The severity of the patient’s general health did not allow for conversion of this treatment.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the soft tissue dissection in treating such fractures, <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixators were introduced to provide fracture stabilization. Although this strategy showed {{a decrease in the}} soft tissue complications [14, 15], mechanical stability was inadequate and loss of reduction was seen [15]. The reason for this mechanical failure is the cantilever loading forces that the external fixator is subjected to. This places the external fixator at a mechanical disadvantage when having to provide stability at a distance from the fixator body [28].|$|R

To {{compare the}} salvage rate and {{complication}} between internal fixation and external fixation {{in patients with}} small bone defects caused by chronic infectious osteomyelitis debridement. Methods. 125 patients with chronic infectious osteomyelitis of tibia fracture who underwent multiple irrigation, debridement procedure, and local/systemic antibiotics were enrolled. Bone defects, which were less than 4 [*]cm, were treated with bone grafting using either internal fixation or <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixation. 12 -month follow-up was conducted with an interval of 3 months to evaluate union of bone defect. Results. Patients who underwent <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixation had higher body mass index and fasting blood glucose, longer time since injury, and larger bone defect compared with internal fixation. No significant difference was observed in incidence of complications (23. 5 % versus 19. 3 %), surgery time (156 ± 23 minutes versus 162 ± 21 minutes), and time to union (11. 1 ± 3. 0 months versus 10. 9 ± 3. 1 months) between external fixation and internal fixation. Internal fixation had no significant influence on the occurrence of postoperation complications after multivariate adjustment when compared with external fixation. Furthermore, patients who underwent internal fixation experienced higher level of daily living scales and lower level of anxiety. Conclusions.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Cattle (n= 22) with long-bone fractures. METHODS: Records for cattle with long-bone fractures repaired between 1999 and 2004 with CRIF 4. 5 / 5. 5 were reviewed. Quality of fracture repair, fracture healing, and clinical outcome were investigated by means of clinical examination, medical records, radiographs, and telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: Successful long-term outcome was achieved in 18 cattle (82 %); 4 were euthanatized 2 - 14 days postoperatively because of fracture breakdowns. Two cattle had movement of clamps on the rod. Moderate to severe callus formation was evident in 11 cattle 6 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Movement of clamps on the rod was recognized as implant failure unique to the CRIF. This occurred in cattle with poor fracture stability because of an extensive cortical defect. The CRIF system may not be ideal to treat metacarpal/metatarsal fractures because its voluminous size makes skin closure difficult, thereby increasing the risk of postoperative infections.

30|$|Bone {{transport}} for segmental resections in {{the treatment}} for infected nonunion, osteomyelitis, or after bone loss in open fractures remains a major undertaking for orthopedic surgeons [1, 2, 3, 4]. For long-bone diaphyseal defects larger than 5  cm, {{with or without a}} soft-tissue defect, specialized management is needed [5]. The use of vascularized bone grafts [6, 7], allograft bone transplantation, or bone transport by an external fixator alone or over an intramedullary nail has been reported in [8, 9, 10]. Bone transport with a circular or <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator represents a standard method for managing lower limb bone defects and for limb lengthening [11, 12, 13, 14]. These methods induce two biological processes: distraction osteogenesis, the new production of bone from a corticotomy, and transformational osteogenesis, where the mechanical stimulation of an abnormal bony interface regenerates normal bony continuity and achieves consolidation [15, 16]. Further, the regenerated bone formed by bone transport is mechanically stronger to that formed by bone grafting but there is a risk of refracture after frame removal [17]. Distraction osteogenesis by the Ilizarov technique [18, 19, 20], subsequently modified by Cattaneo et al. [21], has been used successfully in all long bones since its introduction [17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In contrast, bone transport using a <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator achieves a similar result through distraction of callus (callotasis) that is obtained from a subperiosteal osteotomy [27]. Compared with a circular frame, this device has the advantage of being lighter and a simpler application. There is also less soft-tissue transfixation by pins, thereby allowing early physical exercise and partial weight-bearing [28]. Use of hydroxyapatite-coated pins decreases pin site-related problems [9, 29].|$|R
30|$|One {{solution}} {{to some of}} these complications is the insertion of an intramedullary nail in order to support the regenerated bone during the consolidation phase and facilitate the removal of the external fixator after the distraction phase of lengthening. However, intramedullary nailing after bone transport with a circular or <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator is still controversial as there is a risk of infection. Specifically, when combining external and internal fixation, the risk of deep infection has been reported between 3 and 15  % [45, 46]. Other methods employed to shorten the external fixation treatment period have been described: docking site stimulation with autogenous bone graft, bone marrow injection, electric or magnetic field stimulation, ultrasound stimulation, and the use of bone growth stimulating factors [47].|$|R
30|$|We {{present the}} results of {{treatment}} of 100 patients (72 men, 28 women) by the Ilizarov method of bone transport using circular (55) and <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixators (45). A total of 26 femurs (18 monolateral, 8 circular) and 74 tibias (49 circular, 25 monolateral) was examined. There {{were no significant differences}} between the circular fixator and the monolateral fixator with regard to treatment time, complications in the treated bone segments or compliance with the presence of the fixator. The main complications (pseudoarthrosis at bone contact points after transport, insufficient ossification of lengthened bone, knee stiffness) were resolved with further treatment for all patients with the exception of one case which continued with repeated infections. The circular fixator allows for deformity corrections during bone transport but the monolateral fixator is tolerated better by patients, especially in those with femoral defects.|$|R
30|$|HIV {{infection}} {{has prompted}} many orthopedic and trauma surgeons {{to avoid the}} use of circular external fixators {{for the purpose of}} limb reconstruction in HIV-positive patients. Norrish and Harrison published the first data comparing pin track infection with the use of <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixators in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients [22, 24, 39]. They reported on 13 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative patients and found significantly more infections requiring pharmaceutical or surgical intervention in the HIV-positive group. Our results differ in that we could show no correlation between the incidence or severity of pin track sepsis and HIV status. Our results do correlate with the findings of no correlation between CD 4 count and the severity of pin track infection in HIV-positive patients. The low patient numbers and wide CD 4 range could explain the apparent lack of relationship and more research is required.|$|R

Ten male patients with a mean age of 50 years (range, 22 - 72 years) were treated with a modified Ilizarov fixator. The system was composed of tensioned olive wires attached to four 5 / 8 rings (two proximal and two distal to the fracture line) connected to each other with three <b>rods.</b> The <b>fixator</b> was not extended to the proximal femur nor across the knee to the tibia, and no Schanz screws were used. The main outcomes evaluated were union, time in fixator and IOWA knee score. Time in the fixator averaged 158 days (range, 125 - 180). Mean follow-up was 74 months (range, 24 - 108 months). All fractures united without major compli-cations. One case healed with a 3 ° varus angulation at the fracture site. The mean IOWA score was 83. 8 (range, 70 - 98). Although superficial pin-tract infec-tion was observed at 10 pin sites, no patient developed deep infection requiring premature pin removal. There was breakage of one wire, which was replaced under anaesthesia, and one patient presented a patella fracture after a fall, which healed after tension-band wire fixation.

30|$|Segmental defects created after {{debridement}} for infected non-union of long bones can {{be managed}} by external fixation and bone grafting, bone transport or microvascular free-tissue transfer [1, 2, 3, 4]. The Ilizarov principles are the basis for modern successful treatment [5, 6]. However, when the principles are applied using the conventional Ilizarov fixator with its transosseous tensioned wires, there are disadvantages: local anatomy is distorted; soft tissues are transfixed; {{there is a risk}} of neurovascular impingement; and the circumferential fixator is poorly tolerated [7, 12]. The circular fixator is cumbersome and interferes with conduct of personal hygiene, especially when rings are used in upper thigh [8, 9, 10]. To overcome these disadvantages, some modifications were introduced, e.g. use of half pins and femoral arches [10, 11]. In contrast, a <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator has advantages with being located {{to one side of the}} limb, is usually easier to apply and remove and has greater patient acceptance [13, 14].

30|$|As {{a result}} of the biological, {{therapeutic}} and mechanical advantages offered, and supported by the positive results reported in periprosthetic infections, antibiotic-impregnated PMMA spacers appear to be an attractive option in the management of other Cierny and Mader anatomical type IV infections associated with a bone defect. A case report where a similar technique, involving the use of a PMMA spacer with subsequent distraction osteogenesis, was used in the management of an infected open fracture is published [10]. The authors made use of a <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixator for bone transport. Circular external fixation was preferred in our series due to its modularity, minimally invasive nature and ability to effect bone transport and deformity correction (as illustrated in the case which developed joint contractures). The attributes of fine wire external fixators may also offer theoretical advantages in terms of bone healing. This stems from the three-dimensional stability combined with the low axial stiffness exhibited by fine wire circular external fixators [30, 31]. In addition, meta-analysis has shown that the Ilizarov method of distraction osteogenesis significantly reduces the risk of deep infection in infected osseous lesions [32].|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results and {{complications}} of eight consecutive patients who underwent bilateral tibial lengthenings for dwarfism associated with Turner syndrome. Lengthening was performed via distraction osteogenesis with <b>monolateral</b> <b>external</b> fixation. Tibias were lengthened an average distance of 9. 2 centimeters or 33 percent of the original tibial length. The average total treatment time was 268 days. The overall complication rate was 169 percent for each tibia lengthened and each segment required an average of 1. 7 additional procedures. Seven cases (44 percent) required Achilles tendon lengthening and nine cases (56 percent) developed angulation before or after fixator removal; six of these segments required corrective osteotomy for axial malalignment. Two cases (12. 5 percent) developed distraction site nonunion and required plating and bone grafting. From this series we conclude that tibial lengthening via distraction osteogenesis {{can be used to}} treat disproportionate short stature in patients with Turner syndrome. However, the benefit of a cosmetic increase in height may not compensate for the high complication rate. Efforts to determine the psychosocial and functional benefits of limb lengthening in patients with short stature is necessary to determine the true cost-benefit ratio of this procedure...|$|R
