50|$|Project harmony brought {{together}} organizations and private donors {{to invest in}} ICT projects for Armenia. These projects were meant {{to help build a}} <b>demonstration</b> <b>network</b> of 24-internet- connected secondary schools from the city of Yerevan and a few regions close to the capital. This led to two following grants in support of the Armenia School Connectivity Program, eventually reaching across Armenia, and creating a network of 330 secondary schools with an Internet Computer Center (ICC). The program hired and appropriately trained approximately 600 ICC staff. The people responsible for the ICC program created outreach activities and information literacy programs for the local community. For the isolated and under-served communities of Armenia, project harmony expanded Internet accessibility through the Mobile Internet Lab project. The purpose of the Mobile Internet Lab was to ride through Armenia, offering basic computer and Internet literacy to the school and community members in remote villages. The Mobile Internet Lab was an altered flatbed truck with 5 workstations, a printer, a scanner, and a digital camera and satellite connection.|$|E
