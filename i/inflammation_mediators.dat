50|$|Desonide is a {{synthetic}} nonfluorinated corticosteroid; topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of these properties, however, is unclear for the dermal route of administration. Following absorption through the skin, corticosteroids follow pharmacokinetic pathways similarly to intravenously administered corticosteroids. The mechanism of corticosteroids {{is thought to}} induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Lipocortins control the biosynthesis of <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediators,</b> like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which Amcinonide causes anti-inflammatory responses is unclear with current research focused on similar topical steroids that may possess the same mechanism. [...] This is thought to occur via the induction of lipocortin (phospholipase A2 inhibitor proteins). Ongoing research predicts that Amcinonide presents the release of arachidonic acid which, in turn, stops the synthesis of the <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediators</b> prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Phospholipase A2 normally causes membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, therefore causing a cascade of reactions leading to inflammation of the skin. Due to Amcinonide's high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, a neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction occurs and the initial acid release is inhibited, thus helping to alleviate any itching/ burning symptoms.|$|E

HMGB 1 {{is an early}} <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator</b> in sterile injury and a late <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator</b> in infection. It is an impor- tant mediator in severe sepsis and always associated with the severity of organ failure. Previous studies showed that the administration of systemic lidocaine could inhibit the expression of HMGB 1 on septic mice with musculoskeletal injury. Nine male adult Balb/c mice were grouped by simple random sampling method into three groups of intravenous lidocaine injection dosages: 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg. Musculoskeletal injury was done by breaking the left femo- ral bone in a close manner. Peripheral blood sampling was done 4 hours after injury and 2 hours after lidocaine therapy. To evaluate the expression level of HMGB 1 mRNA, RT-PCR was used. The result of our study showed that intravenous lidoaine administration on the 3 groups could decrease the level of HMGB 1.

40|$|SummaryHistone deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes {{involved}} in chromatin remodeling, are promising targets for anticancer drug development. Several HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are in clinical trials. One limitation of present HDACi is their nonspecificity, affecting many HDACs with similar effectiveness. We {{have identified a}} small molecule, the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide (PN), which specifically depletes HDAC 1 protein without affecting other class I/II HDACs. HDAC 1  depletion occurred through proteasomal degradation and resulted in transcriptional consequences comparable to those observed with pan-HDACi. Surprisingly, HDAC 1 depletion did not occur through the <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator</b> IKK 2, a known PN target and regulator of HDAC 1. Rather, PN promoted HDAC 1 depletion and cell death through the DNA-damage-transducer ataxia telangiectasia mutated.

40|$|The injury {{caused by}} {{myocardial}} reperfusion after ischemia can be contained by interventions {{aimed at reducing}} the inflammation and the oxidative stress that underlie exacerbation of tissue damage. Sphingolipids are a class of structural and signaling lipid molecules; among them, the <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator</b> ceramide accumulates in the myocardium upon ischemia/reperfusion. Here, we show that, after transient coronary occlusion in mice, an increased de novo ceramide synthesis takes place at reperfusion in the ischemic area surrounding necrosis (area at risk). This correlates with the enhanced expression {{of the first and}} rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pathway, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The intraventricular administration at reperfusion of myriocin, an inhibitor of SPT, significantly protected the area at risk from damage, reducing the infarcted area by 40. 9 % relative to controls not treated with the drug. In the area at risk, myriocin downregulated ceramide, reduced the content in other <b>mediators</b> of <b>inflammation</b> and reactive oxygen species, and activated the Nrf 2 -HO 1 cytoprotective response.

In autoimmune diseases such as RA and multiple sclerosis (MS), IL- 17 is produced by helper T (Th) cells that are stimulated by IL- 1 β and IL- 6 derived from phagocytes such as macrophages and from tissue cells. IL- 17 contributes to various lesions that are produced by Th 17 cells, one subset of helper T cells, and by γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells. It strongly contributes to autoimmune diseases that are accompanied by chronic inflammation. Thus, a functional understanding of Th 17 cells is extremely important.

A study was designed to determine if spontaneous labor at term was associated with changes in IL- 1 activity in amniotic fluid. Such fluid was retrieved from 41 women in labor and from 39 women who were not in labor at term. Immunodetectable IL- 1 β was present in 22 of the 41 women in labor but in only 8 of the 39 women without labor.

40|$|Introduction: Bromelain, {{a mixture}} of proteases derived from {{different}} parts of pineapple, has been described to have therapeutic benefits in a diversity of inflammatory diseases. Such effects are associated to its proteolytic activity. As {{one of the most common}} and multifactorial diseases, periodontitis is a bacterial infection that results from the damage to the integrity of the tissues around the tooth, which includes gingiva, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. In periodontitis, the recruitment of defense cells occurs, which releases several pro-inflammatory cytokines. At elevated levels, they can potentiate the alveolar bone loss. Studies have been conducted trying to alleviate the damage to the periodontium, however, the regeneration of the periodontal tissues is still limited. The Hypotheses: Based on previous studies showing that bromelain can act by decreasing the periodontal microorganism growth by proteolytically cleaving important cell surface molecules in leucocytes, by reducing neutrophils migration to periodontal sites, by downregulating the <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator</b> levels, and by decreasing alveolar bone loss in the periodontitis. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: In a first moment, to evaluate this hypothesis, could be used two animal models: the ligature or bacteria inoculation induced periodontitis. If studies using animal models show encouraging results, appropriate clinical trials should be designed to evaluate the effect of bromelain as a complementary treatment for periodontal disease in humans, during the active phase or after the healing phase of mechanical therapy could be tested; to conduct a placebo-controlled study where health and periodontitis patients could be used...|$|R
40|$|Experimental alcohol-induced liver {{injury is}} {{exacerbated}} by a high polyunsaturated fat diet rich in linoleic acid. We postulated that bioactive oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs) {{play a critical role}} in the development/progression of alcohol-mediated hepatic inflammation and injury. OXLAMs are endogenous ligands for transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1). Herein, we evaluated the role of signaling through TRPV 1 in an experimental animal model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Chronic binge alcohol administration increased plasma OXLAM levels, specifically 9 - and 13 -hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids. This effect was associated with up-regulation of hepatic TRPV 1. Exposure of hepatocytes to these OXLAMs in vitro resulted in activation of TRPV 1 signal transduction with increased intracellular Ca 2 + levels. Genetic depletion of TRPV 1 did not blunt hepatic steatosis caused by ethanol, but prevented hepatic injury. TRPV 1 deficiency protected from hepatocyte death and prevented the increase in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, including tumor necrosis factor-α, IL- 6, macrophage inflammatory protein- 2, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. TRPV 1 depletion markedly blunted ethanol-mediated induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, an important alcohol-induced hepatic <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator,</b> via fibrin accumulation. This study indicates, for the first time, that TRPV 1 receptor pathway may be involved in hepatic inflammatory response in an experimental animal model of ALD. TRPV 1 -OXLAM interactions appear to play a significant role in hepatic inflammation/injury, further supporting an important role for dietary lipids in ALD...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} {{disorders such as}} inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect {{bone metabolism}} and are frequently associated {{with the presence of}} osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, <b>inflammation</b> and inflammatory <b>mediators</b> such as TNF, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies.

The release of chronic <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediators</b> and insulin resistance in diabetic brain gave rise to the generation of toxic factor Aβ 42 which was the marker of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, the impairment of memory in diabetes mellitus was also correlated predominantly with uptake/metabolism of glucose in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Previously, anti-inflammation and hypoglycemic effects of berberine (BBr) have been described in peripheral tissues. For better understanding the effects of BBr on cognitive action in diabetics, we investigated the functions of BBr involved in anti-inflammation and ameliorating insulin resistance in prefrontal cortex of diabetic rats. Methods: Intragastric administration of BBr (187. 5 mg/Kg/d) was used in diabetic rats. Fear-condition assay was applied for cognitive assessment, and relative protein expressions were detected by western-blot. The glucose uptake in prefrontal cortex of diabetic rats was tested by Positron-Emission Tomography imaging. The levels of <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediators</b> were determined by commercial ELISA kits. Results: The inflammation mediator release and insulin resistance in the mPFC of diabetic rats was inhibited by BBr. The activation of PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathway, as well as two novel isoforms PKCη and PKC and the translocation of NF-κB in neuron were also down-regulated by BBr; furthermore, the neuron specific glucose transporter GLUT 3 was remarkably augmented by 2 – 3 times when compared with diabetic group; meanwhile, BBr also promoted glucose uptake in the brain. Additionally BBr decreased the expressions of amyloid precursor protein and BACE- 1, and the production of oligomeric Aβ 42. Finally, it accelerates the reinforcement of the information and ameliorates cognitive impairment. Conclusion: BBr inhibited the activation of inflammation pathway and insulin resistance in the mPFC of diabetic rats. Finally, it improved the lesion of cognition in diabetic rats...|$|E

Recent studies have established the 15 -PGDH gene as a colon cancer suppressor. Methods: We evaluated 15 -PDGH as a colon cancer susceptibility locus in a three-stage design. We first genotyped 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 15 -PGDH gene, spanning, 50 kb up and down-stream of the coding region, in 464 colon cancer cases and 393 population controls. We then genotyped the same SNPs, and also assayed the expression levels of 15 -PGDH in colon tissues from 69 independent patients for whom colon tissue and paired germline DNA samples were available. In the final stage 3, we genotyped the 9 most promising SNPs from stages 1 and 2 in an independent sample of 525 cases and 816 controls (stage 3). Results: In the first two stages, three SNPs (rs 1365611, rs 6844282 and rs 2332897) were statistically significant (p, 0. 05) in combined analysis of association with risk of colon cancer and of association with 15 -PGDH expression, after adjustment for multiple testing. For one additional SNP, rs 2555639, the T allele showed increased cancer risk and decreased 15 -PGDH expression, but just missed statistical significance (p-adjusted = 0. 063).

The physiologic pattern of cytokine release and their dynamic relationship was found to be preserved with a quick return to a balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation as shown by the IL- 6 /IL- 10 and TNF-α/IL 10 ratios (used to assess the inflammatory balance). A correlation was found between perioperative pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and the severity of the liver disease necessitating OLT. In summary, cirrhotic patients can achieve a balanced inflammatory response to surgery which is considered a primary requirement for uneventful grafts and patients' postoperative recovery.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the potential of}} multiple stimuli-responsive nanogels as carriers in topical drug administration, {{with a view to}} developing a multi-responsive topical delivery system. Firstly, temperature-responsive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was co-polymerised with a butyl acrylate monomer to yield poly(NIPAM-co- BA), which was loaded with a model permeant, methotrexate. An in vitro study of the loaded nanogel showed that it was capable of delivering methotrexate across the epidermis in levels that significantly reduce the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), a key <b>inflammation</b> <b>mediator.</b> Moreover, reduced lag time and enhanced delivery by the addition of sodium carbonate to the nanogel were observed. However, Western blotting for cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) in ex vivo skin, found the nanogel to be pro-inflammatory thus the observed reduced level of PGE 2 was due to the enhanced delivery of methotrexate, which overwhelmed the inflammatory effect produced by the nanogel. Next, a temperature- and pH-responsive polyNIPAM copolymerised with acrylic acid known as poly(NIPAM-co-AAc) (5 %) nanogel was synthesised. An in vitro migration study demonstrated that particles of the poly(NIPAM-co-AAc) (5 %) were capable of penetrating the porcine skin and migrating across the epidermis, as shown by the presence of the particulates in the diffusion cell receptor phases. Furthermore, the nanogels were shown to enhance the delivery of loaded drugs across the epidermis in comparison to saturated solutions of the corresponding drugs. Western blotting for COX- 2 demonstrated that the nanogel did not induce significant inflammatory reactions post-topical application, suggesting its compatibility with skin. A preliminary investigation examined a single-compartment system comprised of poly(NIPAM-co-AAc) (5 %) nanogel and pH modulator-containing liposome, designed to remain stable until its application onto the skin. However, the composite system proved unsuccessful, primarily due to the liposome instability. Overall, this novel smart topical drug delivery system is within reach, provided the pH modulator-loaded liposome can be adequately stabilised...|$|R
30|$|Various angiogenic {{factors have}} been implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of CNV, with VEGF putatively the key player. The advent of targeted pharmacologic inhibition of VEGF {{has been a major}} advance in the management of CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [1]. There are no randomized clinical trials providing evidence for the efficacy of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of CNV in conditions other than AMD. Nevertheless, given their excellent safety profile, these agents are widely used in all subfoveal CNV cases regardless of etiology, including PIC [2, 3]. It remains unclear why CNV responds in different ways to anti-VEGF treatment. A multifactorial etiology of ocular angiogenesis, including <b>inflammation</b> and <b>mediators</b> other than VEGF, as well as the different levels of vascular maturation of the neovascular complex, has been proposed.|$|R
