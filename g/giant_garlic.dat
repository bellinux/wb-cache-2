50|$|Aquatic trace fossils {{are also}} abundant. Two major ichnofacies are observed, bearing close {{resemblance}} to assemblages found in Antarctica and demonstrating proximity of western Australia and Antarctica {{at the time}} of deposition. One is dominated by Skolithos, suggesting marine deposition. The fabric of the other is dominated by Heimdallia, a strange planar trace that does not have a circular cross-section; it is interrupted in places by Beaconella, a wide trace thought to be constructed by a burrowing arthropod ploughing through the sediment for food, leaving a mound of piled sediment {{at the end of each}} trace. This may suggest the Beaconella organism feeding on Heimdallia. Daedalus, a trace fossil resembling a <b>giant</b> <b>garlic,</b> is also present in this assemblage.|$|E
50|$|Others in {{quantity}} were: alfalfa, apples, apricots, chestnuts, col, cotton, cucumber, forage, <b>garlic,</b> <b>giant</b> radish, hemp, indigo, lupulus, millet, nuts, onions, opium poppies (for opium), peaches, pears, peanuts, rice, ricine, rye, sesame, sugar beet, sweet potatoes, thyme, tobacco, and others. In Amur land (Manchu side) honey (1,800 tonnes) was collected.|$|R
5|$|The Tualatin Riverkeepers, {{a nonprofit}} {{watershed}} council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water {{resources in the}} Tualatin River watershed, and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are Japanese knotweed, meadow knapweed, <b>giant</b> hogweed, <b>garlic</b> mustard and purple loosestrife. The Oregon Department of Agriculture {{and the city of}} Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.|$|R
