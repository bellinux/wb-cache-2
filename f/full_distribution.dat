25|$|A {{significant}} increase in accuracy (to nearly ~80%) was made by exploiting multiple sequence alignment; knowing the <b>full</b> <b>distribution</b> of amino acids that occur at a position (and in its vicinity, typically ~7 residues on either side) throughout evolution provides a much better picture of the structural tendencies near that position. For illustration, a given protein might have a glycine at a given position, which by itself might suggest a random coil there. However, multiple sequence alignment might reveal that helix-favoring amino acids occur at that position (and nearby positions) in 95% of homologous proteins spanning nearly a billion years of evolution. Moreover, by examining the average hydrophobicity at that and nearby positions, the same alignment might also suggest a pattern of residue solvent accessibility consistent with an α-helix. Taken together, these factors {{would suggest that the}} glycine of the original protein adopts α-helical structure, rather than random coil. Several types of methods are used to combine all the available data to form a 3-state prediction, including neural networks, hidden Markov models and support vector machines. Modern prediction methods also provide a confidence score for their predictions at every position.|$|E
40|$|Aggregate, {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of concrete, has a great effect on mechanical property and durability of concrete. Sulfoaluminate cement has lots of special properties such as high early-age compressive strength, fast hydration and setting rate, and hydration with slight swelling. But effect of aggregate gradation with <b>Fuller</b> <b>distribution</b> on properties of sulfoaluminate cement concrete was seldom studied. Hence, in this paper, experimental investigations on mechanical property and durability of sulfoaluminate cement concrete with aggregate gradations according to <b>Fuller</b> <b>distribution</b> were presented. <b>Fuller</b> <b>distribution</b> of aggregates was beneficial to the close packing of aggregates, and the packing density was changed by adjusting the aggregate gradations.

The relationship between packing density of aggregate and water penetration depth obeyed the second-order polynomial y = 0. 002 x 2 – 6. 8638 x + 5862. 3 and had a notable correlation R 2 = 0. 9799. The sulfoaluminate cement concrete with total aggregate gradation with <b>Fuller</b> <b>distribution</b> for h = 0. 50 had the best resistance capability to sulfate attack. It was a second-order polynomial relationship between packing density of aggregates and water penetration depth of y = 0. 002 x 2 – 6. 8638 x + 5862. 3 with R 2 = 0. 9799, which indicated notable correlation.
