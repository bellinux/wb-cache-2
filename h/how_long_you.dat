500|$|Salinger was {{assigned}} to a counter-intelligence division, for which he used his proficiency in French and German to interrogate prisoners of war. In April 1945 he entered a liberated concentration camp, probably one of Dachau's sub-camps. Salinger earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and served in five campaigns. Salinger's experiences in the war affected him emotionally. He was hospitalized {{for a few weeks}} for combat stress reaction after Germany was defeated, and he later told his daughter: [...] "You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely, no matter <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> live." [...] Both of his biographers speculate that Salinger drew upon his wartime experiences in several stories, such as [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor", which is narrated by a traumatized soldier. Salinger continued to write while serving in the army, publishing several stories in slick magazines such as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. He also continued to submit stories to The New Yorker, but with little success; it rejected all of his submissions from 1944 to 1946, a group of 15poems in 1945 alone.|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes you wonder if the century, not Senior, has lost its way." [...] Since his death, no Oriole has worn Cal Sr.'s number 7, although the number has not been officially retired.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ...

[...] / [...] "See Petka, it is a line you may see far away in the steppe when the weather is good.

[...] "A lot of this game is about conditioning and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> can give your best performance." [...] Gordon also revealed {{that he was in the}} process of designing an energy drink called BG7, an allusion to his initials and jersey number. Gordon unveiled the drink at One Sixty Blue, a restaurant co-owned by Michael Jordan. The drink was made with white tea, which has a very high amount of antioxidants, and the most polyphenols of any tea.|$|E

Torque is contacted by Miles, who angrily tells him [...] "how long it's been man? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> been making a mockery of everything?"

Elroy tells Torque the prison has descended into chaos since {{the appearance of the}} malefactors, and asks for help in restoring order. He is able to convince the guards and prisoners to work together, and with Torque's help they are able to escape, although Torque remains behind.|$|E
