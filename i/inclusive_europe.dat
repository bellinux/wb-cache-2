40|$|The article {{presents}} a panorama {{of the situation}} of the <b>inclusive</b> education in <b>Europe</b> from the relation existing between the structures of the European education systems and the models of inclusive education developed by the various countries. We also analyse the development of the systems of integration and "specific centre" and how some nuances were introduced between the two forms of conceiving the inclusive education throughout the last twenty years. The analysis of the numbers of students diagnosed BEP (SpecialNeeds and Inclusive Education) and of those who study in specific centres in each of the countries is interesting to deduce that the criteria used in <b>inclusive</b> education in <b>Europe</b> are far from being homogeneous enough and that both big trends: integration and education in specific centre continue existing in Europe with a clear trend towards the inclusive mode...|$|R

As such he was regularly meeting with the Belgian authorities on matters concerning local Jewishness. These meetings sometimes happen together with the two other Belgian-Jewish roof-organizations: the Forum voor Joodse Organisaties, from Flanders and the CCOJB (Comité de Coordination des Organisations Juives de Belgique), a more French-speaking umbrella. As president of the Consistoire he represented the Jewish community of Belgium at the abdication ceremony of King Albert II and at the swearing in of king Philippe on 21 July 2013. The Consistoire was founded in 1808 by the emperor Napoleon I. The official celebrations of the Bicentenary were held in Brussels in 2008. One of the ceremonies was an academic session at the Great Synagogue of Brussels. Thanks to his efforts, the national event was deeply honored, and this {{for the first time since}} the Belgian independence in 1830, by the presence of the actual reigning king, Albert II.

The reports for the entire period show that {{progress has been made}} in the situation for women through specific programs, but the results are always lower than expected. Thus, inequalities persist in several areas, and developments are the source of new challenges. The main objective of this article is to show how gender equality influences EU funded programs and what issues arise depending on the area in which it is applied. We intend to highlight the types of projects that have gender equality objectives and successful models, considering the context in which these projects were carried out and highlighting the determinants of their success.

It argues that in the context of Turkey's internal politics and the European Union's (EU's) consideration of Turkey's candidature, an essentialist view of identity is constitutive of hostile relations between the EU and Turkey and within Turkish and European societies. Conversely, the adoption of a critical and reflexive cosmopolitan outlook as theory and political practice - examples of which are to be found in the Turkish political reform process and some of the recent practice of the European Commission - offers the best hope for a cosmopolitan <b>Europe</b> <b>inclusive</b> of cosmopolitan Turkey...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} belief {{that in order to}} cure the so-called crisis of democracy, citizens’ involvement in decision-making processes needs to be fostered. However, despite {{the fact that there is}} a move towards more <b>inclusive</b> institutions in <b>Europe,</b> changes implementing democratic innovations at the national level remain rare. Why are democratic innovations not implemented more often? In this article, we provide explanations on why inertia seems to win over change through an analysis of party elites’ willingness to enact democratic innovations across 15 European democracies, by using the PartiRep Comparative MP Survey. This research concentrates on party-level factors: party age, time in government and party ideology. Findings suggest that institutional inertia is partially rooted on the fact that party elites’ support for democratic innovations is heavily related to anti-establishment parties, to left-wing parties and to parties with limited access to power.

30|$|When Copenhagen, {{the capital}} of Denmark, proclaims that it will become the most <b>inclusive</b> city in <b>Europe</b> by 2015, that {{integration}} is a two-way process and that diversity is strength (Copenhagen, 2011), {{it is easy to}} think that the Danish national model for integration is losing its influence and power. After all, the ambitions of Copenhagen are very different from the assimilation policy of the central government. But local integration policies matter little when central governments use coercive instruments to ensure compliance with national integration policies. A city like Copenhagen may want {{to break out of the}} policy frame set by the central government, but when it comes to policies for migrant newcomers, all they can do is decide more about less. The city still has to implement a never ending list of integration measures and administer the integration requirements directed at migrants that are laid down in the Integration Act and other state legislation.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, drafted as {{an input}} to the discussions at the EPC Strategic Council and the EPC’s 20 th Anniversary Conference on 13 October, Janis A. Emmanouilidis and Fabian Zuleeg discuss {{the future of}} the European project, and what’s {{actually}} at stake; not only the fate of an international institution, but something more significant – it is about our way of life; it is about being an open, free, cooperative, internationalist and <b>inclusive</b> <b>Europe.</b> After a detailed analysis of {{the current state of the}} Union, the many complex and interlinked crises it is facing, and what (not) to expect next, they examine the underlying causes of the forces threatening today´s societies. The biggest threat of all, they argue, is the danger of a regressive and illiberal Europe – a Europe in which key values, orientations, norms, and principles are being undermined, and nationalistic, protectionist, discriminatory, xenophobic, intolerant and authoritarian elements get the upper hand. Although this publication does not offer a single answer or solution – or even suggest there is such a ‘silver bullet’ –, the authors do provide some guiding thoughts on how pro-European democratic forces can push back against the polarisation and rising insecurities that seem to have taken a hold of European societies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCycling is {{not only}} {{improving}} the livability of cities, public health, air quality, or the CO 2 balance, it also creates “hard economic value and jobs”. It is therefore a perfect tool for transition in the transport sector, providing {{a large number of}} assets, including jobs. Although the latter point is important to attract public authority consideration and investment in cycling, good information has hitherto been lacking. At regional or city level, some estimates of jobs in the cycling sector are available. At European level however, job figures have been quite scarce. This is the reason why ECF, in partnership with its Cycling Industry Club (CIC), asked TML to assess the jobs in the European cycling sector. TML assessed the number of jobs today and in the future, assuming a doubling in the modal share of cycling. It calculated full-time equivalent jobs in 5 subsectors:•bicycle retail (mainly sales and repair),•bicycle industry (manufacturing and wholesale),•bicycle infrastructure,•bicycle tourism (accommodation and restaurants),•bicycle services. For most sectors job figures linked to cycling were not directly available. TML therefore consulted literature, national studies on the subject, national accounts, used some proxies and did some statistical analysis to provide estimates of jobs in the cycling sector. The study found that more than 650, 000 jobs are linked to cycling today in the EU- 27 and more than 400, 000 new ones could be created in the future with a doubling of cycling modal share. Other interesting findings concern the characteristics of these jobs. Cycling could, compared to other sectors, create:•more local jobs,•more jobs for lower skilled workers,•more jobs per euro spent. It could thus open an interesting window for opportunity for a transition to a more <b>inclusive</b> <b>Europe.</b> In 2015, ECF is producing another report on the economic benefits of cycling, more specifically regarding benefits which occur at the local level. Several studies have shown that, besides creating jobs, making cities more cycling-friendly has beneficial effects for e. g. the businesses of local retailers or for property value along traffic-calmed roads. ECF's aim is to provide an overview {{of the results of the}} research done so far and identify areas where further investigation is needed. The paper summarises both reports in order to show how cycling as a mode of transport is a factor of economic growth and provides social benefits...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the new European economic governance, neoliberal views on wages have further increased in prominence and have steered various reforms of collective bargaining rules and practices. As the crisis in Europe came to be largely interpreted as a crisis of competitiveness, wages were seen as the core adjustment variable for ‘internal devaluation’, the claim being that competitiveness could be restored through a reduction of labour costs. This book proposes an alternative view according to which wage developments need to be strengthened through a Europe-wide coordinated reconstruction of collective bargaining as a precondition for more sustainable and more <b>inclusive</b> growth in <b>Europe.</b> It contains major research findings from the CAWIE 2 – Collectively Agreed Wages in Europe – project, conducted in 2014 – 2015 for the purpose of discussing and debating the currently dominant policy perspectives on collectively-bargained wage systems under the new European economic governance. nrpages: 417 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|For all {{citizens}} to participate fully {{in society and}} to improve employability, a basic level of education is required. Education is {{a key factor in}} preventing poverty, achieving social inclusion objectives, and in ensuring that Europe can develop a “smart growth” agenda because the growing numbers of knowledge-intensive jobs require higher levels of education and those with low levels of qualification could potentially be significantly excluded (Lennert et al., 2010). The transition towards a more knowledge-intensive economy can only take place with increasing levels of education. Carneiro (2006, p. 98) specifically argues that “education directly affects individual employment and earnings and therefore it contributes to income inequality for a given cross section of individuals”. The EU 2020 S itself associates high levels of early school leaving with a range of negative impacts on individuals, societies and economies (European Commission, 2011 a); improving educational attainment is therefore critical for the develpment of a smart, <b>inclusive</b> and sustainable <b>Europe...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1933, {{with the}} rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany, the Jewish {{situation}} became more severe.

40|$|The European Union {{seems to}} have rescued its single currency, {{but it has not}} yet {{put an end to the}} crisis. In this major new book, a group of fifteen {{international}} philosophers, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and legal experts compare the economic, political, constitutional, social, and cultural interpretations of the European crisis. They describe the challenges the EU faces in relation to legitimacy and democracy and address head-on the uncertainty over the future of Europe. The book considers different possible scenarios—from the Union's dissolution, with or without the continuation of the integration process, to its reinforcement through the building of a political union addressing the challenges of legitimacy, democracy and justice. Such a strengthened union could mark a new stage for democracy—not the democracy of ancient cities and modern states, but one convenient to the complex entities, neither national nor supra-national, of which the European Union, despite the crisis, is still the best modern example.

40|$|This paper aims at {{analyzing}} {{the theme of}} inclusion of physically and socially disadvantaged people {{in the management of}} cultural organizations. The objective of the analysis is to investigate this subject in the context of changes that has characterized the recent years. The research analyzes whether current and emerging managerial approaches are consistent with or reflect the perspectives on inclusion promoted by European policies (in particular the strategy Europe 2020 for a smart, sustainable and <b>inclusive</b> <b>Europe),</b> by the Council of Europe Faro Convention and by UNESCO key documents, particularly the Declarations on Cultural Diversity, 2001, the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, 2005 but also more specific documents concerning disability such as the New Delhi Declaration on Inclusive ICTs for Persons with Disabilities: Making Empowerment a Reality, 2014, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2006, or the Recommendation concerning the Most Effective Means of Rendering Museums Accessible to Everyone, 1960. Furthermore, the analysis aims at understanding the peculiarities and characteristics of current and emerging managerial approaches in relation to this theme. For this purpose, a research has been carried out in two phases: a theoretical analysis and an empirical investigation. The theoretical analysis focused on understanding the main managerial and economic approaches to the theme of inclusion in the cultural sector. The empirical analysis was structured in two main phases: In the first phase, interviews and meetings with key players of the cultural sector were carried out. This phase aimed at gathering information that could lead to the selection of a small sample of representatives of cultural organizations that are promoting innovative managerial approaches to the issue of inclusion in cultural organizations and at identifying selected case studies that could be relevant to this topic. In the second phase, the sample of representatives of cultural organizations was contacted via email or phone. Research interviews were carried out with directors and managers of the chosen case studies. The institutions selected are located in Italy and France, two countries that are characterized by a relevant presence of cultural heritage assets as recognized by the high number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Starting from the theoretical premises, this chapter is divided into four main sections. This introductory part is followed by a second section that explores the main theoretical approaches to the theme of inclusion under a managerial perspective. The following section analyzes the economic and managerial criteria and approaches to this issue, discussing the degree of consistency of these perspectives with the scenarios proposed by European policies, by UNESCO conventions, recommendations and declarations and by the Council of Europe Faro Convention. As a result of this analysis, an innovative approach is proposed. This approach is analyzed by means of an empirical investigation of specific case studies of cultural organizations that have been implementing innovative perspectives to inclusion. The chapter ends with some concluding remarks on the results of the analysis, highlighting also potential research developments in the future...|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} the Jews during World War II is almost synonymous with the Jewish {{persecution}} and murder of unprecedented scale in modern times in political <b>Europe</b> <b>inclusive</b> of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). The massive scale of the Holocaust which happened during World War II heavily affected the Jewish nation and world public opinion, which only understood {{the dimensions of the}} Final Solution after the war. The genocide known as HaShoah in Hebrew, aimed at the elimination of the Jewish people on the European continent. It was a broadly organized operation led by Nazi Germany, in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty. During the Holocaust in occupied Poland, more than one million Jews were murdered in gas chambers of the Auschwitz concentration camp alone. The murder of the Jews of Europe affected Jewish communities in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Channel Islands, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.|$|R

Auf der Analyseebene des organisationalen Feldes wird untersucht, welche Rolle Marktmechanismen und öffentliche Regulierungen für die Institutionalisierung des Zweiten Bildungswegs spielen. In diesem Beitrag stellen die AutorInnen erste Ergebnisse dieses Teilprojekts am Beispiel der Berufsreifeprüfung und der Gymnasien für Berufstätige vor. Zentrale Befunde: Der Zweite Bildungsweg zerfällt in Österreich in einzelne Subfelder, weswegen pauschale Aussagen nicht möglich sind und eine Herausbildung von gemeinsamen institutionellen Grundlagen erschwert wird. Die institutionellen Grundlagen müssen Subfeld für Subfeld rekonstruiert werden. Die Perspektive des organisationalen Felds hilft dabei, institutionelle Einheiten abzugrenzen, für die sich sinnvoll die Frage nach Professionalisierungsstrategien stellen lässt. Denn Professionalisierung ist auch eine Strategie, die Macht der ArbeitgeberInnen – ob nun gewinnorientierte Unternehmen oder die öffentliche Hand –, die Lohn- und Arbeitsbedingungen diktieren, zu begrenzen. (DIPF/Orig.) The examinations {{of the division}} of tasks between the state and private individuals active in continuing education suffer from general statements and false oppositions. Generalizations do not do justice to the particularities of different areas of continuing education. Assumptions of how the state, the market or civil society allegedly act, do not agree with the wealth of facets of social reality. While such debates threaten to bear no fruit, they indicate a perspective that has been suppressed in the discourse on lifelong learning: that of conflict. A subproject of the research project ENLIVEN (Encouraging Lifelong Learning for an <b>Inclusive</b> and Vibrant <b>Europe),</b> which is funded by the European Commission (running from 2016 to 2019) as part of the Horizon- 2020 programme, is concerned with second chance education course offerings. On the level of analysis of the organizational field, it is investigated what role market mechanisms and public regulation play in the institutionalization of second chance education. In this article, the authors present the initial findings of this subproject using the example of the university entrance exam and the gymnasiums/secondary schools for people who are employed. The main findings: second chance education in Austria is disintegrating into individual subfields, which is why blanket statements are not possible and the development of common institutional principles is complicated. The institutional principles must be reconstructed subfield by subfield. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the article is social and {{occupational}} activation of persons at risk of social exclusion. The phenomenon of social exclusion is an important socio-economic problem today and an important area {{for the implementation of}} the priorities of EU cohesion policy. This policy sets out the indicators to be achieved by 2020. Among the specific measures to achieve the set goals particularly significant is the implementation of the concept of supported employment targeted at people at risk of social exclusion. It has been outlined that the core document defining current EU policies and guidelines is the aforementioned “Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and <b>Inclusive</b> Growth, <b>EUROPE</b> 2020 ” setting out the following key priorities for the focus of for EU Member States: 1) intelligent development - development of knowledge- and innovation based economy, 2) sustainable development - supporting a more resource efficient, more environmentally-friendly, and more competitive economy, 3) inclusive growth - supporting economy with high employment rate which ensures social and territorial cohesion. It has been stated that. “National Strategy for Social Integration for Poland” the areas of exclusion include: 1) living in unfavorable economic conditions, 2) unfavorable effect of social processes resulting from massive, dynamic developmental changes, 3) insufficient life capital, 4) lack of access to appropriate institutions, 5) experiencing discrimination, 6) personal traits that hinder the use of common social resources. It seems that the basis task of a researcher in this context is not so much solving but rather identification of a problem stemming from objective conditions generating phenomena of marginalization and social exclusion. This analytical effort, taken in the frames of different research orientations is aimed at changing mechanisms ruling this process. It is not so much about providing universal solutions as these may be different for each society and must be looked for taking consideration of local economic and specific cultural conditions...|$|R
40|$|Europe is {{undergoing}} considerable demographic, economic, cultural and socio-political change. National citizenship identities have been {{challenged by the}} simultaneous processes of European integration and the migration of people into and across Europe. This paper explores how {{the current generation of}} youth relates towards Europe, and highlights the factors affecting their political knowledge, interests and identities. Although the article draws on mainly qualitative data from a study into the political identities of native youth and youth of Turkish descent in England and Germany, the results have implications for all European countries [1]. The research indicates that, in countries which promote European agendas and where schools and curricula emphasise an <b>inclusive</b> concept of <b>Europe</b> (e. g. Goethe Gymnasium in Stuttgart), young people have high levels of knowledge about Europe and make Europe part of their hybrid identities. However, in countries where governments and schools marginalise European agendas (e. g. Millroad School in London), young people struggle to relate positively to Europe, especially in working-class contexts where national(istic) agendas come to the fore. The article raises important questions about the possibilities of promoting inclusive governmental and curriculum approaches and offers ways in which the knowledge and identity gaps between youth in different European countries could be addressed...|$|R
40|$|In 2009 the Strategic Framework for European Co-operation in Education and Training (ET 2020) set the {{priorities}} {{for education and}} training for the 21 st century. The Council Conclusions of 12 May 2009 of the ET 2020 highlighted inclusive education {{as the most important}} objective and the fundamental imperative in education to achieve a just and equal society. Until recently, however, at an international level it was not unusual to talk about integration and special needs education as critical strategies for education and training. The differences between these terms have not always been clear, neither have their implications for practice. After providing an overview of the terminology currently used and discussing the differences between these notions, the article will focus on strategies being used to promote the development of <b>inclusive</b> education in <b>Europe</b> as a way to promote social cohesion and equality. The article shows that a change in terminology does not only require a shift in the language used, but also a shift in educational paradigms and most importantly in the agenda for policy and practice. Examples of some of the changes needed to promote inclusion will be drawn from the recommendations of the UNESCO Policy Guidelines (2009) and Agency work...|$|R
40|$|Europe is {{currently}} facing {{the reality of}} a new international multipolar context in which {{the rules of the game}} are being reset. The industrial and innovation policies that have traditionally ruled international competitiveness are rapidly changing. Many nations strong in the international arena master not only the policies and strategies for cost-driven competition but also the craft of innovation in traditional and in selected high-tech sectors. In concordance with the new landscape in the international industrial dynamics arena, new rationales for the rate and direction of innovation policy in Europe are now being defined. The core of the Europe 2020 Strategy 1 agreed by Member States at the June 2010 European Council is to underpin a smart, sustainable and <b>inclusive</b> growth in <b>Europe.</b> In contrast with the Lisbon Strategy core concept 2, the tone and intentionality of the new European strategy redefines the main lines of policy and intervention with broader humanistic rationales. While aiming to tackle lasting and pervasive global problems on issues like climate change, health, high-quality and affordable food, energy supply, the scarcity of resources and the impact of demographic changes, the new strategy has the potential to unleash new multipliers of economic activity that will help differentiate Europe in the international trade landscape. Here the redefinition of innovation policy towards the great human challenges beyond international competitiveness is likely to play a major role...|$|R

Bio-events allow correlation of the section studied with the Campanian Exochosphaeridium? masureae, Areoligera coronata and Samlandia mayi zones, the Maastrichtian Pervosphaeridium tubuloaculeatum, Deflandrea galeata and Hystrichostrogylon coninckii zones, and the Danian Damassadinium californicum Zone. In addition, a correlation with other zonal schemes for the southern North Sea Basin and with conventional northwest European belemnite zones is presented. Comparisons with Boreal and Tethyan realms confirm that most bio-events may also be useful for interregional and global correlation. The Campanian-Danian dinocyst biostratigraphy of the Meer borehole is put alongside geophysical well logs and an ecozonation, in order to check the validity of lithostratigraphical correlations across the Campine Basin. This first, detailed correlation attempt shows that sensitivities to facies change associated with differences in accommodation space and sediment supply appear {{to be at the}} base of slight, yet consistent, shifts between the local lithological succession and the standard lithostratigraphical scheme of the Maastricht type area...|$|R

It contains the contributions from the 2011 EUDO Dissemination Conference on <b>Inclusive</b> Democracy in <b>Europe,</b> and the EUDO Online Forum Debate on National Voting Rights for EU Citizens Residing in Other Member StatesIn this publication, academics, policy-makers, and representatives of civil society explore the history and nature of migrant political participation in Europe and consider policy options for remedying the democratic deficit {{in light of the}} political realities of modern Europe. The contributors provide a comprehensive discussion of inclusive democracy in the European Union, considering principles of democracy, conceptions of national and EU citizenship, and the political and institutional practicalities of national and European policy change. The first section brings together contributions from the 2011 Dissemination Conference organised by the European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO, www. eudo. eu) and co-funded by the European Commission (Lifelong Learning Programme, Jean Monnet action) on <b>Inclusive</b> Democracy in <b>Europe.</b> The second section of the eBook exhibits the EUDO CITIZENSHIP Forum Debate on the voting rights of second-country nationals in the European Union. Contributors to the debate examine the contradictory nature of two of the fundamental rights of EU citizenship: the right to free movement and the right to participate in the political life of one’s country of residence. Those who exercise their right to free movement sometimes forfeit their right to vote in national elections in their country of origin but are also disenfranchised in their country of residence. The book includes revised papers which were initially presented at the Conference “ 2011 EUDO Dissemination Conference: Inclusive Democracy in Europe”, co-funded by the Lifelong Learning Programme, EACEA decision no. 2011 - 2845 / 001 - 001 [...] P. 6.

40|$|Post-modernistic {{concept of}} {{education}} founds {{the idea of}} integrational school, namely a school for everybody, also for children with mild mental disability. It transcends categorisation and {{it is based on}} sending special needs children into appropriate programme with specific adjustments and help to cater individual needs. As oppose to learning and production orientated school, the inclusive school emphasises social skills which enable children with special needs to integrate as well as possible into classes and also into wider social environment. The influence of inclusion of children with mild mental disability into regular primary school education is reflected on their peers as well. They express more tolerance and are more open to embrace differences, this being true also for their teachers and other personnel in primary school. Theoretical part presents education of children with mild mental disability. One can read presentations of different theories of processing special needs children, basic words and inclusive education conditions, factors enabling inclusive education. A list has also been added of some available national and foreign researches and types of <b>inclusive</b> education in <b>Europe.</b> Empirical part consists of data gathered through quantitative research method about factors that influence the success rate of including children with mild mental disorder into regular primary school educational programmes. We were interested how satisfied parents of these special needs children were with their education. We were also interested about opinions of parents of their peers as well as educational staff. The same research questions have been answered by educational staff and also by parents all over Bela Krajina region, in regular and special needs primary schools. With this we gathered opinions about including children with mild mental disability. Data has been gathered through party-structured interviews. Based on results of quantitative method, directions have been given to form inclusive schooling for children with mild mental disability. Besides this, we have presented different forms of help for these children, parents and also educational staff to use. In conclusion, data shows that there are needs for changes in the area of educating children with mild mental disabilities. All participants claim that these children can be successful in inclusive-orientated school, (with regards to individually set aims in programmes set with lower educational standards) and are also well-included into a regular class of their peers. Based on results, we can come to a conclusion that success of inclusive education depends on planning. For all participants in the research this means well planned education, additional education for the teachers and also support for the teachers, smaller classes, cooperation with parents of special needs children and introduction of these children to their teachers, peers and other parents. We {{came to the conclusion that}} including children with mild mental disability into inclusive education, everyone can gain, the children, their peers, teachers, other parents and the society as a whole. ...|$|R
40|$|Communiqué of the Conference of European Ministers Responsible for Higher Education, Leuven and Louvain-la-Neuve {{contains}} proposition {{to continue}} cooperation in further developing the European dimension of quality assurance. European approaches/dimensions in quality assurance comprise a harmonized conformity assessment system developing in the European Economic Area through {{implementation of a}} New Approach and Global Approach. Higher education institutions, with their triple roles as providers of {{the highest levels of}} education, advanced research and path-breaking innovation, {{are at the heart of}} Europe’s knowledge triangle. Implementation of cooperation/partnership arrangements should be encouraged to facilitate implementation of successful and significant value-adding solutions in applied research, practical education and innovation domains for increased effectiveness of Europe’s economy. In higher education should be created environment, promoting and facilitating acquisition of creative and innovative skills, developing production and entrepreneurial capabilities, purposeful inclusion/practising of students and academic staff in production/economic activities, particularly in development of small/medium size enterprises and small-scale production establishments. Student’s centred learning, balanced mobility will facilitate student’s aspirations to acquire useful and necessary knowledge, skills and competence and contribute alignment with the fast changing and value-adding production/economy system. New ‘learning outcomes approach’ is promoting implementation of essential transition/changes in the higher education: from inputs – study duration, study content and qualifications regulation towards study results – recognition/certification of the set of knowledge, skills and competence at the end of corresponding study cycle. Learning outcomes – totality of knowledge, skills and competence which student has acquired within the study programme/cycle and what is certified in the qualification description issued upon completion of bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral studies. QFD self-assessment methodology is based on careful evaluation of professional knowledge, practical skills/abilities and competence level acquired during different study activities of the study programme/cycle. Knowledge/competence comprises aligned continuum of knowledge, skills and competence which is formed within the thematic parts or modules of the study programme. Study module/course/subject study outcomes can be used for definition of criteria for normative conformity assessment and self-assessment of the student’s personal achievements. Scoring criteria are expressing expected results, how student will certify/demonstrate the completeness level of his/her acquired study outcomes after completion of the study module/course/subject. Ranking criteria are reflecting completeness of the acquired study outcomes, they can be evaluated using different scales. Teaching staff and personnel, researchers and professionals are the driving force of higher education/practical research institutions. Teaching staff, researchers are the main staff implementing the Bologna process at all levels of studies/ research training levels/cycles and increase in Bologna process effectiveness can be achieved by elimination of unproductive support/administrative processes/structures. Quality management – assurance, improvement and excellence systems started to emerge in European higher education simultaneously with the beginning of Bologna process, and gradually were developing in both – the regulatory and the voluntary spheres, taking into account the differences in study goals, content and activities of academic and professional studies. European approaches/dimensions to higer education – development of new, value inceasing professionalism, valuable/continuously developing qualifications, substantially enhancing intended smart, sustainable and <b>inclusive</b> growth in <b>Europe...</b>|$|R
