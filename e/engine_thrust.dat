5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control <b>engine</b> <b>thrust.</b> The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases <b>engine</b> <b>thrust.</b> The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> reverser deployed in-flight for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet <b>engine,</b> <b>thrust</b> is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} at Miami International Airport {{was partly}} {{shot at the}} Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show Top Gear, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards {{at the moment of}} full extension away from the plane.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E
50|$|For {{aircraft}} {{equipped with}} thrust reversers, the control for each thrust reverser is usually found {{adjacent to the}} corresponding <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust</b> lever.|$|R

50|$|When one of {{the engines}} on a typical multi-engine {{aircraft}} becomes inoperative, a thrust imbalance exists between the operative and inoperative sides of the aircraft. This thrust imbalance causes several negative effects {{in addition to the}} loss of one <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft <b>engine.</b> <b>Thrust</b> was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of <b>engine</b> <b>thrust.</b> The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
50|$|On 26 May 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, a Boeing 767-300ER, had an {{accidental}} {{deployment of the}} left <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust</b> reverser, which caused the airliner {{to go into a}} rapid dive and break up in mid-air. All 213 passengers and 10 crew were killed.|$|R
5|$|A {{project to}} improve the {{performance}} of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this significantly increased the <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust,</b> there was little improvement in overall performance, thus the project was shelved. The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969.|$|R
2500|$|After {{another two}} hours elapsed the {{aircraft}} was on descent to Hong Kong when, at 05:19 UTC, at a position about [...] southeast of Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the aircraft's ECAM displayed [...] "ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT" [...] and [...] "ENG 2 STALL" [...] {{within a short}} period of time. The second message signified an engine compressor stall, a potentially-serious engine problem. The flight crew accordingly carried out the necessary ECAM actions with No. 2 <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust</b> lever moved to the idle (or minimum-thrust) position. The crew increased No. 1 <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust</b> to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) to compensate for the low thrust of No. 2 engine. Following these actions the crew declared a [...] "Pan-pan" [...] with Hong Kong Air Traffic Control (ATC), requesting the shortest possible route to the airport and priority landing.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, payload {{increases}} are often achieved in later missions independent of <b>engine</b> <b>thrust.</b> This is by weight reduction or trajectory reshaping.|$|E
25|$|The {{result is}} {{there is no single}} {{absolute}} figure for <b>engine</b> <b>thrust,</b> stage thrust or vehicle payload. There are specified values and actual flight values, and various ways of measuring and deriving those actual flight values.|$|E
25|$|After the {{autopilot}} had been disengaged, the pilot flying increased <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> {{in reaction to}} a decrease in airspeed and a perception that the aircraft was sinking.

25|$|Investigators {{found that}} the hot air from the {{wildfires}} could have caused loss of <b>engine</b> <b>thrust,</b> resulting in loss of altitude. The Il-76's tail may have then clipped a hillock, causing {{the rest of the}} aircraft to collide with the hillside. The crew may have lost control of the aircraft after it started hitting trees.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} eventually climbed away over Port Phillip Bay. The {{first officer}} then reviewed the take-off performance calculations in his electronic flight bag, {{and discovered that}} he had understated the aircraft's weight by 100 tonnes (262.9 tonnes instead of 362.9). This meant that an incorrect flex temp was applied, which had resulted in a lower than necessary <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> and consequently insufficient acceleration and airspeed.|$|E
25|$|The ALF 502 has {{experienced}} multiple issues. Its internal electronics could overheat, triggering an automatic shutdown of an engine with no option for inflight restart, and certain rare atmospheric conditions {{could cause a}} loss of <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> due to internal icing.

50|$|Following Carl's {{completion}} of these flights for the Navy, NACA technicians at the High-Speed Flight Research Station (HSFRS) near Mojave, California, outfitted the LR-8 engine's combustion chambers with nozzle extensions {{to prevent the}} exhaust gas from affecting the rudders at supersonic speeds. This addition also increased the <b>engine's</b> <b>thrust</b> by 6.5 percent at Mach 1.7 and 70,000 feet (21,300 m).|$|R
25|$|Scavengers took <b>engine</b> <b>thrust</b> reversers, cockpit avionics, {{and other}} {{components}} from the crashed 757, using Colombian military and private helicopters {{to go to}} and from the crash site. Many of the stolen components re-appeared as unapproved aircraft parts on the black market in Greater Miami parts brokers. In response, the airline published a 14-page list stating all of the parts missing from the crashed aircraft. The list included the serial numbers of all of the parts.|$|E
25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the main wheels to gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the throttles to idle to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>thrust.</b> A squat switch in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed on}} 10 January 1964, on its 125th sortie, during a low-altitude hover. During a vertical descent the aircraft experienced uncontrollable divergent wing oscillations, the port wing eventually striking {{the ground at}} an acute angle with the aircraft rolling over because of the continued lift <b>engine</b> <b>thrust.</b> The loss was attributed to loss of control because the stabilising limits of the three-axis autostabilisation system's 'puffer pipes' were exceeded in roll. Although airframe damage was relatively light, the Centre D'Essai en Vol test pilot, Jacques Pinier, did not eject and died in the crash.|$|E
