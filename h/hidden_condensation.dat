40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>hidden</b> matter <b>condensation</b> on supersymmetry breaking in supergravity models derived from free fermionic strings. We find that the minimum of the effective potential in the modulus direction depends strongly on only one parameter which is fixed by the hidden sector. For nonpositive values of the parameter the potential is unstable which constrains realistic models severely. For positive and decreasing values which correspond to more and/or lighter hidden matter, $T_R$ increases whereas $T_I$ is periodic and depends on the parameter very weakly. Supersymmetry can be broken in the matter direction with a stable vacuum only if the fields which give mass to the hidden matter are light and have modulus independent Kahler potentials. Then, {{for a wide range}} of model parameters, supersymmetry is mainly broken by <b>hidden</b> matter <b>condensation</b> in the matter direction rather than by <b>hidden</b> gaugino <b>condensation</b> in the modulus direction.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} idea that the model-independent (MI) axion of string theory is the source of quintessential dark energy. The {{scenario}} is completed with a composite QCD axion from <b>hidden</b> sector squark <b>condensation</b> that could serve as dark matter candidate. The mechanism relies {{on the fact that the}} hidden sector anomaly contribution to the composite axion is much smaller than the QCD anomaly term. This intuitively surprising scenario is based on the fact that below the hidden sector scale Λ_h there are many light hidden sector quarks. Simply, by counting engineering dimensions the hidden sector instanton potential can be made negligible compared to the QCD anomaly term. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} soft {{supersymmetry}} breaking parameters {{induced by the}} Scherk-Schwarz (SS) boundary condition in 5 -dimensional orbifold field theory in which the quark and lepton zero modes are quasi-localized at the orbifold fixed points to generate the hierarchical Yukawa couplings. In such theories, the radion corresponds to a flavon to generate the flavor hierarchy {{and at the same}} time plays the role of the messenger of supersymmetry breaking. As a consequence, the resulting soft scalar masses and trilinear $A$-parameters of matter zero modes at the compactification scale are highly flavor-dependent, thereby can lead to dangerous flavor violations at low energy scales. We analyze in detail the low energy flavor violations in SS-dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario under the assumption that the compactification scale is close to the grand unification scale and the 4 -dimensional effective theory below the compactification scale is given by the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Our analysis can be applied to any supersymmetry breaking mechanism giving a sizable $F$-component of the radion superfield, e. g. the <b>hidden</b> gaugino <b>condensation</b> model.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dark matter}} prospects of supersymmetric models with nonuniversal gaugino masses. We find that for very particular values of the ratio of soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses, M 2 /M 1, an enhanced coannihilation efficiency between the lightest chargino and the lightest neutralino occurs, allowing for scalars with masses well above the normally accepted limits for viable dark matter in the universal case. As a specific example, we investigate models of <b>hidden</b> sector gaugino <b>condensation.</b> These models exhibit high scalar masses, previously thought dangerous, and the requisite freedom in the ratio of gaugino masses. The cosmologically viable regions of parameter space are investigated, allowing very specific statements to be made {{about the content of}} the supersymmetry-breaking hidden sector.

40|$|We {{propose that}} when gaugino {{condensation}} occurs, some Wilson lines may be induced which can generate an extra {{term in the}} superpotential. This extra term can balance the dilaton-dependent superpotential generated in <b>hidden</b> sector gaugino <b>condensation</b> and lead to a phenomelogically viable local supersymmetry breaking scheme. In this scheme, both local supersymmetry and gauge symmetry are broken but the global supersymmetry is only softly broken at loop-level for some string models. The cosmological constant is naturally zero at the gaugino condensation scale. We show that this scheme makes the affine level one SU(5) string models with intermediate gauge symmetry breaking scale 10 ^{ 16 }GeV possible. One can dynamically determine gaugino condensation scale, local supersymmetry breaking scale and the intermediate gauge symmetry breaking scale M_{GUT} {{in terms of the}} dilaton VEV...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new mechanism, the S-Track, to {{stabilize}} the volume modulus S in heterotic M-theory flux compactifications along with the orbifold-size T besides complex structure and vector bundle moduli stabilization. The key dynamical ingredient which makes the volume modulus stabilization possible, is M 5 -instantons arising from M 5 -branes wrapping the whole Calabi-Yau slice. These are natural in heterotic M-theory where the warping shrinks the Calabi-Yau volume along S 1 /Z 2. Combined with H-flux, open M 2 -instantons and <b>hidden</b> sector gaugino <b>condensation</b> it leads to a superpotential W which stabilizes S similar like a racetrack but {{without the need for}} multi gaugino condensation. Moreover, W contains two competing non-perturbative effects which stabilize T. We analyze the potential and superpotentials to show that it leads to heterotic de Sitter vacua with broken supersymmetry through non-vanishing F-terms. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} a {{modified}} version of string-inspired supersymmetry breaking schemes in [1] and [2] may make affine level one SU(5) and SO(10) string models with intermediate gauge symmetry breaking scale MGUT = 10 16 GeV possible; doublet-triplet problem can also be solved. In particular, we propose that some charged gauge background VEVs might be turned on when gaugino condensation happens in the hidden sector and would break gauge symmetry. One can dynamically determine gaugino condensation scale, local supersymmetry breaking scale and intermediate gauge symmetry breaking scale MGUT in terms of dilaton VEV. With dilaton VEV, 〈S 〉 ∼ 2, and E 6 <b>hidden</b> sector gaugino <b>condensation,</b> we can obtain MGUT = 10 16 GeV.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} Missing Doublet Model (MDM) {{as a means}} to address the {{apparent}} difficulties of the minimal SU(5) supergravity model in dealing with the doublet-triplet splitting problem, the prediction of α 3 (MZ), and the proton lifetime. We revamp the original MDM by extending its observable sector to include fields and interactions that naturally suppress the dimension-five proton decay operators and that allow see-saw neutrino masses. We also endow the model with a hidden sector which (via gaugino condensation) triggers supersymmetry breaking of the desired magnitude, and (via <b>hidden</b> matter <b>condensation)</b> yields a new dynamical intermediate scale for the right-handed neutrino masses (∼ 10 10 GeV), and provides an effective Higgs mixing parameter µ. The model is consistent with gauge coupling unification for experimentally acceptable values of α 3 (MZ), and with proton decay limits even for large values of tan β. The right-handed neutrinos can be produced subsequent to inflation, and their out-of-equilibrium decays induce a lepton asymmetry which is later reprocessed (via sphaleron interactions) into a baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale. The resulting see-saw neutrino masses provide a candidate for the hot dark matter component of the Universe (mντ ∼ O(10 eV)) and are consistent with the MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem. We finally compare the features of this traditional GUT model with that of the readily string-derivable SU(5) × U(1) model, and discuss the prospects of deriving the revamped MDM from string theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the computation of the full component Lagrangian of supergravity coupled to chiral multiplets and a linear multiplet in the U(1) _K formulation is presented here.

We include an anomalous U(1) factor in the gauge group, and an effective theory of gaugino and <b>hidden</b> sector matter <b>condensation</b> through static composite superfields, using the formalism of Binetruy, Gaillard and Wu. Our assumption {{for the form of}} the Kahler potential is general enough to accomodate stabilization of the dilaton at weak coupling through nonperturbative corrections to the dilaton Kahler potential. Finally, in our effective theory of gaugino condensation we provide for general couplings between the hidden sector matter condensates and other unconfined fields present in the theory. It is important to allow for this possibility since such couplings may be useful for the stabilization of matter fields which are moduli at the leading order...|$|R
40|$|The weakly-coupled heterotic string {{is known}} to have {{problems}} of dilaton/moduli stabilization, supersymmetry breaking (by hidden-sector gaugiNO 1 condensation), gauge coupling unification (or the Newton's constant), QCD axion, as well as cosmological problems. We study these problems by adopting the viewpoint that they arise mostly due to our limited calculational power, little knowledge of the vacuum structure, and an inappropriate treatment of gaugiNO 1 condensation. It turns out that these problems can be solved or are much less severe after a more consistent and complete treatment. There are two kinds of non-perturbative effects in the construction of effective field theory: the field-theoretical non-perturbative effects of gaugiNO 1 condensation (with a constraint ignored in the past) and the stringy non-perturbative effects conjectured by Shenker, which are best described using the linear multiplet formalism. Stringy non-perturbative corrections to the Kähler potential are invoked to stabilize the dilaton at a value compatible with a weak coupling regime. Modular invariance is ensured through the Green-Schwarz counterterm and string threshold corrections which, together with <b>hidden</b> matter <b>condensation,</b> lead to moduli stabilization at the self-dual point where the vev's of moduli's F-components vanish. In the vacuum, supersymmetry is broken at a realistic scale with vanishing cosmological constant. As for soft supersymmetry breaking, our model always leads to a dilaton-dominated scenario.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{kinematics}} of {{the central}} region of M 83 (NGC 5236) were obtained through three-dimensional NIR spectroscopy with Gemini South telescope. The spatial region covered by the integral field unit (~ 5 " x 13 " or ~ 90 x 240 pc), was centered approximately {{at the center of}} the bulge isophotes and oriented SE-NW. The Pa_beta emission at half arcsecond resolution clearly reveals spider-like diagrams around three centers, indicating the presence of extended masses, which we describe in terms of Satoh distributions. One of the mass concentrations is identified as the optical nucleus (ON), another as the center of the bulge isophotes, similar to the CO kinematical center (KC), and the third as a <b>condensation</b> <b>hidden</b> at optical wavelengths (HN), coincident with the largest lobe in 10 micron emission. We run numerical simulations that take into account ON, KC and HN and four more clusters, representing the star forming arc at the SW of the optical nucleus. We show that ON, KC and HN suffer strong evaporation and merge in 10 - 50 Myr. The star-forming arc is scattered in less than one orbital period, also falling into the center. Simulations also show that tidal-striping boosts the external shell of the condensations to their escape velocity. This fact might lead to an overestimation of the mass of the condensations in kinematical observations with spatial resolution smaller than the condensations' apparent sizes. Additionally the existence of two ILR resonances embracing the chain of HII regions, claimed by different authors, might not exist due to the similarity of the masses of the different components and the fast dynamical evolution of M 83 central 300 pc...|$|R
