5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers {{of what was to}} lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
2500|$|Although White and Stieglitz {{had tried}} to {{reconcile}} their differences before White died, Stieglitz never forgave White for breaking from him in 1912. Upon hearing about White's untimely death, Stieglitz wrote to Kuehn, [...] "Poor White. Cares and vexation. When I last saw him {{he told me he}} was not able to cope with [...] twenty years ago. <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> that I warned him to stay in business in Ohio ‒ New York would be too much for him. But the Photo-Session beckoned. Vanity and ambitions. His photography went to the devil." [...] In spite of these words, Stieglitz had 49 of White's photographs, including 18 created jointly with Stieglitz, in his personal collection when he died.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him,</b> at {{the hopeful}} change {{he had made}} in Bleak House.|$|E
6000|$|Quite as womanly again, {{and quite}} as {{different}} once more, is the lyric which {{the reader will}} better appreciate when <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> how the Austrians massacred the unarmed people in Milan, in January, 1848, and how, later, during the Five Days, they murdered their Italian prisoners, sparing neither sex nor age.[1] ...|$|R
6000|$|WAITER. Yes, sir. The young lady, {{in giving}} an order, {{or the like}} of that, will say, [...] "Remember, William, we came to this hotel on your account, having heard what a perfect waiter you are." [...] The young gentleman will tell me that <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> {{strongly}} of his father (the gentleman starts at this) and that he expects me to act by him as such. (Soothing, sunny cadence.) Oh, very peasant, sir, very affable and pleasant indeed! ...|$|R
60|$|Hunt gave no heed {{to me when}} <b>I</b> thus <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> that he {{was willing}} to sell his opinions; but {{abruptly}} demanded why I was in York, and where I counted on going.|$|R
60|$|Out of the fount of my womanly wisdom <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> {{how young}} she was, how clever, {{and how much}} flattered.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> {{that she}} might have met with a dull number of the newspaper. He took no notice of this unanswerable reply.|$|E
60|$|After Uncle Abimelech had gone, {{still in}} a towering rage, Murray remonstrated. But <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of his promise {{and he had to}} succumb.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{ventured to}} <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> {{that he might}} speak to Helena {{as well as to}} myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} if he'll wish to see me. I think <b>I</b> may <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of a time he prefers to forget. But I'll come all the same. Is there any chance of seeing any of his pictures?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Dorrit will pardon me,' said Mrs General, 'if I {{remark that}} this is not a time or place for the pursuit of the present conversation. Mr Dorrit will excuse me if <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that Miss Dorrit is in the {{adjoining}} room, and is visible to myself while I utter her name. Mr Dorrit will forgive me if I observe that I am agitated, and that I find there are moments when weaknesses I supposed myself to have subdued, return with redoubled power. Mr Dorrit will allow me to withdraw.' ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of {{the second}} and last point {{to which he had}} adverted.|$|E
6000|$|... "We were comrades before Juarez. One day I {{dragged him}} out of a ditch. <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him.</b> Then I--I told him {{something}} I--I thought--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But this is {{a holiday}} trip," [...] <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Surely I may be {{permitted}} to advise you about the picturesque spots in my own country!" ...|$|E
60|$|Ten minutes {{afterwards}} he {{was eating}} large slices of bread and butter, with every sign of satisfaction; Job wanted to put jam on to them, but <b>I</b> sternly <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of the excellent works that we had read, and forbade it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{afternoon}} I idled {{about the}} streets, {{looking for her}} in vain. When I next {{saw one of the}} boys who had been with me at her first passing <b>I</b> stealthily <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of the incident, and asked if he knew the riders.|$|R
6000|$|The night-watchman {{shook his}} head. [...] "I never met {{any of these}} phil-- philantherpists, as you call 'em," [...] he said, decidedly. [...] "If I 'ad they wouldn't 'ave got away from me in a hurry, I can tell you. I don't say I don't believe in 'em; I only say I never met any of 'em. If people do you a {{kindness}} it's generally {{because they want to}} get something out of you; same as a man once--a perfick stranger--wot stood me eight 'arf-pints becos <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>'im</b> of his dead brother, and then borrered five bob off of me.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been the other one, Martin," [...] I said, [...] "that she loathed. That almost exultation at the thought that he was dead," [...] <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "A great man, Louis, once declared," [...] <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "that one's enemies {{were the}} salt of one's life. One's friends {{sometimes}} weary. One's enemies give always a zest to existence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] {{the other}} acknowledged, [...] "that Mr. Bookam {{was not very}} discreet. <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of your advice--that the money should be passed through Sullivan--but he didn't seem to think it worth while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doubts it," [...] he {{was telling}} the audience. [...] "But then this M. Leandre is himself akin to those who worship the {{worm-eaten}} idol of Privilege, and so he is a little afraid to believe a truth that is becoming apparent to all the world. Shall I convince him? Shall I tell him how a company of noblemen backed by their servants under arms--six hundred men in all--sought to dictate to the Third Estate of Rennes a few short weeks ago? Must <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of the martial front shown on that occasion by the Third Estate, and how they swept the streets clean of that rabble of nobles--cette canaille noble..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ever gracious, dear lady. Well, to continue, then. Here I find a young Englishman {{of exactly}} {{the order and}} {{position}} likely to be useful to us. I approach him frankly. He has been humiliated by the country {{he was willing to}} serve. I talk to him of that country. 'You are English, of course,' <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him,</b> 'but what manner of an England is it to-day which claims you?' It is a very telling argument, this. Upon the classes of this country, democracy has laid a throttling hand. There is a spirit of discontent, they say, among the working-classes, the discontent which breeds socialism. There is a worse spirit of discontent among the upper classes here, and it is the discontent which breeds so-called traitors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (10) When {{my purse}} is empty, and when, noticing that Froggy has got his {{gorgeous}} waistcoat on, <b>I</b> venture to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of that £10 he owes me, things {{are apt to}} get rather warm; ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> {{that there}} was {{concentrated}} lemonade in the hamper, and a gallon-jar {{of water in the}} nose of the boat, and that the two only wanted mixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage.|$|E
6000|$|... "There really isn't {{anything}} at all," [...] she replied. [...] "I just mentioned his condition, and as Mr. Crawshay still seemed curious, <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> {{that it was}} not etiquette to question a nurse about her patients." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'He'll be {{no good to}} you {{till the}} twentieth,' <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him.</b> 'And,' I added, as I stood up to ring the bell, 'you're sure it's a genuine case this time. You won't {{be going back to}} 'Liza?' ...|$|E
60|$|In case any gentleman of {{the press}} should feel injured by these statements, <b>I</b> must <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> am not {{responsible}} for them. They are the sentiments of the Scottish Bawbee, which must be taken {{for what they are}} worth. It is true, I heartily agree with them, but that is an entirely different subject, on which I do not enter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very pretty! He lost several {{children}} in India and <b>I</b> suppose Rosy <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> of them. Ah, poor man! I can sympathize with him, for I too have loved and lost," [...] sighed Miss Henny, pensively surveying the {{group on the}} rustic seat.|$|R
50|$|In August 1809, Arsen sent {{a lengthy}} letter to Alexander <b>I,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> {{of his past}} {{services}} and complaining about the pressure he experienced from Catholicos Anton. In response, in February 1810, Anton convened a church court, which ruled that Arsen should be removed from his office and sent to a remote convent on charges of misconduct, abuse of office, and corruption, which the bishop vehemently denied and filed a complaint to the Russian governor of Georgia, General Alexander Tormasov. In the meantime, the Russian government proceeded with the outright abolition of the Georgian autocephaly. Catholicos Anton was escorted to Russia in November 1810 and deposed by the Imperial decree in July 1811. Arsen quickly ran afoul of the new Russian-appointed prelate, Exarch Varlam. The defiant bishop was relieved from his position. An inquiry into allegations of his corruption was launched, but then dropped because of Arsen's death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply this. I {{sometimes}} {{play a game}} of whist, {{and therefore}} he called me a gambler. Then <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> that he also sometimes played a game of whist, and I asked him what deduction was to be drawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seem to have}} forgotten," [...] <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "that {{the child}} will have every {{advantage}} that education can offer to her, and will be accustomed from her earliest years to restraining and purifying influences, in a clergyman's household." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} now," [...] Harcutt whispered, [...] "what Wolfenden meant this afternoon. When <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> about to-night, {{he laughed}} and said: 'Well, I shall see you, at any rate.' I thought it was odd at the time. I wonder how he managed it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will do something. I'm {{not going}} to be cheated and swindled and have my life thrown away into the bargain. I have always behaved well to him. I have never run up bills without saying {{anything}} about them.' This was a cut at her elder sister, who had once got into some little trouble of that kind. 'I have never got myself talked about with anybody. If there is anything to be done I always do it. I have written his letters for him till I have been sick, and when you were ill I never asked him to stay out with us after two or half-past two at the latest. And now he tells me that I am to eat my meals up in my bedroom because <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that he distinctly promised to take us back to London! Did he not promise, mamma?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! your papa was {{different}} from mine, Venetia,' said Cadurcis; 'my mother talks of him often enough. They did not agree very well; and, when we quarrel, she always says <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> her of <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> dare say Lady Annabel loved your papa very much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|RICARDOS. [With a shrug] Captain Dancy {{was a man}} of honour. He said: [...] "Of course I will do this." [...] I trusted him. And a {{month later}} <b>I</b> did <b>remind</b> <b>him,</b> and he gave me this money for her. I do not know where he got it--I do not know. Gentlemen, I have {{invested}} it all on her--every penny-except this note, for which I had the purpose to buy her a necklace. That is the sweared truth.|$|R
