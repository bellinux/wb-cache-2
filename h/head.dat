5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean <b>head,</b> archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean <b>head</b> as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's <b>head</b> between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the <b>head</b> genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the <b>head</b> to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson <b>head</b> was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the <b>head</b> to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the <b>head</b> rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the <b>head</b> since 1815. The box was placed into an airtight container and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E

5|$|Cox {{sold the}} <b>head</b> in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the <b>head</b> {{as part of}} other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox {{to ask about the}} gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could not come up with a documentary history of how the <b>head</b> came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's <b>head</b> was “the only instance of a <b>head</b> cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which is precisely the case with respect to the <b>head</b> in question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the <b>head</b> was a fake were prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Early in October 1835, Yagan's <b>head</b> and the {{panoramic}} view {{were returned to}} Dale, then living in Liverpool.
