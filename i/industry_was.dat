5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar <b>industry</b> <b>was</b> in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar <b>industry</b> <b>was</b> still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E

5|$|The {{effective}} capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages {{per person per}} day in 1986, and six entire newspapers {{per person per day}} by 2007.

30|$|Data in {{this thesis}} also include the sales, profit, and {{incremental}} of enterprises. We use {{the average number of}} employees in an enterprise to calculate the average operation index and compare the operational performance between monopoly industries and competition industries. From Table  2 we can see that there are great differentials in operation situations among enterprises in monopoly industries. Although the proportion of enterprises ﻿with﻿ loss﻿ in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> quite high, the proportions of average profit and average incremental are higher than the corresponding index in competition industry. The profit per capita in monopoly <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> 7.8 thousand yuan, while the median of the average profit in enterprises of competition <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 3.5 thousand yuan; the median of the average sales in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 336.1 thousand yuan, while the median for the average sales in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 326 thousand yuan. The average incremental is also a measurement on enterprises’ operation situation. The median of the average incremental in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 53.4 thousand yuan, while the median of average incremental in competition <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 36.6 thousand yuan. As the incremental of financial <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> not calculated and there is lack of data about enterprises’ incremental, the number observed on average incremental is less than other indexes of enterprises.|$|R

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck <b>industry</b> <b>was</b> bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
