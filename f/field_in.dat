40|$|Light-cone gauge {{formulation}} of <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> AdS space and conformal <b>field</b> theory <b>in</b> flat space adapted {{for the study}} of AdS/CFT correspondence is developed. Arbitrary spin mixed-symmetry <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> AdS space and arbitrary spin mixed-symmetry currents, shadows, and conformal <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> flat space are considered on an equal footing. For the massless and massive <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> AdS and the conformal <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> flat space, simple light-cone gauge actions leading to decoupled equations of motion are found. For the currents and shadows, simple expressions for all 2 -point functions are also found. We demonstrate that representation of conformal algebra generators on space of currents, shadows, and conformal fields can be built in terms of spin operators entering the light-cone gauge {{formulation of}} AdS fields. This considerably simplifies the study of AdS/CFT correspondence. Light-cone gauge actions for totally symmetric arbitrary spin long conformal <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> flat space are presented. We apply our approach to the study of totally antisymmetric (one-column) and mixed-symmetry (two-column) <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> AdS space and currents, shadows, and conformal <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> flat space.

5|$|Even though {{geothermal}} {{power is}} globally sustainable, extraction {{must still be}} monitored to avoid local depletion. Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello <b>field</b> <b>in</b> Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei <b>field</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand since 1958, and at The Geysers <b>field</b> <b>in</b> California since 1960.|$|E

40|$|The SKA and its {{precursors}} {{will open}} {{a new era in}} the observation of cosmic magnetic fields and help to understand their origin. In the SKADS polarization simulation project, maps of polarized intensity and RM of the Milky Way, galaxies and halos of galaxy clusters were constructed, and the possibilities to measure the evolution of magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> these objects were investigated. The SKA will map interstellar magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> nearby galaxies and intracluster <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> nearby clusters in unprecedented detail. All-sky surveys of Faraday rotation measures (RM) towards a dense grid of polarized background sources with the SKA and ASKAP (POSSUM) are dedicated to measure magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> distant intervening galaxies, cluster halos and intergalactic filaments, and will be used to model the overall structure and strength of the magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> the Milky Way and beyond. Simple patterns of regular <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> galaxies or cluster relics can be recognized to about 100 Mpc distance, ordered <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> unresolved galaxies or cluster relics to redshifts of z ≃ 0. 5, turbulent <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> starburst galaxies or cluster halos to z ≃ 3, and regular <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> intervening galaxies towards QSOs to z ≃ 5.
