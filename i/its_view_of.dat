5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale, and he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} Ethiopian biographical {{tradition}} became far more complex, intertextual, and broader in <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the world given Ethiopia's direct {{involvement in the}} conflicts between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires in the Red Sea region. The annals of Dawit II (r. 1508–1540) describe the defensive war he waged against the Adal sultan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (r. 1527–1543), in an episodic format {{quite different from the}} earlier chronicling tradition. The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church abbot Enbaqom (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous Ethiopian work of history. It explains the Ethiopian emperor's military alliance with Cristóvão da Gama (1516–1542), son of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the Ottoman governor of Yemen, Özdemir Pasha (d. 1560).|$|E

5|$|In British Guiana, {{the leftist}} People's Progressive Party (PPP) {{candidate}} Cheddi Jagan won {{the position of}} chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution. Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961; despite Britain's shift to a reconsideration of <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time, the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office.|$|E

25|$|Naturally, in an {{organisation}} {{of critical}} thinkers that has endured for a century, {{the existence of}} some disagreement is inevitable. Indeed, it would be true {{to say that a}} fair number of internal debates and disagreements have arisen in the Socialist Party concerning issues not covered by the Declaration of Principles and not addressed in the initial membership test – in other words, issues which are somewhat peripheral or incidental rather than core and fundamental. These issues have included the Party's exact attitude to trade unionism, <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> capitalist economic crises, and – in more recent years – whether something akin to law will exist in socialist society.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue has}} been a subject of {{contention}} within modern Jewish denominations, and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has understood homosexual male intercourse as contrary to Judaism, and this opinion is still maintained by Orthodox Judaism. On the other hand, Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism do not hold this view and allow homosexual intercourse and same-sex marriage. Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which until December 2006 held {{the same position as}} Orthodoxy, recently issued multiple opinions under its philosophy of pluralism, with one opinion continuing to follow the Orthodox position and another opinion substantially liberalizing <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> homosexual sex and relationships while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited.|$|E

In 1851, the U.S. Congress established the Customs District of Puget Sound for Washington Territory and Olympia became {{the home of the}} customs house. Its population steadily expanded from Oregon Trail immigrants. In 1850, the town settled on the name Olympia, at the suggestion of local resident Colonel Isaac N. Ebey, due to <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Olympic Mountains to the Northwest. The area began to be served by a small fleet of steamboats known as the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet.|$|E
25|$|Mark was {{traditionally}} placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as a somewhat inferior abridgement {{of what was}} regarded {{as the most important}} gospel, Matthew. The Church has consequently derived <b>its</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark. It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and Luke. The hypothesis of Markan priority (that Mark was written first) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering Son of God.|$|E
