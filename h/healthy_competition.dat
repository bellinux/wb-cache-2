Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards.

Industrial art had never before been so controversial. The exhibition was reviewed in all the major journals. Louis Vauxcelles added to the crisis in a Gil Blas article.|$|E

All the pretty girls are in the latter class. Something must have happened at Colombo--two steamers must have clashed. We have the results of the collision, and we are a menagerie.

Personally, I consider that half our shipmates ought to be thrown overboard. They are only travelling round the world for pleasure, and that sort of dissipation leads to the forming of hasty and intemperate opinions. Anyhow, give me freedom and the cockroaches of the British India, where we dined on deck, altered the hours of the meals by plebiscite, and were lords of all we saw.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} independent exchange rate policy, relative to other determinants, on global export performance of WAMZ countries. The regression results show that exports originating from the Zone {{to the rest of}} the world are influenced positively by domestic output, export prices and exchange rate devaluations, but negatively by import price and economic performance of the major global trading partner, proxied by the US GDP. This result is not universal as the Gambia, Ghana and Guinea total exports functions show that exchange rate policy penalized exports contrary to the Nigerian case in which the coefficient estimate is significant and positive. The study infers that these results are consistent with theoretical expectation given the ironical divergence in export basket. Although they are all primary commodity exporters, Nigeria’s exports is mainly crude oil, and a priori expectation is that rapid economic growth or booms in the US should lead to increased demand for energy (<b>healthy</b> <b>competitions).</b> In conclusion, the study infers that since independent flexible exchange rate policy makes no difference to the Zonal export performance ex ante, but have great potential for global exports collectively, they could explore an OCA to enhance both intra- and global inter-regional export trade. ...|$|R
