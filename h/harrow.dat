In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
50|$|Cyborgs: Before the Last War, {{scientists}} {{could not get}} human Cyborgs to work well due to an inability to perfectly mimic all of the vital organs that people have. Instead, they turned their efforts to making Cyborgs from <b>Harrowed.</b> In addition to cybernetic enhancements and the general abilities that all <b>Harrowed</b> have, some (usually those who were <b>Harrowed</b> before the Cyborg conversion) have access to <b>Harrowed</b> powers. Cyborgs (as well as <b>Harrowed)</b> are detailed in the Cyborgs sourcebook.|$|R

5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and <b>Harrow</b> were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to <b>Harrow</b> the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
