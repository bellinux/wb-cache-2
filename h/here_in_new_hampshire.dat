In response, at the debate the following day, Huntsman responded: [...] "I was criticized last night by Governor Romney for putting my country first, I just want to remind the people <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> and throughout the United States that he criticized me while he was out raising money for serving my country in China, yes under a Democrat, like my two sons {{who are in the}} United States Navy. They’re not asking what the affiliation of the President is. I want to be clear... I will always put my country first. I think that’s important".|$|E

He’s always been there as a fighter in the Senate, but that he will continue to be there for us. But most importantly, his message was, we have to be there, we have to build a movement, we have to fight." [...] In July, in an effort to win Sanders's endorsement and his supporters' approval, Clinton endorsed several new policies he had advocated for, including plans to eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities and to increase spending for community health centers. [...] On July 12, Sanders endorsed Clinton, saying in a prepared statement:I am proud of the campaign we ran <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> and across the country. Our campaign won the primaries and caucuses in 22 states, and when the roll call at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia is announced it will show that we won almost 1,900 delegates. That is a lot of delegates, far more than almost anyone thought we could win. But {{it is not enough to}} win the nomination. Secretary Clinton goes into the convention with 389 more pledged delegates than we have and a lot more super delegates. Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I congratulate her for that. She will be the Democratic nominee for president and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States.|$|E

I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuously, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.|$|R
