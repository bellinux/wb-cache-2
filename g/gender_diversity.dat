40|$|<b>Gender</b> {{and human}} <b>diversity</b> are {{critical}} aspects of {{sustainable forest management}} and human well-being. This chapter draws on experiences of a criteria and indicators (human well-being assessment) methods test in Kalimantan, Indonesia, to explore these concepts, and <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> analysis in relation to sustainability in forestry, specifically {{in terms of the}} role of such analysis in human well-being assessments for research and management. Some of the key theoretical underpinnings of <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> analysis are highlighted, including the potential tensions between the two elements. These tensions, however, are resolvable if gender is approached conceptually as existing at both the macro and micro levels; in the former creating “space” for diversity and in the latter as one of many forms of diversity. The need to emphasise relations in <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> analysis, instead of just roles, is also critical. Taking a <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> approach in the assessment of human well-being in Kalimantan required creativity and flexibility in design and implementation. The chapter addresses these through three lenses: “assessor” awareness, or “grounding oneself”; the assessment tool (in this case the CIFOR C&I Generic Template); and challenges and strategies for accessing local people’s participation. The human well-being assessment test experience in Kalimantan, and other experiences in forestry and natural resource management, indicate that <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> approaches increase the accuracy of assessments, and thus the ultimate effectiveness of research and forestry initiatives. The fundamental connection of <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> analysis to issues of equity, and the links to participation and empowerment also reveal the potential potency of such analysis in promoting social change...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is divided in two parts. The primary purpose is to gain a better {{understanding}} on how one of the leading management consulting companies in the world, McKinsey & Company, approaches issues regarding gender and diversity; how McKinsey justifies the importance of <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> matters and how they are taken into account in the company's business. On the other hand, the secondary {{purpose of this}} study is to analyze how the concept of war for talent relates to gender matters at McKinsey; what the role of war for talent is in McKinsey's gender approach. The literature review discusses earlier research in four fundamentals areas of this study: the war for talent, diversity and <b>diversity</b> management, <b>gender</b> and management consulting. The first part of the literature review focuses on war for talent, defining it, describing the forces driving it and then showing how the companies can respond to it. The second part of the literature review is about diversity and diversity management, defining diversity, showing its importance for companies and introducing two approaches to diversity; the business case approach and the moral case approach. The third chapter first defines gender and proceeds to justify the importance of gender matters. Then it moves on to show how gender discrimination is fought in organizations. The last and fourth part of the literature review is about management consulting. Management consulting is defined and overviews on its history and current state are provided. In addition, professional service firms and their distinctive characteristics are described. The empirical research of this study is conducted as a theoretical thematic analysis. The research is based on public materials of McKinsey & Company, which focus on <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> matters. The data includes reports, blog texts, contents of the website and other publications, and it is gathered from McKinsey's official website. First, the data is analyzed using thematic analysis as a research method. Based on this, I describe how McKinsey justifies the importance of <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> matters and show how McKinsey takes <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> matters into account in its business. I then show how war for talent relates to <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> issues in the research data. At the end, I compare my findings with literature, which is reviewed in chapter 2, in order to show how McKinsey's approach to <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> aligns with the literature. The study implies that McKinsey & Company is well aware of different types of matters regarding <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity,</b> and that McKinsey supports <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> throughout its organization in various different ways. The moral case approach on diversity is recognized, but it is not in a big role in the data. Instead, the business case approach is constantly present in the data and in most cases the importance of <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> in organizations is justified by different business benefits, which <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> can bring into organizations. The war for talent is one of the three themes emerging from the data, and it is strongly linked to McKinsey's approach on <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> issues...|$|R

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that gender does impact a programmer’s perceived merit in the community. A 2016 study identified the gender of over one million programmers on GitHub, by linking the programmer’s GitHub account to their other social media accounts. Between male and female programmers, {{the researchers found that}} female programmers were actually more likely to have their pull requests accepted into the project than male programmers, however only when the female had a gender-neutral profile. When females had profiles with a name or image that identified them as female, they were less likely than male programmers to have their pull requests accepted. Another study in 2015 found that of open source projects on GitHub, <b>gender</b> <b>diversity</b> was a significant positive predictor of a team's productivity, meaning that open source teams with a more even mix of different genders tended to be more highly productive.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} {{and interviews with}} members of open source projects have described a male-dominated culture within open source communities that can be unwelcoming or hostile towards females. There are an initiatives such as Outreachy that aim to support more women and other underrepresented gender identities to participate in open source software. However, within the discussion forums of open source projects the topic of <b>gender</b> <b>diversity</b> can be highly controversial and even inflammatory. A central vision in open source software is that because the software is built and maintained on the merit of individual code contributions, open source communities should act as a meritocracy. In a meritocracy, the importance of an individual in the community depends {{on the quality of}} their individual contributions and not demographic factors such as age, race, religion, or gender. Thus proposing changes to the community based on gender, for example, to make the community more inviting towards females, go against the ideal of a meritocracy by targeting certain programmers by gender and no based on their skill alone.|$|E

I examined findings by program (masters and doctoral) and type of training (those that taught specific gender and culture courses and those that attempted to infuse gender and culture throughout the curriculum). The sample population consisted of syllabi from 21 masters and 18 doctoral training programs (ten each that taught specific courses in <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> and eleven masters and eight doctoral courses that stated that they infuse <b>gender</b> and <b>diversity</b> throughout the curriculum). That {{is that there was}} variation in the topic areas that were explored when the specific courses content and infused course content were compared.
