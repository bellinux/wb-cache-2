5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{you want to watch}} as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's darkness, Nolan {{wanted to}} make the film appeal to a wide age range. [...] "Not the {{youngest}} kids obviously, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I {{would have loved to have}} seen a movie like this." [...] Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.|$|E

[...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair {{itself and}} its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: [...] "...obviously the title refers to the World Expo {{and the spirit of}} that was looking at the future with a sense of {{optimism}} and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today." ...|$|E

Because, indeed, {{there was a lot more}} going on." [...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E

500|$|Holloway is an {{archaeologist}} and Shaw's love interest. Marshall-Green was cast {{after he was}} seen performing on stage [...] "off-off-off Broadway". He described Holloway as the [...] "X Games-type scientist", {{and said that he}} liked the character's [...] "leap-before-looking" [...] philosophy. He also said that Holloway [...] "doesn't want to meet his maker. He wants to stand next to his maker. He's willing to go to the edge to get that." [...] Describing the character's motivation, he said: [...] "he goes to the extreme in everything he does, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse of the [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> drives him is the thrill of the search." [...] Marshall-Green contrasted Holloway with Shaw, and said: [...] "she's the believer. I'm the scientist. I'm the skeptic. I'm the atheist".|$|E
500|$|The {{final scene}} of the episode ended with a tape of a young Olivia in a fire-damaged room, leading to rumors her {{character}} was a fire starter. Torv however discounted this soon after, explaining [...] "I think it's more than that... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they got given or what they got taught is much bigger than just starting fire". Jeff Pinkner agreed and elaborated further, [...] "We saw the consequence. We saw that she started a fire {{at the end of}} the last episode, but I think it's a mistake to assume that that's her power. I think the truth is, it's probably a consequence of her ability". This particular scene, as well as the episode's reference to experiments Walter performed on children, comprise the main plot of the season three episode [...] "Subject 13".|$|E
500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} Arianna Huffington wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba.

[...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E

The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ...

[...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E

This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful."

500|$|Many US {{newspaper}} {{critics were}} less {{taken with the}} film. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "a clunk-headed action picture" [...] that [...] "simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations." [...] Frank Lovece of Newsday {{described it as a}} [...] "soullessly gritty" [...] film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is [...] "all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism". Kyle Smith of the New York Post, who found the police tactics distasteful, wrote, [...] "Justice is supposed to be blind, but in this case <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> the Law really wants is unaccountability" [...] and called Dredd a [...] " [...] thudding, repetitive movie". He also wrote, [...] "It’s not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyper-violence adds up to nothing". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called it a [...] "gray and ugly film", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E
