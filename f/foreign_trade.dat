It is also higher for companies that cross-list on markets with lower trading costs and better insider <b>trading</b> protection. <b>Foreign</b> <b>trading</b> is high close to the cross-listing date but decreases dramatically in the subsequent six months.

During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Trade.</b> By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of minister of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade.</b> In October 1952 at the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policy, and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> on short term {{volatility}} and on the correlation of local with world returns. I find that trading in general is associated with higher volatility, whether it is trading by foreigners or domestic investors. However, controlling for total <b>trading</b> volume, <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> has no impact on volatility in developed countries, and only a marginally significant impact in developing countries. Thus, in developed markets, foreigners generate as much volatility as domestic The share of <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> activity in total stock market volume increased tremendously during the last decade.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset from the Taiwan Futures Exchange, this paper investigates whether <b>trading</b> {{imbalances}} by <b>foreign</b> investors affect emerging Taiwan futures market {{in terms of}} returns and volatility. First, this evidence demonstrates a positive relation between contemporaneous futures returns and net purchases by foreign investors when other market factor effects are controlled. Second, this failure to detect price reversals is inconsistent with the price pressure hypothesis. Third, foreign investors do not exhibit positive feedback trading patterns. Fourth, a bi-directional Granger-causality relationship exists between futures volatility and <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> flows. As found for other stock or foreign exchange markets, our empirical results demonstrate that <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> flows do have impacts on the return and volatility of developing futures market, suggesting that <b>trading</b> by <b>foreign</b> investors may enhance the information flow of the local futures market. <b>Foreign</b> <b>trading...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Australian coal {{industry}} has frequently {{been described as}} being {{in a state of}} ‘profitless prosperity’ referring to the continued investment in low margin mining activities by foreign companies with motives other than profit. Prior research showed that through the use of government investment concessions, <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> companies created an oversupply of seaborne coal to depress prices at the cost of profitability. This study shows that such ‘quasi-integration’ via concessional funding arrangements is no longer a primary strategy employed by <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> companies or governments and finds no evidence of such companies securing coal at below average prices. This study also finds no clear evidence of <b>foreign</b> <b>trading</b> companies using their implicit information advantage as equity investors to secure coal at favourable prices during contract negotiations.

5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{although}} the Scottish economy was still dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade, {{there was an}} increasing amount of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade.</b> Coins were replacing barter goods, with Scottish coins being struck from the reign of David I. Mints were established at Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Perth, but {{until the end of}} the period most exchange was done without the use of metal currency, and English coins probably outnumbered Scottish ones. Until the disruption caused by the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century, most naval trade was probably coastal and most <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> was with England. The wars closed English markets and raised the levels of piracy and disruption to naval trade on both sides. They may have led to an increase in continental trade, and isolated references indicate that Scottish ships were active in Norway and Danzig, and the earliest records from the 1330s indicate that five-sixths of this trade was in the hands of Scottish merchants.|$|E

5|$|Native Hawaiians {{before the}} arrival of Captain Cook in 1770 used no coins; trade in their {{agricultural}} economy was based on barter. Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> began {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other commercial activity that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and scrip used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community to think in terms of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by <b>foreign</b> <b>trade,</b> circulated as a means of exchange alongside American silver and gold pieces.|$|E
