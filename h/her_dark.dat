The few Family members at hand determine that she {{has teamed up with}} him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E
5|$|Mona Lisa {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying {{a woman of}} virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. <b>Her</b> <b>dark</b> garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; {{they are not a}} depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E

5|$|In November 1987, Kai and Martin {{became known}} as The Glamour Girls, and she {{underwent}} an image change that involved bleaching <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> hair platinum blonde {{at the suggestion of}} their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face the Fabulous Moolah's team. Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women's Tag Team Championship. The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988, with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold. Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women's division.|$|E

25|$|A 21-year-old exorcist, Millenear was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age and placed in the care of her uncle and aunt. They were abusive and one day, Millenear killed them with her spiritual rage. Priest Williams took her in and taught her how to focus her powers to help people. She became one of the best exorcists employed by the Vatican until she disobeyed the head Bishop of the Vatican to save a possessed girl using <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> magic abilities. She lost her standing as a priest and left the service. Though Deshwitat is often critical of her, she continues to him on his quest to defeat Kalutika. She was captured by Mr. Grey during an assassination attempt on Deshwitat and was turned into a vampire.|$|E
25|$|Manon {{had never}} {{let go of}} her desire to act. She had even written the famous Burgtheater actor Raoul Aslan a letter and a poem in which she {{expressed}} her desire to one day perform on the same stage. With <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> long hair and beauty, she so impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends on the long back porch of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916. So, as her stepfather, Werfel refused to allow Manon the opportunity.|$|E
25|$|While Henry sulks at the Bethesda {{fountain}} with Violet, Gold takes Regina to {{find someone}} who he claims still has magic. Emma reminds Henry of their time in New York, telling him that he can still wish away his problems and toss a coin into the fountain; she reflects on the irony of her own words as she had wished to fill the void she felt in their family, which lead to Hook showing up with the memory potion. Elsewhere, Gold leads Regina into a shop, where they meet The Dragon (who survived Tamara's attack on him). Though he refuses to help someone evil as Gold, the Dragon agrees to help Regina, who is fighting <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> side. Emma, Henry, Violet, Gold and Regina watch the Dragon create a small view of where their family is; however, the Dragon fails to open a portal as his magic is not enough. He tells them that despite being called the Land Without Magic, it does exist in the Real World; however, it has become harder to tap into because of neglect.|$|E

25|$|The {{events of}} how Merlin was {{transformed}} is witnessed through a dreamcatcher by Emma as she stands near the tree. At the same time, David and Mary Margaret, {{who are now}} under King Arthur's command, convince Regina {{to hand over the}} dagger to Arthur, unaware that moments after, Regina took the two to the treestump where it was hidden. Emma was waiting for her parents by placing a freezing spell on them. She tells Regina about Arthur using Mary Margaret and David in order to unite Excalibur with the dagger and then kill Merlin, which is why Emma wants a skeptical Regina to work with her to free the sorcerer, even though Regina is not convinced of Emma's claim, believing that Emma's darkness is telling Emma this, which Emma disputes by saying it's true and that dark magic is the answer. Regina asks how Emma knew her parents were under the spell, and she shows Regina the dreamcatcher. Regina tells Emma that the device catches more than dreams because it's dark magic and dangerous, as Emma believes that <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> magic is stronger than she thought.|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} , voiced by Yurika Hino and voiced again by Jennifer Hale in the English distribution. At the {{beginning}} of the series, she is consumed by the Phoenix Force and nearly destroys the world with her tremendous strength and power. The X-Men engage in a brief battle with her, until she ultimately sacrifices herself to save the world. Although she apparently dies, she assists the X-Men with conflicts through a strong telepathic link in later episodes, such as saving Professor X from hallucinations, and appears as the White Phoenix of the Crown, encouraging the X-Men to keep on fighting to save the world. She was in a strong and close romantic relationship with Cyclops, and had a necklace with a ruby stone with gold {{in the shape of a}} phoenix, which was a gift from Cyclops. The necklace was then given to Hisako as a sign that Cyclops can finally let Jean go, as he recognizes her sacrifice as a symbol of love for her friends and the world. <b>Her</b> <b>Dark</b> Phoenix persona is taken from X-Men: The Last Stand where her face is full of dark veins and her eyes become entirely black.|$|E
25|$|Norma is lured from Dr Stillingfleet by {{an ad in}} the {{newspaper}} to meet David, and is again drugged. Frances kills David. She sets it up to appear that Norma did it, but the blood on the knife was congealed when Norma found herself holding it. With police and family gathered in the flat, Poirot announces that Andrew did die in Africa. Robert Orwell poses as her father to gain the wealth of the family. He had David paint portraits of him and his late wife in the style of a painter popular 20 years earlier as part of the ruse. Most cruelly {{he and his wife have}} been giving Norma various drugs that give her hallucinations and an altered sense of time, to set her up as guilty. Further, the wife had poisoned herself hoping to pin that on Norma, too. Louise wrote to Andrew on learning he was back in England, so Frances killed Louise; this is the murder Norma feared she did. The woman posing as stepmother was also Frances, who used a blonde wig to cover <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> hair when changing roles. Poirot takes the wig from her bag to make that point. Murder of the two who could expose the imposters was just one of her crimes. Sonia is exonerated when she finds the papers Sir Roderick misplaced, and the two will marry. Poirot had chosen Dr Stillingfleet to help him with Norma in hopes the two would marry, and they will.|$|E

25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening at}} the ball, {{everyone}} makes their grand entrances and the couples dance. Henry has developed a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet. Leroy is able to convince Belle to stop worrying about Rumpelstiltskin and gets her to join the dance. However, the event is about to end early when Percival reveals that he had witnessed Regina slaughter his entire family as a child. He also reveals that knows {{that she is the}} Evil Queen and not the Savior, a fact he confirmed earlier by observing her through the enchanted necklace, and that he kept all of this from Arthur because he would have prevented him from killing Regina. Percival tries to kill Regina, but Robin steps in and fights him, only to be stabbed in the process before David kills Percival. Regina is desperate to save Robin, but her magic does not work due to an enchantment spell placed on Percival's sword. This prompts Regina to ask Emma to help save Robin by using her magic, but Hook does not want Emma to trigger <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> side. Meanwhile, King Arthur does not blame them for Percival's death, saying that his action was inexcusable, and admits that he suspected Regina's identity, but says that Camelot is a place of second chances. He later confesses to Guinevere that he thinks that there is something suspicious about the new arrivals, but he has to trust them, as they are his only hope of freeing Merlin and finding the missing piece of Excalibur. Emma eventually decides to help Regina despite the risk, but the magic triggers her vision of Rumpelstiltskin, who warns her that a price has to be paid if she saves Robin's life. Emma ignores the manifestation and uses her magic to save Robin, but in the process it triggers the darkness in her, as forewarned by Hook, with Emma's hand beginning to resemble that of a Dark One's.|$|E

500|$|Other origin stories involve Parvati and Shiva. Parvati is {{typically}} {{portrayed as a}} benign and friendly goddess. The Linga Purana describes Shiva asking Parvati to defeat the demon Daruka, who received a boon that would only allow a female to kill him. Parvati merges with Shiva's body, reappearing as Kaali to defeat Daruka and his armies. Her bloodlust gets out of control, only calming when Shiva intervenes. The Vamana Purana has a different version of Kaali's relationship with Parvati. When Shiva addresses Parvati as Kaali, [...] "the black one," [...] she is greatly offended. Parvati performs austerities to lose <b>her</b> <b>dark</b> complexion and becomes Gauri, the golden one. <b>Her</b> <b>dark</b> sheath becomes Kausiki, who while enraged, creates Kaali.
