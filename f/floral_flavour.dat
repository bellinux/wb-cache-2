40|$|The flavour {{attributes}} of cocoa liquors prepared from some cocoa clones {{planted in the}} International Clonal Trials of eight different countries were evaluated over two years on seven main flavour traits to examine individual and combined clonal and environmental effects. Fermented and dried cocoa bean samples were prepared in each country according to standardized protocols and the samples were evaluated for any defects before liquors were prepared according to a standard method. Sensory evaluation was undertaken by three panels, one consisting of two panellists and two consisting of one panellist. The results showed low coefficients of correlation between panels for the descriptors evaluated. However, the Multiple Factorial Analysis showed some common features between panels, depending on the axes. With regard to specific flavour attributes, acidity, bitterness and astringency were opposed to cocoa flavour intensity whilst <b>floral</b> <b>flavour</b> {{appeared to be the}} most independent flavour trait, related mainly to the clone for the two years' data that were analysed. Significant year and country effects were observed for cocoa flavour, acidity and astringency. The interaction between clones and countries (environment) were nonsignificant (P= 0. 05), although the P values were relatively low (varying between 0. 06 and 0. 34). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

50|$|In contrast, {{the spirit}} {{derived from the}} Carter-Head still is much subtler with light floral and sweet fragrances. Its method of {{production}} is quite different, with only the neutral spirit and water added to the pot of this still. All botanicals used with the Carter-Head are added to a flavour basket {{at the very top}} of the still. Rather than boiling the botanicals, which produces the strong pungent spirit of the Bennett still, the Carter-Head bathes the botanicals in the alcohol vapours only. As these rise up through the still, they enter the base of the botanicals basket. Inside, the botanicals are contained in copper baskets, which hold them together while allowing the vapours to be fully exposed. As the evaporated alcohol moves through the botanicals it efficiently extracts flavours from them, which are carried out of the basket along with the alcohol until they reach the condenser. Only the lighter, sweeter and <b>floral</b> <b>flavours</b> are able to be extracted by this method, which gives the spirit its distinctive character.|$|R
40|$|Many fungi and yeasts {{have been}} found to produce de novo odorous compounds. Ceratocystis species and the yeasts Kluyveromyces lactis and Sporidiobolus salmonicolor produce a wide range of {{terpenes}} and lactones with fruity or <b>floral</b> <b>flavours.</b> The yeast Williopsis saturnus synthesizes de novo fruity ester flavours (i. e. volatile branched acetates); their yield can be improved by feeding fusel oil as a cheap source of precursor branched alcohols to the fermentation process. Geotrichum klebahnii also produces a broad spectrum of ethylesters of branched carboxylic acids, generating a pleasant fruity flavour. Also, precursor speciality fatty acids and PUFA’s can be converted by fungi (such as Penicillum sp. and Botryodiplodia sp.) into flavour compounds, that provide “green notes”, mushroom flavour, fruity lactones and cheese-flavoured methylketones. Similarly, a two step fungal process has been developed, whereby Aspergillus niger tranforms ferulic acid into vanillic acid, which basidiomycetes such as Pycnoporus cinnabarinus or Phanerochaete chrysosporium can further convert into vanillin. Furanone-flavours occur in many fruits, but have also been detected in microbial cultures. In this context, the soy sauce yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii forms the DMHF-furanone compound from glucose, when fed with fructose- 1, 6 -biphosphate. Apart from precursore...|$|R
5000|$|Darjeeling tea is a {{tea from}} the Darjeeling {{district}} in West Bengal, India. It {{is available in}} black, green, white and oolong.

5000|$|Carotenoids such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and beta-cryptoxanthine are {{produced}} in plants and certain bacteria, algae and fungi, where they function as accessory photosynthetic pigments and as scavengers of oxygen radicals for photoprotection. They are also essential dietary nutrients in animals. Carotenoid oxygenases cleave {{a variety of}} carotenoids into a range of biologically important products, including apocarotenoids in plants that function as hormones, pigments, <b>flavours,</b> <b>floral</b> scents and defence compounds, and retinoids in animals that function as vitamins, visual pigments and signalling molecules.

5000|$|Traditionally, the red wines of Germany {{were mostly}} pale and light-bodied, but new breeds of dark-skinned grapes led by Dornfelder {{have allowed the}} {{production}} of more internationally styled reds. Dornfelderhas a depth of color, good acidity {{and the ability to}} benefit from barrique aging and the associated oak flavours. In comparison to traditional red wine varieties of Germany, Dornfelder is easier to grow than Spätburgunder, has better resistance to rot than Blauer Portugieser (as well as deeper color, more powerful flavours and more tannin), has stronger stalks than Trollinger, ripens earlier than Lemberger, and achieves higher must weights, i.e., higher natural alcohol levels than most of these varieties. Dornfelder can be very productive, and yield up to 120 hectoliter per hectare, but quality-conscious producers typically keep yields much lower. [...] Higher-quality Dornfelder wines are velvety textured, slightly <b>floral,</b> often show <b>flavours</b> of plums, blackberries or cherries, and are typically oaked. Sometimes the wines have a hint of sweetness.|$|R
