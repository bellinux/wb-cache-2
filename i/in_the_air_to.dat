5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results {{in the formation of}} a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E

They {{had been}} {{on their way back}} to RAF Gravesend having spent most of the morning on patrol operating from RAF Hawkinge near Folkestone. Within minutes eight more Squadrons were dispatched to meet them; two from Kenley, two from Biggin Hill and one each from North Weald, Martlesham, Heath, Manston and Rochford.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: {{while most of the}} lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E

5|$|Georgia's kicking {{game had}} {{a far more}} active day than its offense. Punter Gordon Ely-Kelso booted sevenpunts and kicker Brandon Coutu nailed threefieldgoals. The field goals, kicked from 39,51,and28yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11points. Ely-Kelso netted 264yards in punts, an average of 37.7yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were {{returned}} by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was for negative yardage.|$|E

He then aimed a lofted shot over long on from the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly went over the press box and clipped {{the top of the}} roof. Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E

5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the oxygen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> give ZnO, {{accompanied by a}} drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore {{is commonly known as}} the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E
5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the front}} foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60.

The second {{catching}} opportunity went {{in the same direction}} before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E

In the 21st minute Peter Cormack's throw-in on the right fed Chris Lawler to cross to the back post. Toshack's header across the penalty area set up Kevin Keegan's headed opening goal.|$|E
5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6.

Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series.|$|E

5|$|England took a 38-run lead after Australia {{replied with}} 458. Morris contributed only six while batting with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown. Morris chipped Bedser <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> Ken Cranston at mid-wicket to leave Australia at 1/13. Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning. England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce unevenly.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Harvey scored {{seven and}} struggled {{in contrast to}} the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head. His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval. The home team's captain Stuart Surridge lofted a drive down the ground, and Harvey ran 25m from wide long-on and leapt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> catch the ball, which would have cleared the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest; England {{elected to}} bat and started {{strongly}} with 496 {{in the first}} innings, their highest score of the series. On a placid pitch, Morris was one of seven bowlers used as Bradman sought a breakthrough; {{each of the first}} three wickets put on century partnerships. Bill Edrich hit a long hop from Morris's left arm unorthodox spin to the boundary to reach his century, before Bedser lifted him high over square leg for six. This prompted Bradman to replace Morris after he conceded 20 runs in five overs as England reached 2/423. Edrich was out when he attempted to pull Johnson to the on side in the large gap between mid-on and square leg, but only hit it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on to leave the score at 4/426, before England collapsed to 496.|$|E
