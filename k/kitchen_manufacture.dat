40|$|It is {{possible}} to signifi cantly ease kitchen chores with properly sized and appropriately arranged cupboards. In designing kitchen furniture and the optimal depth and the height of storage capacities, accessibility {{should be taken into}} consideration. It is known that the optimal storage zone is between 800 and 1100 mm and that there is reduced visibility and accessibility at the level between 1400 and 1700 mm, which is even more prominent for the elderly. This suggests that wall cabinets are not recommended for the elderly. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine to what extent <b>kitchens</b> <b>manufactured</b> by Slovenian furniture manufacturers are suitable for users of different age groups with regard to the accessibility of goods stored in the cupboards. Furthermore, based on the measurement analysis, recommendations are provided for designing kitchen furniture that would meet the needs of the elderly. The study, carried out using a computer simulation model, analyzed the products of three Slovenian kitchen manufacturers. The cross section of accessibility in the wall cabinets was determined for different age groups of men and women. The results show that the effi cacy of the volume in wall cabinets higher than 600 mm, in comparison to places where objects are easily reachable, is 30 % lower for women, thus indicating the ineffi ciency of storage space in wall cabinets. In terms of accessibility, existing kitchens are not optimal for the elderly, and a model with a deeper worktop and wall cabinets lowered onto the worktop is proposed. Accessibility in such wall cabinets is increased by up to 70 % if the body is moved forward by 30 °...|$|R

The subject is exemplified with printed advertisements designed for electronic <b>kitchen</b> appliances <b>manufactured</b> by the Turkish corporation Arçelik. How the role of woman is fictionalized, the fashion in which the image of woman is used, its influence on promotion and relationship to the marketed product are examined through examples under the heading of advertising...|$|R

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass <b>manufactured</b> <b>kitchen</b> cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|R
5000|$|Madame Aphrodite is {{essentially}} a modern fable built around the aphorism that beauty is more than skin deep. The titular Madame Aphrodite (Nancy Andrews), described as [...] "a bitter recluse", lived alone in a dingy apartment. Working from her <b>kitchen,</b> she <b>manufactured</b> a phony beauty cream using unpleasant and ineffective ingredients, which she planned to sell to her neighbours as revenge for what she perceived as meaness towards her. [...] To help distribute the phony product, Madame Aphrodite hired an attractive but naive young man named Barney (Jack Drummond) as her salesman. Believing the cream to have genuine magical powers, Barney sells it to a shy young girl, Rosemary (Cherry Davis), who becomes attracted to him. The rather plain Rosemary believes that she is being trandsformed into a beauty, and attributes this to the phony product. [...] Madame Aphrodite, touched by the girl's innocence, confesses that the beauty cream is a hoax, and {{points out that the}} change in Rosemary's demeanor was, in fact, due to her love for the likeable Barney. Madame Aphrodite further reveals that she sold the cream to take revenge on womankind because, as a child, she herself had been duped by an advertisement for a fake beauty product. The show concludes with her moment of self-realisation, where [...] "another life has been saved on Second Avenue".|$|R
40|$|Conflict between {{coworkers}} on {{the production}} line can be expensive as well as time consuming for companies. The business problem investigated in the study is the inability of supervisors {{on the production}} line to resolve conflict in nonunion companies, which, consequently, {{may lead to a}} drop in organizational productivity. Behaviors impacting shop floor productivity and performance were detected through miniethnographic and descriptive case study qualitative research methods through research of the production line leadership in a global company that <b>manufactures</b> <b>kitchen</b> and fireplace accessories. Results obtained from themes demonstrated that the production supervisor had some leader–member exchange leader characteristics including modeling behavior, individualized support of team members, resolving conflict in an appropriate manner that respected company culture and the existence of inner as well as outer circle members. Recommendations for future research included calling for additional empirical studies exploring the relationship between gender, diversity, and leader–member exchange effectiveness...|$|R

5000|$|December 1983 - Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. A local {{resident}} salvaged {{materials from}} a discarded radiation therapy machine containing 6,010 pellets of cobalt-60. Transport {{of the material}} led to severe contamination of his truck. When the truck was scrapped, it contaminated another 5,000 metric tonnes of steel to an estimated [...] of activity. This steel was used to <b>manufacture</b> <b>kitchen</b> and restaurant table legs and rebar, some of which was shipped to the US and Canada. The incident was discovered months later when a truck delivered contaminated steel building materials to the Los Alamos National Laboratory drove into the facility through a radiation monitoring station intended to detect radiation leaving the facility. Contamination was later measured on roads used to transport the original damaged radiation source. Some pellets were found embedded in the roadway. In the state of Sinaloa, 109 houses were condemned due to use of contaminated building material. This incident prompted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Customs Service to install radiation detection equipment at all major border crossings.|$|R
