5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed {{to play an important role}} in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent <b>exome</b> and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} modular protein-coding {{capacity of}} the genome is contained within the <b>exome,</b> and consists of DNA sequences encoded by exons that can be translated into proteins.

Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level of diversity in the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only in its very beginnings. <b>Exome</b> sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the <b>exome</b> contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} movement disorder, affecting 1 % of the population over 65 years characterized clinically by both motor and non-motor symptoms accompanied by the preferential loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Here, we sequenced the <b>exomes</b> of 244 Parkinson’s patients selected from the Oxford Parkinson’s Disease Centre Discovery Cohort and, after quality control, 228 <b>exomes</b> were available for analyses. The PD patient <b>exomes</b> were compared to 884 control <b>exomes</b> selected from the UK 10 K datasets. No single non-synonymous (NS) single nucleotide variant (SNV) nor any gene carrying a higher burden of NS SNVs was significantly associated with PD status after multiple-testing correction. However, significant enrichments of genes whose proteins have roles in the extracellular matrix were amongst the top 300 genes with the most significantly associated NS SNVs, while regions associated with PD by a recent Genome Wide Association (GWA) study were enriched in genes containing PD-associated NS SNVs. By examining genes within GWA regions possessing rare PD-associated SNVs, we identified RAD 51 B. The protein-product of RAD 51 B interacts with that of its paralogue RAD 51, which is associated with congenital mirror movements phenotypes, a phenotype also comorbid with PD...|$|R

25|$|Another {{advantage}} of CAPP-Seq {{is that because}} it only targets specific areas {{of interest in the}} genome it is more cost effective than whole <b>exome</b> sequencing and whole genome sequencing which are 171X and 44X more expensive respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{and accuracy of}} an RNA-Seq experiment are dependent {{on the number of}} reads obtained from each sample. A large number of reads are needed to ensure sufficient coverage of the transcriptome, enabling detection of low abundance transcripts. Experimental design is further complicated by sequencing technologies with a limited output range, the variable efficiency of sequence creation, and variable sequence quality. Added to those considerations is that every species has a different number of genes and therefore requires a tailored sequence yield for an effective transcriptome. Early studies determined suitable thresholds empirically, but as the technology matured, suitable coverage is predicted computationally by transcriptome saturation. Somewhat counter-intuitively, {{the most effective way to}} improve detection of differential expression in low expression genes is to add more biological replicates, rather than adding more reads. The current benchmarks recommended by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project are for 70-fold <b>exome</b> coverage for standard RNA-Seq and up to 500-fold <b>exome</b> coverage to detect rare transcripts and isoforms.|$|E

In an average melanoma tissue sample (where melanomas have a higher <b>exome</b> mutation frequency) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000. These high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defect giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in the preceding section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. [...] Large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to about 10cm on each side of a cancer) are found to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins (ERCC1, XPF and/or PMS2) in the entire area of the field defect. [...] When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). [...] A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. [...] In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations. [...] These new mutations and/or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. [...] Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage.|$|E
2500|$|BRA {{appears to}} have a {{predominantly}} genetic etiology and many cases represent the most severe manifestation of an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. There are several genetic pathways that could result in this condition. In 2017 researchers identified heritable autosomal dominant mutations in the gene GREB1L in two unrelated families as being the cause of both BRA and URA utilizing <b>Exome</b> Sequencing and direct sequence analysis. [...] This is the first reported genetic lesion implicated in the activation of Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Targets that has been associated with renal agenesis in humans. The majority of other possible candidate genetic pathways are autosomal recessive in nature and do not coincide with the frequency or penetrance at which BRA typically occurs in the human population. Additionally, candidate genetic pathways would be expected to involve genes expressed in the developing urogenital system (UGS). Often, these same genes and/or pathways of interacting genes are also expressed in the developing UGS as well as the central nervous system (CNS), gut, lung, limbs, and eyes.|$|E

2500|$|Pharmacogenomics aims {{to develop}} {{rational}} means to optimize drug therapy, {{with respect to}} the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. [...] Through the utilization of pharmacogenomics, it is hoped that pharmaceutical drug treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the [...] "one-dose-fits-all" [...] approach. Pharmacogenomics also attempts to eliminate the trial-and-error method of prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient's genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the efficacy of the patient's current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments). Such approaches promise the advent of precision medicine and even personalized medicine, in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual's unique genetic makeup. Whether used to explain a patient's response or lack thereof to a treatment, or act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes, greater efficacy, minimization of the occurrence of drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For patients who have lack of therapeutic response to a treatment, alternative therapies can be prescribed that would best suit their requirements. In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: genotyping or <b>exome</b> or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing provides many more data points, including detection of mutations that prematurely terminate the synthesized protein (early stop codon).|$|E
