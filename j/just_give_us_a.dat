I say the world is full of Miss Nightingales; and we, sick and wounded in our private Scutaris, have countless nurse-tenders. I did not see my wife ministering to the afflicted family at Newcome Park; but I can fancy her there amongst the women and children, her prudent counsel, her thousand gentle offices, her apt pity and cheerfulness, the love and truth glowing in her face, and inspiring her words, movements, demeanour.|$|R

40|$|The {{view that}} {{academic}} writing as an objective and faceless kind of discourse is now dead and buried.

As part of this writers must construct an argument using conventions which establish proximity with readers. I use the term proximity to refer to a writer’s control of language features which display both authority as an expert and a personal position towards issues in a text. Essentially this means that writers have to represent themselves, their material and their readers in ways which meet their readers’ expectations. In other words, proximity entails taking into account participants’ likely objections, background knowledge, expectations and reading purposes. In this paper I explore some of the ways this is done in two very different genres: science research papers and popular science articles. Comparing key features, I show how different language choices are used to construct proximity with very different audiences...|$|E

Everything that people know classically about vampires is wrong, so that <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} to plant our own flag and create our own creature. Kripke on Supernaturals divergence from classical folklore. Although the weekly adversaries for the Winchesters were often based on urban legends, the writers tried to put their own spin on the stories {{for each of the}} episodes. For example, Kripke combined the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization in the pilot. The episode [...] "Hook Man", however, borrowed three or four elements from the numerous variations of the Hook Man legend. The figure is an escaped mental patient in the traditional myth, but the writers decided {{for the purposes of the}} show to make him the ghost of a hook-handed killer. They also added a poltergeist element by having him attached to the conflicting emotions of the guest star—she wears a cross made from his melted hook. Rather than focus on modern interpretations, Kripke and co-executive producer John Shiban decided that Supernaturals vampires would stem more from the original legends. The vampires were given retractable fangs—these were inspired by the rowed teeth of sharks—as well as no aversion to sunlight or the crucifix. Kripke personally added the fact that vampires would become weak if given the blood of a dead man.|$|R
30|$|While {{the program}} {{includes}} developing {{the capacity of}} teacher leaders to conduct the PD, {{it is important to}} assess the extent of their leadership experience and skills and to take this information into account in designing preparation and support activities. Although video is being used more widely in practice-based professional development (van Es et al. 2014), it is likely that VBDs will be unfamiliar to many novice TLs. Our experiences working with UUSD point out the value of designing leadership preparation sessions that include time to model how to conduct a VBD, an opportunity to unpack the VBD by debriefing the facilitator(s) who modeled it, and then space for TLs to plan and rehearse a VBD with a specific protocol-based debrief that reduces anxiety and supports their growth. In their end-of-year interviews, several of the TLs commented on the value of these activities when asked which activities in the TLP sessions most helped them prepare to facilitate VBDs. One TL shared her thoughts about the value of the modeling and debriefing, “When [one of the Stanford team] would come in and debrief you about what you did and how it felt, it dawned on me pretty quickly that you were modeling {{what we were going to}} be doing. Your insights into what you were thinking, how it worked, what you were trying to get at with this activity and the line of questioning, I found it all very, very helpful.” Another explained that the rehearsals “gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance to practice asking questions beforehand and got us thinking, ‘Is that the right question we wanted to ask? Did it work or did it not work?’ so it <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance to tweak what we needed to do....” Similar to novices preparing for professional practice in the clergy and clinical psychology, these novice TLs benefitted from the representations, decompositions, and approximations of practice we incorporated into the leadership preparation sessions (Grossman et al. 2009).|$|R
