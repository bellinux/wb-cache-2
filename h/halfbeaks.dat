5|$|Some marine <b>halfbeaks,</b> {{including}} Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, {{are known}} for their ability to jump {{out of the water and}} glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying <b>halfbeaks.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Halfbeaks</b> {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). <b>Halfbeaks</b> are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where <b>halfbeaks</b> are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the <b>halfbeaks</b> is in a {{state of}} flux.|$|E
50|$|Hemiramphus far, the <b>halfbeak,</b> black-barred <b>halfbeak,</b> black-barred garfish, barred <b>halfbeak,</b> barred garfish or spotted <b>halfbeak,</b> is a {{schooling}} marine fish in {{the family}} Hemiramphidae. It has an Indo-Pacific distribution and has invaded the eastern Mediterranean through the Suez Canal.|$|R
50|$|The American <b>halfbeak</b> (Hyporhamphus meeki) is a <b>halfbeak</b> {{from the}} Hemiramphidae family.|$|R
50|$|The Black-tipped <b>halfbeak,</b> Hyporhamphus neglectissimus, is a <b>halfbeak</b> {{from the}} Hemiramphidae family.|$|R
5|$|<b>Halfbeaks</b> carry several {{adaptations to}} feeding {{at the water}} surface. The eyes and {{nostrils}} {{are at the top}} of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow <b>halfbeaks</b> to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.|$|E
5|$|On the one hand, {{there is}} little {{question}} that they are most closely related to three other families of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and sauries. Traditionally, these four families {{have been taken to}} together comprise the order Beloniformes. The <b>halfbeaks</b> and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.|$|E
5|$|The halfbeaks' {{fossil record}} extends into the Lower Tertiary. The {{earliest}} known halfbeak is Brachyrhamphus bolcensis from the Eocene at Monte Bolca, Italy. Apart from {{differences in the}} length of the upper and lower jaws, recent and fossil <b>halfbeaks</b> are distinguished by the fusion of the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones into a plate.|$|E
50|$|Rhynchorhamphus georgii or long-billed <b>halfbeak</b> is a <b>halfbeak</b> of {{the family}} Hemiramphidae of the order Beloniformes.|$|R
50|$|Hyporhamphus affinis, the {{tropical}} <b>halfbeak,</b> tropical garfish, insular <b>halfbeak</b> or coral reef <b>halfbeak,</b> is {{a species of}} schooling marine fish from the family Hemiramphidae. It is distributed through the Indo-Pacific regions and has been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea which it reached through the Suez Canal.|$|R
50|$|The Poso <b>halfbeak</b> (Nomorhamphus celebensis) is {{a species}} of {{viviparous}} <b>halfbeak</b> endemic to Lake Poso and its tributaries in Sulawesi, Indonesia.|$|R
5|$|Marine <b>halfbeaks</b> are omnivores {{feeding on}} algae; marine {{plants such as}} seagrasses; plankton; {{invertebrates}} such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals {{during the day and}} plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on <b>halfbeaks,</b> herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than {{one in a million}} of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, but there is a much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some <b>halfbeaks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Ballyhoo <b>halfbeak</b> or Ballyhoo, (Hemiramphus brasiliensis), is a baitfish of the <b>halfbeak</b> family (Hemiramphidae). It {{is similar}} to the Balao <b>halfbeak</b> in most features. Ballyhoo are {{frequently}} used as cut bait and for trolling purposes by saltwater sportsmen,. The fish is known to have reports of ciguatera poisoning to humans [...]|$|R
50|$|The wrestling <b>halfbeak</b> (Dermogenys pusilla) {{also known}} as Malayan <b>halfbeak</b> is a species of {{viviparous}} <b>halfbeak</b> native to the fresh and brackish waters of rivers and coastal regions in South-East Asia, in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. It is a small, slender, livebearing fish, with the elongated lower jaw characteristic of its family. The colour of this species varies, depending on where the specimen is found.|$|R
50|$|The Congaturi <b>halfbeak</b> (Hyporhamphus limbatus), {{also known}} as Valenciennes <b>halfbeak,</b> is a potamodromous species of fish in the family Hemiramphidae. It is a valued {{commercial}} fish in tropical countries both dried salted and fresh forms.|$|R
25|$|Typical ocean {{forage fish}} are small, silvery {{schooling}} oily fish such as herring, anchovies and menhaden, and other small, schooling baitfish like capelin, smelts, sand lance, <b>halfbeaks,</b> pollock, butterfish and juvenile rockfish. Herrings are a preeminent forage fish, often marketed as sardines or pilchards.|$|E
25|$|Ocean <b>halfbeaks</b> are omnivores which feed on algae, plankton, marine {{plants like}} seagrass, {{invertebrates}} like pteropods and crustaceans and smaller fishes. Some tropical species feed on animals {{during the day}} and plants at night, while others alternate summer carnivory with winter herbivory. They are in turn eaten by billfish, mackerel, and sharks.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including <b>halfbeaks,</b> silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|E
5000|$|USS <b>Halfbeak</b> (SS-352), a [...] submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy {{named for}} the <b>halfbeak,</b> a garlike fish with a beak formed by an {{extension}} of the lower jaw, found in warmer seas.|$|R
50|$|The Balao <b>halfbeak</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to its relative, the ballyhoo (H. brasiliensis). The main {{difference between the two}} being that the distance from the nares {{to the base of the}} pectoral fin is greater than the length of the ballyhoo's pectoral fin, while that difference is less than the length of the Balao <b>halfbeak's</b> pectoral fin They have no spines on fins, but do have 11-15 rays of their dorsal fins and 10-13 rays on their anal fins. Balao <b>halfbeak</b> have blue-gray skin on their backs, while their undersides are silver or white. The longest recorded Balao <b>halfbeak</b> was 40 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Melapedalion breve, the Philippine snubnose <b>halfbeak,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>halfbeak.</b> It is a coastal species that {{originates}} from the South China and Sulu Seas around the Philippines and Malaysia. It grows to about 22.7 cm SL. It is monotypic of its genus.|$|R
25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes {{of the family}} Clupeidae (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and <b>halfbeaks.</b> They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
500|$|The <b>halfbeaks</b> (family Hemiramphidae) are a {{geographically}} {{widespread and}} numerically abundant family of epipelagic fish inhabiting warm waters around the world. [...] The <b>halfbeaks</b> are named for their distinctive jaws, {{in which the}} lower jaws are significantly longer than the upper jaws. The similar viviparous <b>halfbeaks</b> (family Zenarchopteridae) have often been included in this family.|$|E
500|$|<b>Halfbeaks</b> inhabit warm seas, {{predominantly}} at the surface, in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. A {{small number}} {{are found in}} estuaries. [...] Most species of marine <b>halfbeaks</b> are known from continental coastlines, but some extend into the western and central Pacific, and one species is endemic to New Zealand. Hemiramphus is a worldwide marine genus.|$|E

500|$|The <b>halfbeaks</b> are elongate, {{streamlined}} fish {{adapted to}} living in open water. <b>Halfbeaks</b> can grow to over [...] SL {{in the case of}} Euleptorhampus viridis. The scales are relatively large, cycloid (smooth), and easily detached. There are no spines in the fins. A distinguishing characteristic is that the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones are anklylosed (fused) into a plate. <b>Halfbeaks</b> are one of several fish families that lack a stomach, all of which possess a pharyngeal jaw apparatus (pharyngeal mill). Most species have an extended lower jaw, at least as juveniles, though this feature may be lost as the fish mature, as with Chriodorus, for example.|$|E
500|$|Rather {{than being}} {{closely related to}} the flyingfishes, the {{subfamily}} Zenarchopterinae appears to be the sister group of the needlefishes and sauries. This is based on the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, sperm ultrastructure, and molecular evidence. However, this hypothesis has awkward implications for how the morphological evolution of the group is understood, because the fused pharyngeal plate has been considered reliably diagnostic of the halfbeak family. Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called [...] "halfbeak stage") the theory that <b>halfbeaks</b> are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of <b>halfbeaks</b> appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison.|$|E
500|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the ecology of {{juvenile}} marine <b>halfbeaks,</b> though estuarine habitats seem to be favored by at least some species.
