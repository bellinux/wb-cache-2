50|$|The Maykop {{people lived}} {{sedentary}} lives, and horses formed {{a very low}} percentage of their livestock, which mostly consisted of pigs and cattle. Archaeologists have discovered a unique form of bronze cheek-pieces, which consists of a bronze rod with a twisted loop {{in the middle and}} a thread through her nodes that connects with bridle, halter strap and headband. Notches and bumps on the edges of the cheek-pieces were, apparently, to <b>fix</b> <b>nose</b> and under-lip belts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of studies and regulation concerning the issue of aircraft noise protection in Republic of Serbia. After crossing the limit of 50. 000 operations in 2014, Airport 'Nikola Tesla' is classified as major airport, and with that urged to fulfill various requirements related to <b>nose</b> <b>protection.</b> Major airports are obliged to monitor noise, {{as well as to}} prepare strategic noise maps and action plans aiming to decrease number of people exposed to aircraft noise above acceptable level...|$|R
50|$|The line's {{design was}} for an {{operation}} speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), initially opening at 60 mph (100 km/h), {{with the line}} speed to be progressively raised. The railway line used standard concrete sleepers at 650 mm spacing with rails of weight 54 kg/m. The junction at Colton used a <b>fixed</b> <b>nosed</b> crossings at an angle of 1.77°. The line included chords to allow running from the Leeds-Selby Line. The estimated project cost was £60 million, of which £48.4 million was for civil engineering.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from fibreglass and features a fixed, fuselage-mounted, single-cylinder, two-stroke Gas Gas motorcycle engine, driving a retractable two-bladed fixed-pitch tractor propeller. The engine can be started and run before extending and engaging the propeller. The wing features flaperons and, unlike most other aircraft in this category, lacks wing-mounted air brakes, the brake being fuselage mounted. The landing gear consists of <b>fixed</b> <b>nose,</b> centre and tail wheels along with auxiliary wheels 5.5 m {{out on the}} wing from the fuselage. The aircraft is finished in white polyurethane paint.|$|R
5000|$|Heinkel {{introduced}} the [...] "Tourist" [...] motor scooter in the 1950s which {{was known for}} its reliability. A large and relatively heavy touring machine, it provided good weather protection with a full fairing and the front wheel turning under a <b>fixed</b> <b>nose</b> extension. The [...] "Tourist" [...] had effective streamlining, perhaps unsurprising in view of its aircraft ancestry, and although it had only a , 9.5 bhp 4-stroke engine, it was capable of sustaining speeds of up to 70 mph (official figures 58 mph), given time to get there.|$|R
5000|$|The Wizard is {{made from}} bolted-together {{aluminum}} tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its single-surface 32.3 ft span wing has its cabling supported by a single tube style kingpost. The landing gear uses tube flexing for suspension and features a <b>fixed</b> <b>nose</b> wheel. On the early models the pilot is accommodated on a sling seat suspended from the main wing keel tube, to allow weight-shift control. The standard engine supplied was the single cylinder, two-stroke Yamaha KT-100S of , although a Kawasaki 440 snowmobile engine producing [...] was optional.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Cox <b>fixes</b> Kelso's <b>nose</b> and Elliot meets back up {{with her}} old boyfriend, Sean. During the end narration, J.D. {{strongly}} implies that after Elliot's makeover, he has {{fallen in love with}} her again.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{the weapons}} were either bombs or depth charges and the racks {{were limited to}} a maximum of 1000 lb each. After the first salvo was dropped, the crew had to get the next eight weapons loaded before the pilot had the {{aircraft}} positioned on the next bombing run. The <b>fixed</b> <b>nose</b> guns (introduced when in service with Australian units) were removed when the aircraft was on the water and stowed in the gun room just aft of the bow compartment. The toilet was in the right half of this same compartment and stairs from the cockpit to the bow area divided the two.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the halter, usually a lead (lead line, lead rope) or leash is used to lead or tie the animal. The lead {{is attached to the}} halter most often at a point under the jaw, less often at the cheek, and rarely above the nose. [...] On horses, a lighter version of a headcollar or headstall is also used to attach a fly veil of waxed cotton strands or light leather strips onto a browband. Some fly masks are also made in a similar pattern to a headcollar and are often fastened with velcro tabs. These masks may also have ear and <b>nose</b> <b>protection</b> added to them. On both horses and dogs, halters may be used to attach a muzzle.|$|R
5000|$|Germany's {{aviation}} industry was also dismantled after World War II. Heinkel stayed in business by making bicycles and mopeds, while Messerschmitt made sewing machines and automobile parts. Messerschmitt {{took over the}} German licence to manufacture Vespa scooters from Hoffman in 1954 and built Vespas under from 1954 to 1964. Heinkel designed and built its own scooters. The Heinkel Tourist was a large and relatively heavy touring scooter produced in the 1960s. It provided good weather protection with a full fairing, and the front wheel turned under a <b>fixed</b> <b>nose</b> extension. It had effective streamlining, perhaps thanks to its aircraft ancestry. Although it had only a [...] 4-stroke motor, it could sustain speeds of 70 mi/h km/h. Heinkel scooters were known for their reliability.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing, with a composite partial cockpit fairing. A full fairing that can be adjusted in flight to provide wing trim is optional. The 50% double surface wing is covered in Dacron sailcloth, {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame weight-shift control bar. The powerplant is an air-cooled, two-stroke, [...] Simonini Mini 3 engine, with the Simonini Mini 2+ or the Electravia engines optional. The landing gear consists of four wheels: a <b>fixed</b> <b>nose</b> wheel and <b>fixed</b> main centre-line wheel and two retractable outrigger wheels. The aircraft has an empty weight of 47 kg and a gross weight of 180 kg, giving a useful load of 133 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Pratt flew as a {{passenger}} (along with his aide 1st Lt. Lee John May), {{in the lead}} glider, a quickly substituted CG-4A with a bolt-on Griswold <b>nose</b> <b>protection</b> device, painted to represent The Fighting Falcon. [...] The original [...] "Fighting Falcon" [...] was moved to position #45 in the flight serial. It was a CG-4A paid for by War Bond funds raised by Greenville, Michigan students who intended to raise the $17,000 cost of one glider, but ended up raising over $72,000. Piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Mike Murphy, senior glider pilot of IX Troop Carrier Command, and Second Lieutenant John M. Butler, the #1 glider came down into its designated landing zone, LZ [...] "E", two miles west of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, Manche, Normandy, between 0345 and 0400 hours on June 6, 1944.|$|R

5000|$|In SCA heavy combat, the {{validity}} of a blow received is judged on a honour system. The combatant receiving a blow from a SCA approved weapon judges {{if they would have}} been uninjured, injured, or killed had it been a historically real weapon impacting a universal [...] "imaginary" [...] set of SCA specified armour that all combatants [...] "wear". This set of default armour balances valid blow/hit levels and helps eliminates differences created by the armour combatants are actually wearing. This [...] "imaginary" [...] armour set consists of mail hauberk, an open-faced helmet with a nasal (<b>nose</b> <b>protection),</b> and boiled leather armour about the arms and legs. Blows with sufficient force are judges by combatants to have been deflected, defeated, or penetrated this style of armour, or if struck on an [...] "unprotected" [...] area of the body. Depending on these several variables a combatant judges the level of damage ranging from no damage to instant death and responds according to SCA norms and rules. Combatants varying from SCA combat norms and rules are normally frowned upon because they could potentially compromise safety, fun, and reflect badly on the honor of SCA combatants.|$|R

50|$|Rosita {{went to a}} {{show and}} {{transformed}} into a sexy, beautiful lady by way of plastic surgery that <b>fixes</b> her <b>nose</b> and teeth. She met again with Bruce (with her name changed to Violeta) and Bruce was attracted to her and pursued her. Bruce suspected that Violeta is Rosita, but Violeta was clever and didn't let Bruce know who she really was, and avoided showing Bruce her back since Rosita had a birthmark {{on her back and}} so did Violeta. All through this, Samantha was jealous that Bruce loved Violeta and ended up dying.|$|R
50|$|The Pointer {{carried a}} CCD camera <b>fixed</b> in its <b>nose,</b> meaning {{it had to}} be {{directly}} pointed at its target to see it, which is how the machine got its name.

He cannot call on Calmon because he never bothered to help <b>fix</b> his <b>nose.</b> When he and Truffaldino try to unchain the bird, they are turned into statues. Barberina and Smeraldina arrive and notice that the magic dagger now looks bloodstained. Barberina realizes that her greed was wrong. But Calmon appears, praises her recognition of her error, and advises her to rescue the bird by reading words from a scroll while standing on a precise spot. She successfully does so, and the bird vows to be her husband, and with its feather she releases the statues, including Renzo and Truffaldino.|$|R
25|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{consisted of}} six remote-controlled retractable gun turrets, and <b>fixed</b> tail and <b>nose</b> turrets. Each turret was fitted with two 20mm cannons, {{for a total}} of 16. Recoil vibration from gunnery practice often caused the aircraft's electrical wiring to jar loose or the vacuum tube electronics to malfunction, leading to failure of the aircraft controls and navigation equipment; this contributed to the crash of B-36B 44-92035 on 22 November 1950.|$|R
50|$|Endoscopic endonasal {{surgery is}} a {{minimally}} invasive technique used mainly in neurosurgery and otolaryngology. A neurosurgeon or an otolaryngologist, using an endoscope that is entered through the <b>nose,</b> <b>fixes</b> or removes brain defects or tumors in the anterior skull base. Normally an otolaryngologist performs the initial stage of surgery through {{the nasal cavity}} and sphenoid bone; a neurosurgeon performs {{the rest of the}} surgery involving drilling into any cavities containing a neural organ such as the pituitary gland.|$|R

50|$|His {{feature film}} debut was in {{producer}} Samuel Goldwyn's Technicolor 1944 comedy Up in Arms, {{a remake of}} Goldwyn's Eddie Cantor comedy Whoopee! (1930). Rival producer Robert M. Savini cashed in by compiling three of Kaye's Educational Pictures shorts into a patchwork feature, The Birth of a Star (1945). Studio mogul Goldwyn wanted Kaye's prominent <b>nose</b> <b>fixed</b> to look less Jewish, Kaye refused but did allow his red hair to be dyed blonde, apparently because it looked better in Technicolor.|$|R
5000|$|Charboneau {{soon became}} a fan favorite. Long before Dennis Rodman came on the scene, Charboneau became known for dyeing his hair, {{as well as his}} unusual way of {{consuming}} beer.

The other 20 aircraft were transport versions based on the Model 212.|$|R
60|$|Mr Harding {{is a small}} man, now {{verging on}} sixty years, but bearing few of the signs of age; his hair is rather grizzled, though not gray; his eye is very mild, but clear and bright, though the double glasses which are held {{swinging}} from his hand, unless when <b>fixed</b> upon his <b>nose,</b> show that time has told upon his sight; his hands are delicately white, and both hands and feet are small; he always wears a black frock coat, black knee-breeches, and black gaiters, and somewhat scandalises some of his more hyperclerical brethren by a black neck-handkerchief.|$|R
50|$|The design {{started as}} a {{redesign}} of the Bo 208 under Bölkow technical director Dr Hermann Mylius but resulted in a vastly different aircraft with little commonality of parts with its predecessor. The fuselage was now wider and incorporated a retractable nose wheel. The wings were redesigned and relocated to a low-wing configuration (the Bo 208 was a high-wing aircraft) and made foldable for towing and storage. The aircraft was marketed {{with a choice of}} the <b>fixed</b> or retractable <b>nose</b> wheel, either a 150-hp or 160-hp Lycoming engine, and an optional variable-pitch propeller. A trainer version with dual controls was also manufactured.|$|R
500|$|The VIT-1 was a low-winged, twin-engined {{aircraft}} with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage {{was made}} in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood. The wing and tail structures were built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The VIT-1 had the first metal-skinned control surfaces in the USSR. The main legs of the conventional landing gear retracted aft into the engine nacelles, but the tailwheel was <b>fixed.</b> The <b>nose</b> was extensively glazed to give the bombardier/navigator good visibility and he was armed with a [...] ShVAK cannon with 10° of vertical travel.

50|$|Defensive {{armament}} {{varied between}} three and six 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns. Initially, the armament was quite weak, one 7.7 mm (.303 in) Lewis Gun in the dorsal position, and one in each beam position. This was a serious failing as the gunner could only man one weapon at a time. One improvement was {{the replacement of the}} single dorsal gun by a turret fitted with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Bredas. Another machine gun was sometimes fitted in the ventral position, both for offensive and defensive tasks. Some examples also had a machine gun <b>fixed</b> in the <b>nose,</b> firing with a synchronizer through the propeller disk.|$|R
50|$|The Pegasus had a rectangular-section, ply-covered {{fuselage}}, which tapered {{towards the}} tail. The wing was braced above the fuselage by the struts and the open, unscreened cockpit {{was under the}} leading edge; fabric-covered, inverted V-shaped decking tapered from the lower wing surface rearwards. There was a short, curved landing skid <b>fixed</b> at the <b>nose</b> and joined to the lower longerons {{at the same point}} as the lift struts by a V-form pair of telescopic compression struts. Initially the Pegasus had a tailskid but flight trials showed that both skids were easily broken, so the main skid was replaced with a stiffer one and the tailskid by a rubber tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The Tu-16 bomber {{was armed}} {{with a total of}} seven AM-23 cannon. A single cannon was <b>fixed</b> in the <b>nose</b> of the aircraft, and the others were mounted in pairs in the {{defensive}} turrets. The Tu-95 bomber was in most versions equipped with a total of six AM-23 cannon located in three defensive turrets. Later, the tail turret of the Tu-95 was completely replaced by an electronic countermeasures installation, which resulted in the Tu-95MS. Apart from the Tu-16 and Tu-95, the AM-23 cannon was also installed on the Antonov An-8, An-12B, B-8, B-10, Il-54, Il-76, Myasishchev M-4, 3M and M-6 bombers and transporters. The DB-65U tail turret of the An-12 transporter was equipped with two AM-23 cannon.|$|R
