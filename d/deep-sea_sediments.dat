5|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that the asteroid impact at the K–Pg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments around {{the area of the}} Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, from the colossal waves created by the impact. These deposits have been identified in the La Popa basin in northeastern Mexico, platform carbonates in northeastern Brazil, in Atlantic <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediments,</b> and {{in the form of the}} thickest-known layer of graded sand deposits, around 100m thick, in the Chicxulub crater itself, directly above the shocked granite ejecta.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Proterozoic, Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as graywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments and banded iron formations. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediments</b> eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.|$|E
25|$|Microfossils, {{particularly}} from <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediments,</b> also provide {{some of the}} most important records of global environmental change on long, medium or short timescales. Across vast areas of the ocean floor, the shells of planktonic micro-organisms sinking from surface waters provide the dominant source of sediment, and they continuously accumulate (typically at rates of 20–50million per million years). Study of changes in assemblages of microfossils and changes in their shell chemistry (e.g., oxygen isotope composition) are fundamental to research on climate change in the geological past.|$|E
40|$|Evidence of {{disturbance}} by benthic burrowing organisms is commonly observed in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediment</b> cores but these same cores often possess good magnetic records, especially of field reversals. The natural remanent magnetism (NRM) of these burrowed sediments cannot be a depositional detrital remanence (DRM) but must rather have been acquired at some later time. An experiment {{was designed to}} demonstrate that a post-depositional DRM could be acquired in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediment</b> in conjunction with sediment disturbance similar to that caused by benthic fauna...|$|R
40|$|Susceptibility anisotropies in {{the form}} of {{vertically}} prolate ellipsoids have been reported in many <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediment</b> cores. The results of the present investigation suggest that these anisotropies may not describe the original magnetic fabric of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediment,</b> but are more likely due to either a measurement effect or to deformation of the sediment during coring. Anisotropy measurements made on a spinner magnetometer sometimes were found to be greatly affected by the shape of the sample. This apparent "sample-shape effect" was not observed on a low-field torque meter. The anisotropy of samples taken near the base or the top of some piston cores often reflects sediment disturbance during the coring operation. Most samples of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediment</b> examined had weak anisotropies that could be interpreted as due to normal depositional processes, including bioturbation. The best-fitting susceptibility ellipsoids were usually oblate with near vertical minimum susceptibility axes...|$|R

25|$|Microtektites, {{the fourth}} group of tektites, are tektites {{that are less}} than 1nbsp&mm in size. They exhibit a variety of shapes ranging from spherical to dumbbell, disc, oval, and teardrop. The color of microtektites ranges from colorless and {{transparent}} to yellowish and pale brown. They frequently contain bubbles and lechatelierite inclusions. Microtektites are typically found in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediments</b> that are of the same ages {{as those of the}} four known strewn fields. Microtektites of the Australasian strewn field have also been found on land within Chinese loess deposits, and in sediment-filled joints and decimeter-sized weathering pits developed within glacially eroded granite outcrops of the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.|$|E
500|$|Scientists first {{reported}} evidence of microbes in the accretion ice in 1999. Since then, a different {{team led by}} Scott O. Rogers has been identifying a variety of bacteria and fungi from accretion ice (not from the subglacial water layer) collected during U.S. drilling projects in the 1990s. According to him, this indicates that the lake below the ice is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem. [...] Then Scott Rogers published in July 2013 that his team performed nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) sequencing and the results allowed deduction of the metabolic pathways represented in the accretion ice and, by extension, in the lake. The team found 3,507 unique gene sequences, and approximately 94% of the sequences were from bacteria and 6% were from Eukarya. Taxonomic classifications (to genus and/or species) or identification were possible for 1,623 of the sequences. In general, the taxa were similar to organisms previously described from lakes, brackish water, marine environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake sediments, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sediments,</b> deep-sea thermal vents, animals and plants. Sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation-resistant, autotrophic, and heterotrophic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes.|$|E
