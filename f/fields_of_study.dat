40|$|We utilize {{a unique}} dataset {{of more than}} 15, 500 first-year {{students}} in upper secondary vocational education of a particular region in the Netherlands, and estimate the impact of commuting distance on the choice <b>of</b> a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> Using logistic regression analysis we estimate the probability that students choose for a <b>study</b> in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> engineering, economics or health & welfare. In general we find that our expectations {{with respect to the}} effect of distance deterrence on the choice <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> come true. If the commuting distance to the nearest or the nearest-but-one school location offering a particular <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> increases then the probability that students choose for that field diminishes. As for the nearest-but-two school location offering a particular <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> we find that commuting distance sometimes has a positive correlation with the choice for a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> This may imply that more remote school locations can be more attractive for students for reasons of quality of education or good accessibility by public transport. Moreover, we find that an increasing distance to a school location <b>of</b> one <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> may increase the probability to choose for another <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> This result demonstrates that {{it is not just the}} distance to one particular school location that matters.

One type of reductionism is the belief that all <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.

A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students. Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office.

In {{this article we}} explore the question why there is a correlation between social origin and choice <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> Using data from the Saxon survey of high school graduate candidates, we model the decision process {{of high school students}} regarding post-secondary education about three month prior to graduation. Our empirical results prove that the effect of social origin on the choice <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> is the result of an individual decision structured by status maintenance motive, by expected costs for the different types of higher education and training, by individual ability level, by expected success probabilities {{as well as by the}} socio-cultural distance to tertiary education. These determinants of the choice <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> explains the effect of social origin and, therefore for the aggregate, the persistent social inequality of opportunities in the access to <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R

The purpose <b>of</b> this <b>study</b> was to examine the role <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in college choice behavior. The Chapman (1993) multistage model of college choice provided the theoretical framework for the examination of college choice among students selecting the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> agriculture.

In this model, the choice <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> depends on expected earnings, unemployment duration, and the discount rate. I use data from the Canadian National Graduates Survey for 15, 124 individuals who succesfully completed their programs in Canadian community colleges (CEGEPs in Quebec) in 1990 and 1995. Over this period, the returns (earnings and unemployment duration) to fields such as health declined relative to other fields such as science and engineering. This provides useful leverage for identifying the impact of earnings and unemployment duration on the choice <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} probability of selecting a specific college <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> depends significantly on expected earnings and unemployment duration in that field relative to other fields.
