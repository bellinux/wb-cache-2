500|$|Charlotte's {{discovery}} of a polar bear with a Dharma Initiative collar caused fan speculation about her connection with the island. Mader herself was unaware of Charlotte's backstory beyond the flashback in [...] "Confirmed Dead"she noted [...] "I feel like I'm almost in the same seat as the audience, like 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on?' and 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen next?', it's really exciting actually". She found it freeing to not know her character's history, and felt it made her give a natural performance. Mader felt Charlotte's relationship with Faraday allowed her character to develop and show a softer, more human side, and thought their relationship resonated with the audience as she and Jeremy Davies had good chemistry. Eight episodes of season four were written before production stopped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Once the strike was resolved, a further six episodes were written, two less than originally planned for the season, {{and as a result}} Charlotte's role continued into season five. She enjoyed speaking Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and wished the full scene had been aired. Mader was excited when she discovered that Charlotte grew up on the island, and hoped to have scenes with Nestor Carbonell who plays Richard Alpert, as his character also has a history on the island. However when negotiating contracts in June 2008 she found out that her character would die during season five; Mader summed up Charlotte's season five arc as her demise. Charlotte's death scene was written by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and was amongst their favourite scenes they wrote during season five. Horowitz loved the emotion in the scene due to the audience only just learning Charlotte's backstory, and Kitsis thought Mader's performance [...] "elevate the words to a whole other level". Mader called it [...] "the best thing [...] ha ever done in [...] entire career" [...] and enjoyed playing a significant role within the episode.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode and show, calling them, [...] "at best, a mediocre adventure in detective comedy television". He considered the episode [...] "mindless" [...] {{when compared to}} Monk, which preceded the episode. Moriarty stated that, when not comparing Psych to other shows, the episode is still [...] "making you wonder what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on {{in the minds of}} the show's writers and producers". He questioned the show's ability to last due to having to continue the fake psychic concept, and called detectives Lassiter and O'Hara [...] "completely unlikeable". Moriarty stated that things in the installment [...] "simply don't make any sense". He questioned whether the show would be able to last more than one season, and said that [...] "we highly recommend you continue to take a pass on Psych and save yourself from the mindlessness of it all". The installment was given a rating of 6, or [...] "okay", tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season, with the preceding episode, [...] "Spellingg Bee".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already starting to think, 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.|$|E

500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E

But if a bill like that were to come up, I would vote for it." [...] Following his May 2009 vote against recognizing gay marriages, Barry was criticized for what activists believed to be an apparent flip-flop. Councilman Phil Mendelson said he {{was surprised by the}} vote because Barry had signed on as a co-introducer of the marriage bill. Barry said his position had not changed and warned that the council needed to move slowly on this issue.

2500|$|Among {{the artists}} that Barber has {{recognized}} {{for their contributions}} to [...] practice - Martha Rosler, Adrian Piper, Guerrilla Art Action Group, Critical Art Ensemble and WochenKlausur, among others - he gave a priviled role to the Situationist International as an exemplary model of operative art. [...] The SI and the students they influenced participated in occupations, sit-ins, teach-ins, theatrical agit-prop events {{and other forms of}} protest. [...] The SI endorsed the fundamental importance of intervention as a post-theoretical and practical aspect of their critique of the [...] "Society of the Spectacle" [...] - as theorized by Guy Debord. [...] Among the theoretically informed strategies that were developed by the SI is the constructed situation. [...] The constructed situation is bound to be collective both in its inception and development. [...] However, it seems that at least during an initial experimental period, responsibility must fall on one particular individual. [...] This individual must, so to speak, be the 'director' of the situation. [...] For example, in terms of one particular situationist project - revolving around the meeting of several friends one evening - one would expect (a) an initial period of research by the team, (b) the election of a director responsible for co-ordinating the basic elements for the construction of the decor, and for working out a number of interventions, (c) the actual people living the situation who have taken part in the whole project both theoretically and practically, and (d) a few passive spectators not knowing what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on should be reduced to action.|$|E
