5000|$|His work Die große Wundarzney is a {{forerunner of}} antisepsis. This {{specific}} empirical knowledge originated from his personal experiences as an army physician in the Venetian wars.

50|$|Meeting a challenge, agents make {{decisions}} in conformity to the <b>inherited</b> <b>character,</b> life history and current stimuli. The field of acute attention is limited, and motives partly remain unconscious. From the first person's perspective {{we have an}} intuitive commitment that many options are available. However, if the total of the mental content is considered from the third person's perspective, only a single decision deemed by the agent as the most favorable at the moment turns out real. The validity of causation for any mental event becomes apparent taking into account their neurophysiological correlates. Different causal descriptions correspond to the mental and physical domain. Laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics govern the latter. Admitting downright mental causation of physiological impulses would mean surplus determination. The surmise that under identical conditions, alternative decisions and actions are possible is disproved by naturalists as an illusion.Hard determinism is not taken to refer merely to a determinism on earth, but in all of reality (e.g. involving the effects of light from other galaxies, etc.); not just during a certain deterministic period of time, but for all time. This also means that the relation of necessity will be bi-directional. Just as the initial conditions of the universe presumably determine all future states, so too does the present necessitate the past. In other words, one could not change any one fact without affecting the entire timeline. Because hard determinists often support this eternalist view of time, {{they do not believe}} that there are genuine chances or possibilities, only the idea that events are 100% likely.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that parentally supplied RNA plays crucial roles during eukaryotic development. This epigenetic contribution may regulate gene expression from the earliest stages. Although present {{in a variety of}} eukaryotes, maternally <b>inherited</b> <b>characters</b> are especially prominent in ciliated protozoa, in which parental noncoding RNA molecules instruct whole-genome reorganization. This includes removal of nearly all noncoding DNA and sorting the remaining fragments, producing extremely gene-rich somatic genomes. Chromosome fragmentation and extensive replication produce variable DNA copy numbers in the somatic genome. Understanding the forces that drive and regulate copy number change is fundamental. We show that RNA molecules present in parental cells during sexual reproduction can regulate chromosome copy number in the developing nucleus of the ciliate Oxytricha. Experimentally induced changes in RNA abundance can both increase and decrease the levels of corresponding DNA molecules in progeny, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of chromosome copy number. These results suggest that maternal RNA, in addition to controlling gene expression or DNA processing, can also program DNA amplification levels...|$|R

It was estimated recently that 40 % of apparently balanced de novo translocations with abnormal phenotype were associated with cryptic deletion. We explored 47 unrelated mental retardation patients carrying an apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangement with high-resolution oligonucleotides arrays. We included 33 de novo cases (21 translocations, 7 inversions and 5 complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCR)) and 14 inherited cases (7 translocations, 5 inversions and 2 CCR). Twenty of the 47 cases (42. 6 %) carried a cryptic deletion ranging from 60 kb to 15. 37 Mb. It concerned 16 / 33 de novo rearrangements (8 / 21 translocations, 4 / 7 inversions and 4 / 5 CCR) and 4 / 14 inherited rearrangements (1 / 7 translocations, 2 / 5 inversions and 1 / 2 CCR). The proportion of imbalances was not statistically different between de novo and inherited cases.

40|$|Spatial niche {{segregation}} {{between two}} habitats {{and the related}} adaptive dynamics are investigated. Independent population regulations operate in the two patches by a single resource in each. The populations migrate between the habitats with a constant rate. In line with a general mathematical concept published elsewhere, the niche of a species is described by the measures of the two-way interactions between the species and the resources. Increasing migration rate tends to equalize the population sizes between the habitats and diminish the dependence of the niches on the environ-mental tolerances of the species. In line with the expectations, when two species coexist, their realized niches are more segregated than their fundamental ones. We demonstrate that robust co-existence requires sufficient niche segregation. That is, the parameter range that allows coexistence of the two species shrinks to nil when the niche-differences between the species disappear. In turn, niche segregation requires separation of tolerances and sufficiently low migration rate. For the evo-lutionary study we assume a continuous, clonally <b>inherited</b> <b>character</b> that has different optima at the two patches. Evolution of this trait may end up in an intermediate “generalist ” optimum, or it can branch and leads to a dimorphic population.

40|$|Socialist cities, {{which emerged}} from the social {{revolutions}} and the urban reconstruction after World War II, were planned and developed with formal variety and abundance of public spaces. New cities were structured around the great square or the great central empty space, which was the representative public space of the new political power. These spaces, which were designed to gather multitudes in special days, remained empty most of the time. Indeed, besides some spaces linked to historical centres, most of them persist nowadays without continuous and defined public use. The residential macrostructure – generally situated in {{the first or second}} urban belt around the historic centre – had also its focus on the large public space, reflecting the architectural and urbanist principles of the modernist movement. However, appropriation by society of theses spaces was always deficient, leaving extended areas with reduced and occasional use. This paper intends to systematize through several significant examples the main formal characteristics of public space in the socialist city, its localization and importance in the urban fabric, so as the intended uses. Inevitably, public space was part of the ideological discourse about the creation of an ideal environment for the new society; thus, the main ideological connotations inscribed in the configuration of public spaces will be explained.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Combining the {{analyses}} of {{three generations of}} glacial deposits and {{of a range of}} geomorphic features including widespread honeycombs and tafonis at Two Step Cliffs / Mars Oasis (71 ° 52 'S, 68 ° 15 'W) provides new insights into the geomorphological evolution of West Antarctica, with special respect to alveolar weathering. At Two Step Terrace, indicators of the <b>inherited</b> <b>character</b> of cavernous weathering were found, such as 97 % non flaking and varnished backwalls, and 80 % tafoni floors that are till-covered and/or sealed by lithobiontic coatings. Based on the NE predominant aspect of the alveolized boulder faces, tafoni initiation is attributed to coastal salt spray weathering by halite coming from the George VI Sound during the 6. 5 ka BP open water period. The present-day activity of these inherited cavities is restricted to roof flaking attributed to a combination of processes involving thermal stresses. This 6. 5 ka BP phase of coastal alveolization is the first step of a six-stage Holocene geomorphological scenario that includes alternatively phases of glacial advance or stationing, and phases of vegetal colonization and/or rock weathering and aeolian abrasion on the deglaciated outcrops. This geomorphic scenario is tentatively correlated with the available palaeoenvironmental record in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with two potential geomorphic indicators of the Holocene Optimum being identified: 1. clusters of centimetric honeycombs facing the sound (marine optimum at 6. 5 ka BP); 2. salmon-pink lithobiontic coatings preserved inside cavities and at the boulder surface (terrestrial optimum at 4 - 3 ka BP).
