5|$|An {{advisory}} committee {{was formed by}} the city council in 1956 to propose sites for a new city hall and civic center campus. The city council placed a $250,000 bond issue on the November 1956 ballot to fund {{the construction of a}} new city hall, but voters defeated the proposition. City offices instead moved to a former <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> near the Bellevue Square shopping center in 1960.|$|E

50|$|There may {{be fewer}} <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> in the U.S. {{now than in}} years past, but {{according}} to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were still 14,300 <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> in the U.S. in 2005, employing on average 10 employees each. Even in the face of competition from large chain stores (commonly referred to as big-box or destination <b>hardware</b> <b>stores,</b> e.g., The Home Depot, Lowe's and Menards) new <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> in the U.S. are still opening all the time.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> in China, {{whether in}} the city or rural areas, are small, family-owned, non-franchise companies. They provide similar {{products}} to Western <b>hardware</b> <b>stores,</b> including plumbing and electrical supplies, tools, and some housewares. Unlike the West, they do not normally carry lumber, fishing supplies, gardening products, or boating supplies. Some rural <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> do supply animal feed, such as chicken feed.|$|R
5|$|The film often {{features}} shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows {{are present}} {{from the very}} first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the very end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> into talons above Lila's head.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{said that}} he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges.

5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011. Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original Pancake House, a restaurant, was the final tenant to close in the mall. The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely.

5|$|Alan Kotok {{was born}} in 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised as an only child in Vineland, New Jersey. During his childhood, he played with tools in his father's <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> and learned model railroading. He was a {{precocious}} child, skipping two grades at high school, and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aged 16. Although his interest in computers began at Vineland High School, his first practical experience of computing came at MIT; there he developed a habit of working late at night when more computer time was available.|$|E
5|$|In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen {{down to a}} Vallejo Ace <b>Hardware</b> <b>store,</b> {{where he}} is {{employed}} as a sales clerk. The men have a brief encounter before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, victim Mike Mageau meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot. As the authorities walk by an airport book store, copies of Graysmith's book Zodiac are shown. Final title cards inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be questioned further. A DNA test performed in 2002 on an archived autopsy sample did not match a partial DNA sample gathered from the postage stamp {{on one of the}} Zodiac letters, but this does not rule him out as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{damage was}} also {{reported}} to infrastructure other than roads. After two rivers overflowed, at least 70% of Oxford was flooded, {{which included a}} <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> and dozens of homes, while a senior citizens living complex were evacuated. The SOS Children's Village in Margaretsville sustained approximately $25,000 (1999CAD) in flood damage. Schools in Amherst and the University of Windsor canceled afternoon classes on September24. In the Canning area, 1,500people were left without power, while electricity was also lost in Annapolis Valley, Yarmouth, Truro, Westville, Amherst, and Stellarton. A woman required rescue by firemen after her van plunged into the swollen River Philip. In Maccan, a tractor trailer loaded with lumber went off the road.

5|$|While {{working at}} the <b>hardware</b> <b>store,</b> Gardiner first played {{organised}} sports {{as a member of}} the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E
