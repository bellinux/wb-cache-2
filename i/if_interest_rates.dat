25|$|Long {{duration}} bonds {{tend to be}} mean reverting, {{meaning that}} they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5–10 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} credit card {{companies}} can change the interest rate on debts that were incurred when a different rate of interest was in place is similar to adjustable rate mortgages where interest rates on current debt may rise. However, in both cases, this is agreed to in advance, and is a trade off that allows a lower initial rate {{as well as the}} possibility of an even lower rate (mortgages, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fall) or perpetually keeping a below-market rate (credit cards, if the user makes their debt payments on time). The universal default practice was encouraged by federal regulators, particularly those at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as a means of managing the changing risk profiles of cardholders.|$|E
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{increases}} {{or economic}} conditions worsens the province risks defaulting on the debt. According to the 2012 Provincial Solvency and Federal Obligations study Ontario is [...] "the most vulnerable in the 10-20-year window" [...] for defaulting on its debt obligations.|$|R
25|$|Adjustable rates {{transfer}} {{part of the}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{risk from}} the lender to the borrower. They can be used where unpredictable <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain. The borrower benefits <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> falls but loses <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> increases. The borrower benefits from reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared to fixed or capped rate mortgages.|$|R
5000|$|Now, <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{varies from}} period to period, the {{consumer}} is faced with a stochastic optimization problem. Let the interest r follow a Markov process with probability transition function [...] where [...] denotes the probability measure governing the distribution of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> next period <b>if</b> current <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is [...] The timing of the model is that the consumer decides his current period consumption after the current period <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is announced.|$|R
500|$|Keynes {{had begun}} a {{theoretical}} work {{to examine the}} relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. The work, Treatise on Money, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour. In 1927 he wrote, [...] "We will not have any more crashes in our time." ...|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{when the}} {{duration}} of assets is less than {{the duration of}} liabilities, the duration gap is negative. <b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> rise, liabilities will lose more value than assets, thus increasing the value of the firm's equity. <b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> decline, liabilities will gain more value than assets, thus decreasing the value of the firm's equity.|$|E
50|$|When the {{duration}} of assets is larger than {{the duration}} of liabilities, the duration gap is positive. In this situation, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> rise, assets will lose more value than liabilities, thus reducing the value of the firm's equity. <b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fall, assets will gain more value than liabilities, thus increasing the value of the firm's equity.|$|E
5000|$|Trading {{platforms}} offer rollovers but {{the process}} involves a rollover interest fee which is calculated according {{to the difference between}} the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of the traded currencies. <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the trader's long position is higher than the rate on the short position, the trader receives the <b>interest.</b> <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the trader's short position is higher than the rate on the long position, then the trader pays the interest. For weekends and holidays, the rollover is multiplied by the number of days of rollover.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{collection}} of ISDAFIX fixes was to determine an exercise price for the cash settlement of swaptions (that is, options to enter into fixed rate swaps). ISDAFIX sets were also often used to determine close-out payments <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps were terminated early. Swap dealers also used ISDAFIX to determine {{the market value of}} swap products.|$|R

50|$|Some annuities {{also have}} an {{additional}} feature called a Market Value Adjustment or MVA. MVA applies when a withdrawal is made from the annuity {{in excess of the}} penalty-free amount. Generally, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are lower at time of the withdrawal than at the time the policy was purchased, the value of the annuity would increase. <b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are higher, the reverse is true.|$|E

50|$|The crude maximin choice {{based on}} returns {{would be to}} invest in the money market, {{ensuring}} a return of at least 1. However, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fell then the regret associated with this choice would be large. This would be 11, which is the difference between the 12 which could have been received if the outcome had been known in advance and the 1 received. A mixed portfolio of about 11.1% in stocks and 88.9% in the money market would have ensured a return of at least 2.22; but, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fell, there would be a regret of about 9.78.|$|E
50|$|The line {{of credit}} growth rate is {{determined}} by adding 1.25% to the initial <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (IIR), which means the {{line of credit}} will grow faster <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the loan increases.|$|R
5000|$|In banking, [...] "Pro-rating also {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of applying <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to different time frames. <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> was 12% per annum, you could pro-rate this number to be 1% a month (12%/12 months)." ...|$|R
5000|$|As an example, {{consider}} a three-month option on a stock whose current price is $100. <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is 8% pa and the volatility is 30% pa then the {{prices for the}} options might be: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{interest}} rate insurance protects the holder from rising {{interest rate}}s but does not raise their initial pay rate, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fall, the policyholder will see a benefit in reduced payments on their mortgage or loan when compared to a fixed rate alternative.|$|E
50|$|The {{yield of}} a bond is {{inversely}} related to its price today: {{if the price of}} a bond falls, its yield goes up. Conversely, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> decline (the market yield declines), then the price of the bond should rise (all else being equal).|$|E
5000|$|Exposure to {{interest}} rate risk: since the yield {{is one of}} the main attractions of income trusts, there is the risk that trust units will decline in value <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the rest of the cash/treasury market increase. This risk is common to other dividend/income based investments such as bonds.|$|E
30|$|<b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{expectations}} are so well anchored by four entirely independent monetary policies, {{it is interesting}} to ask how the term premia are correlated, both between themselves and with the US {{on the assumption that the}} US is the dominant financial center. Note that the US Federal Reserve reacted strongly to a domestic and then global financial crisis with a variety of conventional and unconventional means. For convenience we plot all four of our estimated ten-year term premia together with the equivalent US term premia obtained from Adrian et al. (2014) in Fig. 9.|$|R
30|$|The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in project scheduling, especially in large investment projects. Theoretically, projects tend to be postponed when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is high. <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> increases, then investment decreases due to the higher cost of borrowing. Although transit planners cannot control the <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> sensitivity analysis can show them how extension decisions are affected by <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wicksell's most {{influential}} contribution was {{his theory of}} interest, originally published in German language as Geldzins und Güterpreise, in 1898. The English translation Interest and Prices became available in 1936; a literal translation of the original title would read Money Interest and Commodity Prices. Wicksell invented the key term natural <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> and defined it at that <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> which is compatible with a stable price level. <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> falls short of the natural rate, inflation is likely to arise; <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds the natural rate, this will tend to produce deflation. An <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> that coincides with the natural rate ensures equilibrium in the commodity market and produces price level stability. This theory {{was adopted by the}} Austrian School, which theorized that an economic boom happened when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> fell short of the natural rate.|$|R
50|$|Long {{duration}} bonds {{tend to be}} mean reverting, {{meaning that}} they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5-10 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{fall and}} bond prices rise, a firm {{will benefit from}} the sinking fund {{provision}} that enables it to repurchase its bonds at below-market prices. In this case, the firm's gain is the bondholder's loss - thus callable bonds will typically be issued at a higher coupon rate, reflecting the value of the option.|$|E
50|$|An {{interest}} rate mismatch {{occurs when a}} bank borrows at one {{interest rate}} but lends at another. For example, a bank might borrow money by issuing floating interest rate bonds, but lend money with fixed-rate mortgages. <b>If</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> rise, the bank must increase the interest it pays to its bondholders, even though the interest it earns on its mortgages has not increased.|$|E
50|$|I=f(r,ΔY,q) - + + where r is {{the real}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> Y the GDP and q is Tobin's q. The signs under the {{variables}} simply tell us if the variable influences investment in a positive or negative way (for instance, <b>if</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were to rise, investments would correspondingly fall).|$|R
50|$|Then, {{there is}} the point that a rise in <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{designed}} to halt inflation could paradoxically make inflation appear higher <b>if</b> current <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{showed up in the}} index. Economists' principles are not acceptable to all; nor is insistence upon consistency between the treatment of owner-occupied dwellings and other durables.|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{constructed}} {{to examine how}} the utility and dollar values of life and time change as one ages, encompassing several previous studies as special cases. <b>If</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is no higher than the depreciation rate (in deriving utility) and also no larger {{than the sum of}} the depreciation rate and the growth rate of wage (allowed to be negative) at any age, then the dollar value of life monotonically declines as one ages. The dollar value of life increases first and then declines as one ages, i. e., the dollar value of life over age exhibits an inverted-U shape, <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than the depreciation rate by a sufficient margin. While the utility value of time may decrease with age (time is more precious for the young), the dollar value of time increases with age <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is sufficiently higher than the depreciation rate. A distinction is also made between a shift from work to leisure and the value of time (which may not equal to the wage rate) as such with conceptual and policy implications...|$|R
50|$|This {{type of bond}} protects investors: <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> rise after bond purchase, {{the future}} value of coupon {{payments}} will become less valuable. Therefore, investors sell bonds back to the issuer and may lend proceeds elsewhere at a higher rate. Bondholders are ready to pay for such protection by accepting a lower yield relative {{to that of a}} straight bond.|$|E
50|$|The {{capital value}} of a fixed rate loan is {{generally}} determined {{as a function of}} future interest rates at the time of calculation. This means that they contain a capital risk,in that <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fall, the capital value of the loan rises, and vice versa. This differs from a variable rate loan, where the capital value is always the original loan less any capital repayments.|$|E
50|$|With a {{callable}} bond, {{investors have}} the benefit of a higher coupon than they would have had with a non-callable bond. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fall, the bonds will likely be called and they can only invest at the lower rate. This is comparable to selling (writing) an option — the option writer gets a premium up front, but has a downside if the option is exercised.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> must {{necessarily}} {{coincide with}} the payment period. If not, either the payment period or the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> must be modified. For example, <b>if</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> given is the effective annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> but cash flows are received (and/or paid) quarterly, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> per quarter must be computed.
