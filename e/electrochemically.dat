25|$|Most {{microbial}} {{cells are}} <b>electrochemically</b> inactive. Electron transfer from microbial cells to the electrode is facilitated by {{mediators such as}} thionine, methyl viologen, methyl blue, humic acid and neutral red. Most available mediators are expensive and toxic.|$|E

Standard starting is recoil start. Reduction drive systems available are the G-50 gearbox with reduction ratios of 2.16:1, 2.29:1, 2.59:1, 3.16:1, or 3.65:1, or a multi-element cog belt drive. A tuned exhaust and electric start are optional.|$|E
25|$|In his 1896 patent Pollak already {{recognized}} that the capacitance of the capacitor increases when roughening {{the surface of the}} anode foil. Today (2014), <b>electrochemically</b> etched low voltage foils can achieve an up to 200-fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Advances in the etching process are the reason for the dimension reductions in aluminum electrolytic capacitors over recent decades.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Siemens Water Technologies {{announced}} {{technology that}} applied electric fields to desalinate one cubic meter of water while using only a purported 1.5 kWh of energy. If accurate, this process would consume one-half {{the energy of}} other processes. As of 2012 a demonstration plant was operating in Singapore. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Marburg are developing more efficient methods of <b>electrochemically</b> mediated seawater desalination.|$|E
25|$|Ligand binding assays (LBA) is an assay, or an {{analytic}} procedure, whose procedure or method {{relies on}} the binding of ligand molecules to receptors, antibodies or other macromolecules. A detection method is {{used to determine the}} presence and extent of the ligand-receptor complexes formed, and this is usually determined <b>electrochemically</b> or through a fluorescence detection method. This type of analytic test can be used to test for the presence of target molecules in a sample that are known to bind to the receptor.|$|E
25|$|A {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC), or biological fuel cell, is a bio-electrochemical system that drives an electric current by using bacteria and mimicking bacterial interactions found in nature. MFCs can be grouped into two general categories: mediated and unmediated. The first MFCs, demonstrated in the early 20th century, used a mediator: a chemical that transfers electrons from the bacteria in the cell to the anode. Unmediated MFCs emerged in the 1970s; {{in this type of}} MFC the bacteria typically have <b>electrochemically</b> active redox proteins such as cytochromes on their outer membrane that can transfer electrons directly to the anode. In the 21st century MFCs started to find a commercial use in wastewater treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include {{the mechanisms of}} how neurons process signals physiologically and <b>electrochemically.</b> These questions include how signals are processed by neurites – thin extensions from a neuronal cell body, consisting of dendrites (specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons) and axons (specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials) – and somas (the cell bodies of the neurons containing the nucleus), and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron. Another major area of neuroscience is directed at investigations {{of the development of}} the nervous system. These questions include the patterning and regionalization of the nervous system, neural stem cells, differentiation of neurons and glia, neuronal migration, axonal and dendritic development, trophic interactions, and synapse formation.|$|E
25|$|C fiber axons {{are grouped}} {{together}} {{into what is}} known as Remak bundles. These occur when an unmyelinated Schwann cell bundles the axons close together by surrounding them. The Schwann cell keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its cytoplasm between the axons. The condition of Remak bundles varies with age. The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location. For example, in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 dorsal root ganglion, while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments. Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle. The cross sectional area of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it. Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles. The Remak Schwann cells {{have been shown to be}} <b>electrochemically</b> responsive to action potentials of the axons contained within them.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors are {{constructed}} with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which {{serve as the}} power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material {{is a very large}} surface area. In this example the activated carbon is <b>electrochemically</b> etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an aluminum can or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is hermetically sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.|$|E

500|$|Several barium platinides {{have been}} {{synthesized}} in which platinum exhibits negative oxidation states ranging from −1 to −2. These include BaPt, , and [...] Caesium platinide, , a dark-red transparent crystalline compound {{has been shown}} to contain Pt anions. Platinum also exhibits negative oxidation states at surfaces reduced <b>electrochemically.</b> The negative oxidation states exhibited by platinum are unusual for metallic elements, and they are attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals.|$|E
500|$|Zinc is more {{reactive}} than iron or {{steel and}} thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( [...] forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts {{even after the}} zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied <b>electrochemically</b> or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Mediator-free {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} use <b>electrochemically</b> active bacteria to transfer electrons to the electrode (electrons are carried {{directly from the}} bacterial respiratory enzyme to the electrode). Among the <b>electrochemically</b> active bacteria are Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila and others. Some bacteria are able to transfer their electron production via the pili on their external membrane. Mediator-free MFCs are less well-characterized, such as the strain of bacteria used in the system, type of ion-exchange membrane and system conditions (temperature, pH, etc.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{groups have}} shown that alane can be {{produced}} <b>electrochemically.</b> [...] Different electrochemical alane production methods have been patented. [...] <b>Electrochemically</b> generating alane avoids chloride impurities. Two possible mechanisms are discussed {{for the formation of}} alane in Clasen's electrochemical cell containing THF as the solvent, sodium aluminium hydride as the electrolyte, an aluminium anode, and an iron (Fe) wire submerged in mercury (Hg) as the cathode. [...] The sodium forms an amalgam with the Hg cathode preventing side reactions and the hydrogen produced in the first reaction could be captured and reacted back with the sodium mercury amalgam to produce sodium hydride. [...] Clasen's system results in no loss of starting material. For an insoluble anode see reaction 1.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{reference}} electrodes {{consist of}} a plastic tube electrode body. [...] The electrode is a silver wire that is coated with {{a thin layer of}} silver chloride, either physically by dipping the wire in molten silver chloride, chemically by electroplating the wire in concentrated hydrochloric acid or <b>electrochemically</b> by oxidising the silver in a chloride solution.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, the {{chemistry}} behind enzymatic detection compounds has been updated {{so that the}} indicating component is redox active, {{as opposed to the}} more usual chromogenic format, allowing faecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli and E. faecalis to be detected <b>electrochemically</b> without any sample pre-treatment. Since the colour of the detection compound is of no consequence, this allows detection in deeply coloured matrices.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{automotive}} {{engines are}} [...] "water"-cooled to remove waste heat, although the [...] "water" [...] is actually antifreeze/water mixture and not plain water. The term engine coolant {{is widely used}} in the automotive industry, which covers its primary function of convective heat transfer for internal combustion engines. When used in an automotive context, corrosion inhibitors are added to help protect vehicles' radiators, which often contain a range of <b>electrochemically</b> incompatible metals (aluminum, cast iron, copper, brass, solder, et cetera). Water pump seal lubricant is also added.|$|E
2500|$|Sunkist Growers {{was having}} {{problems}} with its own manufacturing process. Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid, with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from litmus paper, did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them. [...] Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice <b>electrochemically,</b> but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and non-reactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.|$|E
2500|$|The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks [...] "the main {{tactics are}} raising energy efficiency, {{switching}} to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, {{and as they}} die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage [...] Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced <b>electrochemically</b> from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters {{appear to be more}} susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy." ...|$|E
