The voice actors were asking for an increase from US$125,000 to $360,000 per episode. The same quote by Homer to Lisa was cited by Michael Schneider in Daily Variety, who wrote: [...] "...insiders note that the actors work just six to seven hours to voice an episode—which would mean $ 360,000 for a day's work, a figure that even Everybody Loves Raymond star Ray Romano doesn't match." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} season, Duchovny {{announced}} that he would leave the show for good. In addition, lead actress Anderson's contract also expired at {{the end of the}} eighth season. Anderson had expressed her growing disinterest in the series ever since the beginning of the eighth season, saying [...] "For a lot of people, if you don't like your <b>job,</b> <b>you</b> can quit your job, I don't necessarily have that option." [...] Anderson cited the fact that [...] "eight years is a long time" [...] as a contributing factor to her indifference. However, Carter soon changed his position and announced he would remain on the show and continue only if Anderson agreed to do another season. Eventually, Fox offered Anderson a [...] "generous" [...] incentive to stay, resulting in the retention of Carter and Anderson and a final season of the show. With the departure of Duchovny and limited use of Anderson, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, saying the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a <b>job.</b> <b>You</b> go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E

500|$|... "Essence" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter. The episode, {{which was the first}} part of two and {{concluded}} with the season finale [...] "Existence", was written during a time of uncertainty for the series. Near the end of season eight, it was unclear whether or not the show would continue onto a ninth season. Carter had maintained for sometime that he would not continue the show without lead actor David Duchovny. However, Duchovny announced that {{after the end of the}} eighth season, he would leave the show for good.

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his <b>job,</b> <b>you</b> know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that <b>job</b> <b>you</b> really want to do and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E

Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams.
