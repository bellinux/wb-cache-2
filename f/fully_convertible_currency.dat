5000|$|Fully {{convertible}} : When {{there are}} no restrictions or limitations {{on the amount of}} currency that can be traded on the international market, and the government does not artificially impose a fixed value or minimum value on the currency in international trade. The US dollar {{is an example of a}} <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> and, for this reason, US dollars are one of the major currencies traded in the foreign exchange market.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{typically}} that basket is trade-weighted, the trade-weighted effective {{exchange rate}} index {{is not the}} only way to derive a meaningful effective exchange rate index. Ho (2012) proposed a new approach to compiling effective exchange rate indices. It defines the effective exchange rate as the ratio of the [...] "normalized Exchange Value of Currency i against the US dollar" [...] to the normalized exchange value of the [...] "benchmark currency basket" [...] against the US dollar. The US dollar is here used as numeraire for convenience, and since it cancels out, in principle any other currency can be used instead without affecting the results. The benchmark currency basket is a GDP-weighted basket of the major <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currencies</b> of the world.|$|R
5000|$|Ho (2012) {{proposed}} {{a new approach}} to compiling effective exchange rate indices. Under this approach, the effective exchange rate can be calculated as a ratio of the normalized exchange value of currency against the US dollar to the normalized exchange value of the benchmark currency basket against the US dollar. Normalized exchange rate refers to the current exchange rate divided by the exchange rate against the US dollar in the base year, which effectively scales up the exchange rate of a [...] "small value" [...] currency like the Japanese yen, worth a small fraction of a dollar, and scales down the exchange rate of a [...] "big value" [...] currency like the British pound, worth much more than a dollar. Thus, all standardized or normalized currencies in the base year are worth US$1 in the base year. The US dollar is used for convenience, but, in principle, any other currency could be used instead without affecting the results. The benchmark currency basket is a GDP-weighted basket of the major <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currencies</b> of the world. Since GDP data are available with a lag, the GDP weights used in Ho are GDPs dated two years ago. The use of GDP weights {{has been found to be}} superior to direct trade weights since countries with bigger GDPs will tend to attract imports from other countries, both direct and indirect.|$|R

5000|$|In reality, the {{background}} {{was one in}} which the East German state was chronically short of cash in general, and of convertible currency in particular. The West German Deutsche Mark had become, by the early 1960s, a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency.</b> Selling political prisoners to the west addressed another problem for East Germany. The historian Stefan Wolle describes the arrangement as [...] "a form of political toxic-waste disposal" [...] ("eine Art politischer Giftmüllentsorgung").

50|$|The dollar was {{introduced}} on 17 February 1970, {{less than a}} month before the declaration of a republic on 2 March 1970. It replaced the pound at a rate of 2 dollars to 1 pound. The dollar proved to be a strong currency, at parity with the pound sterling right up to the very end of Rhodesia in 1980, when it was replaced by the Zimbabwean dollar at par. However, the Rhodesian dollar was never a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> and its exchange rate was therefore not an indication of the underlying economics.|$|E

Currently, the amount of foreign currency is regulated through weekly auctions, while the Central Bank sets the exchange rate.

50|$|Later, Intershops {{were opened}} at border crossings, rest stops and transit {{stops on the}} GDR Autobahn, railway stations, bus stations, ferry terminals, and airports. As {{an example of the}} GDR regime's desire for hard currency, in the 1980s, in the Berlin Friedrichstraße {{underground}} (U-Bahn) station, there was an Intershop kiosk on the platform of the U6 line created specifically for travellers from West Berlin who may not have wanted to pass through the GDR border controls. One could disembark from the underground train, make a purchase, and then get back on the next train, and go back to West Berlin, all without processing through the GDR border controls. Purchases could be paid with any <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency,</b> such as U.S. dollars, British pounds, Swiss francs, and especially the West German mark. The selection included food, alcohol, tobacco, clothing, toys, jewellery, cosmetics, technical devices, music recordings, and much more. These products could not be purchased, or could only be purchased at lower quality, using East German marks, although the majority of these goods were produced in East Germany for sale to Western companies.|$|E

The ground {{level and the}} underground platforms on the [...] "western" [...] side of the station had so called Intershops, created specifically for travellers from West Berlin {{who did not want}} to pass through the East German border controls. Initially just mobile trollies offering alcohol and tobacco, they were soon shops integrated into the station offering food, alcohol, tobacco, books, toys, jewellery, cosmetics, gift items, and more. One could disembark from the U-Bahn, make a purchase, and then get back on the next train and go back to West Berlin, all without going through East German border controls. Purchases could be made with any <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency,</b> such as U.S. dollars, French francs, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and especially the West German Deutschmark. The merchandise was offered duty-free, which made especially the alcohol and tobacco products particularly attractive to passengers from West Berlin. This was also known to the West Berlin customs agency, which sometimes checked travellers coming from the Friedrichstrasse at their first station in West Berlin.|$|E

40|$|In November 2008 the G 20 {{became the}} premier forum for {{international}} {{economic and financial}} affairs. As a result, the international monetary system has come to reflect {{the transformation of the}} global economy brought about by China’s emergence as the second largest economy and major exporter, and by the related limits of international governance, especially of the so-called Bretton Woods institutions. This article argues that Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s Bank of China, started an international debate about the shortfalls of the international monetary system in March 2009, after which China pursued the internationalization of its own currency, the renminbi, to turn it into one of the key international currencies. To this purpose, China has put together a policy framework that facilitates the international use of the renminbi without opening domestic capital markets — a requisite for a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> international <b>currency.</b> This article discusses the renminbi’s trajectory {{over the last five years}} and suggests that it has become more regionalized rather than internationalized. It also discusses the challenges that Chinese authorities experience as they try to put the renminbi in the pockets of foreign investors and at the same time maintain control — “managed convertibility” — of capital flows in and out of the domestic market. The article concludes that the decision to include the renminbi in the International Monetary Fund’s basket for its special drawing rights reflects expectations that the international monetary system will shift from a dollar-dominated to a multi-currency system. However, this will take several years; in the meantime, international governance will continue to reflect the influences of the issuers of the key international currencies...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of the renminbi as an international currency is underpinned by the large and fast growing Chinese economy. We present empirical evidence indicating that the renminbi has already become a significant force impacting the exchange rates of the Asian currencies. We also estimate a reserve currency model and counter-factual simulations, and suggest that the renminbi's potential as a reserve currency would be {{comparable to that of}} the Japanese yen and the British pound if the Chinese currency were to become a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> today. The evolution of the international role of the remninbi will depend importantly on the pace of the liberalisation of the restrictions on currency convertibility, which is likely to be governed by the authorities' consideration of the associated benefits and costs. In particular, we see a two-way reinforcement of currency internationalisation and financial market developments and opening in China...|$|E
40|$|Turkey's liberal {{financial}} markets have been facing serious destabilising effects of financial globalization. Turkey's experience with liberalization and deregulation and open {{financial markets}} have been dissapointing. The most painful and explosive experience {{has taken place}} in the public sector deficits and indebtedness. This paper tries to discuss more serious sources of financial instability in the framework of the theory of the fiscal crises of the state, specifically, the theory of "bifurcation of monetary and real accumulation " and the consequent "socialization of debts". It reaches to the conclusion that financial flows were delinked and severed from real accumulation and real economic activities; private saving surpluses were shouldered by the public deficit. Turkey has "emerging " financial markets. The process of liberalization and deregulation began in 1980. Since mid- 1989 Turkey is a financially open economy with a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency.</b> In terms of capital flows, it is far more open many European countries. Financial liberalization and financial deepening have not resulted in a significant internalization of the markets or in providing useful net transfer of funds. Yet...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} a {{well-known}} puzzle why the yen has not been used more in trade invoicing among Japanese exporters. Despite the yen’s status as an only <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> in Asia, two patterns stand out as puzzling features of an excessively small share of yen invoicing: First, a strong tendency of Japanese exporters to choose importer's currency in their exports to advanced countries, and second, the prevalence of US dollar invoicing in Japanese exports to East Asia even though Japanese firms have built a regional production network {{in the last two}} decades. New possible determinants of currency invoicing at a firm-level are found through interviews with Japanese representative exporting firms. Invoicing behavior is examined by probit estimation using the unique data set on the firms' currency invoicing choice by destination. Our novel findings suggest that a surprisingly low share of yen invoicing among Japanese exports even in the 2000 s can be attributable to (1) a scale-economy in concentrating currency risk at the headquarter as intra-firm trades with overseas operations of Japanese firms grew; and (2) the production/trade structure of Japanese electronics companies in Asia in which final products tend to be exported to the United States or Europe. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a {{discussion}} of the policy perspectives on the past 20 years of economic change in Poland. The article looks at the range of areas (political and economic systems) subject to transition; the evolutionary nature of the change; and the sequence of change. The article calls upon more than 20 years of research into these areas and questions and discusses the nature of change in the stabilization, liberalization and privatization programs. It concludes by providing insights on lessons that may be learned from reform efforts. The authors conclude that the Polish experience proved conclusively that reducing the budget deficit through the elimination of state subsidies, controlling the money supply, and creating a stabilized rate of exchange and a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> can be successful even in a state-controlled, state sector-dominated socialist economy as existed in Poland in 1989 - 1990. The article further asserts that it is also now apparent that only a radical stabilization-liberalization program is capable of abolishing the massive shortages which became the main characteristics of the failed socialist system. Further, the authors argue that the changes initiated in Poland {{as a result of the}} implementation of the Balcerowicz Plan fundamentally changed the mentality of economic activity from state-centered to private-centered. It is this change in the dynamic mentality that may be most important in Poland achieving success over the past 20 years. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} achieving full convertibility for the Chinese currency, Renminbi (RMB), {{and its impact on}} the economies of both mainland China and Hong Kong. It focuses on the sequencing of Renminbi¡¦s full convertibility, clarifying the different concepts of currency convertibility, i. e. current account convertibility, capital/financial account convertibility, and full convertibility. It also discusses the differences between removing restrictions on international transactions and removing restrictions on the exchange of foreign currencies. There still exist various extremely strict restrictions on capital/financial account convertibility in China. There is still a long way to go before these restrictions can be removed completely. China¡¦s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will surely drive the course of Renminbi¡¦s full convertibility. However, the Renminbi may not become a <b>fully</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> within the five years after China¡¦s accession to the WTO. This paper comes to the conclusion that there does not exist a uniform or fixed sequence in adopting the full convertibility of a currency due to the differences between countries. At the same time, based on the common practices and basic sequence taken by most countries in the world, drawing on the experience and lessons from other countries¡¦ practice and given the fact that China is a large developing country, we also conclude that a progressive and prudent sequential process is needed for the full convertibility of Renminbi. convertibility of Renminbi, WTO, China, Hong Kong...|$|E

Investors fear devaluation and they charge Argentina for the option to devalue. In 1999 President Menem recommended “dollarizing ” the economy. Dollarization extinguishes the option to devalue. If dollarization is a credible commitment to maintain a fixed exchange rate, then it is an irreversible decision. This is the first paper, as far as I know, to explicitly model the unique feature [...] irreversibility [...] of a dollarization policy. In addition, it is the first paper to recognize that if a dollarization is a potential exchange rate regime choice, then the equilibrium is a mixed strategy equilibrium. Argentina might dollarize. I compute Nash equilibria and the transition probabilities that a country will move from a currency board regime to dollarizing, or floating, in one year, or two years, out to seven years. I model shocks to the exchange rate as a jump-diffusion process. The jumps represent large “asymmetric ” shocks to the exchange rate — such as Brazil’s 1999 devaluation. The probability of dollarization is inversely related to the jump probability. When the jump probability is small, the probability of dollarization is large and the probability of floating is small. When the jump probability is large, the probability of floating is large and the probability of dollarization is small. I thank my friend and colleague Steve Goldman for many valuable suggestions and corrections, and I thank Richard Saouma for help with the data. ...|$|E
