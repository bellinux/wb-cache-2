5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the <b>good.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory at}} Salamis {{was used by}} Antigonus as a {{suitable}} pretext for his own royal proclamation, the Macedonian throne having lain vacant since the murder of Alexander IV of Macedon by Cassander in 309 BC. At the same time, Demetrius was raised to co-king alongside his father. Antigonus' assumption of the royal title was followed by an attempt to eliminate Ptolemy for <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> massive, but failed, invasion of Egypt in autumn 306, {{and then by the}} celebrated, but equally unsuccessful, Siege of Rhodes by Demetrius in 305–304 BC. Finally, in 302 BC the remaining dynasts—Ptolemy, Cassander, Seleucus, and Lysimachus—having in turn assumed the royal title themselves, allied against Antigonus and defeated him in the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus was killed, and his realm was broken up and divided among the victors.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{composite}} good addresses this problem. The addition of a composite <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single-good model (bringing it up to two) allows for all other opportunities to be accounted for. Since the composite is considered a single good only for purposes of the model, analysis can be made on a two-dimensional graph. Optimal choices represent the bundle of two goods; the first good and the composite.|$|E
25|$|The Pareto optimum {{provision}} {{of a public}} <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society is at the level where the combined sum of the marginal rate of substitution between private goods and a given public good of all individuals {{is equal to the}} marginal rate of transformation. This contrasts to the Pareto optimality condition of private goods, in which each consumers' marginal rate of substitution is equal; as is the societies marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

However, Poole enters and forces him to transform into Mr. Hyde once again by using the blue serum; the heroes flee per Jekyll's request. After they escape, Mr. Hyde injects himself with the red serum, splitting himself and Dr. Jekyll apart, but as Hyde tries to kill Jekyll, Hook and the others rescue Jekyll. Zelena uses fireball at Poole and Snow uses Poole's magical gizmo to zap Hyde unconscious. Jekyll takes his serum and tools with him just before Hyde wakes up.|$|E

500|$|Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise {{early in}} Essai, {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself [...] "nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life." [...] While Cantillon advocated an [...] "intrinsic" [...] theory of value, based on the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jo {{has been}} generally positive. Diana Steenbergen of IGN favored Jo from the beginning, deeming her [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't {{have a lot}} of in their lives right now". She also believed that Jo and Dean had a [...] "natural chemistry" [...] between them, which continues even with her reappearance in the fifth season. However, Steenbergen was confused by Jo's anger at Sam and Dean over John Winchester's involvement in her father's death, feeling that the show's producers may have added it to the story as an excuse for Jo's removal from the series. While Tina Charles of TV Guide was at first unsure about the character, she wrote that by the episode [...] "No Exit", [...] "Tal did step things up and kinda won me over". She believed that while Jo did not make a good love interest for Dean, she was <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sisterly or friendly fellow-ghostbuster way", deeming her as [...] "someone they can count on in a pinch". Overall, Charles felt that Jo [...] "fit into that world, whether she was a little overzealous or not".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} favorable response from critics, who praised its simplicity. According to Crystal Bell of The Huffington Post, Madonna {{was able to}} portray a rich life {{like that in the}} 1960 film, La Dolce Vita. Amanda Dobbins of New York gave props to Madonna for looking <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leotard and for giving break to the young actors accompanying her in the video. Brett Warner of the website Ology appreciated the vintage feel of the video writing: [...] "Heavy sigh. Remember a time when pop videos didn't have to shimmer and sparkle, when you didn't need choreographed dance routines or outlandish costumes? Remember when cars and cleavage was enough? Madonna clearly does." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator agreed, writing that the video is [...] "the most fun visual [...] offered up in years... All in all, a fantastic video for one of the more mediocre tracks off MDNA." [...] Mark Hogan from Spin noted that the video appeared a literal take on the song's lyrics but the change of scenery to the Italian countryside and the party scenes made it endearing. Melinda Newman from HitFix said that although the video did not live up to Madonna's other endeavors, it fit the [...] "carefree" [...] theme of the song. She found influences of Italian film director Federico Fellini's works, especially his 1957 release Nights of Cabiria, in the scene showing Madonna picking up prostitutes in her car.|$|E

2500|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket for Derbyshire against Surrey when he sensationally dismissed Andy Sandham {{with his first}} ball. However, his record {{for the rest of}} the season was moderate. In 1933, Copson became a regular member of the Derbyshire side, and, if he did not, in spite of his short run-up, possess the build to undertake as much work as fast bowlers were expected to then, he was consistently <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> summer unfavourable to bowlers. In the following two summers, Copson was so plagued by injury that there were serious worries about his long-term health.

2500|$|Based {{mostly on}} his {{twelve years of}} {{classical}} piano and acoustic guitar lessons at school, Valdobrev followed {{the way to a}} collaboration and friendship with the most outstanding Bulgarian musicians, jazz and ethno bands, symphony orchestras and conductors. He has often stated that the lack of musical Academy training was of course a disadvantage, but this was compensated by the advantage of being an actor who composes for fellow-actors and senses their need on the stage or on the screen: [...] "After all, if you had the right professors and they were <b>good</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain art (which was my case) they could teach you the rules of arts in a way to use them in another field of your muses. Because the rules of art are universal. For me there’s no difference if I play a character, compose music or write poetry for my songs, it’s all about telling stories, communication, sharing thoughts and emotions, about the ability to stretch and push the boundaries with visions of your own world".|$|E
2500|$|With initial {{ideas for}} The Last Guardian envisioned by Ueda since around 2005 after {{completing}} Shadow of the Colossus, {{the game was}} in active development since 2007, {{a year after the}} release of the PlayStation 3.

By 2009, the development team had completed enough of the game for it to be showcased during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009, using an improved render of the same set pieces previously seen in the Target Render and later provided a short vertical slice of the game to the press for the Game Developers Conference in early March 2011. Ueda had considered including this demo on the then-upcoming remastered The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection, though it was ultimately not included.|$|E
