500|$|Les Bowie {{provided}} the special effects: {{he had made}} his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blanks</b> more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments.

Methods: Osteosarcoma tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 52 patients were selected. Human osteosarcoma cell lines (SaOS 2, HOS, U 2 OS and MG- 63) were collected and cultured; MG- 63 cells had the highest lnc-HOST 2 expression and thus were used in subsequent experiments. Then, MG- 63 cells were transfected and divided into <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> (no transfection), si-CON (transfected with negative control siRNA) and si-lnc-HOST 2 (transfected with small interference lnc-HOST 2 siRNA) groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression of lnc-HOST 2 in primary tissues and cells. Cell growth was detected using the CCK- 8 and colony formation assays. Cell doubling time was detected. Cell migration and invasion were observed using the scratch test and Transwell assays. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression of osteosarcoma cells were detected using flow cytometry with annexin V/PI double staining and PI staining, respectively. Results: The level of lnc-HOST 2 expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> si-lnc-HOST 2 group was significantly decreased compared to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> and si-CON groups. <b>The</b> OD values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> si-lnc-HOST 2 group were significantly lower than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> and si-CON groups. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> and si-CON groups, the si-lnc-HOST 2 group presented significant decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony number and healing rates after scratching. The number of invasive cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> si-lnc-HOST 2 group was significantly less than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> and si-CON groups. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> si-lnc-HOST 2 group, the cell cycle was mainly halted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> G 1 phase, and the apoptosis rate and doubling time in this group were significantly higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group and si-CON group.

Methods: A total of 20 peripheral venous blood samples (3 mL) were collected from 20 asthmatic children during remission stage, and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) were separated by Ficoll method. PBMCs were separated into three groups (blank group, low-dose group and high-dose group). The PBMCs were incubated in vitro for 48 hours <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence (<b>blank</b> group) or presence (low-dose group and high-dose group) of Cordyceps extract at different concentrations (10, 20 μg/mL). The expressions of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 10, T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), GATA-binding protein- 3 (GATA- 3) and forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor- 3 (Foxp 3) mRNAs in PBMCs were measured by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the contents of IFN-γ, IL- 4 and IL- 10 in supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The expressions of IFN-γ mRNA showed no significant differences among the three groups. The expressions of the IL- 4 mRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-dose group and the low-dose group were lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 014, P= 0. 011). The expression of IL- 10 mRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-dose group was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 034). And the differences of the IFN-γ mRNA/IL- 4 mRNA ratio presented no statistic significance among the three groups. The level of IL- 4 content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-dose group was lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 018), but the level of IL- 10 content, and ratio of IFN-γ/IL- 4 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-dose group were higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 011, P= 0. 045). The differences of the IFN-γ presented no statistic significance among the three groups. The T-bet/GATA- 3 ratio and Foxp 3 mRNA expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-dose group were higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 001, P= 0. 015). There was significant difference in expression of GATA- 3 mRNA between the high-dose group and <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 028), and between the low-dose group and <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> group (P= 0. 019). The expression differences of T-bet mRNA were insignificant between any two groups. Conclusion: Cordyceps extract can inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of Th 2 cells and reduce the expression of related cytokines by down-regulating the expression of GATA- 3 mRNA and up-regulating the expression of Foxp 3 mRNA in PBMCs. Meanwhile, it can alleviate the chronic allergic inflammation by increasing the content of IL- 10...|$|R

For example, the player learns that the [...] "Apple" [...] artifact originated from 1687 Cambridge. The player can then time travel using this information; time traveling itself is a minigame in which Mario surfs through a wide ocean, collecting mushrooms. Collecting enough mushrooms will transport Mario to the time period and location programmed into the Timulator. The player is given a short document describing the life and notability of the historical person associated (e.g. Isaac Newton), but the document itself has some of its terms missing. The player thus is required to converse with the non-player characters depicting the local denizens of the time period {{in order to learn}} various facts and be able to fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blanks.</b> The player chooses the words from a list of pre-determined words; if the player incorrectly fills a blank more than twice, he is sent back to 1993 and is required to try again.

30|$|The {{infrared}} spectra of <b>the</b> products obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> experiments were also compared. Neither the products obtained after heating nor the ones extracted with n-pentane showed {{any signs of}} change in their {{infrared spectra}}. This is not surprising because infrared analysis is not a sensitive technique to detect small changes in hydrocarbon composition.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} electro-acupuncture on obestatin in rat with simple obesity. Methods: Obesity was induced in male SD rats with high-fat and -glucose diet for 10 weeks. Twenty-four rats with obesity were randomly divided into untreated group and electro-acupuncture group, with 12 rats in each group. Another 12 normal SD rats serving as controls were fed standard rat chow. Rats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electro-acupuncture group were treated with electro-acupuncture on bilateral Zusanli (ST 36), Tianshu (ST 25) and Pishu (BL 20) acupoints for fifteen days consecutively. Rats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> control group and untreated group were not interfered. Body weight was measured every 3 days during treatment. After treatment, obestatin in serum and hypothalamus was detected by radioimmunoassay or immunohistochemiscal method respectively. Visceral fat weight was also detected. Results: Body weight and visceral fat weight of rats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated group {{were significantly higher than}} those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> control group (P< 0. 01). Body weight and increase of body weight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electro-acupuncture group were significantly lower than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated group (P< 0. 01). Visceral fat weight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electro-acupuncture group was significantly lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated group (P< 0. 01), but {{there was no significant difference}} as compared with <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> control group. <b>The</b> obestatin expression <b>in</b> hypothalamus was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated group than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> control group (P< 0. 05), while it was lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> untreated group than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electro-acupuncture group (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Electro-acupuncture has an effect against obesity in rats, which may be related to up-regulating obestatin expression in hypothalamus...|$|R
