500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold <b>hard</b> <b>news.</b> We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

50|$|As the HKEJ mainly {{focuses on}} {{reporting}} government policies and financial affairs, soft news plays {{a relatively minor}} role in its operations. The style it adopts {{is very different from}} other local newspapers in Hong Kong, such as Apple Daily, Oriental Daily News, etc., which stress their 'Entertainment' content and sensationalise or exaggerate the <b>harder</b> <b>news</b> to promote sales. Unlike tabloid newspapers, the HKEJ features few graphics, with the print edition being primarily text. Advertisements or narrative-style news stories are not found on the front cover. As a result of this focus on content over style, the HKEJ does not enjoy sales figures as high as many other Hong Kong news publications.|$|R

[...] The protester was later named as Civic Party member Ken Tsang, who was {{also a member of the}} Election Committee that returned CY Leung as the city's Chief Executive. About 57 journalists expressed their dissatisfaction with the handling of the broadcast. A petition by TVB staff to management protesting the handling of the event was signed by news staff.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the patterns of}} influence between the news media and the public, by specifically targeting breaking stories, or shocks, to a news system. Specifically, we assess media agenda setting and selective exposure {{by looking at the}} relative public attention spans to <b>hard</b> and soft <b>news</b> (as measured by query volume), in comparison with the volume of news coverage (in print, broadcast, and Web content) for these selected news events. We measure the dynamic distribution of issue coverage in the news media, and how this volume of coverage ultimately influences online search traffic. In order to assess sustained interest in a given topic, distributions of query volume and news coverage were fit with Gamma distributions of appropriate parameters. Findings indicate that there are significant differences in the public attention spans for <b>hard</b> and soft <b>news</b> issues, particularly relative to what news coverage might predict. Soft news events produced a slower rate of decline in query volume, matching the slow tapering off of issue coverage found in Web content. Conversely, for <b>hard,</b> substantive <b>news</b> issues, query volume drops off quite quickly, more closely paralleling the distribution of coverage in broadcast news...|$|R

50|$|Following John Toye's departure, a major {{overhaul}} of Scotland Today saw the programme relaunched as a feature-led magazine programme on Monday 8 October 1984. New co-presenters Sheena McDonald and Haig Gordon presented on sofas {{as opposed to}} desks, with the main regional {{news of the day}} confined to short bulletins before and after the programme, co-presented from Glasgow and Edinburgh. The critics were harsh about the new format - one such newspaper critic described it as The Goon Show - it's Tom and Jerry time but there's not much to laugh at. The Independent Broadcasting Authority also criticised the changes to the programme, and in July 1986, the station's head of news David Scott announced Scotland Today would revert to a <b>harder</b> <b>news</b> format the following Autumn, promising in a newspaper: you won't see pot plants, sofas or sculptures - these are nothing but distractions. The new look programme, launched on Monday 20 October 1986, saw Haig Gordon replaced by former reporter Malcolm Wilson, while feature elements were moved to a new lunchtime programme, Live at One Thirty, which began a fortnight earlier.|$|R
