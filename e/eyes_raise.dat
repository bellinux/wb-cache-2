"I've got it," [...] he said, briskly; [...] "apologize humbly for {{all your}} candour, and I {{will give you a}} piece of {{information}} which shall brighten your dull <b>eyes,</b> <b>raise</b> the corners of your drooping mouth, and renew once more the pink and cream in your youthful cheeks." ...|$|E

40|$|Background and aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the light touch, vision and dual task interference on the surface electromyography (sEMG) activity of ankle muscles Participants: Thirty persons (12 male, 18 Female), right hand without any neuro-musculo-skeletal disorder and in healthy condition, participated in this study.   Methods and Materials: Participants stood in upright and semi tandem position. There was a high sensitivity sensor on the right side in direction of femur greater trochanter. They should press the sensor less than 50 gr. Also we examined the rate of activity in 3 muscles (Tibialis Anterior, Proneus Longuse, Soleuse) on both lower limbs by Biometrix sEMG device. 4 positions were experimented in semi tandem standing: No Touch, No Counting; No Touch, Counting; Light Touch, No Counting; Light Touch, Counting. Each of the above positions was tested in 2 conditions: Eyes Open, Eyes Closed.   Results: Our findings detect that light touch contact especially during vision, resulted in reducing the rate of sEMG activity in the leg postural muscles. No touch and closed <b>eyes,</b> <b>raise</b> the rate of sEMG activity to maximum. conclusion: On basis of findings, it seems that following skin receptors stimulation, some complicated mechanisms will be begun and in order to the orders of Central Nervous System (CNS), these muscles will make the hole body, stable. So it can reduce the entered pressure on leg postural muscles. Therefore we can see the lesser rate in sEMG activity of leg postural muscles...|$|E

60|$|She was {{standing}} now, and {{very close to}} him, his hands still held her elbows, though their touch was so light that she scarce felt it. To release them was easy, and the next second her hands were on his shoulders, her brave <b>eyes</b> <b>raised</b> to him.|$|R
60|$|At {{the exact}} moment that it began to catch fire, she opened her <b>eyes,</b> <b>raised</b> her hand and, with two dainty fingers, had taken the burning scrap of paper from the young man's hand. Then she blew out the flame, and held the paper to her nostril with perfect unconcern.|$|R

60|$|I saw the maid's tender <b>eyes</b> <b>raised</b> to my {{face with}} a look of great {{compassion}} and sweetness whilst I spoke. I observed the pressure which she put on his arm.

60|$|Spite of {{the rich}} deep colour that nature had {{bestowed}} on the Indian beauty, the tell-tale blood deepened on her cheeks, until the blush gave new animation and intelligence to her jet-black <b>eyes.</b> <b>Raising</b> a finger in an attitude of warning, she dropped her voice, already so soft and sweet, nearly to a whisper, as she continued the discourse.|$|R

60|$|We stood {{together}} in the same old-fashioned window at night, when the moon was shining; Agnes with her quiet <b>eyes</b> <b>raised</b> up to it; I following her glance. Long miles of road then opened out before my mind; and, toiling on, I saw a ragged way-worn boy, forsaken and neglected, who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine, his own.|$|R
