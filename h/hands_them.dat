With the assistance of P.E. teacher Larry Littlejunk, she manages to successfully trick Stuart into taking the pills, telling him that they are vitamins.|$|E

Tintin is saved when the machine workers go on strike and then apprehends the mobsters. In thanks, he is invited to a banquet in his honour, where he is kidnapped and thrown into Lake Michigan to drown. Tintin survives by floating to the surface, but gangsters posing as police capture him. He once again overwhelms them, and <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> over to the authorities.

5|$|In Macau, {{three men}} {{break into a}} house, shoot a French woman (Sylvie Testud) and kill {{her husband and two}} children. The woman's father, Francis Costello (Johnny Hallyday), arrives to visit his {{daughter}} who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai (Anthony Wong), Chu (Lam Ka-Tung) and Fat Lok (Lam Suet), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung (Simon Yam). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> a stack of euros and his watch, and asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. Before doing so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes their names on the pictures so that he will not forget who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used.|$|E

Rice, silver or gold is put {{in the hands of}} bridegroom, which he passes on to the bride. She places them in a winnowing fan, and <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> as a present to the wife of the barber. This ceremony is known as Karj Bharna. A man may have not more than three wives. The first wife is the head wife, and she inherits an additional one tenth of the husband's estate.|$|E
25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves the next day to catch a train.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} the battle, Vellaiyammal pleads with Vellaiyathevan not to {{go because}} the {{previous}} night she had a nightmare, which was full of evil omens.

500|$|The video {{starts with}} Rita Ora and her boyfriend, played by Michael Madsen, {{entering}} a diner. The man steps on and squishes a spider with his boot, just before Iggy Azalea is shown {{as a waitress}} named Fox behind the diner counter. Azalea then approaches the couple and <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> the menu. The man orders a BLT sandwich [...] "dripping with melted cheese" [...] and just when Ora is about to order he interrupts her by saying [...] "she's gonna have the same damn thing", which causes Ora {{to look at him}} somewhat upset. As Azalea arrives with the order, the man starts complaining about the sandwich and refuses to eat it. Then, the owner of the diner, Big Wanda, jumps over the counter and asks if there's a problem. After hearing the man's complaint, Azalea tries to explain but to no avail when the owner says [...] "What did the Fox say? Nothing!" [...] and she is told to make another sandwich with more cheese. Ora is shocked when the owner begins to flirt with her boyfriend in front of her, and her boyfriend ignores her because the owner promises him a [...] "big, juicy BLT sandwich" [...] that is the menu's special. When Ora tries to speak up, she is verbally put down by the owner, who says her special order is [...] "nothing like the little sandwich" [...] Ora has. Ora continues to show disapproval towards the situation.|$|E
500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated {{that a couple of}} sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up with}} new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 Edinburgh was {{administered}} by the single tier [...] "Edinburgh Corporation", which covered the [...] "City and Royal Burgh of Edinburgh". As such, the Edinburgh Corporation was responsible for local government services, such as the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways (which closed in 1956). The Edinburgh Corporation {{had the power to}} make 'Burgess' (freemen) of the City of Edinburgh and to grant [...] "Seals of Cause" [...] to Guilds and trade organisations. The Edinburgh Corporation awarded Burgess Ticket through the Lord Dean of Guild, an office in the Corporation. Like the Corporation of the City of London, Burgess Tickets were often awarded along with a 'Freedom Casket' - a container to hold the ticket. Bodies such as the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh and The High Constables of Edinburgh formed part of the corporation, contributing councilors and law enforcement officers. The Edinburgh Corporation had the power to institute these organisations via the granting of a [...] "Seal of Cause". This empowered the societies as [...] "a legal corporation with power to hold property, make its own by-laws and regulations". Other organisations to receive the [...] "Seal of Cause" [...] include The Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh, who received their seal on the 2nd July 1800. The history of the corporation lives on elsewhere around the city, for example {{in the name of the}} members of Muirfield golf club, who were granted a charter by the corporation in 1800 becoming [...] "The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers". Many of Edinburgh's ceremonies and traditions date back to the days of the Edinburgh Corporation, such as the Edinburgh Ceremony of the Keys, where the Lord Provost symbolically hands the keys to the City of Edinburgh to the monarch, who <b>hands</b> <b>them</b> back to the Lord Provost proclaiming [...] "that they cannot be placed in better hands than those of the Lord Provost and Councillors of my good City of Edinburgh".|$|E
