5|$|Just {{weeks after}} Letcher's inauguration, William Henry Harrison {{prevailed in the}} 1840 presidential election. Soon after, Harrison visited Letcher in Frankfort to discuss the {{appointment}} of Letcher's friend John J. Crittenden to Harrison's cabinet. On December 14, 1840, Letcher wrote Crittenden {{to tell him that}} the General Assembly would shortly re-elect him to his Senate seat. If he (Crittenden) were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a position in President Harrison's cabinet, Letcher would prefer he do it before March 4, 1841 so the General Assembly would still be in session to elect Crittenden's replacement in the Senate. On January 11, 1841, Crittenden replied that he expected to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher's preferred deadline. However, due to Harrison's death only a month after his inauguration, Crittenden was not able to keep Letcher's timeline; he was appointed attorney general by John Tyler on March 5, 1841.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 1919, the Senate {{unanimously}} passed Senator Thomas J. Walsh's Senate Resolution 439, {{expanding the}} Committee's investigations to include [...] "any efforts {{being made to}} propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia" [...] and [...] "any effort to incite {{the overthrow of the}} Government of this country". This decision followed months of sensational daily press coverage of revolutionary events abroad and Bolshevik meetings and events in the United States, which increased anti-radical public opinion. Reports that some of these meetings were attended by Congressmen caused further outrage. One meeting in particular, held at the Poli Theater in Washington, DC, was widely controversial because of a speech given by Albert Rhys Williams, a popular Congregationalist minister, who allegedly said, [...] "America sooner or later is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the Soviet Government." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to deflect the pressure, Carney and PRTEU {{contacted}} [...] Virginia congressman Howard W. Smith, {{who at the time}} was the Chair of the House Committee to Investigate Executive Agencies. Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC, quickly scheduled a hearing. In the meantime, the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order, and the PTC management told Ross that, given the union's position, the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either. [...] The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944. The hearing was inconclusive, with Ross reiterating the FEPC position, and the union representatives falling back on the [...] "customs clause" [...] and their claims about seniority issues. Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed: [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> them [...] as fellow workers. ... We are not going to work with them. If anybody believe it, let them try it". A petition, signed by 1776 workers, presented at the hearing, read: [...] "Gentlemen: We, the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co., refuse to work with Negroes as motormen, conductors, operators and station trainmen".|$|E

[...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end. There was so much drama surrounding the group, I think the music just got lost.

2500|$|A year later, {{after taking}} his third world championship, Senna {{explained}} to the press his actions {{of the previous year}} in Suzuka. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed by Jean-Marie Balestre after he had taken pole. Senna said that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> what he saw as unfair decision-making by Balestre, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990 (though some in the F1 paddock noted that the pole position at Suzuka was actually {{on the same side of}} the track it had been since F1 returned to Japan in 1987, and many privately wondered why Senna was suddenly making a fuss about it, considering he had been on pole there in both 1988 and 1989, when he was also fighting Prost for the championship). Senna stated that no matter what happened, he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost would later go on record criticising Senna's actions as [...] "disgusting", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident.|$|E

A second score was composed by Elmer Bernstein, but his music was {{set aside in}} lieu of the final score, composed by John Barry.

The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined. The parents' attorneys Pepper Hamilton stated that court records would show that they were entitled to more than $2 million, but were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> less than half that amount in recognition of the small size of the school district, and because the school board that voted for the policy had been voted out of office, leaving the new school board [...] "having the bill placed in their laps." [...] The previous school board had been defended without charge by the Thomas More Law Center. Richard Katskee, assistant legal director for Americans United, said of the trial's cost, [...] "Any board thinking of trying to do what the Dover board did is going to have to look for a bill in excess of $2 million," [...] and [...] "I think $2 million is a lot to explain to taxpayers for a lawsuit that should never be fought." ...|$|E
