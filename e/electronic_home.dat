5000|$|During {{the period}} from the 1940s through {{approximately}} the 1970s, a variety of more modest self-contained <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> organs {{from a variety of}} manufacturers were popular forms of home entertainment. These instruments were much influenced by the theatre organ in its style, and often these stops contained imitative voicings such as [...] "trumpet" [...] and [...] "marimba". In the 1950s-1970s, as technology progressed, they increasingly included automated features such as: ...|$|E

By this time, a number of multinational companies have set up assembly and manufacturing plants in the country. Local companies in joint collaboration with foreign companies have established assembly and manufacturing plants. At present {{the total number of}} such companies is more than sixty. Since 1994, after Bangladesh's integration into the free market agreement, all kinds of commodities including electronic products began to be imported freely, which created a competitive environment. By the 2000s, few local companies began to export locally manufactured <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> appliances abroad.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, most <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> organs {{were built}} in a {{configuration}} usually called a spinet organ, which first appeared in 1949. These compact and relatively inexpensive instruments became the natural successors to reed organs. They were marketed as competitors of home pianos and often aimed at would-be home organists who were already pianists (hence the name [...] "spinet", {{in the sense of}} a small upright piano). The instrument's design reflected this concept: the spinet organ physically resembled a piano, and it presented simplified controls and functions that were both less expensive to produce and less intimidating to learn. One feature of the spinet was automatic chord generation; with many models, the organist could produce an entire chord to accompany the melody merely by playing the tonic note, i.e., a single key, on a special section of the manual.|$|E

50|$|The old-time radio era, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Golden Age of Radio, was an era of radio programming in the United States during which radio was the dominant <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> entertainment medium. It began with the birth of commercial radio broadcasting in the early 1920s and lasted until the 1950s, when television superseded radio as the medium of choice for scripted programming. During this period radio was the only broadcast medium, and people regularly tuned into their favorite radio programs, and families gathered to listen to the home radio in the evening. According to a 1947 C. E. Hooper survey, 82 out of 100 Americans were found to be radio listeners. A variety of new entertainment formats and genres were created for the new medium, many of which later migrated to television: radio plays, mystery serials, soap operas, quiz shows, talent shows, variety hours, situation comedies, play-by-play sports, children's shows, cooking shows. Since this era, radio programming has shifted to a more narrow format of news, talk, sports and music.|$|E

Johnson recently defended {{one of the largest}} criminal cases to arise out of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, obtaining a settlement of nine separate felony prosecutions in exchange for a short jail sentence and <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> monitoring for his client. One judge called the case “unique in the history of California jurisprudence.” The case {{was the subject of a}} front page feature article in The Wall Street Journal.Representing a high school student in a child pornography trial, Johnson recently obtained a judgment of acquittal before the jury was selected.Johnson also obtained a dismissal for a young man from Lebanon who was accused of sexual assault. Johnson’s client, who was planning to marry his American fiancée, had been facing six years in State Prison followed by deportation back to the Middle East.Johnson was a prosecutor in the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office for 15 years. He prosecuted white collar crime as a member of the Consumer Fraud Unit. He was the County’s top narcotics prosecutor for three years during which his cases included the trial of the County’s first meth lab case, and a prosecution of a member of the Colombian Drug Cartel. He became a homicide prosecutor when one City in San Mateo County - East Palo Alto- was known as the “homicide capital of America” and often tried back-to-back homicide trials.|$|E

The basic premise of the research is that the culturally manufactured fear encourages the <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> security system industry, the presence of which can, in turn, exasperate one’s fear of the risk of falling victim to violent crime...|$|E

The findings obtained from the analysis of information (Data) regarding the dealers of durable <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> appliances are as follows: 1. Employees employed by dealers do not have adequate technical background while dealers have sound experience {{in the field of}} marketing and distribution. This is a strong point here. 2. Pricing system does not have any uniformity and rationale. Pricing system varies with the manufacturer, dealer or with the syndicate of dealer. This eventually affects the marketing of products. 3. Dealers guess the demand only through the customers and their choices/tastes/needs. 4. Manufacturers choose the dealers by appraising their financial status and this makes the market more monopolistic than competitive. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Despite many failures, <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> {{shopping}} with broadband interactive television and/or multi-media PCs is still {{believed to have}} attractive potential by many retailers, technology and communications firms around the world. Previous studies on <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> shopping suggest that good user interface with appropriate format of information display {{is key to the}} acceptance of the technology by potential users. This paper reports an empirical study which looked at different formats of product information display in an electronic supermarket shopping environment. Four prototypes with different combinations of text and pictures display were developed and evaluated in an experimental setting. The results suggest that pictures are more efficient to help the user complete the shopping task although having more pictures does not necessarily lead to correct purchase. Moreover, customers may have a different shopping behavior in the electronic environment from the traditional one in terms of frequency, day and time of the shopping, product items bought and factors for satisfied shopping...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} growth of <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> {{shopping}} in terms of likely transportation and communication interactions. Although opportunities exist to shop from home today, most consumers initiate travel trips to stores or markets. Widespread use of automobiles has facilitated the retailing configurations we know today but {{the development of new}} electronic networks could change this. This study establishes a baseline to explore shopping activities using two day travel activity data from a large U. S. metropolitan area. It is found that people who telework from home today spend more time engaged in shopping activities than other workers. Potentially, their saved work travel is converted into new trips. In the future, saved shopping travel might be converted into other types of travel, and modelling results show that for busy working women, there is a latent demand for maintenance related activities. The study results suggest that <b>electronic</b> <b>home</b> shopping will bring into play complex interactions between communications and transportation. ...|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to digital}} pianos or stage pianos, digital {{keyboards}} are usually much lower in cost, {{as they have}} unweighted keys. Like digital pianos, they usually feature on-board amplifiers and loudspeakers.
