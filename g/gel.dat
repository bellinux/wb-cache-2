5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a <b>gel</b> (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the <b>gel</b> to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane.

5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in <b>gel</b> electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D <b>gel</b> polyacrylamide <b>gel</b> electrophoresis.|$|E

The latter can be further classified into protein continuous, bicontinuous and coarse stranded microstructures. Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was used to evaluate sensory properties of the <b>gels.</b> The <b>gels</b> were subjected to large deformations by uniaxial compression. The microstructure affects the <b>gels</b> breakdown properties as well as serum release which occurred during compression of the <b>gels.</b> Protein continuous and bicontinuous <b>gels</b> fractured through the protein network.

Compared with azo-hydrogels {{which can be}} only degraded by reduction of the azo-groups, this study evaluates whether, in vitro, azo-polysaccharide <b>gels</b> can be degraded through both reduction of the azo-groups in the crosslinks as well as enzymatic break down of the polysaccharide backbone. The azo-polysaccharide <b>gels</b> were synthesized by radical crosslinking of a mixture of methacrylated inulin or methacrylated dextran and N,N'-bis(methacryloylamino) azobenzene (B(MA) AB) and were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis and swelling measurements. Azo-dextran <b>gels</b> could be obtained from methacrylated dextran having low degree of substitution but not from lowly substituted methacrylated inulin. Increasing the amount of B(MA) AB resulted in denser azo-inulin and azo-dextran networks.
