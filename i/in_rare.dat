5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> cases. Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with a silky luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> {{cases where}} {{none of the}} oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{can result}} from normal use.

5|$|Proposed {{mechanisms}} for {{the recognition of}} worker-laid eggs or active reproductive workers include marker hydrocarbons {{on the surface of}} queen-laid eggs, cuticle hydrocarbons on reproductive workers, and recognition of nest-mates. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> cases, worker-laid eggs carry mimicked queen hydrocarbons and escape policing, a condition known as the anarchic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II {{was named}} Nintendo Power best NES game of 1993 over Battletoads & Double Dragon and Kirby's Adventure.

5|$|There were {{no further}} Test matches before the First World War. The 1912–13 Australian season {{was a short}} one for Macartney, but he was <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> form, scoring 125, 96, 94, 76 not out, 91, 10 and 154 in four matches, to total 646 runs at 107.66. He also took four wickets at 30.50.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
25|$|In humans : gastroenteritis, {{urinary tract}} infections, and {{neonatal}} meningitis. <b>In</b> <b>rarer</b> cases, virulent strains are {{also responsible for}} hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicaemia and gram-negative pneumonia.|$|R

5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E

50|$|Not <b>Rare</b> <b>in</b> India. <b>Rare</b> or Very <b>Rare</b> <b>in</b> {{certain parts}} of its global range. This {{butterfly}} is seen chiefly during the monsoon, perhaps due to its larval host plants growing {{at this time of}} the year.|$|R
5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>rare</b> cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Rare {{invested}} in Silicon Graphics computers, which {{they used to}} prototype full computer-generated imagery rendering. Excited about this work, Nintendo purchased a quarter stake <b>in</b> <b>Rare,</b> which eventually expanded to 49%, and offered their cast of characters to the company. The Stampers chose Donkey Kong, and their resulting Donkey Kong Country (1994) was immensely successful: the second-best-selling game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Rare's success continued with the Killer Instinct fighting game series {{and a series of}} games for Nintendo's Nintendo 64 console in the mid- to late-1990s, including Banjo-Kazooie, Blast Corps, Diddy Kong Racing, and GoldenEye 007. The latter became the definitive first-person shooter of the era for home consoles.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and <b>in</b> <b>rare</b> situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. <b>In</b> <b>rare</b> cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
