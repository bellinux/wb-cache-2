50|$|In 1899, {{the year}} when Heaps took over the Ruskin mill, the Stave Lake Power Company was formed and {{subsequently}} obtained permission from the province to use {{the water of the}} river at the Stave Falls to generate electric power. It took more than a decade to make that a reality. Only in December 1911 did their successor, the Western Canada Power Company, see power starting to flow from the Stave <b>Dam</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|MDEA is less {{reactive}} towards CO2, but has an {{equilibrium loading}} capacity approaching 1 mole CO2 per mole amine. It also requires less energy to regenerate. To combine {{the advantages of}} MDEA and the smaller amines, MDEA is usually mixed with a catalytic promoter such as piperazine, PZ, or a fast reacting amine such as MEA to retain reactivity, but lower regeneration costs. Activated MDEA or aMDEA uses piperazine as a catalyst {{to increase the speed}} of the reaction with CO2. It has been commercially successful. Many tests have been conducted on the performance of MDEA/MEA or MDEA/Piperazine mixtures compared to single amines. CO2 production rates were higher than MEA for the same heat duty and total molar concentration when experiments were performed in the University of Regina pilot plant, which is a modeled after a natural gas plant. There were also insignificant trace amounts of degradation products detected. [...] However, when the same control variables and tests were conducted at the Boundary <b>Dam</b> <b>plant,</b> the CO2 production rate for the mixed solvent was lower than MEA. [...] This was a result of the reduction in the capacity of the solvent to absorb CO2 after degradation. Because the Boundary <b>Dam</b> <b>plant</b> is a coal-fired power plant, it operates under harsher environments and produces an impure flue gas containing, fly ash, SO2, and NO2 that are fed into carbon capture. Even with flue gas pretreatment, there is still enough to produce degradation products such as straight chain amines and sulfur compounds, which accumulate so it is no longer possible to regenerate MEA and MDEA. [...] For these blends to be successful in reducing heat duty, their chemical stabilities must be maintained.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Itaipu" [...] {{was taken}} from an isle that existed near the {{construction}} site. In the Guarani language, [...] means [...] "the sounding stone". The Itaipu Dam's hydroelectric power plant produced the most energy of any {{in the world as}} of 2016, setting a new world record of 103,098,366 megawatt hours (MWh), and surpassed the Three Gorges <b>Dam</b> <b>plant</b> in 2016 and 2015 in energy production. Completed in 1984, it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries, 15 km north of the Friendship Bridge. The project ranges from Foz do Iguaçu, in Brazil, and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, in the south to Guaíra and Salto del Guairá in the north. The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14 GW, with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 m. In 2016, the plant employed 3038 workers.|$|E
50|$|Major {{oxidative}} {{degradation products}} of MDEA include monoethanol amine (MEA), methyl-aminoethanol (MAE), diethanolamine (DEA), amino acids bicine, glycine and hydroxyethyl sarcosine (HES), formyl amides of MAE and DEA, ammonia, and stable salts formate, glycolate, acetate, and oxalate. In an industrial plan that utilizes MDEA, oxidative degradation {{is most likely}} to shift to the cross exchanger where temperatures are greater than 70 °C. Higher temperatures and higher CO2 loading accelerate the rate of degradation, resulting in an increase of alkalinity loss as well as total formate production. While MDEA is more resistant to degradation as a standalone compared to MEA, MDEA is preferentially degraded when in an MDEA/MEA blend. Because of the formation of DEA and MAE, which could form nitroso-compounds or diethylnitrosamine and diethylnitraine, the blend could potentially have an adverse impact in terms of atmospheric admissions. In the Boundary <b>Dam</b> <b>plant,</b> emissions increased when CO2 loading of lean amine increased for the blend and MEA. However, decreasing the lean loading increases the reboiler heat duty, which results in an obvious tradeoff between emissions and heat duty or energy costs.|$|E

The readings of these instruments generate time series of data on many occasions have correlation. Each project of a <b>dam</b> <b>plant</b> has characteristics that make it unique. Faced with the need to establish statistical control limits for the instrumentation data, this article makes an approach to multivariate statistical analysis and proposes a model that uses principal components control charts and statistical and to explain variability and establish a method of monitoring to control future observations. An application for section E of the Itaipu hydroelectric plant is performed to validate the model. The results show that the method used is appropriate and can help identify the type of outliers, reducing false alarms and reveal instruments that have higher contribution to the variability...|$|E
