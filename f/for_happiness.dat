5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as <b>for</b> <b>happiness</b> and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive <b>for</b> <b>happiness,</b> virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

Thomas Aquinas' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged {{the validity of the}} question about God's existence. Frederick Copleston, however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as John of Damascus, who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire <b>for</b> <b>happiness.</b> Thomas stated that although there is desire <b>for</b> <b>happiness</b> which forms the basis for a proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required to understand that this desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.|$|E

25|$|In Russia before World War I the {{swastika}} was {{a favorite}} sign of the last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. She placed it where she could <b>for</b> <b>happiness,</b> including drawing it in pencil {{on the walls and}} windows in the Ipatiev House - place of execution of the royal family, and, without dating, on the wallpaper above the bed, where obviously slept the heir. It was printed on some banknotes of the Russian Provisional Government (1917) and some sovznaks (1918-1922). In 1919 it was approved as insignia for the Kalmyk formations, and for a short period had a certain popularity amongst some artists, politics and army groups. Also it was present on icons, vestments and clerical clothing but in World War II it was removed, becoming by association, a symbol of the German occupation.|$|E
25|$|Frank and Lillian Gilbreth {{often used}} their large family (and Frank himself) as guinea pigs in experiments. Their family {{exploits}} are lovingly detailed in the 1948 book Cheaper by the Dozen, written by son Frank Jr. and daughter Ernestine (Ernestine Gilbreth Carey). The book inspired two {{films of the}} same name. The first, in 1950, starred Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy. The second, in 2003, starred comedians Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, and bears no resemblance to the book, except that it features a family with twelve children, and the wife's maiden name is Gilbreth. A 1952 sequel titled Belles on Their Toes chronicled the adventures of the Gilbreth family after Frank's 1924 death. A later biography of his parents, Time Out <b>For</b> <b>Happiness,</b> was written by Frank Jr. alone in 1962.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the level of concern <b>for</b> the <b>happiness</b> of others among a sample of 13 - to 15 -year-old adolescents in England (N= 3, 095) and to test the theory that concern <b>for</b> the <b>happiness</b> of others occupies a different psychological space (within Eysenck’s three dimensional model of personality) from the space occupied by personal happiness. The data demonstrated a high level of concern <b>for</b> the <b>happiness</b> of others, with 84 % of the adolescents saying that, ‘It is important to me to make other people happy’. While high levels of personal happiness are generally shown to be associated with low neuroticism and high extraversion (stable extraversion), these data demonstrated high levels of concern <b>for</b> the <b>happiness</b> of others tend to be associated with high neuroticism, high extraversion, high social conformity, and low psychoticism...|$|R

25|$|Novels such as Triton and the thousand-plus pages {{making up}} his four-volume Return to Nevèrÿon series {{explored}} in detail how sexuality and sexual attitudes {{relate to the}} socioeconomic underpinnings of a primitive– or, in Tritons case, futuristic– society. Even in works with no science fiction or fantasy content to speak of, such as Atlantis: Three Tales, The Mad Man, and Hogg, Delany pursued these questions by creating vivid pictures of New York City, now in the Jazz Age, now {{in the first decade}} of the AIDS epidemic, private schools in the 1950s, Greece and Europe in the 1960s, and– in Hogg– generalized small-town America. Phallos details the quest <b>for</b> <b>happiness</b> and security by a gay man from the island of Syracuse in the second-century reign of the Emperor Hadrian. Dark Reflections is a contemporary novel, dealing with themes of repression, old age, and the writer's unrewarded life.|$|E
25|$|The fair {{was also}} a showplace for {{independent}} films. One of the most noted was a religious film titled Parable, which showed at the Protestant Pavilion. It depicted humanity as a traveling circus and Christ as a clown. This {{marked the beginning of}} a new depiction of Jesus, and was the inspiration for the musical Godspell. Parable later went on to be honored at Cannes, as well as the Edinburgh Film Festival and Venice Film Festival. Another religious film was presented by the evangelist Billy Graham (who had sponsored his own pavilion) called Man in the 5th Dimension, which was shot in the 70mm Todd-AO widescreen process for exclusive presentation in a specially designed theater equipped with audio equipment that enabled viewers to listen to the film in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The 13 and one-half minute film Man's Search <b>for</b> <b>Happiness</b> was made for the Mormon Pavilion and was shown within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for decades.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} the morality built upon the basis of Hartmann's philosophy is the realization that all is one and that, while every attempt to gain happiness is illusory, yet before deliverance is possible, all forms of the illusion must appear and be tried to the utmost. Even he who recognizes the vanity of life best serves the highest aims by giving himself up to the illusion, and living as eagerly as if he thought life good. It is only through the constant attempt to gain happiness that people can learn the desirability of nothingness; and when this knowledge has become universal, or at least general, deliverance will come and the world will cease. No better proof of the rational nature {{of the universe is}} needed than that afforded by the different ways in which men have hoped to find happiness and so have been led unconsciously to work for the final goal. The first of these is the hope of good in the present, the confidence in the pleasures of this world, such as was felt by the Greeks. This is followed by the Christian transference of happiness to another and better life, to which in turn succeeds the illusion that looks <b>for</b> <b>happiness</b> in progress, and dreams of a future made worth while by the achievements of science. All alike are empty promises, and known as such in the final stage, which sees all human desires as equally vain and the only good in the peace of Nirvana.|$|E

The next track, named [...] "The Rich, The Strong and The Poor", tells the story of three men looking <b>for</b> <b>happiness.</b> The first tries to find it in money, but he returns unfulfilled. The second tries looking <b>for</b> <b>happiness</b> in physical strength. He believes that if he proves himself, that he will find peace. Like the first man, he ends up unfulfilled. The final man looks <b>for</b> <b>happiness</b> in basic life needs and likewise ends up in the same position as the first two men. Bawinkel explains that, [...] "all three are very much in the same position in that happiness hasn’t been found in chasing these various desires.
