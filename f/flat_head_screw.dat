The {{following}} year, he introduced his Ball Chair, a hollow sphere on a stand, open on one side to allow a person to sit within. The similar Bubble Chair was clear and suspended from above. Other innovative designs included his Pastil Chair (a beanbag-like molded armchair), and Tomato Chair (a seat molded between three supporting spheres). His Screw Table, as the name suggests, had {{the appearance of a}} <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> driven into the ground. He was awarded the American Industrial Design award in 1968.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{baseline}} non-contacting finger seal is a NASA patented design. The primary {{difference between}} it and Gul Aroras design patented by AlliedSignal {{is that there are}} no lift pads on the high pressure fingers. The baseline non-contacting finger seal is comprised of a back plate, aft spacer, aft (or low pressure) finger element, forward (or high pressure) finger element, forward spacer, and front plate. The components are held together with 20 <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> A typical seal would have a back plate of approximately the same thickness as the front plate and would be riveted together. The thicker back plate allows use of threaded fasteners so that different finger elements can be tested without having to replace all the individual seal components. The finger elements are essentially washers made of thin sheet stock with multiple curved slots machined around the inner diameter to form the fingers. They are clocked so that the fingers of one cover the slots of the other. The aft finger element fingers have axial extensions or "lift pads" at the seal id that are concentric to the rotor. The fingers act as cantilever beams and flex in response to rotor dynamic motion and radial growth of the rotor due to centrifugal or thermal forces...|$|R
40|$|The CB- 4 is {{designed}} as a connection point between a Watchman portable data collector and permanently installed transducers. Up to 12 transducers in four locations are supported. Permanently mounted transducers are typically used in places where the technician {{is not able to}} easily access the machine due to safety or other considerations. This application note covers installation and use of the CB- 4 remote sensor connection box. Each terminal strip of the CB- 4 represents a triaxial test location that is identified by the bar-code on the front panel. Setting up the test location in the EAV software is exactly the same as if the test location were accessible. Care must be taken in connecting the wires between the transducers and the CB- 4 to ensure orientation of the three axes are correctly defined in the software. Assembly and Mounting 1.

5000|$|Sheet metal screws (sometimes called [...] "sheet-metal self-tappers", or P-K screws {{from the}} brand name Parker Kalon - who pioneered the {{manufacture}} of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of self-tapping screw despite the thread created in the sheet of metal being small.

30|$|Although the {{reduction}} in RTVs was observed after mechanical cyclic loading, no screw loosening occurred after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading, which it assumed represents 3 [*]years of function in worse scenario setting according to ISO 14801 in vivo [23]. Our study presents similar results to those of Binon and McHugh, who reported that the 30 -N-cm insertion torque can maintain screw-joint stability in 3 [*]years of simulated function [34]. The reduction of screw preload after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading was 42.74 %. This {{is considered to be}} relatively low and might be because of the implant-abutment connection design [39]. The eccentric force has little effect on the screw preload under functional loading because the contacting part of the cone connection helps to provide frictional resistance and mechanical stability [7, 8]. Moreover, the Octatorx lobular anti-rotational design help produce little micromovement in the joint system under load [9]. The screw design also has an effect on the screw preload [39]. Paepoemsin et al. [31] found that the retaining tapered screws of their implants maintained higher preload efficiency than did the <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> of the implants before and after cyclic loading (P[*]<[*] 0.05). In our study, RTVs were constant from 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. This result is not in agreement with those of Khraisat et al. [40], who concluded that 1, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading significantly affected the RTVs of CeraOne abutment external hex implants compared with 500, 000 [*]cycles of loading. This might be because different types of implant-abutment connections were used. In external connections, implant-abutment stability is obtained primarily by the tension of the screws [4]. Therefore, the screw preload in external connections is affected by the cyclic loading more than in internal connections.|$|R
30|$|In {{both groups}} the {{patients}} received, a single prophylactic dose of antibiotics. All LSC were performed {{by two of}} the authors together (RW and GM) using bone anchor fixation [16]. The operative procedure can be summarized as follows: after developing the presacral avascular plane, the cortical bone of the sacral segment 3 is penetrated in the midline with the laparoscopic bone anchor. Fixation to the sacrum is performed with a selftapping titanium Corkscrew Suture or with <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> titanium <b>screws.</b> A 4.0 [*]× 3.0 -cm piece of monofilament knitted polypropylene mesh (Gynemesh Soft, Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) was sutured to the apical part of the posterior vaginal wall with four mersilene 1 – 0 sutures (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) and was subsequently sutured to the polyester- 2 ligatures attached to the bone anchor. The mesh was covered with peritoneum placing it in a retroperitoneal position. Since the rate of vaginal mesh exposure is significantly higher when abdominal surgery is combined with vaginal surgery [17] and placement of a posterior mesh might increase the risk of postoperative complications in patients without a patent posterior prolapse [18], additional prolapse procedures were not performed concomitantly. We anticipated on a low rate of postoperative cystocele and rectocele since fixation of the vaginal apex to sacral segment 3 restores the natural axis of the vagina [19 – 21].|$|R
50|$|Persons {{wishing to}} make {{adjustments}} to the Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism must become familiar {{not only with the}} use of the dual-sided nut (that fits in the hole in the front of the receiver) but also how that nut is locked in-place (so that it will not accidentally turn once it has been set as desired). What appears to be a <b>flat</b> blade <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> on the right side of the Model 241's receiver, that can easily be mistaken as a screw to lock the dual-sided nut in place, is actually a cosmetic affectation on what has sometimes been described as a 'slug' (instead of having threads on its sides as would a screw it has smooth sides). While the slug does indeed press (inside the receiver) against the outside of the dual-sided nut (and thus keeps the dual-sided nut from rotating) it does not have its pressure against the outside of the dual-sided nut adjusted by rotating (as it would were it a screw) but instead the slug is held pressing against the outside of the dual-sided nut by first being simply pushed against the outside of the dual-sided nut (by pressing down on the slug's <b>flat</b> blade <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> appearance on the right side of the receiver) and then a screw (the actual locking-screw) presses against the side of the slug (inside the receiver) and thus prevents it from moving. That locking-screw is oriented such that it comes in (to press against the side of the slug) from the direction of the front face of the receiver (and so is only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver).|$|R
