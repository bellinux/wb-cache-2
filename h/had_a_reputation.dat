5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reputation</b> for batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been}} for the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler.

By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
