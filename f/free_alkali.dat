The specimens were carbonated for 540 h in an environmental chamber with a CO 2 concentration of 1. 0 ± 0. 2 %, {{a temperature of}} 20 ± 2 ºC, and relative humidity of 65 ± 5 %. Accelerated carbonation led to decalcification of the main binding phase of these cements, which is an aluminium substituted calcium silicate hydrate (C-(N-) A-S-H) type gel, and the consequent formation of calcium carbonate. The sodium-rich carbonates trona (Na 2 CO 3 ·NaHCO 3 · 2 H 2 O) and gaylussite (Na 2 Ca(CO 3) 2 · 5 H 2 O) were identified in cements containing up to 10 wt. % MK as carbonation products.

40|$|With {{demand for}} primary energy {{continuously}} growing, search for renewable and efficient energy sources has been high on agenda of our society. One {{of the most}} promising energy sources is biogas technology. Residues coming from dairy industry and milk processing could be used in biogas production; however, low efficiency and high cost impede wide application of such technology. One of the main problems is management and conversion of organic residues through the anaerobic digestion process which is characterized by acidic environment due to the low whey pH (< 6) whereas additional pH control system is required. Low buffering capacity of whey is responsible for the rapid acidification in biological treatments; therefore alkali activated material is a promising solution of this problem. Alkali activated material is formed using SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 rich materials under highly alkaline solution. After material structure forming process is completed, <b>free</b> <b>alkalis</b> remain in the structure of materials which are available for leaching and could provide buffer capacity potential.

A fragment ion at m/z = 146 with a molecular weight of 460 and other fragment ions at m/z = 187, 121, 400 and 428 indicated endo-maleopimaric tri methyl ester.

40|$|The kinetic {{aspects of}} batch melting related to grain size, primary melt formation, gas liberation, and quartz {{dissolution}} {{can only be}} characterized by performing laboratory experiments, whereas the thermodynamic aspects can be quantified theoretically. One approach {{to close the gap}} between laboratory and industrial practice is scaling up experiments from the milligram to the kilogram range. In the micro scale (less than 150 mg sample), physical and chemical reactions of one component, as well as binary and ternary systems, can be observed through the differential thermal analysis (DTA), coupled with the thermo-gravimetry instrument (TG). Experiments at the mesoscale are: thermal-optical observations (30 g batch), conductometry (200 g batch), modified batch-free time (50 g batch and 250 g cullet), and kilogram 10 kg tests in which 4 kg batch and 7 kg cullet are involved. The present study aims to investigate whether these methods could be applied to <b>free</b> <b>alkali</b> and B 2 O 3 containing glass batches. The investigated system were the eutectic CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CAS) and CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CMAS) based E-glass combined with various B 2 O 3 content. The onset of melting or primary melt formation in <b>free</b> <b>alkali</b> glass batches is generated by its eutectic melting, while in soda-lime-silica batch, the onset of melting corresponds to physical melting of soda ash. The last part of the present paper is feasibility study of alternative B 2 O 3 carriers applied in boron containing glass batches. Conventional borax pentahydrate is one of the substance in the list of SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) under EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemical substances) regulation. For borosilicate batches, no significant impact is observed between the conventional and alternative B 2 O 3 carrier. Ulexite as alternative B 2 O 3 carrier shows kinetic advantages in E-glass and insulation wool glass in terms of early onset of melting and short foaming decay, respectively. However, these advantages could not be seen during industrial trial in insulation wool glass melter tank, due to insufficient ulexite data.

40|$|The pH {{control in}} biotechnological {{processes}} like anaerobic digestion {{is one of}} the key factors to ensure high efficiency in the biogas production process. The decrease of pH level in the digestion process occurs due to the rapid acid formation during metabolic processes of bacteria which leads to the inhibition of the methane producing bacteria; therefore further digestion process is limited. The efficiency of anaerobic digestion reactor decreases dramatically if the pH level falls under pH 6. 6. This problem is common for single-stage continuous digesters with a high organic solid content; therefore the active pH controlling method is commonly used. By creating inorganic alkaline material, the passive pH controlling system could be created. Soluble alkalis are enclosed in the matrix of material during the activation process thus providing slow leaching of <b>free</b> <b>alkalis</b> from the material structure in water medium and ensuring pH increase. In this research a porous alkaline composite material was developed as a pH controlling agent for the biogas production. Two mixture compositions with a different Si/Al and Si/Na ratio were created. The effect of particle size of the material was investigated in order to provide different leaching rates for the described material. Granular material with particle fractions 1 / 2 mm, 2 / 4 mm and 4 / 8 mm and a cubical specimen with dimensions 20 × 20 × 20 mm were tested. The pH level of water medium increased up to pH 11. 6 during the first day and final pH value decreased to 7. 8 after 20 -day leaching. Alkali leaching can be increased by 19 - 32 % changing the mixture composition by adding glass powder to the alkaline material. The particle size factor was negligible for leaching rate of alkaline material due to the high porosity of material. Research results show that this composite material has a potential to be applied in pH control for biotechnological purposes. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
