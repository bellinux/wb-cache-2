5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ball did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on {{the head}} could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E

The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E

5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> player {{wishes to}} take over a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat.
