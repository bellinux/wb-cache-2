40|$|We report {{simultaneous}} X-ray {{and infrared}} (IR) {{observations of the}} Galactic microquasar GRS 1915 + 105 using XTE and the Palomar 200 -inch telescope on August 13 - 15, 1997 UTC. During the last two nights, the microquasar GRS 1915 + 105 exhibited quasi-regular X-ray/infrared (IR) flares with a spacing of ∼ 30 minutes. While the physical mechanism triggering the flares is currently unknown, the one-to-one correspondence and consistent time offset between the X-ray and IR flares establish a close link between the two. At late times in the flares the X-ray and IR bands appear to "decouple", with the X-ray band showing large-amplitude fast oscillations while the IR shows a much smoother, more symmetrical decline. In at least three cases, the <b>IR</b> <b>flare</b> has returned to near its minimum while the X-rays continue in the elevated oscillatory state, ruling out thermal reprocessing of the X-ray flux {{as the source of}} <b>IR</b> <b>flare.</b> Furthermore, observations of similar IR and radio flares by Fender et al. (1997) imply that the source of the IR flux in such flares is synchrotron emission. The common rise and subsequent decoupling of the X-ray and IR flux and probable synchrotron origin of the IR emission is consistent with a scenario wherein the IR flux originates in a relativistic plasma which has been ejected from the inner accretion disk. In that case, these simultaneous X-ray/IR flares from a black-hole/relativistic-jet system are the first clear observational evidence linking of the time-dependent interaction of the jet and the inner disk in decades of quasar and microquasar studies.

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, a number of observing campaigns of the massive black hole Sgr A* {{has been carried out}} in order to address two {{important}} issues: one concerns the underluminous nature of Sgr A* with its bolometric luminosity being several orders of magnitude less than those of its more massive counterparts. It turns out that the angular momentum of the ionized stellar winds from orbiting stars in one or two disks orbiting Sgr A* could be a critical factor in estimating accurately the accretion rate unto Sgr A*. A net angular momentum of ionized gas feeding Sgr A* could lower the Bondi rate. Furthermore, the recent time delay picture of the peak flare emission can be understood in the context of adiabatic expansion of hot plasma. The expansion speed of the plasma is estimated to be sub-relativistic. However, relativistic bulk motion of the plasma could lead to outflow from Sgr A*. Significant outflow from Sgr A* could then act as a feedback which could then reduce Bondi accretion rate. These uncertain factors can in part explain the underluminous nature of Sgr A*. The other issue is related to the emission mechanism and the cause of flare activity in different wavelength bands. Modeling of X-ray and near-IR flares suggests that inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of <b>IR</b> <b>flare</b> photons by the energetic electrons responsible for the submm emission can account for the X-ray flares. A time delay of minutes to tens of minutes is predicted between the peak flaring in the near-IR and X-rays, NOT due to adiabatic expansion of optically thick hot plasma, but to the time taken for <b>IR</b> <b>flare</b> photons to cross the accretion flow before being upscattered.

These flares are associated with X-ray soft-dip/soft-flare cycles, {{as opposed to the}} brighter <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> associated with X-ray hard-dip/soft-flare cycles seen in August 1997 by Eikenberry et al. (1998). Interestingly, the <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> begin before the X-ray oscillations, implying an "outside-in" origin of the IR/X-ray cycle. We also show that the quasi-steady IR excess in August 1997 is due to the pile-up of similar faint flares.

40|$|Significant X-ray {{variability}} and flaring {{has been}} observed from Sgr A* but is poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations that take into account a population of non-thermal electrons with energy distributions and injection rates that are motivated by PIC simulations of magnetic reconnection. We explore the effects of including these non-thermal electrons on the predicted broadband variability of Sgr A* and find that X-ray variability is a generic result of localizing non-thermal electrons to highly magnetized regions, where particles {{are likely to be}} accelerated via magnetic reconnection. The proximity of these high-field regions to the event horizon forms a natural connection between IR and X-ray variability and accounts for the rapid timescales associated with the X-ray flares. The qualitative nature of this variability is consistent with observations, producing X-ray flares that are always coincident with <b>IR</b> <b>flares,</b> but not vice versa, i. e., {{there are a number of}} <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> without X-ray counterparts...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports {{measurements}} of Sgr A* made with NACO in L' -band (3. 80 um), Ks-band (2. 12 um) and H-band (1. 66 um) and with VISIR in N-band (11. 88 um) at the ESO VLT, {{as well as}} with XMM-Newton at X-ray (2 - 10 keV) wavelengths. On 4 April, 2007, a very bright flare was observed from Sgr A* simultaneously at L'-band and X-ray wavelengths. No emission was detected using VISIR. The resulting SED has a blue slope (beta > 0 for nuL_nu ~ nu^beta, consistent with nuL_nu ~ nu^ 0. 4) between 12 micron and 3. 8 micron. For the first time our high quality data allow a detailed comparison of infrared and X-ray light curves with a resolution of a few minutes. The IR and X-ray flares are simultaneous to within 3 minutes. However the <b>IR</b> <b>flare</b> lasts significantly longer than the X-ray flare (both before and after the X-ray peak) and prominent substructures in the 3. 8 micron light curve are clearly not seen in the X-ray data. From the shortest timescale variations in the L'-band lightcurve we find that the flaring region must be no more than 1. 2 R_S in size. The high X-ray to infrared flux ratio, blue nuL_nu slope MIR to L' -band, and the soft nuL_nu spectral index of the X-ray flare together place strong constraints on possible flare emission mechanisms. We find that it is quantitatively difficult to explain this bright X-ray flare with inverse Compton processes. A synchrotron emission scenario from an electron distribution with a cooling break is a more viable scenario. Comment: ApJ, 49 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the radiative properties of Sagittarius A* [...] spectral energy distribution, variability, and radio-infrared images [...] using the first 3 D, physically motivated black hole accretion models that directly evolve the electron thermodynamics in general relativistic MHD simulations. These models reproduce the coupled disc-jet {{structure for the}} emission favored by previous phenomenological analytic and numerical works. More specifically, {{we find that the}} low frequency radio emission is dominated by emission from a polar outflow while the emission above 100 GHz is dominated by the inner region of the accretion disc. The latter produces time variable near infrared (NIR) and X-ray emission, with frequent <b>flaring</b> events (including <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> without corresponding X-ray <b>flares</b> and <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> with weak X-ray flares). The photon ring is clearly visible at 230 GHz and 2 microns, which is encouraging for future horizon-scale observations. We also show that anisotropic electron thermal conduction along magnetic field lines has a negligible effect on the radiative properties of our model. We conclude by noting limitations of our current generation of first-principles models, particularly that the outflow is closer to adiabatic than isothermal and thus underpredicts the low frequency radio emission.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{variability}} properties of long, high cadence GRMHD simulations across {{the electromagnetic spectrum}} using an efficient, GPU-based radiative transfer algorithm. We focus on both disk- and jet-dominated simulations with parameters that successfully reproduce the time-averaged spectral properties of Sgr A* {{and the size of}} its image at 1. 3 mm. We find that the disk-dominated models produce short timescale variability with amplitudes and power spectra that closely resemble those inferred observationally. In contrast, jet-dominated models generate only slow variability, at lower flux levels. Neither set of models show any X-ray flares, which most likely indicate that additional physics, such as particle acceleration mechanisms, need to be incorporated into the GRMHD simulations to account for them. The disk-dominated models show strong, short-lived mm/IR flares, with short (<~ 1 hr) time lags between the mm and IR wavelengths, that arise from strong-field gravitational lensing of magnetic flux tubes near the horizon. Such events provide a natural explanation for the observed <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> with no X-ray counterparts. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Leibowitz 2017) I {{have shown that}} the 39 large X-ray flares of Sgr A* that were {{recorded}} by Chandra observatory in the year 2012, are concentrated preferably around tick marks of an equi-distance grid on the time axis. The period of this grid as found in L 1 is 0. 1033 days. In this work I show that the effect can be found among all the large X-ray flares recoded by Chandra and XMM-Newton along 15 years. The midpoints of all the 71 large flares recorded between the years 2000 and 2014 are also tightly grouped around tick marks of a grid with this period, or more likely, 0. 1032 day. This result is obtained with a confidence level of at least 3. 27 σ and very likely of 4. 62 σ. I find also a possible hint that a similar grid is underlying <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> of the object. I suggest that the pacemaker in the occurrences of the large X-ray flares of Sgr A* is a mass of the order of a low mass star or a small planet, in a slightly eccentric Keplerian orbit around the SMBH at the centre of the Galaxy.

40|$|The Galactic Central {{black hole}} Sgr A * {{exhibits}} outbursts of radiation in the near-infrared (so-called <b>IR</b> <b>flares).</b> One model {{of these events}} consists in a hotspot orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the hole. These outbursts {{can be used as}} a probe of the central gravitational potential. One main scientific goal of the second-generation VLTI instrument GRAVITY is to observe these flares astrometrically. Here, the astrometric precision of GRAV-ITY is investigated in the imaging mode, which consists in analysing the image computed from the interferometric data. The capability of the instrument to put in light the motion of a hotspot orbiting on the ISCO of our central black hole is then discussed. We find that GRAVITY’s astrometric precision for a single star in the imaging mode is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of Sgr A*. The instrument can also demonstrate that a body orbiting on the last stable orbit of the black hole is indeed moving. It yields a typical size of the orbit, if the source is as bright as mK = 14. These results show that GRAVITY allows one to study the close environment of Sgr A*. Having access to the ISCO of the central massive black hole probably allows constraining general relativity in its strong regime. Moreover, if the hotspot model is appropriate, the black hole spin can be constrained. Key words: black hole physics – instrumentation: interferometers – astrometry – Galaxy: centre...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the nature of flare emission from Sgr A* during multi-wavelength observations of this source {{that took place in}} 2004, 2005 and 2006. We present evidence for dimming of submm and radio flux during the peak of near-IR flares. This suggests that the variability of Sgr A* across its wavelength spectrum is phenomenologically related. The model explaining this new behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically cooling plasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background quiescent emission from Sgr A*. When a flare is launched, the plasma blob is most compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emission in radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. Absorption in the observed light curve of Sgr A* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects of lower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescent brightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. This implies that plasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow or further out in the flow. The depth of the absorption being larger in submm than in radio wavelengths implies that the intrinsic size of the quiescent emission increases with increasing wavelength which is consistent with previous size measurements of Sgr A*. Lastly, we believe that occultation of the quiescent emission of Sgr A* at radio/submm by <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> {{can be used as a}} powerful tool to identify flare activity at its earliest phase of its evolution.

40|$|We present {{cross-correlation}} {{analyses of}} simultaneous X-ray and near-infrared (near-IR) {{observations of the}} microquasar GRS 1915 + 105 during relativistic jet-producing epochs (X-ray class α and β). While previous studies have linked the large-amplitude <b>IR</b> <b>flares</b> and X-ray behaviors to jet formation in these states, our new analyses are sensitive to much lower-amplitude IR variability, providing more sensitive probes of the jet formation process. The X-ray to IR cross-correlation function (CCF) shows significant correlations which vary in form between the different X-ray states. During low/hard dips in both classes, we find no significant X-ray/IR correlation. During high-variability epochs, we find consistently significant correlations in both α and β classes, but with strong differences in the CCF structure. The high-variability α CCF shows strong anti-correlation between X-ray/IR, with the X-ray preceding the IR by ∼ 13 ± 2 s. The high-variability β state shows time-variable CCF structure, which is statistically significant but without a clearly consistent lag. Our simulated IR light curves, designed to match the observed CCFs, show variably-flickering IR emission during the class β high-variability epoch, while the class α can be fit by IR flickering with frequencies in the range 0. 1 to 0. 3 Hz, strengthening ∼ 10 s after every X-ray subflare. We interpret these features {{in the context of}} the X-ray-emitting accretion disk and IR emission from relativistic jet formation in GRS 1915 + 105, concluding that the CCF analysis places the origin in a synchrotron-emitting relativistic compact jet at a distance from the compact object of ∼ 0. 02 AU.

All investigated samples satisfied the combustion properties as well as the spectral requirements. The comparison of the two binders containing the same oxidizer shows that GAP always provides better spectral results than HTPB, while the tested dinitramide oxidizers do not have great advantages compared to AP.

Recent missiles equipped with modern seeker technology are able to distinguish between target and decoy flares evaluating spectroscopic emission. So advanced decoy flares have to be adapted to the thermal and spectral emissivity of the platform to be protected. Conventional MTV decoy flares emit a continuous IR spectrum, whereas the exhaust plume of a jet gives distinct band signatures {{of carbon dioxide and}} water. In [1] an approach called “pyro-organic flares” was introduced including the idea to combine hydrocarbon combustion to settle spectral requirements and pyrotechnic mixtures to increase the radiation intensity. In recent developments HTPB bonded samples including AP as oxidizer and different pyrotechnical mixtures were prepared and tested with regard to potential use as a spectral flare. Two thermite mixtures and a titanium/graphite mixture were used. Lab-scale combustion experiments were performed once in free atmosphere at normal pressure, and in a vessel at reduced air pressure of 10 to 100 kPa that covers the complete profile of potential application.

Flux calculations of a flared disk in vacuum {{can be considered a}} special case of the more general family of models in which the disk is imbedded in an optically thin halo. In the absence of such halo, flux measurements can never rule out its existence because the disk flaring surface defines a mathematically equivalent halo that produces the exact same flux at all IR wavelengths. When a flared disk with height H at its outer radius R is imbedded in a halo whose optical depth at visual wavelengths is τhalo, the system IR flux is dominated by the halo whenever τhalo > (1 / 4) H/R. Even when its optical depth is much smaller, the halo can still {{have a significant effect on}} the disk temperature profile. Imaging is the only way to rule out the existence of a potential halo, and we identify a decisive test that extracts a signature unique to flared disks from imaging observations.

40|$|Recent {{infrared}} (IR) {{observations of}} the center of our Galaxy indicate that the supermassive black hole source Sgr A* is strongly variable in the IR. The timescale for the variability, ∼ 30 min, is comparable to that of the X-ray flares observed by Chandra and XMM, suggesting a common physical origin. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the IR emission in the context of models recently proposed to interpret the X-ray flares. We show that the IR emission in Sgr A* can be well explained by nonthermal synchrotron emission if {{a small fraction of the}} electrons in the innermost region of the accretion flow around the black hole are accelerated into a broken power-law distribution, perhaps due to transient events such as magnetic reconnection. The model predicts differences in the variability amplitudes of <b>flares</b> in the <b>IR</b> and X-rays, in general agreement with observations. It also predicts that the IR emission should be linearly polarized, as has indeed been observed during one epoch. <b>IR</b> and X-ray <b>flares</b> analogous to those observed in Sgr A* may be detectable from other accreting SMBHs, provided L 10 ^- 8 L_EDD; at higher luminosities the flaring emission is dominated by thermal synchrotron-self Compton emission, which is likely to be less variable.

The flare emissions, the first simultaneous observations in two mid-infrared bands at 5 μm and 8 μm with white-light and hard X-ray coverage, revealed impulsive time variability with increases on time scales of ∼ 4 s followed by exponential decay at ∼ 10 s in two bright regions separated by about 13 ". The brightest source is compact, unresolved spatially at the diffraction limit (1. 3 " at 5 μm). We identify the <b>IR</b> sources as <b>flare</b> ribbons also seen in white-light emission at 6173 Å observed by SDO/HMI, with twin hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI, and with EUV sources (e. g., 94 Å) observed by SDO/AIA.

The observations suggest that the IR emission is optically thin, this constraint and others suggest major contributions from a density less than about 3 × 10 ^ 13 cm^- 3.
