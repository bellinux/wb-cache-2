40|$|The {{objective}} was to create an accurate steady state thermal model of a molten salt receiver prototype with a horizontal <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> in the molten salt for Concentrated Solar Power on Demand (CSPonD). The purpose of the <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> is to separate the heated salt on the top from the colder salt on the bottom while allowing some of the salt to pass around the plate. The thermal model used is a one dimensional resistance model which uses bulk temperatures for {{the top and bottom}} layers of salt. An assumption needed to be made to allow the model to be solvable, so it was modeled using two different assumptions, a given energy input and a given top salt bulk temperature. The system was solved for the maximum and minimum heights that the <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> transverse, with the top of the plate being 2 centimeters and 5. 5 centimeters {{from the bottom of the}} receiver. The given energy for the two heights was 1, 598 W for the 2 centimeter height and 1, 512 W for the 5. 5 centimeter height. For the given top temperature for the two heights the temperatures were 367. 2 °C for 2 centimeter height and 360. 0 °C for 5. 5 centimeter height. It was observed that both models showed correlation with the trends in the temperature gradients and heat losses as the tested experiment, varying at a maximum temperature difference of 55 K to a minimum of less than 2 K. The observations show that the assumed temperature models show a closer correlation with the experimental results than the assumed energy model. The experiment, however, was only run for 8000 s, which suggests that it might not have reached steady state making the energy model the better model for steady state analysis. by Jennifer A. Rees.

40|$|The {{effect of}} side stream channel height on flow {{stability}} in 30 u coextrusion geometries was investigated. The studies {{were conducted on}} a Dow LD 150 R low density polyethylene melt using a single extruder to feed a flow cell in which the delivered melt stream was split before, and rejoined after, a <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> in a slit die. Wave type interfacial instability occurred at critical stream thickness ratios. Reducing the side stream channel height broadened the layer ratio operating range {{before the onset of}} interfacial instability, therefore improving process stability. Stress fields were quantified and used to validate principal stress differences of numerically modelled flow. Stress field features promoting interfacial instability in each of the die geometries were identified. Interfacial instability resulted when the stress gradient across the interface was asymmetric and accompanied by a non-monotonic decay in the stress along the interface from its inception. © Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2014...|$|E

Nominal unit width (left-to-right) sizes are in increments of 12 in, most commonly 24 to 72 in. Typical commercial charbroilers are a system of three main characteristics: (1) burner, (2) radiant, and (3) grate. The various combinations of these individual aspects have a dramatic effect on the performance of the charbroiler, though other design features such as gas orifice sizing, under-burner heat deflectors, burner <b>divider</b> <b>plates</b> (also known as [...] "superchargers") are also added to create unique and improved performance characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) of alloy 600 {{is regarded as}} one of the most important challenges to nuclear power plant operation worldwide. This study investigates two heats of alloy 600 (forged control rod drive mechanismnozzle and rolled <b>divider</b> <b>plate)</b> in order to obtain a better understanding of the effects of the material parameter on the SCC phenomenon. The experimental approach was designed to determine the effect of the manufacturing process (forged vs. rolled), the cold-work (as-received vs. cold-worked) and the strain path (monotonic vs. complex) on SCC of alloy 600. Specimens with different strain paths have been produced from two materials representative of plant components and tested in high temperature (360 °C) high pressure primary water environment. The manufacturing process has been proven to have a great effect on the stress {{corrosion cracking}} behaviour of alloy 600. Indeed, the SCC susceptibility assessment has demonstrated that the rolled materialis resistant to SCC even after cold work, whereas the forged material is susceptible in the as-received state. Microstructural characterisations have been undertaken to explain these differences in SCC behaviour. The carbide distribution is the main microstructural parameter influencing SCC but the misorientation, in synergy with the carbide distribution, has been proven to give a better representation of the materials SCC susceptibilities.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) {{system based on}} current {{available}} technologies is being developed under {{the framework of the}} Masdar Institute (MI) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) collaborative Flagship Program. The key feature of this concept lies on concentrating sun light directly on the molten salt storage tank, avoiding the necessity of pumping the salts {{to the top of a}} tower thereby avoiding thermal losses and pumping and electric tracing needs inherent in most conventional CSP plants. This Concentrated Solar Power on Demand (CSPonD) volumetric receiver/TES unit prototype will be tested in the existing MI heliostat field and beam down tower in Abu Dhabi (UAE) which will collect and redirect solar energy to an upwards-facing final optical element (FOE). These energy will be concentrated on the aperture of the prototype designed to store 400 kWh of energy allowing 16 hours of continuous production after sunset using Solar Salt (60 %NaNO 3 + 40 %KNO 3) as storage material. The tank is divided in two volumes: one cold in the bottom region, where Solar Salt is at 250 °C and another hot on the upper region, at 550 °C. A moving <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> with active control separates both volumes. The plate includes mixing enhancement features to help with convection on the hot volume of salts. It’s expected that results will demonstrate the technical feasibility and economic viability of this concept allowing its scale up at commercial size...|$|E

Melt streams are converged at an angle of 30 ° to a common die land. Melt stream confluence was observed in two coextrusion die arrangements. In one die design, which we term ‘bifurcated’ the melt stream is split by a <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> in the die after being delivered from a single extruder. In the other design melt streams are delivered to a die from two separate extruders. In each die design melt flow in the confluent region and die land to the die exit was observed through side windows of a visualization cell. Velocity ratios of the two melt streams were varied and layer thickness ratios producing wave type interfacial instability determined for each melt {{for a variety of}} flow conditions. Stress and velocity fields in the coextrusion arrangements were quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. Wave type interfacial instability occurred in the processing of the low-density polyethylene melts at specific, repeatable, stream layer ratios. The birefringent pattern in the confluence region {{and the beginning of the}} die land appeared stable even when the extrudate exhibited instability. However, disturbances were observed in the flow field near the exit of the die land. The study demonstrates conclusively it is possible for interfacial instability to occur in the coextrusion of the same melt. The study also shows that wave type interfacial instability in the coextrusion process is not caused by process perturbations of extruder screw rotation.

40|$|Polymer melts {{experience}} complex, time variant, {{stress and}} deformation fields on their passage through fixed geometries in many conversion operations. Flow complexity is further increased in operations involving the co-joining {{of two or}} more melt streams where one confining boundary is moving and viscoelastic. Such a complex situation arises in coextrusion processes. This work covers experimental studies on polyethylene melt flows in complex coextrusion geometries with a view to understanding the stress fields involved and their effects on flow stability. A 30 ° 1 coextrusion geometry is studied using two extrusion arrangements. In one arrangement a single extruder is used to feed a 'bifurcated' die design wherein the melt stream is split prior to, and rejoined after, a <b>divider</b> <b>plate</b> in the die. In the other design melt streams are delivered to, and converged at 30 °, using two independent extruders. In a second die melt streams are brought together at 90 °. In each die arrangement melt flow in the confluent region and die land to the die exit was observed through side windows of a visualisation cell. Velocity ratios of the two melt streams were varied and layer thickness ratios producing instability are determined for each melt for a variety of flow conditions. Stress and velocity fields in the coextrusion arrangements were quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. The study demonstrates conclusively that wave type interfacial instability occurred in the coextrusion geometries when the same low density polyethylene melt is used in each stream. This observation occurred at specific, repeatable, stream layer ratios in each die arrangement. The complex flows were numerical modelled using a modified Leonov model and Flow 2000 P software. There was reasonable agreement between modelled at experimentally determined stress fields. Modelling however provided far more detailed stress gradient information than could be resolved from the optical techniques. A total normal stress difference (TNSD) sign criterion was used to predict the critical layer ratio for the onset of the interfacial instability in one die arrangement and good agreement between theory and experiment has been obtained. The study conclusively demonstrates wave type interfacial instability in the coextrusion process is not caused by process perturbations potentially introduced by extruder screw rotation but is associated with process-history dependant differences in melt elasticity. © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
