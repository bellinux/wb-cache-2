50|$|On 1 April 1996, Brolin had to {{apologize}} to Howard Wilkinson after an April Fool's Day prank backfired. He had told Swedish television station that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> the season on loan to former club IFK Norrköping as a joke but the statement was then picked up by international media and re-reported as fact. He returned on 3 April, however, and played in the matches against Southampton, Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. He played his last match of the season at Stamford Bridge on 14 April, setting up Gary McAllister's goal in the 4-1 defeat to Chelsea, but was dropped for the following match against Manchester United. On 1 May, it was announced by the club that Brolin had returned home to Sweden undergo surgery to remove scar tissue from his troublesome ankle, and was not fit for Leeds' last two league matches, or indeed at all generally. Brolin's future at Leeds, however, was already in doubt.|$|E
50|$|A fifty-something husband, Gene Bergman (Wilder), and his wife, Annie (Hillary Bailey Smith), {{who is in}} her thirties, are {{learning}} to cope with raising 4-year-old fraternal twin sons, Sam and Gabe (Carl Michael Lindner and Ian Bottiglieri). Sensitive, emotional Gene was especially unprepared for the prospect of fatherhood this much later in his life, and couldn't fathom how the generation gap was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> with the kids once they grew older. Sensible Annie pulled him through all the obstacles, and in the meantime, the Bergmans were just settling in for the joy of Sam and Gabe's innocent years. Gene ran an advertising agency with his partner, crabby best friend Jack Travis (Gregory Itzin), whose offices were located adjacent to both their homes. Jack, whose kids were grown, was at first unsure about Gene's newfound habit of dropping work frequently throughout the day {{to play with the}} twins, but eventually adjusted and sometimes found himself babysitting Sam and Gabe whenever some situation (usually comedic and slapstick) caused Gene and Annie to be away. Also working for the agency was Annie's irresponsible younger brother, Richie Wainwright (Jake Weber), who doted on the kids almost as much as Gene. Others seen were Annie's niece from another of her siblings, boy crazy teen Katy Mooney (Raegan Kotz), and Caleb (Cleavant Derricks), the neighborhood handyman.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2013, Nick {{takes a look}} at the {{paternity}} test results from 2006, this time showing viewers that the results were inconclusive. The storyline coincides with the memorial of the death of Nick's daughter, Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes), and he visits her grave and admits that he is terrified about losing another daughter. Joshua Morrow admitted in an interview with TV Guide that the writers make it clear that Nick did not intend to do anything wrong. He stated that Nick [...] "refused to do another test". Morrow admits that Nick may have never thought about the possibility of Jack being Summer's father again had Summer not fallen so hard for Kyle to point where she admits that she would like to lose her virginity to him. He said that [...] "people don't know what to think" [...] of Nick's [...] "threatening Kyle" [...] and reasons to [...] "ground Summer". On May 27, 2013, Morrow did an interview TV Buzz which confirmed that Summer is indeed Jack's daughter, and according to the actor, Nick is terrified of Summer's reaction. However, months later it was revealed that the {{paternity test}} results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very curious as <b>to</b> how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it <b>out</b> with Summer. I'm sure she's still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the close bond that she now has with Jack." ...|$|R
500|$|In May 2013, Morrow {{spoke with}} Michael Logan of TV Guide, {{revealing}} {{that the question}} of Summer's paternity would be visited, as Nick's [...] "game-changing deception" [...] would be uncovered. It later revealed onscreen that Summer may in fact not be his daughter; the paternity results read only by Nick years ago were inconclusive. Logan called it [...] "messy development", stating that his character may be [...] "trashed forever". According to Morrow, after Cassie's death, Nick withheld the fact that the results were corrupted because [...] "he just couldn't bear the thought of losing Summer, too", but called it [...] "out of character". [...] "But now he's freaking out because there's a good likelihood that Summer and Kyle are brother and sister," [...] he stated. Nick later secretly does another test using hair from Summer's hairbrush, which comes back conclusive. Later that May, Morrow stated during an interview with TV Buzz that Nick would be devastated by the paternity test outcome; confirming that Summer is in fact Jack's daughter. He stated that Nick is [...] "terrified" [...] of the potential repercussions and the reactions, from Jack, Sharon, Noah, and most importantly Summer. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very curious as <b>to</b> how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it <b>out</b> with Summer.

5000|$|... US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, {{stated that}} [...] "Now {{is the time}} to stop this {{unacceptable}} bloodshed." [...] The U.S. State Department ordered all family members of its embassy employees and non-essential personnel to leave Libya. Obama and Clinton sharpened their criticism after the formation of a rival government in Benghazi, issuing statements urging Gaddafi to step down. Clinton added on 27 February that the U.S. has begun [...] "reaching out" [...] to the organisers of an [...] "interim" [...] government" [...] and that [...] "We’ve been reaching out to many different Libyans who are attempting to organize in the east and, as the revolution moves westward, there as well. I think it’s way too soon to tell how this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>out,</b> but we’re going to be ready and prepared to offer any kind of assistance that anyone wishes to have from the United States." [...] The United States cosponsored and, after pushing successfully for the inclusion of language allowing member states to take additional military action to protect civilian targets under threat in Libya, voted for a UN Security Council resolution establishing a Libyan no-fly zone, which it is expected to take a major role in enforcing, on 17 March. It recognized the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya on 15 July {{and is a member of}} the Libya Contact Group.|$|E
5000|$|We love Duke and Anna {{together}} too, and I thought originally, “We {{are really}} going to play it this way?” But, because I trusted that it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> well, I can say we are in the good hands of our head writer, Ron Carlivati. That is the great thing, because I have gotten creeped out myself by some of the stuff I have been doing. I get totally creeped out! On-Air On-Soaps While Buchanan went on to do other things, he appeared on several other soaps and in 2007 he said he'd be open to reprising the role but, [...] "They never asked me, which was the interesting thing." [...] He described himself as [...] "totally open" [...] to a return but there had never been a [...] "serious" [...] discussion about it. On August 23, 2012, Soap Opera Network reported on the rumor of Buchanan returning to the series. Buchanan had just made his final appearance as Ian McAllister on Days of Our Lives. Buchanan responded to fan questions about his return on Twitter with the statement [...] "My tweets are sealed." [...] Meanwhile, executive producer Frank Valentini teased a huge surprise for the episode airing on Monday August 27. Ian Buchanan reappeared {{for the first time in}} 23 years on August 27, 2012 and the 1990 recast was officially retconned with Paget being scripted as an impostor. [...] "I've come to the conclusion that's why nobody can use a cell phone in the studio" [...] Buchanan said joking to Soaps In Depth in reference to his top secret return. Buchanan didn't even tell his longtime friend and co-star Finola Hughes that he had visited the studio. Buchanan revealed that he was unaware of the story the writers had planned for him when he agreed to return. Viewers quickly realized that something had gone wrong with Duke as he had become quite un-apologetically evil as Duke had suddenly killed Steve Burton's beloved Jason Morgan. Buchanan was afraid of the fan backlash and hesitant about playing the story because it was far removed from the man viewers had come to know and love. However, even this return proved to be not all it seemed to be. On November 12, Duke was revealed to be in impostor once again as super villain Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) had disguised himself as Duke in an attempt to win Anna's affections. Faison had been holding the real Duke captive in a clinic.|$|E

5000|$|I {{thought that}} was the truth until they exposed what happened. I didn't find out the truth until the script came. They're like, [...] "You have to wait and see." [...] For a while I was like, [...] "Oh, my gosh! This is huge. He's not my dad." [...] I was getting really into it. Then I saw what happened. I was reading and they left like a cliff note right {{at the end of one}} of the scripts about what Sharon did. I was sitting in my {{dressing}} room in disbelief, like, [...] "How could she do that to me? This is awful. This is way bad." [...] I took it very close to heart.I'm actually really excited. I'm very curious as <b>to</b> how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it <b>out</b> with Summer. I'm sure she's still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the close bond that she now has with Jack. I'm excited <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it as an actress and to see how it all <b>plays</b> <b>out</b> as a fan. — Hunter King, on Summer's paternity test and Sharon switching the results. In a 2010 interview with TV Guide, Morrow openly discussed his strong belief that Summer was not Nick's child due to the fact that Nick was suffering from amnesia at the time. Though the actor himself questioned Summer's paternity, it seemed nothing would come of his speculation. In October 2012, Bushman hinted that she would not be opposed to a potential romance with Kyle Abbott (then Blake Hood). In February 2013, King's version of Summer is scripted as being 18 years old, and the character has developed a major crush on Kyle. Nick's immediate disapproval hinted that there was more to his disapproval then just the slight age difference between the two characters. Because Nick is the only person to see the test results, many viewers have begun to speculate that Jack could indeed be Summer's biological father. Summer's crush on Kyle reminds them of the possibility that they could be brother and sister. With the installation of Josh Griffith as head writer, in addition to Nick's adamant disapproval of Summer's crush on Kyle, Jack even brings up the night he helped deliver Summer in the elevator. According to Griffith, Nick is so protective because he knows about Jack's playboy history during his younger years. He stated: [...] "Nick's worried that Summer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get involved with someone who could break her heart." [...] Despite Griffith's explanation, King herself questioned Summer's paternity; [...] "I ask Josh everyday, 'Whose daughter am I?" [...] Though Griffith does not confirm or deny anything, he explained that anything is possible.|$|R

40|$|Rapid land {{transformation}} {{driven by}} large scale investments {{is one of}} the big trends defining this century. In a virtual briefing for the Global Donor Platform members CIAT agriculture expert Deborah Bossio dismisses the cry for more investments often heard in development circles. From her perspective a lack of investments is not the problem. The more pressing question is whether these large scale investments could be sustainable and socially inclusive. How are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> in the end? Another emerging feature, according to Bossio, is the dominance of globalization as well as foreign income and international trade as major drivers of land use change. Taking a closer look at these dynamics shows that we aim at achieving multiple goals (sustaining communities, produce goods, store carbon, protect wildlife, sustain biodiversity, ecosystem services). The landscapes approach provides a vehicle for realizing those objectives. After outlining the reasons behind choosing landscapes approaches, Deborah rounds off with introducing specifics of CIAT’s landscapes approach. Deborah Bossio is the director of soils research area at CIAT. She is based in Nairobi, Kenya, and has more than 15 years experience working in sustainable agriculture development research.

40|$|How do humans {{relate to}} their technology? This {{is not a new}} question, many have {{struggled}} with it. What we want to do here is to make it visible through another vocabulary, the virtual. We are going to unpack this vocabulary by reconfiguring the traditional moves that start with distinct categories of human things and technical things and seek to explain one category in terms of the activities of the other. Through the Actor Network Theory (ANT) we will opt for Allegoresis as another register or vocabulary that makes technology and people visible. Through Latours’s recent work we find our way to Walter Benjamin and his take on Leibniz’s Monadology as a way of understanding the Kantian symbolic mode in historical terms. Benjamin asks for an account of stability from historical change and reinterpretation. The relationship between movement and moments is what we want to describe as that between the virtual and the actual. Moreover, it is this vocabulary that helps us understand or make visible the constant rewriting that any technology goes through as it is configured and reconfigured as humans and non-humans are arranged in historically contingent ways. We are then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> the virtual or arrive at it as we look to notice the arrangements of people and technology in a photographic club where members are beginning to use digital technologies...|$|E
