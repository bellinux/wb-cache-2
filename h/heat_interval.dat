The compositional milk quality of buffalo was also studied. The data were collected from 46 individual buffalo based on their history, reared by 34 farmers of Samtse and Tsirang districts using structured questionnaire. A data on daily milk production of individual buffalo was measured immediately after complete milking using weighing spring balance with a 10 g precision. Milk samples of 60 ml were collected in plastic vials, then stored in cool box and transported to place or areas with electricity facility for milk compositional analysis. The samples were analyzed within 2 hr time period after collection of samples using ultrasonic milkotester. The production and breeding parameters studied were average daily milk yield, average age of cows, lactation number, lactation record, age at first breeding, <b>heat</b> <b>interval,</b> gestation period, calving interval and days open.

40|$|For {{dairy cattle}} breeds, mainly the taurine ones, the {{selection}} emphasized {{for many years}} the increase in milk yields and, as a consequence, the adaptive and reproductive traits were negatively affected. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the influence of genetic and environmental effects on the reproductive traits in a dairy herd selected for high milk production levels. The data set comprised 1, 737 first lactations Holsteins cows of Agrindus Farm, located at Southeastern region of Brazil. The records of the following reproductive traits: calving to first <b>heat</b> <b>interval</b> (CFHI), calving to conception interval (CCI) and first to second calving interval (FCI) were analyzed as dependent variables by least squares method using GLM procedure (SAS). Linear models were considered including two production levels (1 = less than 9, 500 kg and 2 = more than 9, 501 kg of total milk yield), contemporary group (year and months calving), management group, sire of cow, and the sire used to breeding cows, as classificatory variables. As covariates were included for all traits the peak milk yield in lactation (linear effect), age at calving only for CFHI (linear and quadratic effects) since this effect was not significant for other traits, and CFHI (linear effect) only for FCI. The coefficients of determination represented 24 %, 74 % and 75 %, respectively for CFHI, FCI and CCI models. Production level, peak milk yield and sire effects were significant (P< 0. 05) for all traits. The average estimated for high and low milk production level were 73 and 79 days, 500 and 601 days, 227 and 330 days for CFHI, FCI and CCI, respectively, suggesting that cows with higher genetic potential for milk had worse reproductive performance. Similarly, lactation peak showed significant effect (P< 0. 05) for all traits, suggesting higher peaks cows showed also poorer reproductive rates. Sire effect also was a variable that showed significant effect (P< 0. 01) for all traits, which means that there was additive genetic variability transmitted from one to the other generation. The bull used to mate cows by artificial insemination or by controlled mating and the contemporary group had a significant effect (P< 0. 01) for FCI and CCI. Bull effect can be explained by semen quality and this effect showed an important variation source in the model and may help the farm to identify causes of reproductive problems. The important genetic association between production and reproduction traits in dairy cattle justifies to include reproductive traits in the breeding goals of dairy cattle breeding programs. There was an important effect of genetic potential of cows to produce milk for IPPC, causing the higher intervals, represented by sire and production level effects on this trait. Although the cow had shown estrus, the conception occurred late...|$|E

40|$|The {{compound}} of interest at {{the conception of}} this research project was YInMnO 3, a new bright blue inorganic pigment discovered by Mas Subramanian in 2009. 1 The pigment’s unique reflective properties in the infrared region of light give this compound potential as a passive heat reducer in cool roofing. The project was conceived {{with a desire to}} find alternate routes to synthesis of this promising blue pigment. CuTiO 3 and YInFeO 3, 2, 3 other hexagonal pigments with metal ions in the same trigonal bipyramidal coordination, were made with similar experimental parameters after successful synthesis of YInMnO 3 in the microwave. Previous research has identified microwave-active elements and compounds that heat up rapidly when exposed to microwave energy. Undergraduate student Casey Young profiled various susceptors in the microwave to determine a working susceptor with the capability of heating to 1300 degrees Celsius (the literature temperature required to synthesize YInMnO 3). Thermal profiles were gathered for several susceptors, collecting temperature readings at various power levels and <b>heating</b> <b>interval</b> lengths. The susceptors tested were tungsten oxide, activated and non-activated manganese dioxide, silicon carbide, cupric oxide, activated carbon mesh, and granular carbon slug. Reusability and maximum temperature were both significant limitations. The susceptor that proved most optimal for synthesis was carbon slug 6 - 8 mesh, which rose to 1350 degrees Celsius and was reusable after successive heatings. Casey Young determined the optimal parameters for microwave synthesis, including crucible type, crucible dimensions, type of susceptor, amount of susceptor, microwave power level, duration of <b>heating</b> <b>intervals,</b> and amount of <b>heating</b> <b>intervals</b> necessary for successful synthesis. After Casey Young determined ideal microwave synthesis conditions, the student ran several trials to synthesize YInMnO 3 and YCuTiO 3 and analyzed phase-purity via XRD to find optimal heating time. Using the parameters outlined by Casey Young, undergraduate student colleague Omar Rachdi ran trials of YInFeO 3 to find optimal heating time for synthesis. Casey Young and Omar Rachdi then constructed a poster for CUE 2013 and presented to the general public on May 15 th, 2013. The findings of this project are significant because it shows alternative synthesis routes for YInMnO 3 and other pigments of similar structure. The conventional synthesis of YInMnO 3 in a furnace requires three full days of heating; microwave synthesis of this compound was shown to reduce the synthesis time to under 2 hours. This reduced heating time holds potential to reduce production cost of YInMnO 3, giving this environmentally beneficial pigment greater economic potential. 1. 	Smith, A. E. et al.

The overall incidence rate of retained placenta was 11. 2 %. Retained placenta was 4. 6 {{times more likely to}} occur following twin births than following single births. Most cases of retained placenta occurred during the fall. Forty-five percent of that seasonal increase was explained by an increased number of calvings. Metritis complex was diagnosed following 54. 8 % of retained placenta cases. Retained placenta alone did not significantly impair reproductive performance. Metritis complex, in {{the presence or absence of}} retained placenta, caused a significant (P≤ 0. 05) increase in days open, services per conception, calving to first <b>heat</b> <b>intervals</b> and days from calving to first service.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of various metal surfaces {{has been investigated}} in atomic detail with the field ion microscope. Unreconstructed (bulk-terminated) surfaces were produced by low-temperature field evaporation and induced to reconstruct either by heating alone or heating {{in the presence of}} deuterium. Field ion microscope images recorded before and after the field-free <b>heating</b> <b>interval</b> were used to determine the temperature at which restructuring takes place and the structure of the reconstructed surface. The results clearly showed that the (110) planes of Pt and Ir reconstruct to missing-row structures. The temperature required for restructuring was approximately 300 K for Pt and 500 K for Ir. The reconstructions were observed for (110) planes as large as 40 - 50 Å diameter and for clusters as small as five atoms. The direct observation of missing-row structures for these small clusters provides convincing evidence that the reconstructions are driven by short-ranged atomic interactions. Missing-row structures were also produced on higher index planes of Pt such as (311), (211), and (511) by heating to temperatures above 400 K. Small clusters of atoms on the (110) plane of Ni did not reconstruct thermally, but did reconstruct to a missing-row structure when heated to 150 - 170 K in the presence of 10 - 8 Torr deuterium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{fast growing}} amount of {{renewable}} energy from wind or solar plants with their inherent production fluctuations re-quires conventional backup and storage capacity {{in order to keep}} grids stable. Hence, hydropower plants in Switzerland are in-creasingly selling peak energy in a liberalized European electrici-ty market. This development leads to higher start/stop-cycle frequencies of their hydrogenerators and some older machines are also subjected to more starts per year than they were origi-nally designed for. In consequence the high voltage insulation system in the stator conductor bars is stressed by a higher num-ber of thermal cycles which might shorten machine lifetimes sig-nificantly. In this paper a new test for assessing the impact of thermal cycling in modern mica/epoxy insulation systems is pre-sented. The new method isolates insulation aging exclusively caused by thermal cycling by the use of cycles with short <b>heating</b> <b>intervals</b> and a maximum temperature close to the glass transition point of the insulation system’s binder (epoxy) resin. The insulation aging condition is monitored with non-destructive measurements of the Dissipation Factor and Par-tial Discharges during, and a destructive voltage endurance test after completion of the thermal cycling.

A joint U. S. - French testing program was devised that would screen samples of carbon/carbon to determine the fabrication process that would produce the best thermal-optical and thermal-mechanical properties, lowest mass loss, and acceptable RF properties for temperatures up to 2400 K during shield operation. The U. S. testing program relied on three facilities to measure thermal-optical properties, emissivity, and mass loss. The facility for optical property testing consisted of a high intensity halogen lamp whose beam passed through a window in a vacuum chamber containing the sample. As the beam intensity was increased, the increasing temperature {{of the sample was}} measured by contact thermocouples for various angles of incidence. The temperatures were introduced into a heat balance equation to determine the absorptivity/emissivity ((z/e) ratio given the known heat flux input. The emissivity of the samples were determined, independently, by another specially calibrated facility that used Joule heating of the samples and measured the emissivity by remote pyrometry that had been precisely calibrated. The mass loss from the samples was measured in an special furnace facility that heated the samples over a progressively longer duration while the mass of the samples was measured precisely between each <b>heating</b> <b>interval.</b> Thermal-mechanical properties were measured using standard techniques at the NASA Langley Research Center and its subcontractors...|$|R

Measurements of cell parameters and unit-cell volumes were obtained {{at room temperature}} and at <b>heating</b> <b>intervals</b> of 50 ~ over the temperature range from 50 to 1400 ~ The unit-cell parameters for cancrinite increase non-linearly with temperature up to 1200 ~ and shortly thereafter, the mineral melted. The c parameter increases more rapidly than the a parameter, and the c/a ratio increases linearly with temperature. A plausible thermal expansion mechanism for cancrinite, {{which is based on}} the framework expansion that occurs as a function of cavity content, is presented. In the thermal expansion of cancrinite, the short Na-H 20 in the HeO-Na [...] HeO chain expands to form equal distances to the two H 20 molecules in the chain. This causes the Na atoms to move towards the plane of the six-membered rings and tbrces the tetrahedra to rotate and the rings become more planar. The Na atoms then form bonds to all six (O 1 and 02) oxygen atoms in a ring; the Na-O 1 bonds become shorter and the Na-O 2 bonds become longer. These effects cause an increase in both a and c, and thus an increase in the c/a ratio. A similar thermal expansion mechanism operates in the sodalite-group minerals where the six-membered rings and Na-C 1 bond are involved.

Choosen ferromagnetic material has some parameters such as anisotropy constant as large as 4. 5 × 10 5 erg/cm 3, magnetic saturation of 2100 G, Curie temperature of 373 K, and finite-dimension of 50 × 50 × 10 nm 3. The use of perpendicular anisotropy media with appropriate properties value are intended to increase the storage capacity of the hard disk without ignoring its thermal stabilty. At writing information, ferromagnetic material is induced by magnetic field for reversing the direction of magnetization {{and all at once}} also heated by thermal pulse which was designed matches closely the reality. To examine thermal fluctuation effects, twenty random number for magnetization was adopted in calculation and probability of magnetization reversal was introduced for determining the theshold field.

In this study, a capacitive sensor was designed to assess frying oil degradation at several <b>heating</b> time <b>intervals</b> by measuring changes on its electrical capacitance. The sensor was designed using interdigitated electrode structure. A total of 30 samples of 130 ml palm oil were heated at 180 °C up to 30 h. For each one hour interval, one sample was moved out from the laboratory oven. The electrical capacitance, total polar compound (TPC) and viscosity of the samples were measured for analysis. Preliminary results demonstrated significant correlation between oil electrical capacitance with TPC and viscosity with R 2 ranged from 0. 83 to 0. 90. The designed sensor has good potential for simple and inexpensive way of determining frying oil quality...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} active IR Thermography techniques for the NDT of thick polymer and glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GRP) composite panels. A low cost Thermal NDT set-up is proposed, comprising a single-detector IR camera with low thermal resolution and low frame rate, and common low-power halogen lamps as external heat source devices. The use of halogen lamps in particular requires several seconds of switch-on {{time in order to}} deliver meaningful and effective heat quantities. The influence of such long <b>heat</b> deposition <b>intervals</b> is investigated on the possibility to implement Transient Thermography and Lock-In Thermography techniques. Regarding the Transient Thermography approach this is carried out as in traditional Pulsed Thermography, and the Thermal Contrast is in particular analyzed assessing the influence of the heat pulse duration and non-uniformity of heat deposition. Regarding the Lock-In approach a technique is adopted which modulates heat deposition into trains of square waves. A lock-in signal processing in the frequency domain is then performed to obtain Phase Contrast parameters...|$|R
30|$|Since {{almost all}} GGD(/E)EF {{proteins}} display cyclic diguanylate activity, the proteins were initially assayed {{for the production}} of c-di-GMP, using the method employed previously (Ryjenkov et al. 2005). Briefly, a reaction mixture containing 5  μM protein, 10  mM MgCl 2, and 50  mM NaCl was treated with 5  μM of GTP (Sigma Aldrich). The reaction mixture was prewarmed and the reaction was carried out for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60  min. Aliquots were withdrawn at the given time <b>intervals,</b> <b>heated</b> in a boiling water bath for 3  min, 0.5  mM EDTA was added and centrifuged at 10, 000 g for 10  min.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} a 1. 5 MW system that injects the regenerated energy, caused by the braking action of electric trains, back into the Eskom supply. At present this energy is dumped into resistor banks and goes to waste as <b>heat</b> For the <b>intervals</b> that the train is not regenerating energy, the system operates as an active power filter. An overview of the system is provided as well as further details on the series-stacked inverter, injection transformer, measurement system and protection in the system. Simulation results show the operation of the system. Conference Pape...|$|R
30|$|We {{believe that}} for {{accurate}} determination of heat capacity profiles, and the derived enthalpy profiles and stored <b>heat</b> per temperature <b>interval</b> tables, DSCs {{will need to}} be operated at rates below 0.5 K min^- 1. This is a regime where DSCs are generally not readily used, and due to their construction, also do not perform particularly well. The effort needed in terms of calibration, combined with the longer measurement times make it worthwhile to look at other measurement techniques. While the virtues of the T-history method (and comparable techniques) are well-established for the study of PCMs, we believe that this paper has also made clear that pASC is a suitable technique for this type of research.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} laser heating of silicon. A three-dimensional form of electron kinetic theory approach is considered when deriving the governing heat transfer equation. The numerical method employing a finite difference scheme {{is used to}} discretize the resulting equations. The step input laser pulse with Gaussian spatial distribution is introduced. The present predictions are compared {{with the results of}} the Fourier heating model. It is found that the temperature rise in the surface vicinity depends on the electron lattice site atom collisions. As <b>heating</b> progresses, the <b>interval</b> energy gain dominates the conduction losses in this region. The electron kinetic theory predictions and the Fourier theory results become similar as the laser pulse length increases...|$|R
2500|$|Males reach {{maturity}} at 4–5 {{years of}} age, and females at 3–4 years. A Bengal comes into <b>heat</b> at <b>intervals</b> of about 3–9 weeks, and is receptive for 3–6 days. After a gestation period of 104–106 days, 1–4 cubs are {{born in a}} shelter situated in tall grass, thick bush or in caves. Newborn cubs weigh [...] {{and they have a}} thick wooly fur that is shed after 3.5–5 months. Their eyes and ears are closed. Their milk teeth start to erupt at about 2–3 weeks after birth, and are slowly replaced by permanent dentition from 8.5–9.5 weeks of age onwards. They suckle for 3–6 months, and begin to eat small amounts of solid food at about 2 months of age. At this time, they follow their mother on her hunting expeditions and begin to take part in hunting at 5–6 months of age. At the age of 2–3 years, they slowly start to separate from the family group and become transient — looking out for an area, where they can establish their own territory. Young males move further away from their mother's territory than young females. Once the family group has split, the mother comes into heat again.|$|R
