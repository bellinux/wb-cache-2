40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for treating}} pollutants in a gas may include {{a source of}} hydrogen peroxide, and a treatment injector for creating and injecting dissociated hydrogen peroxide into the flow of gas. The treatment injector may further include an <b>injector</b> <b>housing</b> having an inlet, an outlet, and a hollow interior extending there between. The inlet may be connected in fluid communication with the source of hydrogen peroxide so that hydrogen peroxide flows through the hollow interior and toward the outlet. At least one ultraviolet (UV) lamp may be positioned within the hollow interior of the <b>injector</b> <b>housing.</b> The at least one UV lamp may dissociate the hydrogen peroxide flowing through the tube. The dissociated hydrogen peroxide may be injected into the flow of gas from the outlet for treating pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides...|$|E
40|$|Magnetostriction is the {{deformation}} that spontaneously {{occurs in}} ferromagnetic materials when an {{external magnetic field}} is applied. In applications broadly defined for actuation, magnetostrictive material Terfenol-D possesses intrinsic rapid response times while providing small and accurate displacements and high-energy efficiency, which {{are some of the}} essential parameters required for fast control of fuel injector valves for decreased engine emissions and lower fuel consumption compared with the traditional solenoid fuel injection system. A prototype CNG fuel injector assembly was designed, which primarily included magnetostrictive material Terfenol-D as the actuator material, 1020 Steel having soft magnetic properties as the <b>injector</b> <b>housing</b> material, AWG copper wire as the coil material and 316 Stainless Steel having non-magnetic properties as the plunger material. A 2 D cross-sectional geometry including the <b>injector</b> <b>housing,</b> coil, Terfenol-D shaft, and plunger, was modeled in both Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) and ANSYS for 2 D axisymmetric magnetic simulation. The magnetic simulations were performed {{in order to determine the}} coil-circuit parameters and the magnetic field strength to achieve the required magnetostrictive strain, and consequently, the injector needle lift. The FEMM magnetic simulations were carried out with four different types of AWG coil wires and four different injector coil thicknesses in order to evaluate the relationship between the different coil types and thicknesses against the achieved strain or injector lift. Eventually, the optimized parameter obtained from FEMM results analysis was verified against ANSYS electromagnetic simulation. Subsequently, a three dimensional replica of the CNG flow conduit was modelled in GAMBIT with the resultant injector lift. The meshed conduit was then simulated in FLUENT using the 3 D time independent segregated solver with standard k-ε, realizable k-ε and RSM turbulent models to predict the mass flow rate of CNG to be injected. Eventually, the simulated flow rates were verified against mathematically derived static flow rate required for a standard automotive fuel injector considering standard horsepower, BSFC and injector duty cycle...|$|E
40|$|Impinging jet {{injectors}} {{are often}} used in rocket propulsion systems, where storable liquid propellants shall be feeded. Also for gelled fuels and propellants this injector type is interesting due to its simplicity and relatively small contact areas between gel and <b>injector</b> <b>housing</b> compared to many other injector types. Gelled propellants are shear thinning fluids and show a significantly different rheological behaviour than Newtonian fluids. During storage and transport conditions with very low shear stress values their viscosity is very high and often combined with a distinct yield stress {{so that they are}} often described as semi-solid. During the feeding process through pipes and injectors, the structure of the gel is being destroyed, which leads to a decrease of viscosity up to its liquefaction inside the injector unit. Various experimental and theoretical investigations about the impinging jet injector processes with gelled propellants have been conducted in the past years and have shown that impinging jet injectors are interesting candidates for real engine applications. Up to now there are still gaps to be closed in the understanding of the working behaviour of impinging jet injectors with gelled fuels. The aim of the present publication is to present the results of an investigation concerning the influence of the interior injector inlet angle on the feeding process and spray behaviour of three different gelled fuels. For this task pressure loss measurements as well as shadowgraph images have been used to characterize the injection process...|$|E
40|$|A single-cavity {{horizontal}} test cryomodule (HTC) {{has been}} designed and fabricated recently at Cornell University for ERL project. This cryomodule is a shortened version of the full <b>injector</b> cryomodule, <b>housing</b> five superconducting cavities. It serves as a test bench for new design features and for testing fully dressed two-cell ERL injector cavities. The cryostat design has been optimized for precise cavity alignment, good magnetic shielding, and high cryogenic loads from the RF cavities, input couplers, and HOM loads. The HTC was made long enough so in the future it can accommodate longer, multicell cavities of the ERL main linac. In this paper we report on results from the first full test of the HTC, including RF system and superconducting cavity performance, cryomodule studies and operation of a new 2 K cryogenic system...|$|R
40|$|Does Nimbin have a drug problem? This tiny {{village in}} {{north-eastern}} NSW has an international reputation for its alternative community and its street drug market. Ever since the Aquarius Festival {{thirty years ago}} Nimbin has fascinated the media, and recurrent headlines about the village 2 ̆ 7 s (undefined) 2 ̆ 7 drug problem 2 ̆ 7 suggested my research topic. My research aim {{was to investigate the}} meaning/s of Nimbin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 drug problem 2 ̆ 7 in the context of Nimbin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 alternative 2 ̆ 7 culture. Because the topic of illicit drugs is both ethically challenging and highly sensitive, my research design was strongly participant-focused, with an emphasis on confidentiality balanced by a mixed methodology to cross-validate results. My methods included an anonymous household (door-to-door) survey based on a national household survey; an anonymous mailed-back survey of Nimbin and Lismore drug injectors; taped interviews with health and legal professionals, cannabis activists and drug dealers; semi-structured interviews with 2 ̆ 7 professional 2 ̆ 7 cannabis crop growers; and participant observation over several years. I found the multi-method research design to be particularly effective for investigating illegal drug marketing and use, and the design provided me with multiple perspectives on a complex issue. Superficially, there appeared to be two drug 2 ̆ 7 problems 2 ̆ 7 in Nimbin — one was the (largely cannabis) street market, and the other revolved around heroin users, and included complaints about scruffy-looking people hanging around the main street, or overdosing in the public toilet. However, my research suggested that these issues, while immediately comprehensible as 2 ̆ 7 drug problems 2 ̆ 7, obscured more complex issues. For example, the village 2 ̆ 7 s street drug market was intertwined with the local economy and with the alternative community 2 ̆ 7 s values and drug use, while close to half of the drug <b>injectors</b> lacked secure <b>housing</b> (which creates problems that are not related to heroin), and all heroin users were blamed for the actions of few. Many factors influence the creation and maintenance of what we might call 2 ̆ 7 problems 2 ̆ 7, and drugs are frequently blamed for broader social problems. What is Nimbin’s drug problem? The answer depends, in part, on the drug of interest, but more importantly it depends on your definition of a ‘problem’. Some useful and meaningful perspectives on this important social issue include quantified indicators such as death, injury, arrest rates, the economics of black markets, the demographics of drug use, and estimates of ‘social costs’. Qualitative perspectives include people’s opinions about drugs, media-generated moral panics, the effects of social marginalisation, and the role of drug cultures. A number of ‘drug problems’ arise {{as a direct result of}} drug illegality. They include black markets, corruption, drug-related violence, theft, stronger forms of the drug, and more dangerous using practices (with the risk drug overdoses and HIV/AIDS), as well as public nuisance issues. Government policy, judicial sentencing and public opinion are moving towards the social reintegration of illicit drug users, but this is almost invariably counter-balanced by a toughening of legal sanctions against supply of the same drug. Most discussions about illicit drugs fail to consider the long-term implications of harsh penalties for, and elaborate and punitive police operations (such as occurred throughout my Nimbin research) against, small-scale independent growers and dealers. The only way to directly engage with drug markets and all the attendant problems, is to legitimise and regulate the supply of recreational drugs. I discuss several examples of the important role of the drug culture in mitigating problems caused by illegality. One example is the influence of Nimbin 2 ̆ 7 s alternative community on the style of the drug market. The village drug scene more closely resembles the many north coast village craft markets, than it does Kings Cross, Cabramatta or New York 2 ̆ 7 s Bronx. Buyers are north coast locals, along with national and international tourists (the small village is known to cannabis users world-wide, both through media attention and word-of-mouth). Nimbin offers a 2 ̆ 7 safe 2 ̆ 7 village market ambience and competitive prices to a mainly cannabis using clientele. I suggest that there are two major underlying influences on the experience of a ‘drug problem’, regardless of the drug or the place. They are: 1. Political influences — specifically the effects of government policy on black markets, law enforcement practices, and access to services and resources; 2. Cultural influences — particularly the beneficial effects of norms and functional role models for the safe use of a drug, cultural effects on the drug market, and the role/s of the drug in the day-to-day life of the culture. These influences can operate with, or despite, each other, and can create or ameliorate many ‘drug problems’. In the case of Nimbin’s alternative culture, government policy has created a number of drug problems and the counter-culture has worked to minimise them. In my research into Nimbin’s ‘drug problem’ I have clarified some issues and raised a number of others. I have examined the notion of a ‘drug problem’ from several perspectives using a range of research tools, and discussed some key influences on the problem associated with drug use. Drawing from the Nimbin research and my reading, I suggest legalising the recreational drugs to bring them under the dual controls of supply legislation and social norms. In conclusion, I suggest that we need to be very clear about what ‘drug problem’ it is that we are talking about, and indeed, whether the problem is really about drugs at all...|$|R
