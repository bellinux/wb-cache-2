40|$|The {{automotive}} industry operates {{in a very}} competitive market which requires controlling product costs, improving the product quality and shortening the development lead time. Cost estimation requires quality data and information, therefore this research project identified several issues that hinder this activity, namely a lack of resources and information acquiring and validation difficulties. This research paper presents the various data and information requirements for <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> in {{automotive industry}}. The research project has identified the common cost estimation process model within the identified industry sector. The study identified the types of data and information requirements for cost estimating. It has also constructed the relevant data infrastructure {{as the basis for}} a Web Portal, which is the physical presentation of the information infrastructure. Multiple sources of data collection techniques were employed to identify the types of data needed for detailed cost estimates within a manufacturing company. These techniques include participant observation, semi-structured interviews, process models and document analysis of six different UK based automotive companies. Methods of process modelling like IDEF 3 and knowledge capture technique known as X-Pat (eXpert Process Knowledge Analysis Tool) were employed in this study. This study makes several contributions concerning both conceptual and practicable information issues that have long vexed <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> practices in the automotive industry. The study conceptually defines the detailed bottom-up information (i. e., individual cost elements and the links between them) needed for an accurate estimate of cost, and shows why each element of information is needed and where it fits into the cost model. To respond to the practicable information vexations, the study shows where to find the necessary cost information and proposes a validation method. The research creates useful knowledge {{in the form of an}} improved understanding of information requirements for cost estimates. The benefits to the industry of better cost estimates based on this research at the conceptual design stage include improved cost control and enhanced ability to adjust to anticipated market trends.

40|$|Quantity Take-off, {{the process}} of obtaining the {{dimensions}} and calculating the quantities from given plans and specifications, {{is perhaps the most}} basic and important phase in the detailed estimation of construction costs. The pricing strategies of cost estimation vary greatly in different situations. However, as the pricing changes, the quantity of the work involved in a particular project remains unchanged. A relatively accurate quantity take-off is thus a crucial element to successful bidding and project management. This thesis presents a new methodology that can integrate AutoCAD with the quantity take-off during the <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process. Based on the designer's 2 D AutoCAD drawings, and through interaction with a user, a customized AutoCAD module generates a 3 D model of a project and exports the components' information into an external Access database which contains detailed quantity take-off information. The 3 D model improves project visualization by allowing estimators to visualize the construction process as it would be actually built. Moreover, this customized module makes the quantity take-off much more efficient and effective...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the internal costing practices employed by commercial and engineering disciplines of cost estimating for generating estimates at the conceptual design stage of complex hardware products. It examines {{whether there is a}} formal structure in the interaction between the two groups that can be represented within a model. The aim is to develop a framework that will formalise and improve the communication of commercial and engineering disciplines in cost estimating. A literature review examines the role of different costing techniques and the information requirements for generating cost estimates. The review identifies that {{there is a lack of}} research in the information requirements for cost estimating of specific manufacturing industries, and that the interaction of commercial and engineering disciplines of cost estimating at conceptual design stage is hindered by the different focuses of these groups. By conducting a survey study the author identifies the internal practice in cost estimating for the automotive industry. The survey establishes that in order to improve the internal practice it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that formalises and enables the reuse of the cost estimates and improves the interaction between the two groups. The author identifies a common cost estimating process for the automotive industry. This study establishes the required data and information elements and information sources that need to be collected in order to have reliable data infrastructure. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functions in such a way that will enable the development of a <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model at the conceptual design stage, which will improve interaction between the commercial and engineering groups. The function-based cost estimating process becomes the focus of detailed studies using experts from the automotive industry. This results in a generic framework that provides a formalised structure to represent functional requirements in the form of a <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model. The thesis concludes that product functions need to be captured and analysed during the conceptual development of a product and be associated to cost estimates. The developed results provide both groups of cost estimating a structured, consistent approach to developing cost estimates at the conceptual design stage. The data infrastructure and the function-based cost estimating framework is validated through case studies and expert evaluation. The approach contributes towards improvement of the internal cost estimating practice with the automotive industry. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a neural network-based cost estimating method, {{developed for the}} generation of conceptual cost estimates for low-rise prefabricated structural steel buildings. <b>Detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> is current practice {{for this type of}} buildings, since cost estimators are often challenged by a wide variety of different parameters. The developed method employs neural networks (NNs) for modeling individual project parameters associated with the direct cost of a project. It integrates NN cost models with cost adjustments, allowing for evaluation of different project alternatives, in a timely manner. The ability of NNs to capture real life experiences encountered on actual projects (i. e. actual costs), generalize and utilize that knowledge for estimating the cost of new projects makes it a very powerful tool to the application at hand. Data used in this study (75 building projects) were collected from a large manufacturer of prefabricated structural steel buildings in Canada (Canam Manac) over a 3 -month period. The performance of developed cost models was tested against costs incurred by projects not used in training of those models, and costs predicted by regression. Results indicate that the proposed models, when used for projects with parameters within the range for which the models were trained, outperform regression. In addition, the proposed models can account for a number of parameters defining a project, and bearing considerable impact on the project cost. The proposed methodology can easily be adapted to provide decision-support for risk management and to assist in developing productivity models {{in a wide range of}} industries...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the issues in generating cost estimates at the conceptual design stage for Embedded Systems Design and Development (ES D&D), based on specifications. The research examines {{if there are any}} relationships between the system’s specifications and the system’s cost, and if these relationships can be formalised. The aim is to develop a framework that will structure, formalise and improve the ES D&D Cost Estimating process. Literature review examines current situation regarding ES D&D Cost Estimating and the information requirements for generating cost estimates. The review identifies that research concentrates on Embedded Systems manufacturing cost estimation, {{there is a lack of}} research regarding D&D cost estimation, as well as on the information requirements for generating D&D cost estimates. By conducting an industrial survey, the author identifies the internal practice on ES D&D Cost Estimating for the automotive and aerospace industries and identifies trends, commonalties and differences within and between them. The survey establishes that in order to improve the ES D&D Cost Estimating process, it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that will avoid issues with shortage of information imposed by suppliers and will link the Embedded System’s specifications with the system’s actual implementation and expected functionality. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functionality in such a way that will enable the development of a <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> framework at the specification’s design stage. The framework is developed in three parts for hardware, software and integration and reuse. The ES hardware design and development effort is predicted using a complexity based cost estimating approach. The research has demonstrated that Use Case Points can be used to predict software development effort for ES software development when the specification is expressed as use cases. In case of statechart based specifications, the development effort is predicted, like in the case of Hardware, using a complexity based cost estimating approach. The study then investigates factors that affect Integration and Reuse effort for ES D&D. The Integration and Reuse effort is predicted using a expert judgement based methodology. The developed results provide automotive industry with a structured, consistent approach to develop cost estimates for the ES D&D Cost at the specifications design stage.

40|$|Cost {{estimation}} is {{an essential}} skill in the construction industry. For each stage in the project life cycle, conceptual design till decommissioning, there are particular techniques to perform cost estimation. Starting from the preliminary design stage, <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> progressively become more detailed and more challenging as a task that requires more man-hours. Consequently, it is not feasible to be performed repetitively. Considering this, <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are only performed at specific points during the design and at the bidding; leaving gaps were project cost can grow out of control. This research proposes a methodology to develop an integrated cost budgeting and cost estimation model for building projects. The proposed model is implemented by integrating an automated quantity take-off system, with a relational database to generate <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> reports. The dynamic environment of the proposed model, streamlines the preparation of <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> in order to reflect, virtually instantly, the impact of changes in project scope on the cost. Accordingly, decision makers will be able to; venture various scenarios to meet the client budget without compromising the project quality, save tremendous amount of resource-hours allocated to prepare <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and cut down design process cost.
