5|$|Gilchrist's attacking batting {{has been}} {{a key part of}} Australia's one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He {{was a part of the}} {{successful}} 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. He is currently 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. He maintains a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing. He is second on the all-time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people claim that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> keeper in Australia whilst others claim that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry is the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E

500|$|Shand {{had nearly}} reduced Johnson to tears, having {{previously}} caused a senior police officer to cry during the hearing of a royal commission the year before. A colleague of Shand's recalled his [...] "capacity of insinuation in tone which could annoy {{and bring a}} witness into antagonism". Shand then asked Johnson about a hypothetical case of Barnes being selected in the future. Johnson evaded the matter of whether he would select the player until Shand asked him to assume that [...] "Barnes {{is in the best}} possible form and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> cricketer in Australia", to which Johnson replied that he would not.|$|E
500|$|In 1792 Juan De la Villebeuvre, {{who worked}} among the Indians {{on behalf of}} the Spanish government, was named a special {{commissioner}} to the Choctaws and Chickasaws. [...] Favre's reputation as a competent and valuable interpreter grew quickly, and in an undated letter to Governor Baron Francisco Carondelet, De la Villebeuvre wrote, [...] "...I am going to reside with Favre, who is employed by the king [...] and who will serve me as interpreter. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> one of the province, with a great influence over the minds of the Indians, and he knows how to lead them firmly whenever necessary."

500|$|Mold {{was popular}} with other cricketers. The Times said: [...] "Apart {{from the burning}} {{question}} of throwing, not a word could be said against him. He was liked by all his brother professionals, and popular wherever he played." [...] However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no-balled by Phillips. A batsman who played against him when he first appeared for Northamptonshire said: [...] "If he is fair <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bowler in England, but I {{think he is a}} worse thrower than ever Crossland [...] was." [...] Mold's Times obituary stated: [...] "He was a deadly fast bowler, but, all through his career, even his best feats in the cricket field were spoken of with something of apology".|$|E
500|$|Burton, who {{finished}} second, {{was happy with}} his performance, [...] " [...] Todd Berrier has come in and done a great job, the team’s done a great job. We had one hiccough early on pit road {{but the rest of}} them we picked out our spots every single time, and that’s what it takes; it takes a team effort." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was {{no doubt in my mind}} they were going to come this week and make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E
500|$|When the emissaries {{returned}} to Buenos Aires, {{the government was}} worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López. Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario, but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned. Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director. With {{the signing of the}} Santo Tomé pact, the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario. Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North, with the strong support of San Martín. [...] "In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau, I am decided for Belgrano; he is the most methodical man of all whom I know in America; he is full of integrity and natural talent. He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned, but I think <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> we have in South America".|$|E

500|$|James did {{not play}} at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England. He became {{the leader of the}} team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, {{stepping}} back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history. He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.

500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation. New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera said, [...] "It happened to the best umpire {{we have in our}} game. The best. And a perfect gentleman. ... It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they blew it. At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You don't. I feel for you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying he was sorry. But that doesn't help your situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid. He's probably wondering right now whose side God is on." ...|$|E
