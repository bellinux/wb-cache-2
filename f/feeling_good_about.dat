500|$|Critical {{response}} for [...] "Oh Father" [...] was generally positive. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , commented {{that with the}} track, Madonna exposed herself by transforming her personal experience into art, making it clear to anyone how she felt about her relationship with Tony. Rooksby believed that the [...] "psychobabble" [...] phrases of <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> oneself in the song, {{would have made it}} extremely popular in the early Eighties. He added that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was the most compassionate and generous moment in Madonna's musical career and the track might have inspired the exploration of childhood in the music of contemporary artists like Kate Bush and Tori Amos, in particular Bush's song [...] "The Fog" [...] from her 1989 studio album, The Sensual World, and Amos' [...] "Winter" [...] from the 1992 effort, Little Earthquakes. [...] Author Leslie C. Dunn wrote in her book Embodied Voices, that the autobiographical nature of the song brought forth a new side of Madonna. Sharing the same view, Freya Jarman-Ivens, {{one of the authors of}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds, declared [...] "Oh Father" [...] as a powerful statement regarding father-daughter relationships. Allen Metz, author of The Madonna Companion, described the song as a [...] "stark ballad with a serious string arrangement". O'Brien felt that the strings were dramatic and pretentious. She described Madonna's singing as consisting of [...] "Courtney Love-style rasp" [...] and adding that Madonna [...] "attacks the song with personal passion".|$|E

And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood. I {{tried to make}} a statement about <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> yourself and exploring your sexuality, but people took it to mean that everyone should go out and have sex with everyone, and that I {{was going to be the}} leader of that. So I decided to leave it alone because that's what everyone ended up concentrating on. Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the {{condition}} of healthy narcissism, {{it is suggested that}} this is correlated with good psychological health. Self-esteem works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. [...] Therefore, because of their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom. Other researchers suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad'; however, it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with other outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.|$|E
2500|$|After {{having served}} his suspension, Rypien {{struggled}} {{to remain in}} the Canucks' line-up and was made a regular healthy scratch. In late-November 2010, the Canucks allowed him another personal leave of absence. At this time, it began to be widely speculated in the media that Rypien was suffering from mental health issues. While the Canucks organization withheld any details regarding Rypien's situation, general manager Mike Gillis stated publicly that [...] "when you come to know somebody and realize they're a really good person…You don't only support them when they're {{at the top of their}} game…you support them when they're not <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> things or have other issues they have to deal with." [...] On March 8, 2011, Rypien returned from his leave and was assigned to the Moose. The NHL waived the two-week limit allowed for a conditioning stint, allowing the Canucks to leave him with the Moose for the remainder of the season and avoid his salary cap hit. Rypien completed his final season as a Canuck with one assist over nine games, while also recording two assists in 11 AHL games. He also helped the Moose to the second round of the playoffs, recording one goal in seven post-season games, before they were eliminated by the Hamilton Bulldogs.|$|E
40|$|Background: To assess patient' {{reaction}} towards bedside {{teaching in}} the nephrology ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (Tehran) and to identify the factors that may influence it. Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} the nephrology ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex from march to September, 2014. All inpatients present {{on the day of the}} study were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. 	 		 			 			Results: 146 patients were examined in this study that 62 patients (42. 5 %) were women and 84 cases (57. 5 %) were men. 112 (76. 7 %) of patients had a <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> the training to physicians. The behavior of students was evaluated respectful by 132 individuals (90. 4 % of patients). Total number of 106 individuals (72. 6 % of patients) had trusted to the health care team and 120 people (82. 2 % of patients) knew that the physicians’ behaviors are associated with the respect to their religious beliefs. Not being same sex of the examiners was important for 47 individuals (32. 2 % of patients). The number of 123 cases (84. 2 % of patients) evaluated the physicians' behavior with respect to their privacy. The number of 119 individuals (81. 5 % of patients) received their responses from the examiners. Statistical tests indicate a significant relationship between the respectful behavior of students with patient and <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> training to physicians, so that the 95. 5 % of people who have seen the respectful behavior of students to oneself had a <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> training to physicians (P˂ 0. 001). The relationship between the presence of teacher with students and <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> on training to physicians was significant (P= 0. 013). Positive feeling about practicing physicians was associated with patient age. So the age average of people who feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> practicing physicians was significantly lower than the other people (47. 2 ± 17 versus 55. 6 ± 18 and P= 0. 028). 			Conclusion: The relationship between respectful behavior and presence of teacher with students and age and <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> on training to physicians was significant...|$|R

2500|$|During {{its first}} three seasons in existence, Citi Field {{was known to}} play as a [...] "pitcher's park", and has been cited {{as the cause of}} the {{decreased}} offensive production of David Wright and Jason Bay. Wright hit only 10 home runs in 2009 after hitting at least 30 in the previous two seasons, while Bay had the worst offensive production of his career in his first season with the Mets in 2010, only hitting 6 home runs, 47 RBIs, and OBP of just [...]347, and a slugging percentage of a career low [...]402. Jeff Francoeur, who played with the Mets during their first two years at Citi Field, criticized the ballpark's dimensions, calling it [...] "a damn joke." [...] During the 2011 season, Citi Field allowed 1.33 home runs per game, the third lowest total out of the 16 National League ballparks. The team responded by altering the ballpark dimensions for the 2012 season, creating a more neutral ballpark. Wright's 2012 offensive numbers have improved due to the alterations. [...] "It's a huge difference", Wright said. [...] "It allows you to relax and know you don’t have to try to hit the ball a mile to see results. And at the same time, if you do hit the ball well and you see results, instead of a 400-foot flyout, you’re 1-for-1 and <b>feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> yourself." ...|$|E
