50|$|<b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> is {{sometimes}} incorrectly stated to exist {{to account for}} the effects of interlacing. Interlacing itself does not affect <b>Kell</b> <b>factor,</b> but because interlaced video must be low-pass filtered (i.e., blurred) in the vertical dimension to avoid spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e., flickering effects), the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> of interlaced video is said to be about 70% that of progressive video with the same scan line resolution.|$|E

40|$|The Perinatal Hemolytic Disease is {{a disease}} caused by the immune passage through the {{placenta}} and maternal antibody specific classIg G for the antigen (the paternal) present in fetal red blood cells, shortening its lifetime. Haemolytic disease by the system Rh (Cc, Ee,Dd) is the prototype of maternal all immunization and fetal hemolytic disease. In around 98 % of cases of maternal all immunization to erythrocyte antigens not (ABO hemolytic disease _ DHPN) are due to Rh (D), the remaining 2 % atypical antigens as <b>Kell</b> <b>factors,</b> E or C (Bowman, 1997). The D antigen is expressed only in red blood cells and is part of RH system with other antigens such as Cc, Ee, these alsohemolytic properties, but D is 50 times more immunogenic than the other antigens of the Rh system. The process of raising the maternal system Rh (D) is given by presence of Rh positive red blood cells in your MEDICAL 2 bloodstream, either during pregnancy via maternal-fetal transfusion (which can reach 29 % inlast quarter), transfusion of incompatible blood, abortion, and today, deserves the use of injected illicit drugs...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kell</b> <b>factor,</b> {{which limits}} the {{vertical}} resolution in analog television, and both {{horizontal and vertical}} resolution in digital television, to {{a fraction of the}} number of scan lines or pixels ...|$|E
50|$|For {{compatibility}} reasons, {{the horizontal}} bandwidth remains at 5.0 MHz. This {{means that a}} PALplus signal provides no extra horizontal resolution {{to compensate for the}} image being stretched across a wider screen. The result is a horizontal resolution that is 73% of the vertical resolution, or 51% when the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> is ignored.|$|E
50|$|From a {{different}} perspective, the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> defines the effective resolution of a discrete display device since the full resolution {{cannot be used}} without viewing experience degradation. The actual sampled resolution {{will depend on the}} spot size and intensity distribution. For electron gun scanning systems, the spot usually has a Gaussian intensity distribution. For CCDs, the distribution is somewhat rectangular, and is also affected by the sampling grid and inter-pixel spacing.|$|E
50|$|In the NTSC {{transmission}} standard, each field contains 262.5 lines, and 59.94 {{fields are}} transmitted every second. Each line must therefore take 63 microseconds, 10.7 {{of which are}} for reset to the next line. Thus, the retrace rate is 15.734 kHz. For the picture to appear to have approximately the same horizontal and vertical resolution (see <b>Kell</b> <b>factor),</b> it {{should be able to}} display 228 cycles per line, requiring a bandwidth of 4.28 MHz. If the line (sensor) width is known, this may be converted directly into cycles per millimeter, the unit of spatial resolution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the horizontal resolution that is required to match the vertical resolution attained by a given number of scan lines. For 576i at 50 Hz, given its 4:3 aspect ratio, the required horizontal resolution must be 4/3 times the effective vertical resolution, or (4/3)&times;0.7&times;576 = 537.6 pixels per line. Taken further, since 537.6 pixels is equal to a maximum of 268.8 cycles for an alternating pixel pattern, and given 576i 50 Hz has an active line period of 52µs, its luminance signal requires a bandwidth of 268.8/52 = 5.17 MHz.|$|E
5000|$|A 625-line analog (e.g., 50 Hz PAL) {{television}} picture {{is divided into}} 576 visible lines from top to bottom. Suppose a card featuring horizontal black and white stripes is {{placed in front of}} the camera. The effective vertical resolution of the TV system is equal to the largest number of stripes that can be within the picture height and appear as individual stripes. Since it is unlikely the stripes will line up perfectly with the lines on the camera's sensor, the number is slightly less than 576. Using a <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> of 0.7, the number can be determined to be 0.7&times;576 = 403.2 lines of resolution.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kell</b> <b>factor,</b> {{named after}} RCA {{engineer}} Raymond D. Kell, is a parameter used {{to limit the}} bandwidth of a sampled image signal to avoid the appearance of beat frequency patterns when displaying the image in a discrete display device, usually taken to be 0.7. The number was first measured in 1934 by Raymond D. Kell and his associates as 0.64 but has suffered several revisions given that {{it is based on}} image perception, hence subjective, and is not independent of the type of display. It was later revised to 0.85 but can go higher than 0.9, when fixed pixel scanning (e.g., CCD or CMOS) and fixed pixel displays (e.g., LCD or plasma) are used, or as low as 0.7 for electron gun scanning.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} how the distortion comes about, let us consider an ideal linear process from sampling to display. When a signal is sampled at a frequency that is at least double the Nyquist frequency, it can be fully reconstructed by low-pass filtering since the first repeat spectra does not overlap the original baseband spectra. In discrete displays the image signal is not low-pass filtered since the display takes discrete values as input, i.e. the signal displayed contains all the repeat spectra. The proximity of the highest frequency of the baseband signal to the lowest frequency of the first repeat spectra induces the beat frequency pattern. The pattern seen on screen can at times be similar to a Moiré pattern. The <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> is the reduction necessary in signal bandwidth such that no beat frequency is perceived by the viewer.|$|E
5000|$|MUSE's [...] "1125 lines" [...] are {{an analog}} measurement, which {{includes}} non-video [...] "scan lines" [...] during which a CRT's electron beam {{returns to the}} top of the screen to begin scanning the next field. Only 1035 lines have picture information. Digital signals count only the lines (rows of pixels) that have actual detail, so NTSC's 525 lines become 486i (rounded to 480 to be MPEG compatible), PAL's 625 lines become 576i, and MUSE would be 1035i. To convert the bandwidth of Hi-Vision MUSE into 'conventional' lines-of-horizontal resolution (as is used in the NTSC world), multiply 29.9 lines per MHz of bandwidth. (NTSC and PAL/SECAM are 79.9 lines per MHz) - this calculation of 29.9 lines works for all current HD systems including Blu-ray and HD-DVD. So, for MUSE, during a still picture, the lines of resolution would be: 598-lines of luminance resolution per-picture-height. The chroma resolution is: 209-lines. The horizontal luminance measurement approximately matches the vertical resolution of a 1080 interlaced image when the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> and interlace factor are taken into account.|$|E
5000|$|System E {{implementation}} provided {{very good}} (near HDTV) picture quality {{but with an}} uneconomical use of bandwidth; a 625/50 signal providing the same clarity as an 819-line image, but matted down 4:3 with {{the same number of}} lines, would still need nearly 6mhz for the vision carrier alone (vs typical 5 to 6mhz in actual use), and 5mhz for 525/60 (vs typical 4.2mhz), although a 405/50 transmission could get away with only 2.5mhz (typical 3mhz, as System A made no allowance for <b>Kell</b> <b>Factor</b> and thus had a [...] "narrow pixel"/"tall line" [...] appearance). Thus even an unusually crisp [...] "standard" [...] definition (or slightly soft 405-line) image only needed half, or even one-quarter the vision bandwidth of the 819-line system to give a [...] "balanced" [...] appearance, despite their lower overall resolution still seeming perfectly clear on the more affordable small-screen receivers often used in the pre-color era. With the usual additions of sound carrier and vestigial sideband the result was a combined signal that demanded approximately two to three times the bandwidth of more moderately specified standards, even when colour was added to them (as the color subcarrier resides within the luma signal space).|$|E
40|$|T HE <b>KELL</b> <b>FACTOR,</b> {{which has}} proved to be of conssiderable {{clinical}} interest, was discovered by Coombs, Mourant., and Race ’ when they introduced the direct antiglobulits test in the diagnosis of hemolytic disease of the newborns. lnstil 1950, seven cases of this disease due to the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> had beets published 2 and recently two more cases were added. 3. Seven transfusion reactions have beets observed its which the sera of the patient contained Kell antibody; however, three cases 5 6 were riot “pure”, for anti-Kell occurred together with other antibodies which masked the harmful effects of anti-Kell. Brief reference is made below to four transfusion reactions attributable to isoimmutsizat. ion by the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor.</b> Wiener ansd Sonn-Gordon 7 described, ins 1947, the case of a womati with four childrens who suffered from subacute bacterial endocarditis ansd received four blood transfusioiss, the last two followed by severe hemolytic reactions. Onse of the children aisd the last donor were Kell positive, but the other children and donors were not examined. The patient. whose serum contained anti-Kell was later given two uneveistful transfusions of compatible Kell negative blood. A secoisd transfusion reaction due to the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> has been mentioned but nsot described S Molhison#{ 176 } reported a hemolytic t. ratssfusion reactions caused by the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> occurring after about thirty blood t. ransfusionss its the course of eight years. Wiener et al. ’#{ 176 }investigated a case of autohemolytic disease with anemia in which more t. hais fifteens blood traissfusiotss had been givens. Serologic tests were complicated by the presence of autoatst. ibodies and survival of transsfused cells. The next blood transfusiots caused a mild hemolytic reaction, and at this time the patient was showns to be Kell negative and to have a strong incomplete Kell aistibody ins her serum. Thereaft. er, transfusions of Kell tsegative l) lood were well tolerated. In two of the four cases the hemolytic reactions were not severe, but ins {{at least one of the}} remainitsg cases the itscompatible transfusiots together with the generalized infections could have contributed to the fatal outcome. In the case to be presented, the <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> was doubtless the essential cause of death...|$|E
40|$|The High Definition {{scene is}} {{constantly}} changing. The arrival of Full HD flat panel displays, the constant {{improvement of the}} AVC encoder, and the trend towards 1920 x 1080 progressive broadcasting have changed the balances of the High Definition broadcasting chain. It is, therefore, required to revisit the TV-formats debate. This research project {{was set up to}} consider: End-viewer perceived quality for critical content when broadcasting 720 p/ 50, 1080 i/ 50, and 1080 p/ 50. End-viewer perceived quality for critical content encoded with MPEG 2, VC 1 and H. 264 /AVC in various bitrates. Industry trend to migrate from MPEG 2 at 18 Mbps to AVC at 12 Mbps. New techniques for better usage of the available bitrate. Research during the project showed that: MPEG 2 and AVC have different types of artifacts but the overall perceived quality is similar for the same bitrate. The choice depends on the viewer. 1080 i/ 50 quality is highly dependent on the set of(de-) interlacer. A possible solution for better bitrate usage could be frame sub-sampling prior the encoding and frame interpolation on the decoder. Tests showed that it can work only for content with smooth motion or temporally filtered. For a certain bitrate, there is an optimal tradeoff between the resolution format and the perceived quality. It is, though, highly content dependent and therefore not easily exploitable. The results of the perception test conducted showed that: 720 p, 1080 i, and 1080 p have differences in quality, not statistically significant for MPEG 2 encodings. 1080 p and 720 p are preferred to 1080 i for AVC encodings. Viewers prefer MPEG 2 artifacts to AVC arti-facts. Viewers prefer MPEG 2 at 18 Mbps to AVC at 12 Mbps Subjects that need to be investigated: The role of <b>Kell</b> <b>factor</b> in the comparison between 1080 p and 720 p for-mats.
