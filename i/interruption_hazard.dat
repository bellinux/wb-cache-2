40|$|AbstractIsoniazid mono-resistance is {{the most}} common {{first-line}} drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB), but its treatment outcome remains unclear. From January 2004 to October 2011, 425 (5. 1 %) of 8414 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB from four hospitals in Taiwan were identified as having isoniazid mono-resistant TB. Among them, 395 (92. 9 %) were included and followed up for 2 years after complete treatment. Although 328 (83. 0 %) patients were successfully treated, 67 (17. 0 %) had unfavourable outcomes, including death in 56 (14. 2 %) and treatment failure in 11 (2. 8 %). The treatment success rate was similar in patients with high-level and low-level isoniazid-resistant TB (82. 2 % versus 83. 4 %, p 0. 785) and among those taking anti-TB treatment with and without isoniazid (83. 1 % versus 83. 0 %, p  1. 000). Patients without rifampicin interruption had lower risk of unfavourable outcome (14. 3 % versus 37. 0 %, p 12 months had less relapse than 6 -month treatment (3. 2 %, 0 %, 3. 7 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, p 0. 037). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that co-morbidity with cancer (hazard ratio, 2. 43) and rifampicin <b>interruption</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio 1. 91) were independent factors associated with unfavourable outcomes. Treatment throughout with rifampicin and extended treatment for cavitary disease are crucial for improving outcomes in patients with isoniazid mono-resistant TB...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Guidance {{is needed}} on best medical {{management}} for advanced HIV disease with multidrug resistance (MDR) and limited retreatment options. We assessed two novel antiretroviral (ARV) treatment approaches in this setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a 2 × 2 factorial randomized open label controlled trial {{in patients with}} a CD 4 count≤ 300 cells/µl who had ARV treatment (ART) failure requiring retreatment, to two options (a) re-treatment with either standard (≤ 4 ARVs) or intensive (≥ 5 ARVs) ART and b) either treatment starting immediately or after a 12 -week monitored ART interruption. Primary outcome was time to developing a first AIDS-defining event (ADE) or death from any cause. Analysis was by intention to treat. From 2001 to 2006, 368 patients were randomized. At baseline, mean age was 48 years, 2 % were women, median CD 4 count was 106 /µl, mean viral load was 4. 74 log(10) copies/ml, and 59 % had a prior AIDS diagnosis. Median follow-up was 4. 0 years in 1249 person-years of observation. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in the primary composite outcome of ADE or death between re-treatment options of standard versus intensive ART (hazard ratio 1. 17; CI 0. 86 - 1. 59), or between immediate retreatment initiation versus <b>interruption</b> before re-treatment (<b>hazard</b> ratio 0. 93; CI 0. 68 - 1. 30), or in the rate of non-HIV associated serious adverse events between re-treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe clinical benefit or harm assessed by the primary outcome in this largest and longest trial exploring both ART interruption and intensification in advanced MDR HIV infection with poor retreatment options.

40|$|Constellations of {{hundreds}} of low-Earth orbiting small satellites are currently being designed and built. Operators plan to provide data and media distribution services as well as imaging and weather observations. As our society increases its dependence on satellite services for communication and navigation, {{there is a growing}} need for efficient spacecraft systems monitoring and space situational awareness to avoid service <b>interruptions</b> due to <b>hazards</b> such as space weather. Particularly for large constellations, satellites need greater autonomy to improve responsivity and reduce the load on human operators. In this thesis, we present the development of algorithms that identify unusual behavior in satellite health telemetry. Once these events have been identified, we collect and analyze them, along with assessing space weather observations and operational environment factors. Our approach uses transient event detection and change-point event detection techniques, statistically evaluating the telemetry stream compared to a local norm. This approach allows us to apply our algorithms to any spacecraft platform, since there is no reliance on satellite- or component-specific parameters, and it does not require a priori knowledge about the data distribution. We apply these techniques to individual telemetry data streams on geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) communications satellites (ComSats), and consider the results, a compiled list of unusual events for each satellite. Results include being able to identify events that affect many telemetry streams at once, indicative of a spacecraft system-level event. With data from multiple satellites, we can use these methods to better determine whether external factors played a role. We compare event dates to known operational activities and to known space weather events to assess the use of event detection algorithms for spacecraft monitoring and for environmental sensing. by Ashley Kelly Carlton.

40|$|A review with 176 refs. Rapidly burgeoning population, declining {{productivity}} and increasing vulnerability to agriculture {{as a result}} of climate change are imposing serious concern over global food security. Biotic stresses alone take a heavy toll of the 5 billion tons of food that is currently produced annually and plant diseases alone reduce global food prodn. by more than 10 %. These have necessitated the practise of modern agriculture with the use of enormous amts. of chems. both to manage diseases and increase yield. Overuse and overdependence on chem. pesticides have resulted in pollution, neg. health <b>hazards,</b> <b>interruption</b> of natural ecol. nutrient cycling and destruction of biol. communities that otherwise supported crop prodn. Hence, there is a realization for technologies that would complement resistance breeding and pesticide use in disease management with newer approaches that could replace or supplement the conventional methods. To control plant diseases, host resistance, chem. protection, biol. control, induction of resistance and transgenic plants are proposed. Utilization of a plant's own defense mechanism by application of technologies to induce resistance is emerging as one of the important ecofriendly strategies for crop protection that avoids the use of synthetic pesticides. In many plants, a long lasting, broad spectrum resistance can be induced locally and systemically after local infection with necrotrophic micro-organisms and it is referred to as Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR). In the past ten years, there has been significant progress in understanding the mol. events that occur during initiation and maintenance of SAR. In the classical model of SAR, a signal produced by an infected leaf moves through the vascular tissue to uninfected leaves where it induces pathogenesis related proteins and assocd. resistance to subsequent pathogen attack. Mechanism of induced resistance phenomenon has been elucidated and utilized in developing strategies for plant disease management. Agricultural significance to protect the yield and sustainability in ecosystem has also been elucidated. This review analyses the current ability and prospects in activating defense systems in plants for effective control of diseases focusing mainly on the induction of systemic resistance. Exptl. results and possibility to control downy mildew disease in pearl millet crop in semi-arid region is highlighted. In view of its economic, social, environmental and biotechnol. perspectives, future prospects and challenges of induced resistance, as a component of Integrated Pest Management have also been discussed.
