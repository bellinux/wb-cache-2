50|$|If {{correctly}} {{shaped and}} manufactured, glass {{can be a}} functional material: comfortable to wear, tough, and safe for the body. However, cheaper glass beads that are not covered in a metal shell can easily break into shards. If you <b>drop</b> <b>glass</b> jewelry on the floor, you probably won't {{be able to use}} it again. Also if you have a cheap bead in a tongue piercing and accidentally chew on it, it can break into tiny shards and cause lacerations.|$|E

In the subway level, the player must go through a maze and collect Waldo and his <b>dropped</b> <b>glasses</b> in order to exit the stage. The player must also avoid Wizard Whitebeard, who can quickly {{subtract}} time if the player lands on his spot. And in the final level, the player must match three pictures of Waldo {{in order to get}} Waldo to the moon.|$|R

5000|$|Prince Rupert's drops are {{produced}} by <b>dropping</b> molten <b>glass</b> <b>drops</b> into cold water. The water rapidly cools and solidifies the glass from the outside inward. This thermal quenching may be described using a simplified model of a rapidly cooled sphere.

25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a <b>glass</b> <b>dropping</b> on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to <b>drop</b> the <b>glass</b> on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply {{in the nature of the}} instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.|$|R
