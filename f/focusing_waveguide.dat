40|$|In this dissertation, some {{analysis}} tools {{for the study}} of integrated devices applied in optical-disk memory system are investigated. These applications include the gradient-index media used in waveguide lenses and the <b>waveguide</b> <b>focusing</b> grating coupler. Previous studies of gradient-index components have largely been either strictly geometrical in nature or based on the split-step procedure, which are not sufficient for design and analysis purposes. In this dissertation, some beam propagation methods based on paraxial optics are presented, which facilitate diffraction propagation calculation in all types of optical systems that have modest amounts of aberrations, including gradient-index elements. It is also shown that not only is it possible to apply the beam propagation method accurately to stigmatic gradient-index media, but also a propagation distance of any length may be taken without using the split-step method. The Maxwell's fisheye lens is discussed in detail to show application of these methods. <b>Waveguide</b> <b>focusing</b> grating couplers are modeled in detail.

The elements {{of the circuit model}} are explained and the current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics are investigated. Special attention is paid to the series resistance, which is an important limiting factor for the conversion efficiency of HBV frequency multipliers. HBVs can be fabricated from various material systems. An overview of the heterostructures suitable for HBVs is presented, with special emphasis on GaAs/AlGaAs on GaAs and InGaAs/InAlAs on InP which are the most common HBV material systems. The fabrication processes for planar, whisker contacted and pillar geometry HBVs are described. A process where whisker contacted HBVs are fabricated on a copper substrate is presented in detail. By replacing the substrate with copper, the thermal properties of the HBVs are improved drastically. Self-heating reduces the conversion efficiency of HBV frequency multipliers. Therefore, it is important to reduce the thermal resistance of HBVs. Improved diode geometries and thermal models are presented.

40|$|In free space, the {{diffraction}} limit sets a {{lower bound}} to the size to which light can be confined. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are electromagnetic waves {{bound to the}} interface between a metal and a dielectric, allow the control of light on subwavelength length scales. This opens up a rich world of opportunities in science and technology, ranging from lighting and photovoltaics to photonic circuits and quantum optics. This thesis explores new ways to tailor the properties of SPPs such that they enable the confinement of light at nanoscale dimensions. A variety of metallodielectric geometries are used that can serve as waveguides for SPPs. We show how the SPP propagation characteristics can be controlled, and how light can be concentrated in subwavelength volumes by tapering and truncating the waveguides. In Chapter 2 we use a near-field microscope to image the fields of SPPs that are squeezed into a 50 ~nm thick dielectric layer between two Ag surfaces, showing that the wavelength of SPPs is significantly shortened with respect to that of light. Chapter 3 <b>focuses</b> on specific <b>waveguided</b> SPP modes that can exhibit a negative effective index of refraction. This enables negative refraction of light into the waveguide at optical frequencies. Chapters 4 and 5 show that the concentration of infrared SPPs in laterally tapered Ag stripe waveguides enhances the upconversion of infrared to visible light in Er ions in the substrate. SPPs focus at the 65 nm large taper apex. Calculations show that the observed focusing effect can only occur for SPPs at the interface between the metal stripe and the high-index substrate. The <b>focusing</b> in tapered <b>waveguides</b> is {{explained in terms of}} an adiabatic transformation of a SPP mode guided by the waveguides in Chapter 6. Tapered waveguides are used to efficiently excite SPPs on metal nanowires with diameters as small as 60 nm. Phase- and polarization-sensitive near-field microscopy allows retrieval of the propagation speed and the polarization nature of the excited nanowire mode. The efficiency with which a taper couples light to a nanowire is measured to be 50 %. In Chapter 7, we show that SPPs that propagate onto a Si wedge on Ag come to a halt at a specific wedge thickness, concentrating energy in a subwavelength focus. Chapter 8 investigates field enhancement at a wavelength of 1. 5 m in arrays of subwavelength apertures in a metal film. We study the enhanced excitation of Er ions positioned close to the metal film by collecting Er upconversion emission. Both propagating and localized SPP resonances are studied. The field enhancement due to localized resonances is shown to be independent of the incident angle. Chapter 9 describes the enhancement of the radiative emission rate of Er ions placed inside annular apertures. An increase of both the photoluminescence intensity and the photoluminescence decay rate is observed when the aperture resonance is tuned to the Er emission wavelength.

An example is gven {{of the development of}} an instrument based on the use of an integrated optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) refractive index transducer. The technique is especially promising for application to multianalyte sensors where several outputs need to be interrogated simultaneously. The high sensitivity and low noise demonstrated by the system will enable the use of cheap, stable LED light sources in practical instruments. Introduction: Integrated optical transducers for the real-time measurement of interactions between biological molecules and for the specific detection of chemical and biochemical species are the subject of growing interest. Applications of this technology include environmental pollution monitoring, industrial process control and medical diagnostics. Integrated optical sensors provide the high detection sensitivity achievable using optical transduction techniques in a compact and robust format. This approach also offers advantages for the fabrication of multianalyte sensors through the integration of multiple transducers on a single chip by straightforward scaling of the photolithographic production process. Several types of integrated optical sensor have been described (e. g. [1 - 3]), but no commercially viable multianalyte system currently exists and, in order to fully exploit this technology in practical instrumentation, {{inexpensive and}} reliable techniques for addressing the multiple outputs of waveguide devices must be found. Fibre-to-chip pigtailing of integrated optical devices formed in 'passive' materials such as glass, where it is difficult to truly integrate monolithic light sources and detectors, is not the best solution when dealing with multiple outputs due to the necessity of producing and pigtailing fibre arrays. For single input devices, however, fibre input coupling is still a viable option as only a single pigtail needs to be made. In this paper we present measurements on multiple-output integrated optical sensor devices using fibre input coupling and a cheap, readily available, 1 D CCD array detector to simultaneously address all outputs. A lens is used to <b>focus</b> the <b>waveguide</b> outputs onto the array, resulting in a compact unit that can be housed in a standard instrument package.

The optical frequency comb has been extensively studied because of its precision as a tool for spectroscopy, and is now widely used in bio- and chemical sensors, optical clocks, mode-locked dark pulse generation, soliton generation, and optical communication. Recently, thanks to the developments in nanotechnology, the optical frequency comb generation is made possible at a chip-scale level with microresonators. However, because the threshold power of the optical frequency comb generation is beyond the capability of the on-chip laser source, efficient microresonator is required.

Lasing action is achieved by using optical intersubband transitions between quantized states in specifically designed multiple-quantum-well heterostructures.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} various {{methods for}} producing photon pairs from waveguides. It covers relevant {{topics such as}} waveguide coupling and phase matching, along with the relevant measurement techniques used to infer photon pair production. A new proposal to solve the phase matching problem is described along with two conceptual methods for generating entangled photon pairs. Photon pairs are also experimentally demonstrated from a third novel structure called a Bragg Reflection Waveguide (BRW). The new proposal to solve the phase matching problem is called Directional Quasi-Phase Matching (DQPM). It is a technique that exploits the directional dependence of the non-linear susceptiblity (χ^(2)) tensor. It is aimed at those materials that do not allow birefringent phase-matching or periodic poling. In particular, it <b>focuses</b> on <b>waveguides</b> in which the interplay between the propagation direction, electric field polarizations and the nonlinearity can change the strength and sign of the nonlinear interaction periodically to achieve quasi-phasematching. One of the new conceptual methods for generating entangled photon pairs involves a new technique that sandwiches two waveguides from two differently oriented but similar crystals together. The idea stems from {{the design of a}} Michelson interferometer which interferes the paths over which two unique photon pair processes can occur, thereby creating entanglement in any pair of photons created in the interferometer. By forcing or sandwiching the two waveguides together, the physical space that exists in the standard Micheleson type interferometer is made non-existent, and the interferometer is effectively squashed. The result is that the two unique photon pair processes actually occupy the same physical path. This benefits the stability of the interferometer in addition to miniaturizing it. The technical challenges involved in sandwiching the two waveguides are briefly discussed. The main result of this thesis is the observation of photon pairs from the BRW. By analyzing the time correlation between two single photon detection events, spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) of a picosecond pulsed ti:sapph laser is demonstrated. The process is mediated by a ridge BRW. The results show evidence for type- 0, type-I and type-II phase matching of pump light at 783 nm, 786 nm and 789 nm to down converted light that is strongly degenerate at 1566 nm, 1572 nm, and 1578 nm respectively. The inferred efficiency of the BRW was 9. 8 · 10 ^- 9 photon pairs per pump photon. This contrasts with the predicted type- 0 efficiency of 2. 65 · 10 ^- 11. This data is presented {{for the first time in}} such waveguides, and represents significant advances towards the integration of sources of quantum information into the existing telecommunications infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} data traffic has {{initiated}} {{the development of}} optical telecommunications. Due to explosive growth of optical network, has brought forward an increased need for guided-wave optical component. The purpose of this work is to investigate the temperature profile in the thermo-optic waveguide. Here, we use one and two dimensional model to analyze the thermal model. We <b>focus</b> on polymer <b>waveguide</b> since these technology is attractive for many advantages, including large thermo-optic coefficient (for Polyurethane (PUR) : dn/dt ~ - 3. 3 - 4 K- 1) and low thermal conductivity (~ 0. 19 W m- 1 K- 1). The buried and rib waveguide structure is used for two dimensional model thermal analysis. We interested to see how heating the heater will change the refractive index and change the profile in the waveguide. Thermal coupling became next task of this project. We analyze the effect of heater to the nearby waveguide. To perform this analysis, we utilized a commercial finite element method (FEMLAB 2. 0), which is a tool for PDE-based multiphysics modelling in an interactive environment-MATLAB. The simulated result will use one and two dimensional model respectively. Effective index change is dependency of heater size as well as distance between core to the heater. Increasing 1 µm of heater width will reduce - 0. 1 of dneff/dt it also increasing the power consumption. Thermal coupling is related to waveguide spacing and depth. The coupling estimation is increase with the waveguide depth but decrease with the waveguide spacing. Apply trench structure can reduce the thermal coupling estimation, K. The temperature of heated waveguide decreases as the trench depth increases, therefore it requires less power in performing its function. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum dynamics of a generic model of light-matter interaction {{in the context}} of high-impedance <b>waveguides,</b> <b>focusing</b> on the behavior of the photonic states generated in the waveguide. The model treated consists simply of a two-level system coupled to a bosonic bath (the Ohmic spin-boson model). Quantum quenches as well as scattering of an incident coherent pulse are studied using two complementary methods. First, we develop an approximate ansatz for the electromagnetic waves based on a single multimode coherent state wave function; formally, this approach combines in a single framework ideas from adiabatic renormalization, the Born-Markov approximation, and input-output theory. Second, we present numerically exact results for scattering of a weak intensity pulse by using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations. NRG provides a benchmark for any linear response property throughout the ultrastrong-coupling regime. We find that in a sudden quantum quench, the coherent state approach produces physical artifacts, such as improper relaxation to the steady state. These previously unnoticed problems are related to the simplified form of the ansatz that generates spurious correlations within the bath. In the scattering problem, NRG is used to find the transmission and reflection of a single photon, as well as the inelastic scattering of that single photon. Simple analytical formulas are established and tested against the NRG data that predict quantitatively the transport coefficients for up to moderate environmental impedance. These formulas resolve pending issues regarding the presence of inelastic losses in the spin-boson model near absorption resonances, and could be used for comparison to experiments in Josephson waveguide quantum electrodynamics. Finally, the scattering results using the coherent state wave-function approach are compared favorably to the NRG results for very weak incident intensity. We end our study by presenting results at higher power where the response of the system is nonlinear...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project explored {{the potential of}} forming an integrated optics technology based on silicon core waveguides suitable for application in sensors and communications in the wavelength range 1. 2 to 1. 6 mum. Integrated optics has evolved around the use of compounds such as lithium niobate and III-V semiconductors due to their available electro-optic properties. By contrast silicon has received relatively little attention as its indirect band gap has prevented the fabrication of light sources in the material and its centrosymmetric crystal structure means {{that it has no}} useful linear electro-optic effect. The lack of a demonstrated low loss integrated optical waveguide compatible with single mode optical fibres has been a further limitation. However, these major drawbacks in silicon waveguide technology may be more than offset by the potential advantages of forming silicon integrated optical devices using well established silicon microelectronics fabrication methods. The project <b>focused</b> research on <b>waveguiding</b> in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures with the aim of developing a practical low loss waveguide in these structures and understanding the various loss mechanisms. In principle the optical absorption of pure crystalline silicon over the wavelength range of interest allows waveguides with losses less than 0. 1 dB/cm to be formed. SOI material formed by ion implantation has been developed for microelectronic applications and provides a commercial source of a silicon planar waveguide structure with high quality interfaces and low defect density. The project studied waveguides based on this material. Initially planar waveguides with silicon thickness from 0. 57 to 7. 3 microns and buried oxide thickness of 0. 07 to 0. 4 microns were studied. Fabrication methods and structures were identified which allowed multi-microns planar SOI waveguides to be formed with losses less than the benchmark of 1 dB/cm. For these structures a buried oxide thickness of 0. 4 microns was found to be sufficient to prevent substrate leakage loss. It has been concluded that the predominate loss mechanism is scattering of light at the silicon to buried oxide interface. Rib waveguides were formed in SOI following the insight into loss mechanisms gained in the planar waveguide studies. Optical rib waveguides with widths from 2. 73 to 7. 73 microns were formed in SIMOX (Separation by IMplantation of OXygen) based SOI structures consisting of a 4. 32 micron thick surface silicon layer and a 0. 398 micron buried oxide layer. The effect of waveguide width, bend radius, Y-junction splitting and interface roughness on loss and mode characteristics were studied at wavelengths of 1. 15 and 1. 523 microns. The experimental results support the hypothesis that certain rib dimensions can lead to single mode waveguides even though planar SOI waveguides of similar multi-micron dimension are multimode. The propagation losses of waveguides 3. 72 microns wide were found to be 0. 0 dB/cm and 0. 4 dB/cm for the TE and TM modes respectively when measured at 1. 523 microns. The measurement uncertainty was estimated to be +/- 0. 5 dB/cm. These results are thought to be the lowest loss measurements for silicon integrated optical waveguides reported to date. During the course of the project other researchers have demonstrated useful electro-optic properties in silicon semiconductor junctions based on the free carrier plasma dispersion effect and room temperature electroluminescence in silicon based junctions. The combination of these developments with the practical waveguide structure demonstrated in this project now makes the possibility of developing a practical silicon based integrated optics technology a reality...|$|R
