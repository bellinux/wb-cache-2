40|$|The use and {{applications}} of composites are expanding these days. Due to light weight,high specific strength and stiffness,composite materials are being widely {{used as a}} part of wind turbine blades and ship building. For high temperature applications,Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) are preferred over laminated composites because of its good performance in the thermal <b>field.</b> <b>Chopper</b> blades, turbine cutting blades,marine propellers,compressor blades, fan shape blades,and mostly gas turbines use pre-twisted cantilever plates. Often they are subjected to thermal environments,and thus FGMs are a decent option to metal plates. Composite structures with cut-outs are usually employed in engineering structures. In structural components cut-outs are provided sometimes to lighten the structure and for proper ventilation. Cut-outs in aircraft components (for example,fuselage,ribs and wing spar) are required for inspection,access,fuel lines and electric lines or to minimize the general weight of the aircraft. Study of buckling of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates with and without holes and with varying applied in-plane loads is dealt in the present work. The analysis is carried out by using ANSYS. An element having six degrees of freedom per node SHELL- 281 is used. The FGM plate is assumed to be a laminated section containing a number of layers with a steady variation of the material property through the thickness,where each layer is taken as isotropic. Material properties in each layer are determined using power law. Results obtained from convergence studies, carried out by using 12 number of layers and 12 by 12 mesh, are found to be quite accurate. Buckling behavior of cantilever twisted FGM plates with and without cut-outs and for different non-uniform applied in-plane loads are studied for the effect of various parameters like material gradient index,aspect ratio, side to thickness ratio, diameter of cut-outs and twist angle...|$|E

The chopper wIl 1 be used to control the initial population of longitudinal phase space in order to eliminate rf capture losses and achieve an optimal phaw space density distribution. The chopper operates 011 the 35 keV H- beam between the ion source and the RFQ.

40|$|Neutron Source {{operates}} at 30 Hz. Its beam spill must be locked to neutron choppers with a precision of 5 0. 5 US. A chopper and an accelerator have large and diff-erent inertias. This makes synchronization by phase lock to the 60 Hz power line extremely difficult. We solved the phasing problem by running both the Ring Magnet Power Supply (RMPS) of the synchrotron and the chopper motors {{from a common}} oscillator that is stable to 1 ppm and by controlling five quantities of the RMPS. The quantities controlled by feedback loops are dc current, injection current, ejection current, reso-nant frequency, and the phase shift between the syn-chrotron peak <b>field</b> and the <b>chopper</b> window...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been done for {{establishing}} analytical theory and design method of a chopper circuit that {{is a kind of}} D. C. amplifiers. 　This paper cosists of seven chapters and an appendix. 　In chapter 1, introduction, chopper circuits are compared with conventional D. C. amplifiers in regard to every characteristics and the <b>fields</b> utilizing effectively <b>chopper</b> circuits are clarified. The purpose and the summary of this study are described in this chapter. 　In chapter 2, is described the approximate solution of chopper circuits which have larger time constants than chopper 2 ̆ 7 s switching period; general formulas are obtained by using the special characteristics of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltage and current, and by using the approximation of circuit impedances. The frequency response and so on are easily obtained by inserting elements of Y-matrix of chopper circuits in to the general formulas. Characteristics of each fundamental circuit are investigated in detail and the most suitable contact ratio of choppers at which the gain of chopper amplifiers changes scarcely is obtained by using the general formulas. The error of the approximate solution is also investigated with experiments. 　In chapter 3, is first described the performance calculation for chopper circuits comprising two choppers at least of which the performance can not be analysed independently. The performance calculation is obtained by using the products of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s characteristic functions and the analytical method used in chapter 2. The performance calculation is available for analysing balanced modulating circuits or chopper amplifiers with negative feedback, and coincides closely with experimental values. The differential type of a wide-band chopper amplifier is described next and is the one which broadens the freqency band width withou tmaking a switchinig frequency higher and by increasing the nurnber of a mechanical chopper. The analysis and the design method of the differential type is also given in this chapter. 　In chapter 4, is described the precice analysis of chopper circuits. The general successive formulas of chopper circuits are obtained by the concept of T transform or modified Laplace transform and give the precice values of chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltages. Initial values at each switching period is not neccesary for using the successive formulas, so the chopper 2 ̆ 7 s terminal voltages may be easily calculated by the successive formluas. The precice solution coincides with the approximate solution if the time contsants of chopper circuits are sufficiently large. The stability criterion can be obtained by the precice solution. 　In chapter 5, it is described how negative feedback has influence on the characteristics of chopper circuits. It is shown by the theory and the experiment that higher harmonics generated in the demodulating circuits of the conventional chopper amplifiers do not change and higher harmonics of the wide-band chopper amplifiers can be sufficiently decreased by negative feedback. The upper limit of negative feedback is obtained by the precice solution {{for the sake of the}} design of chopper amplifiers with negtive feedback. It is clarified that a circuit which is considered as stable in general may be unstable with specialmechanism of oscillation. The upper limit of negativefeedback of the complex circuits considered as hard to be calculated by the theory, is obtained by the experiment...|$|R
