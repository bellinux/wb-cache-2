5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for <b>heat.</b> <b>For</b> example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide <b>heat</b> <b>for</b> local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past {{him on the}} home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} <b>heat</b> <b>for</b> the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{has played}} six-and-a-half seasons (1994–2001) for the Bullets {{franchise}} (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004–07) for the Houston Rockets, two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie {{year with the}} Bullets, {{he became the first}} player to graduate on time with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an All-Rookie player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make salary cap room. He was most recently a regular starter during the 2005–06 NBA season. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career NBA Finals appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the <b>Heat</b> <b>for</b> part of the following season, and won a second championship. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.|$|E

He and Mysterio formed an {{alliance}} with Master P and his No Limit Soldiers and fought with The West Texas Rednecks. After Master P left WCW, Konnan formed a stable known as The Filthy Animals. He and Mysterio, representing the Filthy Animals, defeated Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on October 18, 1999. They were scheduled to defend the titles against Harlem Heat in the MGM Grand Garden Arena on October 24, 1999 at Halloween Havoc, but {{on the night of}} the event Mysterio was announced as being injured. The title was then contested in a three way tag match pitting Konnan and Billy Kidman, representing the Filthy Animals, against Harlem Heat and the First Family (Hugh Morrus and Brian Knobs). Harlem Heat regained the title after Stevie Ray pinned Morrus. Konnan and Kidman defeated Harlem <b>Heat</b> <b>for</b> the title the next night on Nitro, but lost to Harris Brothers (Ron and Don Harris) on November 22, 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of <b>heat</b> <b>for</b> their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate effects of heat-oxidized soy protein isolate (HSPI) on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, apparent nutrient digestibility and digestive function of broiler chickens. A total of 320 1 -day-old Arbor Acres chicks were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 replicates of 10 birds, receiving diets containing soy protein isolate (SPI, control group) or the same amount of SPI heated in an oven at 100 °C for 1, 4, or 8 h, for 21 days, respectively. The results indicated that compared with the control group, body weight gain and feed intake of birds fed diet containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 8 h were significantly lower (p< 0. 05). Serum urea nitrogen concentration was higher in the broilers fed diet containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 4 or 8 h at d 21 (p< 0. 05). In contrast, serum glucose content was decreased by HSPI substitution at d 21 (p< 0. 05). The relative pancreas weight in HSPI groups was higher than that in the control group at d 21 (p< 0. 05). Meanwhile, the opposite effect was observed for relative weight of anterior intestine and ileum in broilers fed a diet containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 8 h (p< 0. 05). Birds fed diets containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 4 or 8 h had a decreased lipase activity in anterior intestinal content at d 14 and 21 (p< 0. 05), respectively. In addition, the same effect was also noted in broilers given diets containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 1 h at d 21 (p< 0. 05). Similarly, amylase, protease and trypsin activity in anterior intestinal content were lower in broilers fed diets containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 8 h at d 21 (p< 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM) from d 8 to 10 and DM, crude protein (CP), and ether extract from d 15 to 17 were lower in broilers fed diets containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 8 h (p< 0. 05). Besides, birds given diets containing SPI <b>heated</b> <b>for</b> 4 h also exhibited lower CP apparent digestibility from d 15 to 17 (p< 0. 05). It was concluded that HSPI inclusion can exert a negative influence on the growth performance of broilers, which was likely to result from the simultaneously compromised digestive function...|$|R
