Nulli certe quamdiu rex manet. Semper enim ex divinis id obstat, Regem honorificato; & qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resisit: non alias igitur in eum populo potestas est quam si id committat propter quod <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> rex esse desinat. Tunc enim se ipse principatu exuit atque in privatis constituit liber: hoc modo populus & {{superior}} efficitur, reverso ad eum sc. jure illo quod ante regem inauguratum in interregno habuit. At sunt paucorum generum commissa ejusmodi quae hunc effectum pariunt. At ego cum plurima animo perlustrem, duo tantum invenio, duos, inquam, casus quibus rex ipso facto ex rege non regem se facit & omni honore & dignitate regali atque in subditos potestate destituit; quorum etiam meminit Winzerus. Horum unus est, Si regnum disperdat, quemadmodum de Nerone fertur, quod is nempe senatum populumque Romanum, atque adeo urbem ipsam ferro flammaque vastare, ac novas sibi sedes quaerere decrevisset. Et de Caligula, quod palam denunciarit se neque civem neque principem senatui amplius fore, inque animo habuerit interempto utriusque ordinis electissimo quoque Alexandriam commigrare, ac ut populum uno ictu interimeret, unam ei cervicem optavit. Talia cum rex aliquis meditator & molitur serio, omnem regnandi curam & animum ilico abjicit, ac proinde imperium in subditos amittit, ut dominus servi pro derelicto habiti dominium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ipso</b> <b>jure</b> is a Latin phrase, {{directly}} {{translated as}} by operation of law. It {{is used as}} an adverb.|$|E
50|$|The {{phrase is}} used to {{describe}} legal consequences that occur by the act of the law itself. For example, if property is held in a tenancy by the entirety by a husband and wife, who then get divorced, the property is converted <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> (i.e. by the law itself) into another form of tenancy, usually a tenancy in common, at the very instant the marriage is dissolved. Likewise, contracts that establish partnerships sometimes provide that the partnership is <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> dissolved if one partner attempts to sell his or her interest in the partnership. In all of these situations, when one legally significant fact occurs, other relationships are automatically changed by the law.|$|E
50|$|Under {{foundation}} (fundatio) in {{the broader}} sense is included the granting of the necessary means for the erection and maintenance of a benefice. Thus, granting that a church is necessary to a benefice, three things are requisite: the assignment of land, the erection of the church at one's private expense (aedificatio), and the granting of the means necessary {{for the support of}} the church and beneficiaries (dotatio). If the same person fulfills all three requirements, he becomes <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> patron, unless he waives his claim. Different persons performing these three acts become co-patrons. It is an accepted theory that one who is responsible for only one of the three acts mentioned, the other two conditions being fulfilled in any manner whatsoever, becomes a patron. It is possible to become a patron also through the reædiftatio ecclesiæ (rebuilding a church) and redotatio beneficii (reendowing the benefice).|$|E

The effect of such a stipulation was well settled in Louisiana. In Nathan v. Lee, 2 Martin N.S. 32, the effect was decided to be that"the mortgagee is not bound to pursue a third possessor, but may have the hypothecated property seized in via executina as if no change had taken place in its possessors, because any alienation or transfer made in violation of the pact de non alienando is <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> void, {{as it relates to the}} creditor, and that this effect of the pact is not annulled by the provisions of the Civil Code in relation to mortgages, and the rules laid down for pursuing the action of mortgage." ...|$|E

50|$|Additionally, as the {{international}} community considered the status of Jerusalem to be unresolved, even after 1967, and did not deem {{any part of the}} city to be Israeli territory, including that part held since 1948, UNSC 242 did not settle territorial issues between Israel and Palestine left unresolved by the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Indeed, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht and others have argued that, because of the disorder in Palestine at the time, the territorial framework of the 1947 Partition Plan did not come into effect {{in such a way as}} to <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> grant Israel sovereignty over the territory allocated to the Jewish state under that plan. Stone agrees with Lauterpacht's analysis, and his view that sovereignty was acquired through other means:Lauterpacht has offered a cogent legal analysis leading to the conclusion that sovereignty over Jerusalem has already vested in Israel. His view is that when the partition proposals were immediately rejected and aborted by Arab armed aggression, those proposals could not, both because of their inherent nature and because of the terms in which they were framed, operate as an effective legal re-disposition of the sovereign title. They might (he thinks) have been transformed by agreement of the parties concerned into a consensual root of title, but this never happened. And he points out that the idea that some kind of title remained in the United Nations is quite at odds, both with the absence of any evidence of vesting, and with complete United Nations silence on this aspect of the matter from 1950 to 1967?... In these circumstances, that writer is led to the view that there was, following the British withdrawal and the abortion of the partition proposals, a lapse or vacancy or vacuum of sovereignty. In this situation of sovereignty vacuum, he thinks, sovereignty could be forthwith acquired by any state that was in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means.|$|E

40|$|The working {{draft of}} the Civil Code of Serbia, which was {{published}} in June 2015, includes model-provisions on surrogate motherhood, which is, at present, expressly prohibited by law. The paper gives a survey of the proposed provisions and examines particularly those that define which persons can conclude a contract on surrogacy. By limiting this right to persons holding the nationality of Serbia, or to these nationals and persons residing in the territory of Serbia for at least three (five) years the legislator wish to avoid reproductive tourism. Surrogate mothering with cross-border effects gives rise to complicated legal problems as regards the definition and recognition of legal parentage of the intended parents both in the countries in which the surrogate mother gives birth to the child, as well as in countries in which the intended parents wish to live with their child. The restrictive concept which retains surrogate mothering within the borders of the domestic state and between domestic nationals disables outgoing cases of surrogate motherhood, but it is not quite true for persons who are not citizens of Serbia, but living on its territory. For these reasons the paper critically examines these limitations in the proposals, and indicates that the incoming cases of surrogate motherhood cannot be prevented due to the free movement of people. The paper also provides analysis of the legal issues of the incoming cases of surrogate motherhood, and suggests solution for them if in the future Civil Code the proposed <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> legal parenthood of intended parents will be adopted. With <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> legal parenthood of a child who is born to a surrogate mother abroad {{there is no need to}} restrict surrogacy cases to nationals of Serbia or to foreigners domiciled in Serbia for three (five) years minimum...|$|E

40|$|The unfortunate {{experience}} {{in recent years}} of the American holders of defaulted foreign bonds led to the passage by Congress on May 27, 1933, of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders Act, as Title II of the Federal Securities Act. It was designed to furnish a medium through which American bondholders could act jointly in the adjustment of their claims against defaulting governments or other foreign entities. The holders of the defaulted bonds of a foreign state occupy a peculiar position. They cannot sue in the bondholders 2 ̆ 7 state, nor, even where foreign governments permit themselves to be sued, have they any effective remedy in the courts of the foreign country. The diplomatic channel has been occasionally opened to them, but in most countries only on proof of discrimination against them as nationals of a particular country or on some evidence of denial of justice or bad faith, such as the diversion of security, or the repudiation of specific pledges or guaranties. Mere failure by reason of inability to pay is not alone deemed <b>ipso</b> <b>jure,</b> a violation of international law. While unofficial good offices have often been extended by {{the governments of the}} bondholders in an effort to assist them in obtaining payment or adjustment of rightful claims, and while the line separating good offices from official representations is not so clearly defined as is often supposed, bondholders have had no assurance of legal protection either judicial or diplomatic...|$|E
40|$|In Mabo and Others v State of Queensland (No. 2), the High Court {{undermined}} the basic assumption that had guided all Australian real property law since colonisation: the legal consequences that {{flow from the}} feudal character of the English doctrine of tenure no longer apply <b>ipso</b> <b>jure</b> in Australia; title to land is no longer exclusively derivative; all titles to land can no longer, theoretically, {{be traced back to}} a Crown grant. Consequently, although the High Court confirmed that the doctrine of tenure is an essential principle of Australian land law, six members of the Court {{made it clear that the}} grundnorm of Australian real property law is no longer the English, and thus feudal, doctrine of tenure; instead, it is the Australian doctrine of tenure with radical title as its postulate. Nevertheless, since the decision in Mabo, discussion has focused on the meaning of native title and the practical implications of its judicial recognition. This paper, however, considers the effect of the Court’s decision on the reception of English land law. Indeed, it will be shown that the applicability of the Australian doctrine of tenure was only possible because the High Court clarified the doctrine of reception as it applied to Australia. Although the High Court accepted that Australia was a settled territory, the new element introduced by the Court was the recognition of a new class of settled colony at common law. By ascribing to Australia the status of a settled, yet inhabited, colony, the Court was free to prescribe a doctrine relating to the law that applied in the colony. In doing so, the Court considered the relevance of the doctrines of continuity and recognition as well as the scope of the Crown’s prerogative powers in a settled, yet inhabited, colony. It is argued that, as a result of the High Court’s restatement of the common law, there is a new doctrine prescribing the system of law that applies upon settlement of an inhabited territory: a modified doctrine of reception, which includes the doctrine of continuity pro tempore (a merged version of the continuity and recognition doctrines) ...|$|E
