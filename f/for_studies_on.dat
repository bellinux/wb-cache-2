25|$|The use of bird skins to {{document}} species {{has been a}} standard part of systematic ornithology. Bird skins are prepared by retaining the key bones of the wings, leg and skull along with the skin and feathers. In the past, they were treated with arsenic to prevent fungal and insect (mostly dermestid) attack. Arsenic, being toxic, was replaced by borax. Amateur and professional collectors became familiar with these skinning techniques and started sending in their skins to museums, some of them from distant locations. This {{led to the formation}} of huge collections of bird skins in museums in Europe and North America. Many private collections were also formed. These became references for comparison of species and the ornithologists at these museums were able to compare species from different locations, often places that they themselves never visited. Morphometrics of these skins, particularly the lengths of the tarsus, bill, tail and wing became important in the descriptions of bird species. These skin collections have been utilized in more recent times <b>for</b> <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> molecular phylogenetics by the extraction of ancient DNA. The importance of type specimens in the description of species make skin collections a vital resource for systematic ornithology. However, with the rise of molecular techniques, it has now become possible to establish the taxonomic status of new discoveries, such as the Bulo Burti boubou (Laniarius liberatus, no longer a valid species) and the Bugun liocichla (Liocichla bugunorum), using blood, DNA and feather samples as the holotype material.|$|E

In , the Army Corps responded with the first of the [...] "308 Reports" [...] named after the 1925 House Document No. 308 (69th Congress, 1st Session). With the help of Washington's Senators, Wesley Jones and Clarence Dill, Congress ordered $600,000 in further studies to be carried out by the Army Corps and Federal Power Commission on the Columbia River Basin and Snake Rivers. U.S. Army Major John Butler was responsible for the upper Columbia River and Snake River and in 1932, his 1,000-page report was submitted to Congress. It recommended the Grand Coulee Dam and nine others on the river, including some in Canada. [...] The report stated that electricity sales from the Grand Coulee Dam could pay for construction costs. Reclamation—whose interest in the dam was revitalized by the report—endorsed it.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the parliamentary report the church reacted by seeking help from academics and sociologists specializing in religious issues, including Jean Baubérot, Jean Séguy, Jean-Paul Willaime, Massimo Introvigne, Laurent Amiotte-Suchet, Bernard Blandre and Émile Poulat, who generally criticized its cult classification. Willaime and Poulat, among other sociologists, deemed the church's danger was never proven. Danièle Hervieu-Léger said the classification as a cult was an [...] "absurd decision". Sébastien Fath considered the church [...] "a bit radical but overall harmless", noting that this group had never been sued, and maintained that the church was criticized because of its proselytism and its rapid growth. Amiotte-Suchet deemed that the pastor's influence on the faithful was far from being as coercive as critics said. Poulat said, [...] "We can debate whether it may be a 'sect' in the sense of Weber; it is certainly not a 'secte' [...] in the popular and parliamentary sense of the term". Contacted by academics to participate in a documentary about the church, UNADFI and CCMM refused to explain their position. The Center <b>for</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>on</b> New Religions said the church's theology is [...] "clearly mainline", but was criticized [...] "because it does not belong to the World Council of Churches or other establishment church bodies".|$|E
