5|$|The {{seventh and}} final novel, Fyre (published in April 2013), sees the cast {{featuring}} the toughest challenges yet as Septimus nears {{the end of}} his ExtraOrdinary Wizard training. The dreaded Two-Faced Ring has been captured, but remains a grave threat, and must be plunged into the Alchemical Fyre for it to be destroyed for good. The ring, however, holds a threat far greater than most realize, and the restarting of the Fyre <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> quite dangerous.|$|E
25|$|This letter <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a {{reflection}} of the very nature of Jardine as a businessman and itself an explanation why the man was considered as the most powerful trader in the South China coast.|$|E
25|$|That Machiavelli had a {{wide range}} of {{influences}} <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> not controversial. Their relative importance is however a subject of on-going discussion. It is possible to summarize some of the main influences emphasized by different commentators.|$|E
6000|$|The {{manner in}} which Mr. Longdon {{indicated}} the empty room <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> an interruption. [...] "Don't I sufficiently spare you?" ...|$|R
50|$|An aporime is {{a problem}} {{difficult}} to resolve, and which has never been resolved, though it may not <b>be,</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> impossible.|$|R
60|$|It {{almost seemed}} {{that all the}} women were glad, and this <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a vindication of the Ranger's idea of law.|$|R
25|$|In contrast, {{philosophers}} who {{define the}} right to life by reference to particular levels of physical or psychological development typically maintain that such characteristics are morally relevant, and reject the assumption that all human life necessarily has value (or that membership in the species Homo sapiens <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> morally relevant).|$|E
25|$|The {{extraction}} {{and refining}} of carbon based fuels and its distribution <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> an {{energy intensive industry}} contributing to CO2 emissions. In 2007 U.S. refineries consumed 39353 million kWh, 70769 million lbs of steam and 697593 million cubic feet of Natural Gas. And the refining energy efficiency for gasoline is estimated to be, at best, 87.7%.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Locke (2005) {{claims that}} the concept of EI <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a {{misinterpretation}} of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp abstractions—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.|$|E
2500|$|.....she {{opined that}} [...] "...this poem <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> {{a good enough}} reason for [...] Lokhvitskaya's legacy to remain {{unpublished}} in the Soviet times." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, {{whatever}} our marble may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> {{all that}} we can know of it is under {{the shape of a}} bundle of our own consciousnesses.|$|R
2500|$|Like all Gaue {{since the}} restructering of 1932, Munich-Upper Bavaria <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> sub-divided <b>in</b> smaller {{administrative}} entitiys, {{in the structure}} of a pyramid, these being (1936): ...|$|R
25|$|Another of {{the ways}} in which the {{ecological}} role of a plant can make it a weed even if it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> inoffensive, is if it harbours a pest that is dependent on it for survival; for example, Berberis species are intermediate hosts for stem rust fungi, so that they promote serious damage to wheat crops when growing near the fields.|$|E
25|$|Because {{mobile phones}} {{are often used}} publicly, social norms {{have been shown to}} play a major role in the usage of mobile phones. Furthermore, the mobile phone can be a fashion totem custom-decorated to reflect the owner's {{personality}} and may be a part of their self-identity. This aspect of the mobile telephony business <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> an industry, e.g. ringtone sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{it is an}} {{efficient}} method of gathering food. However, constructing the web <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> an energetically costly process {{because of the large}} amount of protein required, in the form of silk. In addition, after a time the silk will lose its stickiness and thus become inefficient at capturing prey. It is common for spiders to eat their own web daily to recoup some of the energy used in spinning. The silk proteins are thus recycled.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Simply'!"--and little Bilham's {{concurrence}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> {{a lively}} comment. [...] "Thank you. But I thought," [...] he continued, [...] "you had exactly NO plan 'for' him." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was quite}} sincere,--had {{been touched by}} her {{manifest}} disturbance, and, despite his masculine relentlessness of criticism, he had an intuition of feminine suffering that <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> feminine.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not much}} mind his calling her Margaret; it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> such a trifle; {{but when he}} made a fuss about kissing her hand it annoyed her.|$|R
25|$|And God said, Let {{the earth}} bring forth grass, the herb {{yielding}} seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> upon the earth: {{and it was}} so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God {{saw that it was}} good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.|$|E
25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E
25|$|The City of Ottawa is a single-tier municipality, {{meaning it}} <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a census {{division}} {{and has no}} county or regional municipality government above it. As a single tier municipality, Ottawa has responsibility for all municipal services, including fire, emergency medical services, police, parks, roads, sidewalks, public transit, drinking water, storm water, sanitary sewage and solid waste. Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, currently Jim Watson, elected in a citywide vote.|$|E
60|$|The {{way to her}} own bed-chamber led her by {{the door}} of Sydney's room. She {{suddenly}} stopped; the door was not shut. This <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a suspicious circumstance.|$|R
50|$|The album {{received}} much praise {{from the other}} members of the Razorlight band. Bassist Carl Dalemo said that it had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> huge progress for the profile of Razorlight.|$|R
50|$|Judge Pettiti {{submitted}} a partly concurring opinion, {{considering that the}} criminal legislation in Greece on proselytism <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> contrary to Article 9. Judge De Meyer {{submitted a}} short concurring opinion.|$|R
25|$|Hiding from Humanity extends Nussbaum's work {{in moral}} {{psychology}} {{to probe the}} arguments for including two emotions—shame and disgust—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or animality through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how projective disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} methane from the Arctic <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a major {{contributor}} to global warming as a result of polar amplification. Recent observations in the Siberian arctic show increased rates of methane release from the Arctic seabed. Land-based permafrost, also in the Siberian arctic, was estimated in 2013 to release 17 million tonnes of methane per year – a significant increase on the 3.8 million tons estimated in 2006, and estimates before then of just 0.5 million tonnes. This compares to around 500 million tonnes released into the atmosphere annually from all sources.|$|E
25|$|It {{may now be}} {{understood}} that Henri Bergson was dissatisfied with Kantianism, which limited the bounds of reason {{to such an extent}} that it deemed knowledge of the absolute an impossibility. His method of intuition can in fact be seen as a response to Immanuel Kant, who believed that we can only know the world as it appears to us, not as it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> He maintained that the attempt to know the absolute always resulted in antinomies, a kind of philosophical paradox caused by the limits of reason.|$|E

60|$|The Ghetto <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> {{indifferent}} to us; {{it was merely}} {{our way to the}} Library, whither the great memory of Ariosto invited us to see his famous relics treasured there.|$|R
5000|$|Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall {{concluded}} {{that the death penalty}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> [...] "cruel and unusual punishment," [...] and incompatible with the evolving standards of decency of a contemporary society.|$|R
25|$|Radiation therapy <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> painless. Many low-dose palliative {{treatments}} (for example, {{radiation therapy}} to bony metastases) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be {{experienced in the}} days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.|$|E
25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
25|$|MCC {{decided to}} commemorate Grace's {{life and career}} with a Memorial Biography, {{published}} in 1919. Its preface begins with this passage:Never was such a band of cricketers gathered for any tour as has assembled to do honour to {{the greatest of all}} players in the present Memorial Biography. That such a volume should go forth {{under the auspices of the}} Committee of MCC <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> unique in the history of the game, and that such an array of cricketers, critics and enthusiasts should pay tribute to its finest exponent has no parallel in any other branch of sport. In itself this presents a noble monument of what W. G. Grace was, a testimony to his prowess and to his personality.|$|E
60|$|Some thirty-five arrived safely, and the Dinner of Welcome in Sculpture Hall {{not only}} set a {{milestone}} in {{the progress of the}} city, but <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> a beautiful and distinctive event.|$|R
60|$|Bernadine eyed his {{prisoner}} keenly. Such absolute composure <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> disturbing. He <b>was,</b> for the moment, {{aware of}} a slight sensation of uneasiness, which his common sense, however, speedily disposed of.|$|R
