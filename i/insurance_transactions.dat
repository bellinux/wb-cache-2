In the twentieth century, the famous Islamic jurist, Sheikh Muhammad Abduh permitted insurance practices by supporting that <b>insurance</b> <b>transaction</b> is akin to the al-Mudharabah (one kind of partnership business where one party provides the fund and other party provides labour) financing technique (Ali 2006, p. 102).|$|R

50|$|In {{recent years}} the {{operational}} definition of insurance presented {{at the beginning of}} this article proved inadequate as a result of contracts that had the form but not the substance of insurance. The essence of insurance is the transfer of risk from the insured to one or more insurers. How much risk a contract actually transfers proved to be at the heart of the controversy. This issue arose most clearly in reinsurance, where the use of Financial Reinsurance to reengineer insurer balance sheets under US GAAP became fashionable during the 1980s. The accounting profession raised serious concerns about the use of reinsurance in which little if any actual risk was transferred, and went on to address the issue in FAS 113, cited above. While on its face, FAS 113 is limited to accounting for reinsurance transactions, the guidance it contains is generally conceded to be equally applicable to US GAAP accounting for <b>insurance</b> <b>transactions</b> executed by commercial enterprises.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} in the case, as formulated by the Court itself, was [...] "whether the Commerce Clause grants to Congress the power to regulate <b>insurance</b> <b>transactions</b> stretching across state lines." [...] For nearly 80 years before then, the Supreme Court had consistently held that [...] "Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce,” [...] "the business of insurance is not commerce," [...] and [...] "contracts of insurance are not commerce at all, neither state nor interstate." [...] Those cases, however, dealt with the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, i.e., whether the business was [...] "interstate commerce" [...] such {{that it could not}} be regulated by the individual states. The South-Eastern Underwriters case, however, involved the question whether the business of insurance was [...] "interstate commerce" [...] sufficient to allow Congressional regulation. The Supreme Court in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, 322 U.S. 533 (1944), 4-3 decision written by Justice Hugo Black, reversed the district court, holding that (1) the Sherman Act intended to cover the alleged acts of monopolization; and (2) that the transaction of insurance across state lines was [...] "commerce among the states" [...] which the Constitution permitted Congress to regulate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} a constructive algorithm {{in which a}} hierarchi-cal tree of hidden Markov models may be obtained directly from data using an unsupervised learning regime. The method is applied to health insurance trans-action data such that profiles with similar local temporal behaviours are grouped together. By judicious incorporation of limited additional prior information, {{it is found that}} profiles can be separated into various sub-behavioural groups thus pro-viding a technique for large-scale automatic labelling of data. In the application to the health <b>insurance</b> <b>transaction</b> data set, by incorporating limited information concerning the medical functions used in a medical procedure, it is possible to label some individual medical transactions as to whether they are related to a par-ticular medical condition or not. This automatic labelling process adds values to the collected transactional database for possible further applications, e. g. public health studies. ...|$|R

40|$|A body of {{empirical}} evidence {{has shown that}} many managers would welcome new ways of highlighting catastrophic consequences, as well as means to evaluating decision situations involving high risks. When events occur frequently and their consequences are not severe, it is relatively simple to calculate the risk exposure of an organisation, {{as well as a}} reasonable premium when an <b>insurance</b> <b>transaction</b> is made. The usual methods rely on variations of the principle of maximising the expected utility (PMEU).

When the quality of estimates is poor, e. g., when evaluating low-probability/high-consequence risks, the customary use of quantitative rules together with overprecise data could be harmful as well as misleading.

The {{values of}} such services are seldom, if ever, directly apparent; rather {{these values are}} implicitly entwined within the payment of premiums. This paper discusses the treatment of insurance services, and related transactions, {{in the balance of}} payments.

The treatment of life insurance, which has many of the characteristics of nonlife insurance, is then addressed.

50|$|The {{development}} of the concept and theoretical formulae which show how investment return and risk should affect insurance rates (B-12, B-14, B-24, D-13). One of the immediate implication of insurers’ assets and liabilities portfolio management is {{in the area of}} ratemaking. The insurers practically “borrow” money from the insureds. If the <b>insurance</b> <b>transaction</b> was risk-less, the loading should have been negative and equal to the risk-free interest rate.
