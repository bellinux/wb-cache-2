50|$|Terrestrial valleys {{normally}} {{consist of}} channels- geometric depressions {{in the valley}} floor carved by flowing water- and overbank regions that include floodplains and terraces. Some channels have shapes and sizes that hardly change along the river; these do not have riffles. However, many channels exhibit readily apparent changes in width, bed elevation, and slope. In these cases, scientists realized that the riverbed often tends to rise and fall with distance downstream relative to an average elevation of the river's slope. That led scientists to map the bed elevation down the deepest path in a channel, called the thalweg, to obtian a longitudinal profile. Then, the piecewise linear slope of the river is computed and removed to leave just {{the rise and fall}} of the elevation about the channel's trendline. According to the zero-crossing method, riffles are all the locations along the channel whose residual elevation is greater than zero. Because of the prevalence of this method for identifying and mapping riffles, riffles are often thought of as part of a paired sequence, alternating with pools- the lows between the riffles. However, modern topographic maps of rivers with meter-scale resolution reveal that rivers exhibit a diversity of <b>in-channel</b> landforms.|$|E

40|$|In an {{analytical}} model channel transport is analyzed {{as a function}} of key parameters, determining efficiency and selectivity of particle transport in a competitive molecular environment. These key parameters are the concentration of particles, solvent-channel exchange dynamics, as well as particle-in-channel- and interparticle interaction. These parameters are explicitly related to translocation dynamics and channel occupation probability. Slowing down the exchange dynamics at the channel ends, or elevating the particle concentration reduces the <b>in-channel</b> binding strength necessary to maintain maximum transport.

A comparison of the riverscape evaluation by biology students and national park managers indicates that education in the discipline facilitates understanding of the environmental significance of <b>in-channel</b> wood although its effects are highly insufficient to form the positive attitude toward wood-containing watercourses typical of the managers. In turn, the education of water engineering students about <b>in-channel</b> wood apparently dominantly emphasizes threats caused by its presence in watercourses, so that the students' highly negative attitude toward wood needs to be significantly moderated when the graduates begin working as water authority managers. ...|$|E

We characterize <b>in-channel</b> transient storage with a rhodamine WT solute tracer experiment in a 304 m cascade-pool-type bedrock reach with no hyporheic zone. We compare the solute breakthrough curve (BTC) from this reach to that of an adjacent 367 m alluvial reach with significant hyporheic exchange. In the bedrock reach, transient storage has an exponential residence time distribution with a mean residence time of 3. 0 hours and a ratio of transient storage to stream volume of 0. 14, demonstrating that at moderate discharge, bedrock <b>in-channel</b> storage zones provide a small volume of transient storage with substantial residence time. In the alluvial reach, though pools are similar in size to those in the bedrock reach, transient storage has a power law residence time distribution with a mean residence time of > 100 hours (estimated at nearly 1200 hours) and a ratio of storage to stream volume of 105. Because the <b>in-channel</b> hydraulics of bedrock reaches are simpler than alluvial step-pool reaches, the bedrock results are probably a lower end-member with respect to volume and residence time, though they demonstrate that <b>in-channel</b> storage may be appreciable in some reaches.

40|$|<b>In-channel</b> fine-sediment storage, {{especially}} in areas draining highly erodible materials, constitutes {{an important part}} of the sediment budget of a drainage basin. This phenomenon occurs when sediment production in the basin is greater than the river's transport capacity, resulting in large accumulations of fines along the river channel. <b>In-channel</b> sediment storage has been studied in a similar to 3 -km channel length reach of the River Isabena during an average hydrological year (2007 - 2008). The River Isabena drains an area of 445 km(2). It is located at the Southern Pyrenees and the channel network flows through an area of extremely erodible materials producing an enormous amount of suspended sediment. Total <b>in-channel</b> sediment storage for the study period has been estimated at approximately 679 t, which equates to 0. 32 % of the annual suspended sediment load calculated at the basin's outlet. Sediment storage values obtained in the study reach have been extrapolated to the whole main channel length (45 km), resulting in a total storage of 9, 810 t, representing the 4. 7 % of the annual total load. <b>In-channel</b> storage shows both temporal and spatial trends. In relation to the former, sediment is continuously accumulated during low-flows while the latter shows that sediment accumulation increases in the downstream direction.

40|$|SummarySediment {{concentration}} (SC) –water discharge (Q) {{relations in}} rivers are typically governed by multiple and relatively complex processes. Due to hysteresis effects, sediment discharges can differ for similar or equivalent water discharges, which causes scatter in empirical datasets and may decrease the predictive power of SC rating curves. Such hysteresis effects {{must therefore be}} understood and accounted for to make dependable predictions for river system management. The overall objectives {{of this study are}} to develop modelling approaches suitable for reproducing and predicting hysteresis effects at larger scales and to investigate the possible contribution of <b>in-channel</b> processes (erosion and deposition) to sediment concentration hysteresis loops. To investigate relevant field-scale conditions, we develop a one-dimensional dynamic sediment transport model of the downstream Tuul River (northern Mongolia), investigating <b>in-channel</b> processes along a 141 km stretch during a hydrological year. The results show that the present modelling approach can reproduce both anti-clockwise and clockwise hysteresis effects. Importantly, <b>in-channel</b> processes alone can cause considerable anti-clockwise hysteresis effects without being reinforced by catchment processes such as hillslope erosion. Such specific contributions from <b>in-channel</b> processes introduced data scatter into the sediment rating curves, decreasing their R 2 -values from unity to approximately 0. 5 to 0. 6. More generally, possible changes in the number or magnitude of high-flow events, caused by climatic or other anthropogenic factors, could influence total sediment deposition, which was primarily found to occur during relatively short high-flow events. Such potential changes also have important implications for the possible spreading of polluted sediments...|$|E
40|$|<b>In-channel</b> wood is a {{fundamental}} component of the riverine system.

However, a lack of knowledge still exists on how the geomorphic effects, quantity, and characteristics of <b>in-channel</b> wood may be altered by dif- ferent human pressures. For this reason, <b>in-channel</b> wood was surveyed in the Brenta, Piave, and Tagliamento gravel-bed rivers (northeastern Italy), which are altered by different degrees of human pressures. Both single pieces of wood (N 0. 1 m diameter, and/or N 1 m long) and accumulations of large wood were measured on cross sectional transects within the active channels. Overall, 3430 (8. 4, 13. 9 and 10. 7 elements/ha in the Brenta, Piave, and Tagliamento rivers, respectively) of isolated pieces and 591 (9. 8, 15. 0, and 11. 0 wood accumulations/ ha in the Brenta, Piave, and Tagliamento rivers, respectively) accumulations were surveyed in the study sites. In the Brenta and Piave rivers, which feature the greater human pressures, logs appear in a worse state of conserva- tion. In the less disturbed Tagliamento River, the logs appear to be smaller and in a better state of conservation with higher capacity for resprouting.

Removal of vegetation and CWD decreased transient storage area (As) by 61 % and 43 % in the agricultural and blackwater streams, respectively, and decreased the portion of median travel time owing to transient storage (Fmed) by 45 % and 56 %, respectively. Flow baffles were then added to create <b>in-channel</b> transient storage in both streams. Baffles increased As 227 % and 119 % for the agricultural and blackwater streams, respectively, and increased Fmed 309 % and 132 %, respectively.

We created a laboratory mobile-bed alluvial meandering river and collected detailed measurements in the highly sinuous meander before and after installation of <b>in-channel</b> structures, which included one cross vane and six J-hooks situated along 1 bar unit. Measurements of streambed and water surface elevation with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution were obtained using close-range photogrammetry. Compared to the smooth gradually varied water surface proﬁle for control runs without structures, the structures created rapidly varied ﬂow with subcritical to supercritical ﬂow transitions, as well as backwater and forced-morphology pools, which increased volumetric storage by 74 % in the entire stream reach. The J-hooks, located along the outer bank of the meander bend and downstream of the cross vane, created stepwise patterns in the streambed and water surface longitudinal proﬁles. The pooling of water behind the cross vane increased the hydraulic gradient across the meander neck by 1 % and increased local groundwater gradients by 4 %, with smaller increases across other transects through the intrameander zone.

40|$|This thesis investigates geomorphological {{processes}} {{within the}} forested floodplain of the Highland Water, a small, lowland {{river in the}} New Forest, southern England. Geomorphological processes were monitored (a) before restoration, in order to define reference conditions, and (b) after restoration, in order to monitor {{the performance of the}} restoration against the reference conditions. The results demonstrate that the restoration was successful at moving the restored system towards target reference conditions by re-connecting the channel and floodplain, and consequently floodplain geomorphological dynamics were increased after restoration. However, the restored floodplain was considerably more connected and more dynamic than an upstream semi-natural reference reach, indicating that the restored channel was perhaps undersized. Floodplain channels were an important geomorphological feature observed on semi-natural floodplains, particularly in association with hydraulically effective wood jams. Experiments into sedimentation and erosion showed that overbank flow scoured the surface and distributed sediment, and rates of erosion and deposition were higher within floodplain channels than elsewhere on the floodplain surface. These channels were therefore a major control over the spatial distribution of energy and materials on the floodplain at the patch, feature and reach scale (10 - 1 to 102 m). The formation of <b>in-channel</b> wood jams, which force flow overbank, relies on the accumulation of wood. Experiments to investigate transport of small wood recorded travel distances ranging from 0 to over 1000 m. Shorter travel distances were associated with higher <b>in-channel</b> geomorphological diversity, particularly the presence of <b>in-channel</b> wood jams. This thesis therefore provides a greater understanding of the geomorphological processes operating on a forested floodplain in conjunction with monitoring the performance of a river restoration project that incorporated a forested floodplain.
