Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the <b>educational</b> <b>field,</b> however, the recent shift to sociology and psychology has opened the door for new findings in education as a social science. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.|$|E

500|$|Partnerships in Mathematics and Science (PIMS) {{began in}} Eva Evans's {{administration}} in 1994, {{and was a}} part of the SPIRIT program during the Linda White administration. Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, [...] "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements. [...] And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls. [...] We need more black women in those fields." [...] The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the National Science Foundation and historically black colleges from across the country. Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies. For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in Marietta, Georgia, consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided <b>educational</b> <b>field</b> trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science. Also, a national P.I.M.S. Olympiad, deriving from knowledge of math and science, in conjunction with the PIMS Community Parade was held at the 58th Boulé in Dallas, Texas.|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{precautions}} {{against the}} Ebner's goal of propagating Zionism through Jewish day schools, Straucher gave his approval {{to the teaching}} of Romanian-language classes, and therefore to a measure of assimilation, while preventing Zionists from reforming the curriculum. In this context, he made himself known for protesting the Romanianization policies promoted by the governments in Bucharest, in particular in the <b>educational</b> <b>field.</b> During the mid-1920s, he was in correspondence with National Liberal leader Ion I. C. Brătianu and Filderman, documenting cases in which Bukovinan schools had been [...] "purged" [...] of Jewish teachers and administrators were being dismissed, pensioned or demoted by the Ministry of Education, as well as the state-condoned underfunding of state-run Jewish schools. He contrasted these occurrences with the traditionally elevated status of Jews in Czernowitz (then designated as Cernăuți), whom, he assessed, formed 50% of the city's population and 90% of its taxpayers. At the time, the authorities had restructured the secondary education institutions into five high schools, divided by ethnicity, and Straucher's writings attest a significant reduction in attendance numbers for the Jewish Lycée No. 3. Jewish parents were then opting in favor of sending their children to privately run day schools.|$|E
