5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct cytotoxic effect of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to oxalic acid. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric acute kidney failure. The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. Accumulation of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E

25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity. There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.

500|$|The {{three main}} systems {{affected}} by ethylene glycol poisoning are {{the central nervous}} system, metabolic processes, and the kidneys.

Similar to ethanol, it causes intoxication, followed by drowsiness or coma. Seizures may occur due to a direct effect. The toxic mechanism of ethylene glycol poisoning is mainly due to the metabolites of ethylene glycol. Initially it is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolaldehyde, which is then oxidized to <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid</b> by aldehyde dehydrogenase. [...] The increase in metabolites may cause encephalopathy or cerebral edema. The metabolic effects occur 12 to 36 hours post ingestion, causing primarily metabolic acidosis which is due mainly to accumulated <b>glycolic</b> <b>acid.</b> Additionally, as a side effect of the first two steps of metabolism, an increase in the blood concentration of lactic acid occurs contributing to lactic acidosis.
