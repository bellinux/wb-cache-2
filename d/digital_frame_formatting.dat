5000|$|A CAN network can be {{configured}} to {{work with}} two different message (or [...] "frame") formats: the standard or base <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> (described in CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B), and the extended <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> (only described by CAN 2.0 B). The only {{difference between the two}} formats is that the [...] "CAN base frame" [...] supports a length of 11 bits for the identifier, and the [...] "CAN extended frame" [...] supports a length of 29 bits for the identifier, made up of the 11-bit identifier ("base identifier") and an 18-bit extension ("identifier extension"). The distinction between CAN base <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> and CAN extended <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> is made by using the IDE bit, which is transmitted as dominant in case of an 11-bit frame, and transmitted as recessive in case of a 29-bit frame. CAN controllers that support extended <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> messages are also able to send and receive messages in CAN base <b>frame</b> <b>format.</b> All <b>frames</b> begin with a start-of-frame (SOF) bit that denotes the start of the frame transmission.|$|R

30|$|In the {{proposed}} work, a new node may {{join in a}} cluster or an existing node may leave from a cluster. Therefore, it supports mobility unlike the existing system which does not support mobility. To support this, the modified medium access control (MAC) <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> is used. The modified <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> also authenticates the newly joining node in the cluster (Section 3.1. 1).|$|R
3000|$|In the {{verification}} step (step one), if {{a source}} node is declared {{as a new}} node, then the CH demands CHC from the source node by sending beacon frame. Based on reception of the beacon frame, the source node replies with its CHC. Now, the CH compares the received CHC against the entry available in the CHC table (Table 4). If the received CHC is matched with an entry available in Table 4, then the source node belongs to the available CHs. Otherwise, the source node is declared as a jammer node. Then, it proceeds with the auditing step. Because the newly joined node or the existing node in a cluster {{has a chance to}} become a jammer node in the future. The CHC is incorporated in the MAC <b>frame</b> <b>format.</b> To implement this, the 802.15. 4 MAC <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> and beacon <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> are modified (i.e., the reserved field in the MAC and beacon <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> is utilized to incorporate the CHC) as follows: [...]...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate radio receivers that had been previously acquired for other tasks by the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, for additional service in a radio direction finding (DF) system. The antenna, calibration signal generator and DF algorithm were provided. As the receivers used the VITA 49 <b>frame</b> <b>format,</b> {{much of the work}} involved the interpretation of the frame structure and contents. The other main challenges were to put the receivers into the correct internal state, to compensate the analogue phase errors due to cabling, and to correlate the <b>digital</b> <b>frames</b> according to the time stamps. The work was performed partly as a literature study and, during implementation, by using an investigative trial and-error method. Collection of reference signals, for later offline analysis, was made at the Swedish Defence Research Agency. The findings of the evaluation was that the receivers were phase coherent and that the VITA 49 <b>frame</b> <b>format</b> was suitable for DF use. An apparently systematic error of unknown origin rendered the DF results inaccurate, even though the precision of the results was high. The automatic gain control (AGC) of the receivers did not perform according to norm. If the systematic error is compensated for, and the AGC problem is eliminated, the receivers will function as a DF system using the manufacturer's instructions, with the provided antenna. The performance of the receivers in this setting was not a primary concern for the thesis, but was deemed to be acceptable. Suggestions for further development include finding the source of the systematic error, an automatic calibration function, a more thorough performance analysis, and code optimizations using multiple threads...|$|R
