40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> {{currently}} {{used for the}} cryopreservation of peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCTs) has been determined empirically. Although the use of cryopreserved PBSCTs is successful and usually leads to rapid hematopoietic recovery, the freeze-thawing process is known to induce a significant degree of cell death. Furthermore, the infusion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), used to protect the cells against damage induced by freezing, can cause morbidity. Therefore, optimizing the current cryopreservation protocol (with 10 % DMSO and a slow linear cooling curve) with theoretically optimized freezing curves and a lower DMSO concentration might improve the recovery after transplantation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A theoretical model was used to predict optimal freezing curves for 5 and 10 percent DMSO. CD 34 +-selected and -unselected PBSCs were cryopreserved with the current or the new freezing curves. Postthaw quality was evaluated by cell viability, colony formation, and megakaryocyte outgrowth. RESULTS: With 10 percent DMSO, {{the use of the}} predicted optimal <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> resulted in increased postthaw viability of CD 34 + cells, colony formation, and megakaryocyte outgrowth. Lowering the DMSO concentration to 5 percent resulted in improved postthaw viability and functionality, which was not further improved by use of the theoretically optimized <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the current cryopreservation method for PBSCTs can be improved by either lowering the DMSO concentration to 5 percent or by using the theoretically optimized <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> Infusion of less DMSO and more viable cells might improve the outcome of PBSC...|$|E

The aim of this thesis was to find the influence of different equilibration and <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> conditions to on spermatozoa viability after thawing. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes available information about the bulls semen parameters, methods for its evaluation and especially the processing and long-term preservation. Within the case study part of the thesis, during the years 2013 - 2015 the semen of the pre-selected group of 5 breeding bulls was being collected at the Sires insemination center. The group was uniform as to age, breed and housing and treatment conditions. After initial assessment the collected semen was divided into parts, which were then processed in different wals. A part of straws was processed by standard protocol, the other part was processed using different length of equilibration and <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> First part of the straws was equilibrated in a standard protocol for 120 minutes; subsequently half of the equilibrated straws was standardly frozen by the Direct Freezing method based on 3 -phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> while the other half was frozen using the different 2 -phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> Second part of the straws was initially equilibrated for 240 minutes with the subsequent freezing, similarly {{as in the previous}} case, used 3 -phase and 2 -phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> Frozen straws were then stored in liquid nitrogen container at - 196 °C. Spermatozoa motility was evaluated using CASA. The semen was further evaluated on the proportion of live and dead spermatozoa, using coloration of Eosin and Nigrosine, and on the sensitivity of the spermatozoa membranes, using HOS test, which detects the reaction of spermatozoa tail membrane to hypoosmotic conditions. The obtained results indicated higher progressive spermatozoa motility (+ 5. 57 %) and higher percentage of live spermatozoa (+ 4. 47 %) following the application of the prolonged equilibration (240 min). When applying the length of equilibration 240 minutes, the values of total spermatozoa motility and HOS test were higher as well, though the differences were not statistically significant. When evaluate the effect of using different freezing curves on the parameters of the spermatozoa after thawing, higher values (average + 1. 6 %) at almost all of these parameters using 3 -phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> were found, the diferrences were not statistically significant.

40|$|Heterogeneous ice {{nucleation}} {{remains one}} of the outstanding problems in cloud physics and atmospheric science. Experimental challenges in properly simulating particle-induced freezing processes under atmospherically relevant conditions have largely contributed to the absence of a well-established parameterization of immersion freezing properties. Here, we formulate an ice active, surface-site-based stochastic model of heterogeneous freezing with the unique feature of invoking a continuum assumption on the ice nucleating activity (contact angle) of an aerosol particle's surface that requires no assumptions about the size or number of active sites. The result is a particle-specific property g that defines a distribution of local ice nucleation rates. Upon integration, this yields a full freezing probability function for an ice nucleating particle. Current cold plate droplet freezing measurements provide a valuable and inexpensive resource for studying the freezing properties of many atmospheric aerosol systems. We apply our g framework to explain the observed dependence of the freezing temperature of droplets in a cold plate on the concentration of the particle species investigated. Normalizing to the total particle mass or surface area present to derive the commonly used ice nuclei active surface (INAS) density (n s) often cannot account for the effects of particle concentration, yet concentration is typically varied to span a wider measurable freezing temperature range. A method based on determining what is denoted an ice nucleating species' specific critical surface area is presented and explains the concentration dependence as a result of increasing the variability in ice nucleating active sites between droplets. By applying this method to experimental droplet freezing data from four different systems, we demonstrate its ability to interpret immersion freezing temperature spectra of droplets containing variable particle concentrations. It is shown that general active site density functions, such as the popular n s parameterization, cannot be reliably extrapolated below this critical surface area threshold to describe <b>freezing</b> <b>curves</b> for lower particle surface area concentrations. <b>Freezing</b> <b>curves</b> obtained below this threshold translate to higher n s values, while the n s values are essentially the same from curves obtained above the critical area threshold; n s should remain the same for a system as concentration is varied. However, we can successfully predict the lower concentration <b>freezing</b> <b>curves,</b> which are more atmospherically relevant, through a process of random sampling from g distributions obtained from high particle concentration data. Our analysis is applied to cold plate freezing measurements of droplets containing variable concentrations of particles from NX illite minerals, MCC cellulose, and commercial Snomax bacterial particles.

40|$|The aim of optimalization the {{insemination}} doses {{production is}} to provide the highest fertilization ability of spermatozoa during the demanding proces of processing fresh semen and its subsequent cryopreservation. Temperature changes causes spermatozoa damage during the cooling and freezing. Spermatozoa is exposed to cold shock and many others limiting factors, which leads to cell death and therefore to decline of fertilization ability of thawed insemination doses. For increasing spermatozoa resistance, exactly the plasma membrane resistance against cold shock was fraction of egg yolk LDL cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) at various concentrations into the comercially produced diluents added. It is believed that LDL acts possitively to plasma membrane and helps to maintain the fertilization ability of spermatozoa after thawing. Following step in the proces of insemination doses production is slow cooling of diluted semen and equilibration, when the straws are store at cooling box for 30 minutes to 240 hours. This period is necessary to penetrate of certain diluent components into the spermatazoa also maintain the balance between their intracellular and extracellular concentration. Also important is subsequent freezing temperature gradient of insemination doses. The most suitable freezing method is based on computer controlled temperature decline in freezing chamber which allows the precise control of ice crystals formation that could tear and kill the cell. During 2012 to 2016 was repeatedly collected semen from the group of breeding bulls (n = 27, Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh breed) at AI centre. Semen which fulfill the standard entrance conditions in first step was evenly into several parts divided. For dilution {{the three types of}} comercially diluents AndroMed, Bioxcell and Triladyl with and without LDL addition were used. Into the diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell the concentration of LDL 4 %, 6 % and 8 % into the dilent Triladyl 6 %, 8 % and 10 % was added. Diluted semen was filled into the glass capillares with volume 0, 1 ml and temperature + 4 °C. Subsequently the sample was placed to cold bath (0 °C) for 10 minutes. Then the volume of capillare with physiological solution (37 °C) was mixed and for next 120 minutes was incubate. The effect of cold shock to proportion of live spermatozoa was evaluated by using Eosin and Nigrosine staining technique during heat test of spermatozoa survivability after spermatozoa heating and after 120 minutes of incubation. The more suitable semen diluents which provide the higher spermatozoa resistance against cold shock were AndroMed and Bioxcell. Together the possitive effect of LDL addition into the diluents to lower decrease of proportion of live spermatozoa during heat test was found (P< 0. 05). The most suitable LDL concentration which had a favorable influence at spermatozoa resistance against cold shock was 6 % in diluent Bioxcell. Values of the proportion of live sperm were higher {{at the beginning of the}} heat test (+ 1. 31 % to + 3. 2 %) and after 120 minute incubation (+ 5. 82 % to + 8. 41 %) compared to other diluents with and without addition of LDL. In the next step the process of equilibration was optimized, is an important part of insemination doses production. The effect of the length of equilibration for subsequent fertilization ability of spermatozoa was evaluated using spermatozoa motility based of CASA and proportion of live spermatozoa after thawing and during heat survival test lasting 120 minutes (37 ° C). Suitable semen was diluted by comercially used diluent AndroMed based on soya lecithin, filled into the straws (0. 25 ml), cooled and equilibrated in cooling box for 30, 120 and 240 minutes and freezed in programmable freezing box applying four types of freezing curves differing in temperature rate decline. There was used standard and by producer recommended 3. phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve,</b> then 2. phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve,</b> and 3. phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> with slower as well as rapid decline of temperature rate in freezing chamber, compared with standard <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> The highest spermatozoa motility was found using 240 minutes of equilibration by + 2. 72 % and + 4. 58 % compared to other lengths of equilibration (P < 0. 05 to 0. 01). The highest proportion of live spermatozoa was found using 120 minutes of equilibration (+ 6. 87 % and + 8. 68 %). The highest average spermatozoa motility during heat test after thawing was achieved by using 2. phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> (from + 2. 97 % to + 10. 37 %, P < 0. 05), also in the proportion of live spermatozoa (from + 4. 37 % to + 8. 82 %, P < 0. 01). When evaluating interaction between the length of equilibration and <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> (standard 3. phase and 2. phase <b>freezing</b> <b>curve),</b> the highest average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa using 240 minutes of equilibration by both freezing curves was reached, there was no statistically significant differences.

To maintain good fertilization ability of semen during cryopreservation is necessary to increase the spermatozoa resistance against cold shock using addition of correct concentration of LDL into the commercially used diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell.

40|$|The methods {{currently}} used by metrologists for estimating {{the influence of}} impurities in metal fixed points require accurate knowledge of the concentrations of impurities present and of liquidus slopes of binary systems. In this thesis, two alternative methods are presented that can estimate the influence of impurities without requiring any knowledge of the impurities. Both methods are based on Scheil’s solidification model. By using a numerical solidification model it is shown that the freezing behaviour of a fixed point cell can approximate to Scheil’s model when the freezing time is greater than x 2 / D, where x is {{the thickness of the}} ingot and D is the diffusion coefficient of impurities in the liquid. The first method uses the gradient of a <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> at about 0. 5 fraction solid, and is able to predict the influence of impurities with a maximum uncertainty of around 25 %. This is assuming that all the important impurities have distribution coefficients much lower than 1, which is often the case in practice. By applying some modifications to this method, it is possible {{to determine whether or not}} the distribution coefficients of the dominant impurities lie below or above 1. The second method involves numerically best fitting Scheil’s equation to a <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> This method works for materials with multiple impurities, but problems arise when it is applied to an experimental <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> due to distortion in the freeze plateau. This is thought to be caused by the thermal effects arising from the non-uniform thermal conditions under which the fixed point is realised. It is experimentally and numerically demonstrated that the thermal uniformity of the three-zone furnace is improved by separating (thermally isolating) the heating zones. By modelling the freezing behaviour of a silver cell in the three-zone furnace it is shown that (a) increasing the freeze undercooling increases the influence of the thermal effects and adversely affects the shape of the freeze plateau, and (b) making the temperature at the base of the cell higher than that at the top reduces the influence of the thermal effects and improves the shape of the freeze plateau.

Our work generalizes to soft potentials the original application of the method to hard sphere freezing, and builds on a previous PSMC study of the LJ system by Errington (J. Chem. Phys. 120, 3130 (2004)). The latter work is extended by tracing a large section of the Lennard-Jones <b>freezing</b> <b>curve,</b> the results for which we compare to a previous Gibbs-Duhem integration study.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the effect of different freezing curves, straw sizes, and thawing rates on the cryopreservation of collared peccary semen. Twelve ejaculates were obtained from captive adult males by electroejaculation, and evaluated for sperm motility, kinetic rating, viability, morphology, and functional membrane integrity. The ejaculates were diluted in a coconut water extender (ACP- 116 c) with egg yolk and glycerol, packaged into 0. 25 mL or 0. 50 mL plastic straws and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen following a slow (− 10 °C/min) or a fast (− 40 °C/min) <b>freezing</b> <b>curve.</b> After one week, samples were thawed at 37 °C/ 1 min or 70 °C/ 8 s and evaluated as reported for fresh semen, and also for kinematic parameters (computerized analysis). A significant decrease in sperm motility and kinetic rating was observed after glycerol addition at 5 °C and also after thawing for all the treatments (P 0. 05). In general, values for sperm characteristics found after thawing at 37 °C were better preserved than at 70 °C (P 0. 05). The evaluation of the kinematic parameters of sperm motility confirmed these results at values varying from 20 % to 30 % motile sperm for the samples thawed at 37 °C, and values fewer than 12 % motile sperm for samples thawed at 70 °C (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, we recommend the use of a fast <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> that reduces the time spent on the cryopreservation of collared peccary semen, which could be packaged both in 0. 25 mL or 0. 50 mL straws, but the thawing should be conducted at 37 °C/ 1 min...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} rationally design polymer {{vehicles}} for controlled drug delivery {{it is important}} to completely understand the nature and mechanisms of the structural evolution of the polymer matrix that ultimately controls drug release kinetics. NMR cryoporometry has been used previously to study drug release from polymer vehicles. However, no previous studies have employed the integrated cryoporometry and PFG NMR method known as cryodiffusometry, or explored the potential of specialized cryoporometry techniques such as scanning loops. In this work {{it has been shown that}} the true extent of the variability in structural evolution and transport properties between different batches of PLGA polymer microspheres, made in different ways, would be missed if these data were not available. Cryoporometry scanning loops have been used to determine the overall network geometry. Cryoporometry <b>freezing</b> <b>curves</b> and PFG NMR have been used to study the evolution in the pore-scale connectivity and the larger-scale inter-connectedness of the nanoporous void space following immersion of microspheres in aqueous phase.

40|$|Soil {{freezing}} and thawing is of importance in transport of water, heat and solute, which has coupled effects. Solute type and solute content in frozen soil could influence the osmotic potential of frozen soil and decrease freezing point, resulting in differences in soil <b>freezing</b> characteristic <b>curves</b> under various solute conditions. Prediction model provides an approach for estimating soil <b>freezing</b> characteristic <b>curves</b> under various water and solute conditions based on soil <b>freezing</b> characteristic <b>curve</b> obtained at certain water and solute conditions. Water, heat and solute transport in seasonally frozen soil is a coupled process strongly linked to evaporation and energy balance of soil surface. High solute content and shallow GWTD provide good conditions {{for water and}} solute accumulation in surface layer, which would result in more evaporation during thawing. Also, high solute content in upper layer would cause more liquid water to exist in upper layer, which may enhance evaporation during freezing period. Obvious increase in cumulative evaporation amount was detected for frost tube experiments, 51. 0, 96. 6, to 114. 0 mm when initial solute content increased from 0. 2 %, 0. 4 %, to 0. 6 %, and initial GWTD of 1. 5 m. Similar trends were observed for other GWTD and solute treatments. Water and heat transport simulated by the CoupModel combined with GLUE calibration showed good performances, when constrained by certain criteria. Uncertainties were investigated using ensemble of modeling results. Simulated energy partitioning showed intensive oscillations in daily courses during soil freezing/thawing periods and strongly influenced the stability of energy system on surface of soil. The study demonstrated the complexity in water, heat and solute transport in seasonally frozen soil, {{and the necessity of}} combining experimental data with numerical model for better understanding the processes as well in decision making for irrigation district water resources management. 土壤冻融过程对于水热及溶质的运移具有十分重要的影响，并对于寒旱区水文过程的研究有着深远意义。在冻土中，溶质的种类及溶质含量会对土壤溶质势产生影响，并导致冰点的降低，进而影响土壤冻结曲线的变化。本研究通过建立含盐冻土冻结曲线的预报模型，有效地利用一定水盐试验条件下的冻结曲线对未知条件下的冻结曲线进行预测，进而为数值模型实时根据土壤水盐条件获得准确的液态含水量与温度的关系时提供了可行的方法。冻融土壤中的水热盐运移过程与地表的水热平衡有着密切联系，进而影响冻融土壤蒸发过程。试验研究表明，高溶质含量及浅埋深地下水条件为地表的蒸发提供了便利条件，因为高溶质含量土壤冰点降低，同一负温条件下的液态含水量增大，为蒸发提供了可利用水分；而浅埋深地下水对冻融期水盐的表聚提供的方便，进而有助于融化期地表水分的大量蒸发及下层土层水分的大量向上补给。例如，当地下水初始埋深设置在 1. 5 m时，对于初始含盐量分别为 0. 2 %， 0. 4 % 和 0. 6 % g/g的冻融试验组，冻融期累积蒸发量分别为 51. 0 ， 96. 6 和 114. 0 mm。同样的增加趋势在其它初始地下水埋深设置试验组里也被验证，且初始地下水埋深越浅，累积蒸发量也越大。CoupModel 与GLUE相结合的方法能够有效地根据实测数据对模型进行率定并经过筛选后得出较好的模拟结果集合。通过对筛选的模拟输出集合的不确定性分析，对模型模拟过程的不确定性有了很好的了解。模拟的地表能量分配过程显示，地表能量的日变化过程较为剧烈，并且对地表能量平衡系统的稳定性产生了显著影响。研究通过试验与模拟相结合的方法，展示了季节性冻融土壤中水热盐耦合运移过程的复杂性，同时也表明利用试验取样与数值模型相结合的方法研究冻融土壤中水热盐运移过程的必要性，并为高效的水资源管理决策的制定提供了有效的手段。 QC 20150518 </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the equilibrium vapor pressure over nitric acid solutions with observed water and nitric acid partial pressures in the stratosphere implies that nitric acid cannot be present as an aerosol particle in the lower stratosphere. A similar comparison for sulfuric acid solutions indicates that sulfuric acid aerosol particles are 75 % H 2 SO 4 by weight in water, in good agreement with direct observations. The <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> of H 2 SO 4 solutions requires that the H 2 SO 4 aerosol particles be solid or supercooled. The equilibrium vapor pressure of H 2 SO 4 in the stratosphere is {{of the order of}} 20 picotorr. At stratospheric temperatures, ammonium sulfate is in a ferroelectric phase.

This confirms the mechanism of this phenomenon proposed previously {{by the use of}} lattice models. For the liquid free energy, the Mansoori and Canfield variational method is used, which yields an effective volume- and temperature-dependent hard-sphere packing fraction. The solid free energy is calculated by means of the Lennard-Janes and Devonshire cell model, the Lindemann fraction also being evaluated.

40|$|The excess enthalpies, volumes and Gibbs free {{energies}} of mixing have been measured {{for a series}} of cyclic ethers with hexafluorobenzene.

The <b>freezing</b> <b>curve</b> of the system tetrahydropyran + hexaflucrobenzene has been determined shewing only a simple eutectic, indicating that the complex exists only in solution. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of some of these systems gave an insight into the possible orientation of the complex.

40|$|The ab-plane {{resistivity}} of Ba(Fe 1 -xRux) 2 As 2 (x = 0. 00, 0. 09, 0. 16, 0. 21, and 0. 28) was studied under nearly hydrostatic pressures, up to 7. 4 GPa, {{in order}} to explore the T-P phase diagram and to compare the combined effects of iso-electronic Ru substitution and pressure. The parent compound BaFe 2 As 2 exhibits a structural/magnetic phase transition near 134 K. At ambient pressure, progressively increasing Ru concentration suppresses this phase transition to lower temperatures at the approximate rate of ~ 5 K/% Ru and is correlated {{with the emergence of}} superconductivity. By applying pressure to this system, a similar behavior is seen for each concentration: the structural/magnetic phase transition is further suppressed and superconductivity induced and ultimately, for larger x Ru and P, suppressed. A detailed comparison of the T-P phase diagrams for all Ru concentrations shows that 3 GPa of pressure is roughly equivalent to 10 % Ru substitution. Furthermore, due to the sensitivity of Ba(Fe 1 -xRux) 2 As 2 to pressure conditions, the melting of the liquid media, 4 : 6 light mineral oil : n-pentane and 1 : 1 iso-pentane : n-pentane, used in this study could be readily seen in the resistivity measurements. This feature was used to determine the <b>freezing</b> <b>curves</b> for these media and infer their room temperature, hydrostatic limits: 3. 5 and 6. 5 GPa, respectively.

The <b>freezing</b> temperature-humidity <b>curves</b> for open containers and for droplets are the same. For a given temperature, surface freezing is nucleated at the liquid water–air interface by a high enough humidity, forming a surface ice crystal prior to freezing of bulk. The symmetry of the surface crystal, as well as the freezing point, depend on humidity, presenting at least three different types of surface crystals. An evidence of simultaneous nucleation of Surface ice single crystals is also provided.|$|R
