They were concerned that a formal apology could be construed as an admission of <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be {{in the interests of the}} children and their futures. Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any duty-of-care legal proceedings.|$|E

50|$|Janssen {{was almost}} {{certainly}} innocent of any <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> and this was recognised {{by the amount of}} his fortune that he was permitted to retain when the rest was taken to compensate investors - he was allowed to keep £50,000, a much-higher proportion than most of the other directors.|$|E
50|$|The {{law does}} not {{recognise}} a general duty of care to prevent others from suffering loss or damage caused by the <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> of third parties. A closer relationship between defendant and the wrongdoer is required to establish such a duty.

He was dismissed partly because he and Principal Guarn Sims differed over the way Studstill handled finances and supervised his assistant coaches, though no one has alleged <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> by Studstill.|$|E

Ogletree apologized, {{saying that}} he [...] "made a serious mistake during the editorial process of completing this book, and delegated too much responsibility to others during the final editing process."

5000|$|On August 1, 2014 the House Intelligence Committee has {{concluded}} that there was no <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> by the Obama administration in the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and that news briefing given by the administration reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger stated that [...] "the intelligence community warned about an increased environment, but did not have specific tactical warning of an attack before it happened". A report, released November 21, 2014, stated that it found no intelligence lapses, that Susan Rice's talking points were [...] "flawed", and was seen as invalidating several theories; the report was criticized by survivors and politicians, including Senator Lindsey Graham.|$|E
50|$|Bad lending {{decisions}} made by the State Bank of South Australia's board and managing director Tim Marcus Clark were exposed. As the bank's owner, the government was the guarantor of $3 billion worth of loans. Bannon remained as Premier during three inquiries, the last two of which cleared him of any <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> Upon resigning as head of government, {{he announced that he}} would not contest his seat of Ross Smith in the coming election. Lynn Arnold replaced Bannon as Premier but was unable to stave off a landslide defeat at the 1993 election. Labor achieved just 39 percent of the two-party vote, and suffered a swing of 9.1 percent against it. As a result, it retained only 10 seats in a house of 47.|$|E
40|$|The author {{successfully}} oposes {{the arguments}} of authors claiming that secession constitutes a legitimate remedy for different social and political wrongs perpetrated against {{the members of a}} minority group. He poses 2 key questions: How can secession as transfer of sovereignty and competence to a newly formed state constitute a remedy against the alleged wrongs that lead to the secession, and is secession the sole and most efficient means to remedy the above-mentioned wrongs? The author quotes defenders of secession, who claim that <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> by the means of systematic repression, unequal distribution of power and resources in a particular state and inability of a group of population to control the decision- making bodies in a particular state are the problems that lead to the secession. He provides valid arguments that each of the above-mentioned problems may be solved in the ways that don’t encompass secession. The author lucidly points out that secession does not necessarily remove the problems which a stateless community may face. He also deals with the controversial views that secession may constitute a legitimate response to systematic violations of human rights of inhabitants of a particular state. The author provides sound arguments disputing Buchanan’s views that an authority loses the right to sovereignty if it systematically violates the rights, pointing out that in secession anarchy and law-lessness may replace one form of rule rather than the transfer of state’s sovereignty to the secessionist powers. He also rejects arguments of those who use Locke’s theory of natural right to revolt as an excuse for the secession. 20 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{an annual}} tax subsidy that well exceeds $ 100 billion, most private {{healthcare}} expenses in the United States today {{are covered by}} employer-sponsored insurance. Like other important employee-welfare benefits, employer-sponsored health insurance is regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) - a landmark federal statute whose primary objective was the protection of private-sector retirement savings. A rich scholarly literature has developed which addresses the effects of federal tax and regulatory policy on the structure and performance of our healthcare industry. Within legal academia, however, one issue in particular has engendered much debate: to what extent has ERISA - because of {{the manner in which}} its preemption and civil enforcement provisions have been interpreted - created a system in which employees and their beneficiaries receive insufficient protection? Broadly speaking, commentators divide into two camps. One group believes that the status quo is grossly unjust and sadly ironic. In their view, legislation intended to protect employees and their beneficiaries against fiduciary misdeeds is habitually used as a shield by such fiduciaries against liability for negligence and even <b>deliberate</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> The other group believes that the status quo is the fair result of a sensible legislative compromise. They argue that the current system adequately protects employees and their beneficiaries while, at the same time, maximizing the overall level and quality of welfare benefits offered by employers. This paper addresses one of the most hotly contested questions in that debate: what civil remedies should be available in litigation against a welfare plan and its fiduciaries when a litigant has been injured by the wrongful handling of her benefits claim? Its modest goal is to illustrate that the decade-long conflict that has raged over this question is nothing more than an age-old consequentialist battle over liability rules which, for several often misunderstood reasons, is not amenable to simplistic legislative or judicial resolution...|$|E
