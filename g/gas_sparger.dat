40|$|A {{discrete}} bubble model (DBM) {{has been}} used to study the effect of <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> properties on the hydrodynamics in a bubble column. As a first step the performance of the model was evaluated by comparison with experimental data. Subsequently, four different perforated plates with different sparged areas were used as a <b>gas</b> <b>sparger.</b> Distributions of liquid velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and void fraction in the central plane were compared for the four different systems. Furthermore, the effect of the sparger location was also investigated. It was found that the liquid-phase circulation becomes more pronounced as the sparged area location is more distant {{from the center of the}} bottom plate. Finally, gas-phase residence time distributions (RTD) were obtained from the simulations. By employing standard axial dispersion model, the gas-phase mixing in the bubble column was characterized. Results show that the extent of mixing increased when the sparged area decreased. The axial dispersion coefficient increased as the sparged area was shifted to the edge of the bottom plate...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the fluid {{dynamics}} and transport phenomena in bubble columns depend mainly on the bubble column design (i. e., the column diameter, aspect ratio, and <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> openings) and the liquid phase properties. In this communication, we contribute to present-day discussion through an experimental study concerning the combined effects of the <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> design and liquid phase properties on both the gas holdup and the main flow regime transition. The experimental study concerning gas holdup measurements was conducted in a large-diameter and large-scale bubble column (with a height of 5. 3 m and inner diameter of 0. 24 m) operated in the batch mode. Air {{was used as the}} dispersed phase (using gas superficial velocities in the range 0. 004 – 0. 20 m/s), and various water–monoethylene glycol (MEG) solutions were employed as binary liquid phases. The water–MEG solutions tested have viscosities between 0. 9 mPa·s and 7. 97 mPa·s, densities between 997. 086 kg/m 3 and 1094. 801 kg/m 3, and surface tension between 0. 0715 N/m and 0. 0502 N/m. Two gas spargers were tested: (a) a spider sparger (“coarse gas sparger”) and (b) a needle sparger (“fine gas sparger”). The former produced a poly-dispersed homogeneous flow regime resulting in a concave gas holdup curve, whereas the latter produced a mono-dispersed homogeneous flow regime resulting in an S-shaped gas holdup curve. It was observed that the mono-dispersed bubble size distribution stabilized the homogeneous flow regime. The addition of MEG produced different effects depending on the <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> design. The addition of MEG in the “coarse gas sparger” configuration produced what is usually referred to as “dual effect of viscosity”: depending on the MEG concentration, the homogeneous flow regime was stabilized/destabilized, and thus, the gas holdup increased/decreased. Conversely, the addition of MEG in the “fine gas sparger” changed the shape of the gas holdup curve from an S-shape to concave, thus rendering it similar to the ones produced by “coarse gas sparger”. We speculate that viscous solutions reduce the influence of the inlet conditions in large-diameter and large-scale bubble columns; {{this is a matter of}} future research. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} {{admitted that the}} gas holdup is independent of the column dimensions and <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> design if three criteria are satisfied: {{the diameter of the}} bubble column is larger than 0. 15  m, <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> openings are larger than 1 – 2  mm and the aspect ratio is larger than 5. This paper contributes to the existing discussion; in particular, the effect of the aspect ratio (within the range 1 – 15) in a counter-current gas-liquid bubble column has been experimentally studied and a new gas holdup correlation to estimate the influence of aspect ratio, operation mode and working fluid on the gas holdup has been proposed. The bubble column, equipped with a spider <b>gas</b> <b>sparger,</b> is 5. 3  m in height, has an inner diameter of 0. 24  m; gas superficial velocities in the range of 0. 004 – 0. 23  m/s have been considered, and, for the runs with water moving counter-currently to the gas phase, the liquid has been recirculated at a superficial velocity of − 0. 0846  m/s. Filtered air has been used as the gaseous phase in all the experiments, while the liquid phase has included tap water and different aqueous solutions of sodium chloride as electrolyte. Gas holdup measurements have been used to investigate the flow regime transitions and the global bubble column hydrodynamics. The counter-current mode has turned out to increase the gas holdup and destabilize the homogeneous flow regime; the presence of electrolytes has resulted in increasing the gas holdup and stabilizing the homogeneous flow regime; the aspect ratio, up to a critical value, has turned out to decrease the gas holdup and destabilize the homogeneous flow regime. The critical value of the aspect ratio ranged between 5 and 10, depending on the bubble column operation (i. e., batch or counter-current modes) and liquid phase properties. Since no correlation has been found in the literature that can correctly predict the gas holdup under the investigated conditions, a new scheme of gas holdup correlation has been proposed. Starting from considerations concerning the flow regime transition, corrective parameters are included in the gas holdup correlation to account for the effect of the changes introduced by the aspect ratio, operation mode and working fluid. The proposed correlation has been found to predict fairly well the present experimental data as well as previously published gas holdup data...|$|E

40|$|Membrane fouling {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} {{in the application of}} microfiltration. Several techniques have been proposed to enhance the permeate flux during microfiltration. Gas sparging is a hydrodynamic method for improving the performance of the membrane process. In this study, a 0. 2 μm hollow fiber microfiltration membrane was used to study the effect of cross flow velocity (CFV) and gas injection factor () on the critical and limiting flux during microfiltration of pineapple juice. In addition, the phytochemical properties of clarified juice were investigated. In the absence of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging,</b> the critical and limiting flux increased as the CFV or shear stress number increased. The use of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> led to a remarkable improvement in both the critical and limiting flux but it was more effective at the lower CFV (1. 5 m s- 1), compared to those at higher CFV (2. 0 and 2. 5 m s- 1). When the gas injection factor was applied at 0. 15, 0. 25 and 0. 35 with a CFV of 1. 5 m s - 1, the enhancement of 55. 6 %, 75. 5 % and 128. 2 % was achieved for critical flux, while 65. 8 %, 69. 7 % and 95. 2 % was achieved for limiting flux, respectively. The results also indicated that the use of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> was an effective method to reduce reversible fouling and external irreversible fouling rather than internal irreversible fouling. In addition, the CFV and <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> did not affect pH, total soluble solids, colour, total phenolic content and the antioxidant property of the clarified juice. The l-ascorbic acid and total vitamin C were significantly decreased when the higher CFV and high gas injection factor were applied.

40|$|AbstractThe need {{to bring}} new {{biopharmaceutical}} products to market more quickly and to reduce final manufacturing costs is driving early stage, small scale bioprocess development. This work describes a comprehensive engineering characterisation of a novel, single-use 24 -well parallel miniature bioreactor system. Cell culture performance is also investigated, with particular focus on the aeration strategies adopted at this small scale (7 mL) either by headspace sparging alone or by direct <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> into the culture medium. Apparent volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) values ranged between 3 – 22 h− 1 and 4 – 53 h− 1 for headspace aeration and direct <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> respectively. The higher kLa values with direct <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> correlated directly {{with the increase in}} gas–liquid interfacial area per unit volume. Mixing times (tm) over a range of conditions were generally in the range 1 – 13 s and decreased with increasing shaking frequency (500 – 800 rpm). Direct <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> also served to reduce tm values by a factor of up to 19 fold. The impact of aeration strategies on cell culture kinetics of a model CHO cell line was also determined. Cultures performed with head space aeration alone showed the highest viable cell density (VCD) (15. 2 × 106 cellsmL− 1), viability retention and antibody titre (1. 58 gL− 1). These were greater than in conventional shake flask cultures due to the improved control of the μ 24 bioreactor system. In all cases the miniature bioreactor managed good control of process parameters such as pH 6. 95 ± 0. 4, temperature T°C 37 ± 0. 4 and DO% 57 ± 32. Cultures performed with direct <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> showed a 25 – 45 % reduction in VCD (depending on the aeration strategy used) and a similar reduction in antibody titre.

Department of Energy (DOE) and Air Products Liquid Phase Conversion Company, L. P. (the Partnership). Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) and Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman) formed the Partnership to execute the Demonstration Project. The LPMEOIYM Process Demonstration Unit was built at a site located at the Eastman complex in Kingsport. During this quarter, comments from the DOE on the Topical Report "Economic Analysis - LPMEOHTM Process as an Add-on to IGCC for Coproduction" were received. A recommendation to continue with design verification testing for the coproduction of dimethyl ether (DIME) and methanol was made. DME design verification testing studies show the liquid phase DME (LPDME) process will have a significant economic advantage for the coproduction of DME for local markets. An LPDME catalyst system with reasonable long-term activity and stability is being developed. A recommendation document summarizing catalyst targets, experimental results, and the corresponding economics for a commercially successful LPDME catalyst was issued on 30 June 1997. The off-site, product-use test plan was updated in June of 1997. During this quarter, Acurex Environmental Corporation and Air Products screened proposals for this task by {{the likelihood of the}} projects to proceed and the timing for the initial methanol requirement. Eight sites from the list have met these criteria. The formal submission of the eight projects for review and concurrence by the DOE will be made during the next reporting period. The site paving and final painting were completed in May of 1997. Start-up activities were completed during the reporting period, and the initial methanol production from the demonstration unit occurred on 02 April 1997. The first extended stable operation at the nameplate capacity of 80, 000 gallons per day (260 tons per day) took place on 06 April 1997.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{experimental study}} of gas-liquid contacting in an oscillatory baffled column is presented focusing {{on the effect of}} fluid oscillation on gas holdup and bubble size. The results show that beyond a critical level of fluid oscillation the Sauter mean diameter of the dispersion is substantially reduced, while the gas holdup (and, thus, the residence time of the gas phase) increases significantly. The reduction of bubble size was described in terms of bubble breakage, caused by the interaction of the bubbles with eddies. The experimental results were modeled by applying Kolmogoroff’s theory of isotropic turbulence. The steep increase in the gas holdup with oscillation was mainly due to bubble entrainment by large vortices, formed by the oscillatory flow in the presence of baffles. A semi-theoretical expression, based on the forces acting on a bubble, was proposed, and was able to accurately match the experimental trends.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in the operations of mammalian cell bioreactors is the detrimental effect of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging.</b> Since the most convenient way to oxygenate any bioreactor is by <b>gas</b> <b>sparging,</b> this adverse effect has often {{been one of the}} limiting oxygen transport problems in both laboratory and industrial mammalian cell bioreactors. When one examines the literature on the effect of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> on the death of mammalian cells, a great deal of confusions has been reported. It is not clear from the published literature as to the leading cause for gas-sparged related cell death. These confusions prevent the rational design and operations of mammalian cell bioreactors. In our laboratory, we have attempted to address this problem both fundamentally as well as attempt to obtain a general understanding on the adverse effect of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging.</b> Our analyses first examined the fluid shear associated with the various sections that the gas bubbles encounter during entrance, passage through the bioreactor and the final exit of the gas bubbles. Our analyses showed that the major damage of the mammalian cells by gas bubbles is due to the burst of the bubbles when exiting the bioreactor. It was also our hypothesis that the entrained cells in the liquid boundary layer of the gas bubble upon bursting is the major cause for cell death. We have corroborated this hypothesis by correlating the liquid entrainment with the cell death rate using results from our laboratory as well as other studies. Pluonic F- 68, a weak surfactant, has routinely been used in laboratory and industrial bioreactors. In the past, the protective effect of Pluronic F- 68 has never been shown as to why it is effective. In our research, we have data using microphotography which clearly demonstrated and corroborated our entrainment hypothesis is the major reason for the effectiveness of Pluronic F- 68 in protecting the cells from gas-sparged related cell death.

Agreement between automated and manual classification, measured in terms of a performance index, is 98 % for single bubbles identification. Further, the present work describes the application of such methodology to the study of temperature, type of <b>gas</b> <b>sparger,</b> and liquid phase properties (viscosity and surface tension) influence on the individual components of volumetric liquid side mass transfer coefficient, kLa. The results show that the different experimental parameters and liquid properties act by a particular way on kL and a.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is used {{to convert}} unusable waste such as livestock manure, wastewater, solid waste and food waste into valuable end products such as biogas. Wastewater treatment plants are required to intensify wastewater digestion process using existing digester capacity by processing concentrated sludge, which affects digester mixing performance. There have been many studies on digester hydrodynamics, but digester mixing is still carried out based on empirical evidence rather than fluid mechanical studies. The main objective of this work {{is to determine the}} optimum mixing method/s for digesters using a hydrodynamic study. This involved a model liquid to represent sludge. Flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) are employed in this work. Also, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are developed and validated using flow visualisation experimental data. All experiments were conducted in a 0. 19 m diameter cylindrical tank. Three mixing systems, namely mechanical mixing, liquid recirculation and <b>gas</b> <b>sparging,</b> were implemented. Xanthan gum Keltrol-T (XGKT) solution was selected as the model liquid because its rheological characteristics are similar to digester sludge. Specific power inputs ranging from 3. 5 to 10. 5 W/m 3 were employed. Dye tracer and brine solution were used as tracers in flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) techniques respectively. Inactive mixing volume was determined by measuring the volume of the coloured and low conductivity regions in flow visualisation and ERT experiments, respectively. Experimental results show that the total inactive volume in the model digester decreases with increasing mixing time and reaches a plateau. Larger inactive volume was found in solutions with higher apparent viscosity regardless of the mixing mode used. Increasing power input beyond a certain value was found to have no influence in the reduction of inactive volume in liquid recirculation and <b>gas</b> <b>sparging.</b> In case of mechanical mixing, a threshold power input is required to achieve an acceptable value of the active volume. Experiments with liquid recirculation and <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> systems were conducted with different nozzle orientations to study their effect on inactive volume reduction. Downward jet in liquid recirculation system produces the largest inactive volume, and upward and angled jets lead to smaller inactive volumes. In <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> system, the downward sparger with a low tank bottom clearance leads to the smallest inactive volume. Therefore, the position and orientation of fluid inlet nozzles are very important in the design and operation of digesters processing thicker sludge. ERT can be used to estimate the shape and size of the active mixing region. It provides information on the inactive volume reduction rate and the final dead volume up to a certain level of accuracy depending on the mixing system. However, the estimations require further investigations and improvements. Overall, ERT has the potential of being used in the study of inactive volume in real sludge. CFD models are developed only for mechanical mixing and liquid recirculation systems. The models estimate the flow patterns and the inactive volume fairly well. However, the CFD model for the mechanical mixing system could not predict the presence of a threshold power input) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of ethylhexadecyldimethylammonium bromide (EHDA-Br) at liquid-air interfaces {{generated by}} bubbling {{a constant stream}} of air through an aqueous solution was determined with a 2 in. diameter foram separation column equipped with a <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> made of porous stainless steel (20 mu pores). The results obtained from batch operation with total recirculation of the collapsed foam as well as from continuous operation showed that the surface excess Gamma depends on foam rate as well as bulk concentration whereas Gibbs' adsorption isotherm predicts a constant value for Gamma. It was concluded that the application of Gibbs' equation to the prediction of the surface excess accumulated at dynamic interfaces generated in the foam separation process for EHDA-Br is probably justified only under the rather stringent conditions of good drainage and perfect stability of the foam. Equations proposed to predict the performance characteristics of a continuous pool-feed foam separation column based on Gibbs' equation and an ideal foam model were also found to be valid under the same conditions. The effect on the various parameters describing the efficiency of a continuous foam separation column was studies for the following variables: feed concentration, foam column height, feed rate, column diameter. An attempt was also made to analyze the continuous foam separation process by utilizing the concept of the HTU...|$|E
40|$|In urban {{waste water}} treatment, a novel <b>gas</b> <b>sparger</b> based on {{flexible}} rubber membrane {{has been used for}} the last ten years. The objective of this present work is to compare two flexible membranes (the new membrane and the old membrane provided by ONDEO-DEGREMONT group) used in waste water treatment. For this purpose, the different membrane properties (hole diameter, pressure drop, critical pressure, deflection at the centerline and elasticity) have been characterized. The bubble generation at the membranes with a single orifice and with four orifices have been studied and their performances have been compared in terms of interfacial area and power consumption. From the experimental and theoretical approach, the new membrane is less elastic (or more rigid) than the old membrane. The bubble diameters generated from the new membrane remain constant with the gas velocity through the orifice, whereas they increase logarithmically for the old membrane. The inverse behaviours are observed in terms of the bubble formation frequency. Moreover, the bubbles generated from the new membrane have significantly larger sizes and lower formation frequencies than those obtained with the old one. From these results, it can be noted that the new membrane has a behaviour comparable to a rigid orifice. No coalescence phenomenon at the bubble formation is observed from the new and the old membranes with four orifices. The interfacial area and the power consumption are evaluated and show slight differences between the interfacial area provided by {{the old and the new}} membranes for one value of power consumption...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effect of}} liquid {{properties}} (surfactants) on bubble generation phenomenon, interfacial area and liquid side mass transfer coefficient was investigated. The measurements of surface tension (static and dynamic methods), of Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) and of characteristic adsorption parameters such as the surface coverage ratio at equilibrium (se) were performed to understand the effects of surfactants on the mass transfer efficiency. Tap water and aqueous solutions with surfactants (cationic and anionic) were used as liquid phases and an elastic membrane with a single orifice as <b>gas</b> <b>sparger.</b> The bubbles were generated into a small-scale bubble column. The local liquid side mass transfer coefficient (kL) {{was obtained from the}} volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) and the interfacial area (a) was deduced from the bubble diameter (DB), the bubble frequency (fB) and the terminal bubble rising velocity (UB). Only the dynamic bubble regime was considered in this work (ReOR = 150 - 1000 and We = 0. 002 - 4). This study has clearly shown that the presence of surfactants affects the bubble generation phenomenon and thus the interfacial area (a) and the different mass transfer parameters, such as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) and the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (kL). Whatever the operating conditions, the new kLa determination method has provided good accuracy without assuming that the liquid phase is perfectly mixed as in the classical method. The surface coverage ratio (se) proves to be crucial for predicting the changes of kL in aqueous solutions with surfactants...|$|E

40|$|The denitrifier Pseudomonas perfectomarina reduced nitrite under {{conditions}} of kinetic competition between cells and <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> for extracellular dissolved nitric and nitrous oxides, NOaq and N 2 Oaq, in a chemically defined marine medium. Time courses of nitrite reduction and NOg and N 2 Og removal were integrated to give NOg, and N 2 Og yields. At high sparging rates, the NOg yield was > 50 % of nitrite-N reduced, and the yield of NOg + N 2 Og was ~ 75 %. Hence interrupted denitrification yields NOaq and N 2 Oaq as major products. The yields varied with sparging rates in agreement with a quantitative model of denitrification (Betlach, M. P., and Tiedje, J. M. (1981) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 42, 1074 - 1084) that applies simplified Michaelis-Menten kinetics to NO 2 > NOaq > N 2 Oaq > N 2. The fit gave {{an estimate of the}} maximum scavengeable NOaq yield of 73 ± 8 % of nitrite-N. Thus a minor path independent of NOaq is also required. The fit of the model to data at lower sparging rates, where normal denitrification products predominate, implies that the extracellular NOaq pool yield is independent of <b>gas</b> <b>sparging</b> rate. Thus in P. perfectomarina NOaq and N 2 Oaq are intermediates, or facilely equilibrate with true intermediates, during complete denitrification. The recovery of most nitrite-N as NO and/or N 20 under perturbed conditions is not an artifact of irreversible product removal, but an attribute of denitrification in this species, and most probably it is characteristic of denitrification in other species as well...|$|R
