5000|$|A Show, {{another term}} for 'meet' or 'event' (in several countries, 'fair') simply {{describes}} the {{forum for the}} exhibition of the toys, dolls and collectibles. A show may {{be held in the}} meeting rooms of a hotel (the Miami show does this, as does the Boston show, and the producers will typically choose a venue near the area's metropolitan/international airport for the convenience of dealers and guests alike), or in the large buildings at a fairground (the Chicago, York and Toledo shows are good examples), or at any other site that is simply large enough, and provides enough parking space, {{to meet the needs of}} the sellers and buyers. Within the given exhibition space, dealers will set up their toys, dolls and collectibles on tables that generally are 30" [...] x 72" [...] each, and are sometimes (as in Miami) 30" [...] x 96" [...] each. One dealer may only need a single table for his display, but the next dealer may need six or eight contiguous tables for the same purpose. The tables, including their set-up, are provided by the host facility. The facility charges the toy show promoter a fee for each table, and that fee is passed on to the dealer.

40|$|One of the {{unresolved}} {{issues in}} case-based design {{is how to}} perform design case adaptation when the constraints are not numerical. In this paper we present a method of case adaptation that employs an evolutionary algorithm. We present a process model for evolutionary design case adaptation, {{as well as the}} knowledge it requires and its implications. This model has been implemented for <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> using a case-base of Frank Lloyd Wright prairie houses and an evaluation using feng shui constraints. The implementation demonstrates the representation issues and shows how the model can address two distinct knowledge sources. The design process model presented in this paper addresses design synthesis and evaluation by combining the paradigms of case-based reasoning (CBR, see for example (Kolodner, 1993)) and evolutionary or genetic algorithms (GA’s, see for example (Mitchell, 1998)). The process model, illustrated in Figure 1, emphasises solving problems using inspiration from precedents; this is the main idea behind CBR. The solutions to past design problems contained in the precedents that are retrieved serve as starting points for a search for design solutions. Multiple random combinations and modifications (together referred to as adaptations) of the retrieved cases are then generated and evolved incrementally, until a satisfactory solution to the new design problem is found; this is the main idea behind GA’s. In this paper we present the process model in general terms and as applied to <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout.</b> The model can be used to perform a variety of design tasks on a broad set of application domains, so far it has been implemented for the <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> and structural design domain...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the foundations of}} a novel approach that deals with constraint-based design methods to supporting participatory planning processes of low-income dwellings. We examine the space allocation problem inside the architectural domain {{on the basis of}} graph theory and combinatorics, providing a concise mathematical background for an implementation strategy called FLS (<b>Floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>Layout</b> Support), which is analyzed {{here for the first time}} regarding this particular context of application. The philosophy underlying a design method that is mainly driven by the formulation of distinct constraints suggests to avoid the traditional procedure of first to create a yet not necessarily valid instance of the eventual design solution by directly choosing specific parameter values of its shape, and later on to evaluate its validity by confronting the designed model to a set of applicable constraints. Instead, constraint-based design poses a search procedure that operates in a space of planning-relevant constraint sets. The FLS methodology integrates some few principles of constraint-based automated reasoning with high user interactivity, into a design environment where as much dwellers as planners can collaboratively work in solving spatial organization problems of housing projects. The FLS model of application makes use of a combination of dweller-specified constraints, planning and zoning regulations, and a small library of modular space units. Constraint-based design ! methods are particularly capable of supplying efficient support for the collaborative involvement of dwellers into the architectural programming process of her/his own home. Mainly, because dwellers themselves tend to describe their space need and design intentions as a set of constraints on room quantity, space utilization, circulation system, allocation of available furniture, available budget, construction time, and so forth. The goal is to achieve an integrated tool for finding and modelling topologically valid solutions for <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> alternatives, by combining user-driven interactive procedures with automatic search and generative processes. Thus, several design alternatives can be explored in less time and with less effort than using mainstream procedures of architectural practice. A FLS implementation will constitute one system module of a larger integrated system model called Esther. A FLS tool shall interact with other functional modules, like e. g. the BDS (Building Bulk Design Support), which also uses constraint-based design methods. A preliminary procedural model for the FLS was tested on Chile’s official social housing standards (Chilean Building Code – OGUC. Art. 6. 4. 1) which are very similar to most Latin American housing programs currently in operation...|$|E

In this paper we introduce the so called design patterns, developed by Christopher Alexander in the 1970 s, in order to handle these problems systematically. The presentation formally follows Alexander’s structure in some cases, which are all related to practical experiments on being private or public at home. We start with a number of concrete user situations related to human-computer interaction. Social and communicative phenomena or possibilities end up in novel design patterns at the interface between an architectural and a technological perspective. The novel patterns presented are primarily based on experiences from practical work on the development of a conceptual dwelling of the future, comHOME, designed and constructed as a full-scale model of a flat.

40|$|A {{through life}} {{non-destructive}} evaluation technique {{is presented in}} which a key solder joint feature, nucleating at the bump to silicon interface and propagating across a laminar crack plane is captured and tracked using acoustic microscopy imaging (AMI). The feasibility of this concept was successfully demonstrated by employing the measurement technique in combination with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to study the impact of component <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> on the reliability of electronics systems subjected to thermal cycling. A comprehensive review of current and emerging packaging and interconnect technologies has shown increasingly a move from conventional 2 D to 3 D packaging. These present new challenges for reliability and Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) due to solder joints being hidden beneath the packaging, and not ordinarily visible or accessible for inspection. Solutions are developed using non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques that {{have the potential to}} detect and locate defects in microelectronic devices. This thesis reports on X-ray and Acoustic Micro Imaging (AMI) which have complementary image discriminating features. Gap type defects are hard to find using X-ray alone due to low contrast and spot size resolution, whereas AMI having better axial resolution has allowed cracks and delamination at closely spaced interfaces to be investigated. The application of AMI to the study of through life solder joint behaviour has been achieved for the first time. Finite Element Analysis and AMI performance were compared to measure solder joint reliability for several realistic test cases. AMI images were taken at regular intervals to monitor through- life behaviour. Image processing techniques were used to extract a diameter measurement for a laminar crack plane, within a solder joint damage region occurring at the bump to silicon interface. FEA solder joint reliability simulations for flip-chip and micro-BGA (mBGA) packages placed on FR 4 PCB's were compared to the AMI measurement performance, with a reasonable level of correlation observed. Both techniques clearly showed significant reliability degradation of the critical solder joints located furthest from the neutral axis of the package, typically residing at the package corners. The technique also confirmed that circuit board thickness can affect interconnect reliability, as can floor plan. Improved correlation to the real world environment was achieved when simulation models considered the entire <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> and constraints imposed on the circuit board assembly. This thesis established a novel through life solder joint evaluation method crucial to the development of better physics of failure models and the advancement of model based prognostics in electronics systems.

40|$|Case-based {{reasoning}} (CBR) {{provides a}} methodology for directly using previous designs {{in the development}} of a new design. An aspect of CBR that is not well developed for designing is the combination and adaptation of previous designs. The difficulty with this aspect of case-based design is partly due to the extensive amounts of specialised knowledge needed to select the appropriate features of a previous design to include in the new design and the adaptation of these features to fit the context of a new design problem. In this paper we present a design process model that combines ideas from CBR and genetic algorithms (GA’s). The CBR paradigm provides a method for the overall process of case selection and adaptation. The GA paradigm provides a method for adapting design cases by combining and mutating their features until a set of new design requirements and constraints are satisfied. We have implemented the process model and illustrate the model for residential <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout.</b> We use a set of Frank Lloyd Wright prairie house layouts as the case base. The constraints used to determine whether new designs proposed by the process model are acceptable are taken from feng shui, the Chinese art of placement.

Despite recent advances in the production of research-based knowledge, the professional practices lack of a consistent and permanent technology adoption scheme and remain as a very resilient and fragmented industry. This work is a part of an ongoing research project developing guidelines for improving both physical and virtual modeling processes within an architectural design context. Here, we present a customizable model of a space layout explorer. The implementation of the user-driven solution-finding process is based on constraint technology embedded in Autodesk’s Revit® 2011 macros tools, commonly used in the professional practice. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a practical use of a small constraint-based system on software of widespread use.

The main findings are discussed as guidelines for further research on the end-user involvement on a "creative mass customization" scheme.

The only possible work which may show some similarities is Shpuza’s paper, (Shpuza 2013), on the effect of foreground network properties such as length and connectivity on the integration of street network in order to quantify this effect he defined the foreground network in four different thresholds including the highest 90, 80, 70, and 60  % values of choice. He showed that among them the mean length and the mean connectivity of the 80  % foreground network had the highest influence on the axial map integration. The method also has conceptual similarities to some of Hillier’s investigations in ‘the laws of the field’ (Hillier 1996 b) where he identifies how within the confines of a grid, inserting walls have different distance and configurational effects depending on where in the field they are added—and consecutively where additional walls are added in relation to earlier additions. It also similarly relates to some investigations of office floor plate shapes and configuration by Shpuza (2006) that studies how interruptions in <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layouts</b> by e.g. structural elements have different effects depending on both floor plate shape and organization of work places in offices.|$|R

In temperate climates, passive ventilation and cooling techniques can be utilized to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort using natural ventilation.

There are few tools to predict the thermal performance of and resulting airflow patterns in naturally ventilated {{office buildings}} accurately. This thesis presents three significant contributions for the evaluation of natural ventilation in buildings: * A methodology for assessing the performance of naturally ventilated buildings through a reduced-scale air model was developed based on dimensional analysis and similitude criteria.

Data from the reduced-scale model were compared to the data obtained from monitoring a prototype building and then used in creating numerical simulations. (cont.)

It may be argued that for many standard and smaller buildings, designing for natural ventilation is straightforward: a simple process of drawing diagrams to illustrate how air flows within the building, which can achieve satisfactory comfort conditions. However, {{there is a significant}} lack of information in the current literature to demonstrate the complexity and challenges in designing large, naturally ventilated buildings. This is especially true when the new double-skin facade (DSF) configuration is used as a means of conserving energy while providing superior thermal comfort.

40|$|System {{design is}} tied to both {{functionality}} and geometric realization. The former is pertinent to system performance, and the latter is related to packaging. Packaging is an optimization process that finds a desirable placement for the system components within a given space. When the components do not fit into the allocated space at the packaging stage, the design engineers must make modifications that can affect {{the performance of the}} system. The modification of a component can also affect the geometry and positions of other components in the system. These changes might lead to an infeasible layout. Therefore, optimizing the system performance considering packaging is desirable. Packaging problems and solution methods have been studied in many applications, such as electrical circuit layout, glass or metal cutting, truck loading, trunk packing, rapid prototyping (RP), architectural <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout,</b> routing, and mechanical component layout. Packaging problems in a mechanical system design are more challenging than 2 D applications such as circuit layout and the metal cutting problem; this is due to a larger design space and increased complexity of geometry. Complex 3 D geometry leads to increased computational time for interference checking, which is inevitable for finding a feasible layout. Detailed 3 D CAD models, however, are not required or not available at the preliminary design stage. Therefore, abstract representation of the components is necessary during the layout process. Abstract models should balance accuracy of geometry representation and rapid computation capturing designers’ intent. This dissertation presents a computational environment for addressing the combined packaging and optimal system design. The packaging problem also includes pipe generation because pipe routing is also important problems in mechanical system design.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the layout design problems known as the'spatial allocation problems'gave rise to several approaches, which can be generally classified into two main streams. The first attempts to use the computer to generate solutions of the building layout, while in the second, computers are used only to evaluate manually generated solutions. In both classes the generation or evaluation of the layout are performed systematically. Computer algorithms for'spatial allocation problems'first appeared more than twenty-five years ago (Koopmans, 1957). From 1957 to 1970 over thirty different programs were developed for generating the <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> automatically, as is summarized in CAP-Computer Architecture Program, Vol. 2 (Stewart et al., 1970). It seems that any architect who entered the area of CAAD {{felt that it was}} his responsibility to find a solution to this prime architectural problem. Most of the programs were developed for batch processing, and were run on a mainframe without any sophisticated input/output devices. It is interesting to mention that, {{because of the lack of}} these sophisticated input/output devices, early researchers used the approach of automatic generation of optimal or quasioptimal layout solution under given constraints. Gradually, we find a recession and slowdown in the development of computer programs for generation of layout solutions. With the improvement of interactive input/output devices and user interfaces, the inclination today is to develop integrated systems in which the architectural solution is obtained manually by the architect and is introduced to the computer for the appraisal of the designer's layout solution (Maver, 1977). The manmachine integrative systems could work well, but it seems that in most of the integrated systems today, and in the commercial ones in particular, there is no route to any appraisal technique of the layout problem. Without any evaluation techniques in commercial integrated systems it seems that the geometrical database exists Just to create working drawings and sometimes also perspectives...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an architecture}} practice-oriented implementation strategy of constraint-based methods called BDS (Building Bulk Design Support) to supporting bulk analysis during the architectural programming phase. We examine the optmization problem of site coverage and building massing {{according to a}} set of standard planning and zoning regulations, and try a problem solving approach based on the paradigm of constraint satisfaction problems. The case study, which is focused on the paticipatory planning of very low-income dwellings within the Latin American context, serves as testbed for a prototypical application of the adopted methodology. The BDS constitutes a novel approach on computer-aided bulk analysis, regarding this particularly relevant context of application. In the case of participatively planned low-income housing projects, efficiency regarding time and cost of planning directly affects dwellers’ quality of life, whereas elementary programming tasks such as bulk analysis lack appropriate state-of-the-art technological support. Traditional architectural planning methods demand a large domain-specific knowledge base and skillful planners. A planning process, which is mainly driven by the formulation of planning-relevant constraints and sets of solution alternatives, suggests to avoid architects’ traditional procedure of: 1. Create an (yet not necessarily valid) instance of the eventual design solution by directly choosing specific values for its shape parameters. 2. Evaluate its validity by confronting the designed model {{to a set of}} applicable constraints, which have to be satisfied. Instead, the constraint-based design methodology poses a search procedure that operates in a space of pertinent constraint sets. A computer-aided interactive search procedure to find more valid design solution alternatives in less time and with less effort is particularly qualified to supply efficient support for participatory planning activities carried out between dwellers and planners. The set of solutions for a building-bulk design problem is constrained by both a large complex system of planning and zoning regulations and the geometry of the eventual design solution itself. Given a considerable amount of such regulations, a regular size geometric constraint satisfaction system proved to be capable of providing a highly efficient, interactive modeling and evaluation tool for the formulation in real time of valid solution alternatives for an ordinary building-bulk design problem. A BDS implementation will constitute one system module of a larger integrated system model called Esther. A BDS tool shall interact with other functional modules, like e. g. the FLS (<b>Floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>Layout</b> Support), which also uses constraint-based design methods...|$|E
40|$|As {{the world}} {{population}} continues to grow, food supply is increasingly under pressure. In the recent decades in China, rapid urbanization {{has led to}} a nation wide scarcity of arable land. Without intervention, a national – or even global - food crisis could be imminent. The Vertical Cities Asia competition brief asked for a proposal in which 100 000 people could live, work and play within a 1 km 2 plot in the south of Chengdu. The agriculture and food problem is particularly relevant to the Chengdu region, since this region is responsible for a large share of China’s rice supply throughout history. With the focus on food security, the intention of this proposal is to preserve the existing arable land and revise the current food supply chain, {{but at the same time}} to accommodate the influx of rural migrants - one of the greatest causes for Chengdu’s population growth. Given these preliminaries, the construction of a vertical town with an ultra high density seems inevitable. Reaching a high urban density is often done through the most economic way; skyscrapers in CBD’s, condominium parks dominate existing cities. However, each high-rise becomes a ‘cul-de-sac’ in the urban circulation, where transportation and movement still pressurizes the ground floor space. In order to achieve a true vertical town, circulation should take place on all (elevated) levels. Daily activities and needs are all accommodated within the vertical town, detached from the ground floor. A 72 x 72 x 72 m cube appears to be a suitable module to build up this vertical town. The 72 x 72 x 72 measurement is generic enough to suit a wide range of program, since the <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> is flexible enough fulfil different program requirements. Not only can each cube be dedicated to a program according to the current demands, but it also has the ability to change in function over time. By stacking the cubes on a minimal foot print, the adjacent arable land can be left untouched and continue to be used for food production. Certain rules are set out to dictate the method of stacking and linking. With this set of rules, there will be a large freedom in the town’s growth – horizontally and vertically – while fulfilling daylight, circulation and structural requirements. At the same time, the cubes are stacked in such a way to create maximum surfaces for urban farming. By stimulating local production of food, intermediary parties in the conventional food supply chain can be eliminated; consumers buy directly at the producers. Not only can this lead to a greater awareness of food production, but it will also contribute to the reduction of transportation. In turn, this means less air pollution and less fossil fuel consumption. Hence, sustainability is achieved by the prevention of existing problems, rather than resolving the consequences after the problem has occurred. On the scale of Chengdu, this Agropolis is part of a long-term vision to emphasize the importance of agriculture. The proposal intends to limit Chengdu’s horizontal expansion to only growth in Chengdu’s ‘fingers’, thereby preserving the existing agricultural land in-between. In the end the density issue is tackled in a way that the urbanism itself could occur anywhere in the world, and the entire story about farming and migrations of farmers makes it a specific project for China and the city of Chengdu.

5000|$|In 1988, Leuchter {{traveled}} to several sites of structures identified as gas chambers, where, {{although he did}} not have permission to do so, he collected samples from walls, ceilings and floors, using a chisel and hammer to chip and scrape off pieces of the masonry. He took copious notes about the <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>layout,</b> and all of his actions were videotaped by a cameraman. (Leuchter, who had been married for about one month before the trip, told his wife that the trip to Auschwitz-Birkenau was their honeymoon.) Leuchter then brought the samples back to Boston, where he presented them to Alpha Analytical Laboratories, a chemical laboratory, for testing. Leuchter told Alpha only that he would use the samples as evidence in a court case about an industrial accident. The lab tested them for exposure to cyanide and found trace amounts in the crematoria, which Leuchter dismissed in his report: ...|$|R
40|$|A chosen {{case study}} house {{forms the basis}} of this paper, which is a pilot {{energy-efficient}} social housing project, completed by one of the largest housing developers in the UK. The main aim {{of this study is to}} inform the redesign of flexible energy-efficient housing units. The housing, designed for social tenants, was built by the Accent Group in 2005, using modern construction methods and sustainable materials, based on extensive research from the adaptable and “Grow Home” principles of Avi Friedman as well as open building implementation. The first pilot scheme was designed in collaboration with the Building Energy Analysis Unit at the University of Sheffield, together with the Goddard Wybor Practise, and was a successful housing development with respect to being environmentally friendly and a low-energy design scheme for the UK climate. This paper presents redesigning of flexible terraced housing units, and their performance evaluation, using a building simulation method as well as the passive-house planning package. The aim was to plan a row of terraced houses that can not only utilize a flexible design concept in <b>floor</b> <b>planning</b> <b>layout,</b> but also to reduce energy consumption with a passive design with particular attention paid to material selection. In addition, building simulation work has been carried out with the use of DesignBuilder software for both thermal and energy performance evaluation. The study examines the annual energy performance and comfort conditions in the designed house to be situated in the Northeast of England, UK. A terraced house unit design is considered a flexible home that can adjust to the needs of different tenants for the purpose of achieving a sustainable building under different aspects, such as low energy, low carbon, use of renewables, and low impact materials, with flexibility by design...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of design constraints for use in analyzing the capacity of the residential units' floor areas in Open Building projects. Two cases are used to demonstrate the use of these constraints: a vacant office building (Kales Building) being converted to residential occupancy; a new multi-story building the lower floors of which are hotel rooms and the upper floors are residential condominium units. The thesis suggests that these constraints and the capacity analysis of residential floor areas associated with them can assist design teams, at the beginning of similar projects; provide important "added value" to clients, and contribute to the long term "sustainability" or adaptability of buildings. The first part of the thesis addresses {{the question of how to}} design a residential base building which can accommodate an optimal number and variety of fit-out unit layouts. The answer to the question links to the need for design constraints and points to their use in capacity analysis. The second part of the thesis {{focuses on the}} deduction of "constraint-designing" for Open Building residential layout. Plumbing systems, which are one of the most significant barriers to the application of Open Building, are specifically and more deeply studied in this part. A series of constraints are developed, which can generally assist in designing and analyzing floor plate capacity.. It is akin to learning to know the rules before starting a game. The third part of the thesis focuses on the demonstration of the uses of constraints in the design process of the conversion of an abandoned office building to residential uses. The last part of the thesis demonstrates the use of constraints and capacity analysis in a new multi-story condo project. In short, the paper is initially concerned with both the design concept and its application into detail levels in one of the many issues. It is a study of methods and technical rules of designing <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> <b>layouts</b> when capacity analysis is the aim. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. Arch. ...|$|R
