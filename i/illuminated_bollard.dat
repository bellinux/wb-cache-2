5000|$|Internally {{illuminated}} traffic bollards {{have been}} in existence throughout the United Kingdom since the 1930s, although the term [...] "bollard" [...] only seems to {{have been in}} common use since the late 1940s. An <b>illuminated</b> <b>bollard</b> has a recessed base light unit in the foundation which illuminates the traffic bollard from all angles. The main components are housed {{below the surface of the}} improvement (typically a concrete surface). Therefore, if a vehicle strikes the traffic bollard, the units below the surface are not damaged.|$|E

50|$|<b>Illuminated</b> <b>bollards</b> {{are also}} used to {{supplement}} street signs and street lighting to provide a visual cue to approaching drivers that an obstacle exists ahead during hours of darkness and during periods of low visibility: (fog, rain, snow, haze, etc.) and to indicate that braking may be required.|$|R

50|$|They are {{primarily}} used at roundabout intersections within the splitter islands (a raised or painted {{area on the}} approach of a roundabout used to separate entering from exiting traffic, deflect and slow entering traffic, and provide a stopping place for pedestrians crossing the road in two stages) and {{at the ends of}} pedestrian refuge islands, typically located at mid-block pedestrian crosswalks. <b>Illuminated</b> <b>bollards</b> are also used in Hong Kong, a former British colony.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, {{recent years}} have seen a {{proliferation}} of various kinds of beacons and <b>bollards,</b> <b>illuminated,</b> reflective or otherwise designed for high visibility at pedestrian crossings, to which the name Belisha or [...] "Bellisher" [...] is occasionally erroneously applied. These high-visibility crossing markers are often placed on refuge islands {{in the middle of}} the road, in addition to or instead of at the roadside. Many of these new crossings are signposted that pedestrians must give way to traffic.|$|R
