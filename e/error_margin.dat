This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling {{as a result of}} gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an <b>error</b> <b>margin</b> of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913. However, oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy flux}} from Vega has been {{precisely}} measured against standard light sources. At 5480Å, the flux is 3,650Jy with an <b>error</b> <b>margin</b> of 2%. The visual spectrum of Vega {{is dominated by}} absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal quantum number. The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium. The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent. However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar coronal hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted {{along the line of}} sight.|$|E

25|$|The clay tablets {{that were}} {{reported}} to the excavators of Kish in 1925 {{may not have been}} the first to come from Jemdet Nasr. Already before 1915, a French antiquities dealer had bought tablets that reportedly came from the site through looting. He sold them in lots to the French dealer Dumani Frères, the Louvre and the British Museum, while those resold to Dumani Frères were subsequently purchased by James Breasted for the Oriental Institute in Chicago. Another group of tablets was purchased in Kish in the 1930s and of these it was asserted that they came from Jemdet Nasr, although this is unlikely due to stylistic differences between these tablets and those excavated at Jemdet Nasr in 1926. During the first regular excavation season in 1926, between 150 and 180 tablets were found in Mound B; the <b>error</b> <b>margin</b> resulting from gaps in the administration kept by the excavators.

They did observe that measurements taken at Los Alamos were greater than those made at Berkeley, which they attributed to cosmic rays, which are more numerous at Los Alamos, which is [...] above sea level. While their measurements indicated a spontaneous fission rate of 40 fissions per gram per hour, which was high but acceptable, the <b>error</b> <b>margin</b> was unacceptably large. In April 1944 they received a sample from the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Tests soon indicated 180 fissions per gram per hour, which was unacceptably high. It fell to Bacher to inform Compton, who was visibly shaken. Suspicion fell on plutonium-240, an isotope that had not yet been discovered, but whose existence had been suspected, it being simply created by a plutonium-239 nucleus absorbing a neutron. What had not been suspected was its high spontaneous fission rate. Segrè's group measured it at 1.6 million fissions per gram per hour, compared with just 40 per gram per hour for plutonium-239. [...] This meant that reactor-bred plutonium was unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a predetonation that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass before enough plutonium reacted. A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. So too was the possibility of separating the isotopes, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.|$|E

The study involves both model studies and field data analysis. A total of thirty (30) Schlumberger VES data sets generated for multilayered (3 - 5 layers) geologic models and field VES data from ten (10) drilled sites in the Basement Complex areas were employed. RESIST version 1. 0 software was used for the refinement of the preliminary interpretation results (layer parameters) obtained from model and field data. Statistical analysis of percentage deviations between model and final interpretation parameters was carried out; while composite plots of the interpreted and borehole derived depths were done. The <b>error</b> <b>margins</b> obtained in each of the conventional partial curve matching, asymptotes/inflection points and type curve-controlled guess technique respectively are significantly between ± 10 %;- 30 and + 40 % and- 30 and + 10 % in resistivity estimates; ± 10 %;- 10 and + 130 % and- 40 and + 100 % in depth estimates in the theoretical model data. The <b>error</b> <b>margins</b> in depth in the field data trial are significantly between- 35 and + 5 % for partial curve matching,- 90 and + 20 % for asymptotes/inflection points and- 85 and- 10 % for type curve-controlled guess technique.

40|$|Assessing output {{errors of}} ice flow models {{is a major}} {{challenge}} {{that needs to be}} addressed if we are to increase our confidence level in projections of mass balance in Antarctica and Greenland. Major inputs to ice flow models include geometry (ice thickness and surface elevation), constitutive laws and boundary conditions (geothermal flux, basal drag coefficient, surface temperature). These inputs can be either measured, in which case they carry errors due to instruments, or inferred using inverse methods (such as basal drag which is inverted using InSAR surface velocities) in which case they carry additional errors generated by the inversion process itself. In both cases, these input errors will result in uncertainties that propagate throughout a forward model, and that influence output diagnostics. In order to estimate the resulting <b>error</b> <b>margins</b> on diagnostics such as mass flux, we develop a new framework based on the Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications (DAKOTA), which we interface to the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We present results on the Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, for which we evaluate <b>error</b> <b>margins</b> of mass flux across the whole glacier, given currently known <b>error</b> <b>margins</b> on ice thickness, basal friction and ice hardness. Our results suggest errors in these inputs propagate linearly through the ice flow model, providing a way to 1) calibrate measurement requirements for field campaigns collecting data such as bedrock or surface topography 2) quantify uncertainties in projections of mass balance and 3) assess the sensitivity of model outputs to input parameters. This new error propagation model should help quantify confidence levels that we assign to model projections for the mass balance of Antarctica and Greenland, which will ultimately improve our projections of future sea level rise in a warming climate.
