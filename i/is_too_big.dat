5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big.</b> If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big.</b> If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big.</b> It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E

Martin however deemed it [...] "unfilmable" [...] and impossible to be done as a feature film, stating that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as three feature films.

500|$|In July 2011, {{a report}} by {{consultancy}} EC Harris found that Saudi Arabia is the cheapest country in the Middle East to build in, half as expensive as Bahrain, and 34% cheaper than the United Arab Emirates, where Burj Khalifa is located. The future towers' site is located in very close proximity to King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, whose runways nearly align with the towers' site, which will {{have an effect on}} the airspace. While skyscraper experts have stated that towers well over one kilometre, even two kilometres (6,562 feet) high, are technically buildable, physical sustainability and practicality issues come into play in towers of this height. From a real estate perspective, it is considered virtually impossible to create enough demand to justify such a tower, but that at some point someone with a great excess of money will likely do it anyway. As for physical restraints, Bart Leclercq, head of structures for WSP Middle East recently said, [...] "I truly believe that 1 mile—1.6 kilometres—is within range. Over that, it may be possible if there are improvements in concrete quality. But 2km <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> a figure –it's just a step too far at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> it will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers. They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the overall amount of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). For broaching to be effective, the workpiece should have [...] more material than the final dimension of the cut.|$|E

500|$|Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone gave a mixed {{review of}} the album, {{wondering}} why the remix album was necessary {{to be released in}} the first place. She nevertheless added that [...] "he album has some diverting moments. Goldfrapp's down-tempo 'Judas' is less a remix than a smart cover, and the Weeknd and Illangelo re-imagine 'Marry the Night' as a strobe-y, atmospheric R epic. But there are two or three duds for each winner—like the bludgeoning 'Scheiße', a gratuitous exercise that strives to make a dance-floor thumper out of a song that was born that way." [...] Rosen's view was shared by Paul Rice from Slant Magazine, who gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Rice's main complaint was that [...] "ertain artists cry out for the remix treatment more than others, usually those whose vocal talents are relatively straightforward and could benefit from the extra fuss." [...] He added that Gaga was not such an artist and that the original Born This Way album [...] "in particular, <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> and untamed, full of too many of its own references and styles, from Springsteen to Madonna. As such, it's best enjoyed on its own flawed, bombastic terms." [...] Nick Levine, reviewing the album for BBC Music felt that most of the tracks are already available as digital downloads and CD singles, [...] "so it's easy to dismiss Born This Way: The Remix as inessential and, yes, a cash-in. But taken as a whole, this release offers enough revelations to suggest the original album is worth revisiting. That additional purpose, whether intentional or not, feels at least partly fulfilled." [...] Levine complimented The Weeknd and Twin Shadow's remixes, while criticizing Foster the People and Sultan & Ned Shepard for their predictable remixes.|$|E
