5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, male {{variegated}} fairywrens {{have been}} observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow. Petals are displayed and presented to a female <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> fairywren's own or another territory.|$|E
5|$|Sex-specific {{responses}} to stress {{have also been}} demonstrated in the rat, {{to have an effect}} on the hippocampus. Chronic stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E
50|$|The elytra of {{the females}} are more {{extended}} backward than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> and <b>the</b> female's abdomen looks from above wider than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> <b>The</b> <b>male,</b> <b>in</b> addition to its slimmer body, is distinguished from the females by their larger eyes and by {{the length of the}} last segment of the antennae, which is nearly twice <b>the</b> corresponding segment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> female.|$|R
50|$|Batocera wallacei {{is a huge}} long-horn beetle {{reaching}} about 80 - 85 mm {{of length}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> while <b>the</b> females are smaller.

5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> The anterior legs have {{three pairs of}} long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E

5|$|Cells in zona reticularis of the {{adrenal glands}} produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most {{important}} of which is DHEA. In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|In 1328 Charles IV of France died {{without a}} male heir. Queen Isabella made {{a claim to}} throne of France on behalf of her son Edward {{on the grounds that}} he was a matrilineal {{grandson}} of Philip IV of France. However, the precedents set by Philip V's succession over his niece Joan II of Navarre and Charles IV's succession over his nieces meant that the senior grandson of Philip III <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> line, Phillip of Valois, became king. Not yet in power, Edward paid homage to Phillip as Duke of Aquitaine.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, DNA {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a sample of 45 men with the surname MacLeod, 47% were found to share a common ancestor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage {{was found to be}} the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the study concluded that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} probability, period of development and characteristics of a clinical course of chronic prostatitis {{against the background of}} androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male.</b> Materials and methods: <b>The</b> Aging <b>Male</b> Symptoms (AMS) rating scale has been applied for androgen deficiency evaluation and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) — for chronic prostatitis evaluation. 57 men with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> have been examined. Results: It has been concluded that the development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> occurs <b>in</b> a shorter time period and about 1. 5 times more frequently compared to androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> at <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis. The analysis of time periods between the onset of chronic prostatitis symptoms against the background of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> and androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> symptoms against <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis showed that androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> symptoms have been revealed 1 - 2 years earlier than the onset of chronic prostatitis. The development of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> against <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis has showed a backward tendency. Signs of chronic prostatitis have been more frequently occurred in a period of four-five years earlier <b>the</b> androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> development. Conclusion: <b>The</b> risk of development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> during <b>the</b> next two years is actually four times higher <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> development of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging <b>male</b> against <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis.

The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity.

In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
