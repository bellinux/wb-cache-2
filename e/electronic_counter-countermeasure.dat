50|$|Recent-generation SARH {{weapons have}} {{superior}} <b>electronic</b> <b>counter-countermeasure</b> (ECCM) capability, {{but the system}} still has fundamental limitations. Some newer missiles, such as the SM-2, incorporate terminal semi-active radar homing (TSARH). TSARH missiles use inertial guidance {{for most of their}} flight, only activating their SARH system for the final attack. This can keep the target from realising it is under attack until shortly before the missile strikes. Since the missile only requires guidance during the terminal phase, each radar emitter can be used to engage more targets. Some of these weapons, like the SM-2, allow the firing platform to update the missile with mid-course updates via datalink.|$|E

5000|$|MiG-23MF: ("Flogger-B") This was {{an export}} {{derivative}} of the MiG-23M {{originally intended to}} be exported to Warsaw Pact countries, {{but it was also}} sold to many other allies and clients, as most export customers were dissatisfied with the rather primitive MiG-23MS. It actually came in two versions. The first one was sold to Warsaw Pact allies, and it was essentially identical to Soviet MiG-23M, with small changes in [...] "identify friend or foe" [...] (IFF) transponders and communications equipment. The second variant was sold outside Eastern Europe and it had a different IFF and communications suite (usually with the datalink removed), and downgraded radar, which lacked the <b>electronic</b> <b>counter-countermeasure</b> (ECCM) features and modes of the baseline [...] "High Lark". This variant was more popular abroad than the MiG-23MS and considerable numbers were exported, especially to the Middle East.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is {{a passive}} {{electronically}} scanned array radar equipped with IFF, <b>electronic</b> <b>counter-countermeasure</b> (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems.The AN/MPQ-53 Radar Set supports PAC-2 units, while the AN/MPQ-65 Radar Set supports PAC-3 units. The main {{difference between these}} two radars is the addition of a second traveling wave tube (TWT), which gives the −65 radar increased search, detection, and tracking capability. The radar antenna array consists of over 5,000 elements that [...] "deflect" [...] the radar beam many times per second. The radar antenna array also contains an IFF interrogator subsystem, a TVM array, and at least one [...] "sidelobe canceller" [...] (SLC), which is a small array designed to decrease interference that might affect the radar. Patriot's radar is somewhat unusual in that it is a [...] "detection-to-kill" [...] system, meaning that a single unit performs all search, identification, track, and engagement functions. This is in contrast to most SAM systems, where several different radars are necessary to perform all functions necessary to detect and engage targets.|$|E

30|$|Fortunately, several {{anti-jamming}} {{techniques have}} been well studied to counter the repeater jamming [15 – 18]. The very effective <b>electronic</b> <b>counter-countermeasure</b> (ECCM) for radar system is pulse diversity [16, 17], which is often adopted to combat the DRFM-based repeater jammer. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, most strategies are designed for the whole pulse sampling jamming including the pulse diversity, while the schemes for ISRJ might be fewer. Gong et al. [18] proposed an ECCM scheme to suppress the ISRJ for de-chirping ISAR and investigated the suppression effects for single point target. However, the strategy was only based on the ISRJ model of single point target, and the interrupted pulse samples were repeated once. The jamming suppression effects on different orders, delayed time, jamming-to-signal ratio (JSR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were not considered. Besides, suppression results were depicted but not evaluated. Moreover, the jamming suppression effect of approach I relies on the time width selection of frequency smoothing window. Some jamming residue affects the suppression performances.|$|E
30|$|Consequently, {{with the}} {{advancement}} of digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) [7, 8], the active false targets retransmitted by deception jammers would be robustly correlated with real target echoes and probably overlap with the echoes in both time and frequency domain, which will significantly enhance its deception. More precisely, the active false targets generate a coherent pulse train of the same carrier frequency, modulation type, pulse width, and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Therefore, the randomization of the scan-to-scan range delay of the jammer pulse, and adjustable linear initial phase advancement over the pulse train will be achieved. In effect, contrary to unintentional contaminating targets that are ordinarily not very powerful, active ECM perfectly created false targets with random range and Doppler. In view of that, false targets with scan-to-scan randomized range and Doppler clearly become a potentially dangerous threat. Therefore, more awareness should be driven to their potential abilities in the <b>electronic</b> <b>counter-countermeasure</b> (ECCM), which is of vital prominence to the survival and operation performance of radar systems in electronic warfare.|$|E

40|$|Random noise radars {{have been}} {{analyzed}} extensively {{over the past}} forty years. They were noted for their attractive LPI (low probability of intercept), LPIin (low probability of identification), and LPD (low probability of detection) characteristics. Using ultra-wideband noise as a radar transmit signal has {{the added benefit of}} achieving high-resolution imagery, in both down-range and cross-range dimensions using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique. ^ A coherent ultra-wideband random noise radar system operating in the 1 – 2 GHz frequency range has been developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A unique signal processing procedure based upon heterodyne correlation techniques preserves phase coherence within the system, thereby enabling it to be used for synthetic aperture radar imaging. Original experimental setup facilitates a simple and low-cost mobile SAR implementation, best suited for short-range quasi-stripmap SAR imaging. This dissertation develops the theoretical formulation and addresses practical implementation of UWB random noise SAR. It also investigates the potential of a coherent continuous-wave (CW) bandlimited random noise radar as an inexpensive, <b>electronic</b> <b>counter-countermeasure</b> (ECCM) capable, radio-frequency interference (RFI) resistant imaging instrument. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Linearly stepped {{frequency}} (LSF) waveforms {{are widely}} equipped in {{inverse synthetic aperture}} radar (ISAR), where the frequency is linearly altered with a fixed frequency step in each burst.
