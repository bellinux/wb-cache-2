40|$|The rapid {{accumulation}} of gene expression data has offered unprecedented opportunities to study human diseases. The National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus {{is currently the}} largest database that systematically documents the genome-wide molecular basis of diseases. However, thus far, this resource has been far from fully utilized. This paper describes the first study to transform public gene expression repositories into an automated disease diagnosis database. Particularly, we have developed a systematic framework, including a two-stage Bayesian learning approach, to achieve the diagnosis of one or multiple diseases for a query expression profile along a hierarchical <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomy.</b> Our approach, including standardizing cross-platform gene expression data and heterogeneous disease annotations, allows analyzing both sources of information in a unified probabilistic system. A high level of overall diagnostic accuracy was shown by cross validation. It was also demonstrated {{that the power of}} our method can increase significantly with the continued growth of public gene expression repositories. Finally, we showed how our disease diagnosis system can be used to characterize complex phenotypes and to construct a disease-drug connectivity map...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory {{responses}} {{can vary}} depending on a myriad of factors including: 1) the initiating stimulus or trigger, 2) the cell types, involved in the response, and 3) the specific effector cytokine-chemokine milieus produced. The compilation {{of these and other}} factors in a given mechanistic context is sometimes referred to as the “inflammome”. Humans and other higher order mammals have evolved (over time) several discrete inflammomes to counter the effects of pathogens. However, when these inflammomes are induced inappropriately, they drive the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. The vast majority of biological anti-inflammatory treatments currently being developed are focused on the post hoc inhibition of downstream effectors by anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and receptor antagonists. This prevailing “end-point treatment” has even directed a new disease classification paradigm, namely a cytokine-based disease classification, as opposed to a traditional diagnosis based on a particular tissue or organ system dysfunction. Although this approach has a number of advantages, it omits the processes that led to the generation of the inflammatory effectors in the first place. In this review, we will expand the cytokine-based <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomy</b> into an inflammome-based taxonomy that includes interventions that subvert a priori cytokine development that can complement post hoc inhibition...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBecause {{asthma and}} COPD are both {{inflammatory}} chronic obstructive airway diseases, {{there are several}} clinical expressions which can cause confusion, such as: eosinophilic asthma with fixed obstruction, which is a risk factor and might progress to COPD; eosinophilic COPD; COPD with partial reversible obstruction with no asthmatic component and also eosinophilic asthma–COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS).

40|$|Randomized {{controlled}} trials often rely on placebo {{control groups}} to estimate treatment differences. Recently, the high frequency of negative trials and ethical concerns surrounding {{the use of}} placebos have brought the use of placebo control groups under increased scrutiny. Although many psychiatric researchers argue that placebo control groups should be replaced with active control groups, we argue that preferential use of active control groups will not {{reduce the number of}} negative trials. Rather, we suggest that some of the variation and contradiction in randomized controlled trial results arises from the clinical heterogeneity of patient characteristics, disease severity, comorbidity, and cotherapies. Further characterization of patient heterogeneity, through improved <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomies,</b> severity indices, and classification of comorbid diseases, will serve to reduce clinical heterogeneity among patients and reduce the number of negative trials produced by wide variation in treatment and control response rates...|$|R

However, these sources are in general unstructured and, construction of surveillance tools such as taxonomical correlations and trace mapping involves considerable human supervision.

We use these word embeddings to automatically create <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomies</b> and evaluate our model against corresponding human annotated taxonomies. We compare our model accuracies against several state-of-the art word 2 vec methods.

Current programs of the biggest funding institutes, such as Horizon 2020 (European Union), Personalized Medicine & New Technologies (National Institute of Health) and the China Precision Medicine Initiative, PMI (Chinese Academy of Sciences) are heavily investing into adding biological disease marker signatures to augment classical clinical characteristics and to discover and exploit the underlying cellular and molecular networks of disease.

40|$|Background: Biological {{interpretation}} of genomic summary data {{such as those}} resulting from GWAS and eQTL studies {{is one of the}} major bottlenecks in medical genomics research, calling for efficient and integrative tools to resolve this problem. Results: We introduce eXploring Genomic Relations (XGR), an open source tool designed for precision {{interpretation of}} genomic summary data enabling downstream knowledge discovery. Targeting users of varying computational skills, XGR utilises prior biological knowledge and relationships in a highly integrated but easily accessible way to make user-input genomic summary datasets more interpretable. We show how by incorporating ontology, annotation, and systems biology network-driven approaches, XGR generates more informative results than conventional analyses. We apply XGR to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) summary data to explore the genomic landscape of the activated innate immune response and common immunological diseases. We provide genomic evidence for a <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomy</b> supporting the concept of a disease spectrum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory disorders. We also show how XGR can define SNP modulated gene networks and pathways that are shared and distinct between diseases, how it achieves functional, phenotypic and epigenomic annotations of genes and variants, and how it enables exploring annotation-based relationships between genetic variants. Conclusions: XGR provides a single integrated solution to enhance interpretation of genomic summary data for downstream biological discovery.

40|$|Drugs {{are often}} seen as {{ancillary}} {{to the purpose of}} fighting diseases. Here an alternative view is proposed in which they occupy a spearheading role. In this view, drugs are technologies with an inherent therapeutic potential. Once created, they can spread from disease to disease independently of the drug creator's original intentions. Through the analysis of extensive literature and clinical trial records, it can be observed that successful drugs follow a life cycle in which they are studied at an increasing rate, and for the treatment of an increasing number of diseases, leading to clinical advancement. Such initial growth, following a power law on average, has a degree of momentum, but eventually decelerates, leading to stagnation and decay. A network model can describe the propagation of drugs from disease to disease in which diseases communicate with each other by receiving and sending drugs. Within this model, some diseases appear more prone to influence other diseases than be influenced, and vice versa. Diseases can also be organized into a drug-centric <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomy</b> based on the drugs that each adopts. This taxonomy reflects not only biological similarities across diseases, but also the level of differentiation of existing therapies. In sum, this study shows that drugs can become contagious technologies playing a driving role in the fight against disease.

40|$|Disease Intelligence (DI) {{is based}} on the {{acquisition}} and aggregation of fragmented knowledge of diseases at multiple sources {{all over the world to}} provide valuable information to doctors, researchers and information seeking community. Some diseases have their own characteristics changed rapidly at different places of the world and are reported on documents as unrelated and heterogeneous information which may be going unnoticed and may not be quickly available. This research presents an Ontology based theoretical framework in the context of medical intelligence and country/region. Ontology is designed for storing information about rapidly spreading and changing diseases with incorporating existing <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomies</b> to genetic information of both humans and infectious organisms. It further maps disease symptoms to diseases and drug effects to disease symptoms. The machine understandable disease ontology represented as a website thus allows the drug effects to be evaluated on disease symptoms and exposes genetic involvements in the human diseases. Infectious agents which have no known place in an existing classification but have data on genetics would still be identified as organisms through the intelligence of this system.

40|$|Background—Disease {{management}} has shown great promise {{as a means}} of reorganizing chronic care and optimizing patient outcomes. Nevertheless, disease management programs are widely heterogeneous and lack a shared definition of disease management, which limits our ability to compare and evaluate different programs. To address this problem, the American Heart Association’s <b>Disease</b> Management <b>Taxonomy</b> Writing Group developed a system of classification that can be used both to categorize and compare disease management programs and to inform efforts to identify specific factors associated with effectiveness. Methods—The AHA Writing Group began with a conceptual model of disease management and its components and subsequently validated this model over a wide range of disease management programs. A systematic MEDLINE search was performed on the terms heart failure, diabetes, and depression, together with disease management, case management, and care management. The search encompassed articles published in English between 1987 and 2005. We then selected studies that incorporated (1) interventions designed to improve outcomes and/or reduce medical resource utilization in patients with heart failure, diabetes, or depression and (2) clearly defined protocols with at least 2 prespecified components traditionally associated with disease management. We analyzed the study protocols and used qualitative research methods to develop a <b>disease</b> management <b>taxonomy</b> with our conceptual model as the organizing framework. Results—The final taxonomy includes the following 8 domains: (1) Patient population is characterized by risk status...|$|R
40|$|Systems biology {{comprises}} {{a series}} of concepts and approaches {{that have been used}} successfully both to delineate novel biological mechanisms and to drive translational advances. The goal of systems biology is to re-integrate putatively critical elements extracted from multi-modality datasets in order to understand how interactions among multiple components form functional networks at the organism/patient-level, and how dysfunction of these networks underlies a particular disease. Due to the genetic and environmental diversity of human subjects, identification of critical elements related to a particular disease process from cross-sectional studies requires prohibitively large cohorts. Alternatively, implementation of systems biology principles to interventional clinical trials represents a unique opportunity to gain predictive understanding of complex diseases in comparatively small cohorts of patients. This paper reviews systems biology principles applicable to translational research, focusing on lessons from systems approaches to inflammation applied to multiple sclerosis (MS). We suggest that employing systems biology methods in the design and execution of biomarker-supported, proof-of-principle clinical trials provides a singular opportunity to merge therapeutic development with a basic understanding of disease processes. The ultimate goal is to develop predictive computational models of the disease, which will revolutionize diagnostic process and provide mechanistic understanding necessary for personalized therapeutic approaches. Added, biologically-meaningful information can be derived from diagnostic tests, if they are interpreted in functional relationships, rather than as independent measurements. Such systems-biology based diagnostics will transform <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomies</b> from phenotypical to molecular and will allow physicians to select optimal therapeutic regimens for individual patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe NEUROWEB project {{supports}} cerebrovascular researchers’ association studies, {{intended as}} {{the search for}} statistical correlations between a feature (e. g., a genotype) and a phenotype. In this project the phenotype refers to the patients’ pathological state, and thus it is formulated {{on the basis of}} the clinical data collected during the diagnostic activity. In order to enhance the statistical robustness of the association inquiries, the project involves four European Union clinical institutions. Each institution provides its proprietary repository, storing patients’ data. Although all sites comply with common diagnostic guidelines, they also adopt specific protocols, resulting in partially discrepant repository contents. Therefore, in order to effectively exploit NEUROWEB data for association studies, it is necessary to provide a framework for the phenotype formulation, grounded on the clinical repository content which explicitly addresses the inherent integration problem. To that end, we developed an ontological model for cerebrovascular phenotypes, the NEUROWEB Reference Ontology, composed of three layers. The top-layer (Top Phenotypes) is an expert-based cerebrovascular <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomy.</b> The middle-layer deconstructs the Top Phenotypes into more elementary phenotypes (Low Phenotypes) and general-use medical concepts such as anatomical parts and topological concepts. The bottom-layer (Core Data Set, or CDS) comprises the clinical indicators required for cerebrovascular disorder diagnosis. Low Phenotypes are connected to the bottom-layer (CDS) by specifying what combination of CDS values is required for their existence. Finally, CDS elements are mapped to the local repositories of clinical data. The NEUROWEB system exploits the Reference Ontology to query the different repositories and to retrieve patients characterized by a common phenotype...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} {{draws on}} ethnographic research conducted in Oman on inherited blood disorders (IBD). Interpreting results from population genomics studies that trace mutation processes over centuries of human activities, lay-representations of IBD often consider them historical evidences. The perceived spread of IBD in Oman may thus provide unusual historical depth {{in a country}} where past conflicts have been erased from historiography and representations of time are politically prescribed. Through the notions of crisis and diversification, this contribution shows how IBD's chronicity challenges the healthcare system and became a national issue, politically labelled as urgent. The paper casts light on several aspects of contemporary Omani society: it first addresses the dynamics of <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomies</b> [...] though biomedically described in the early 20 th century, IBD were not individualized within local nosologies until the 1970 s. Secondly, it shows how biomedical knowledge about IBD led to diversification within the healthcare system, through the introduction of clinical genetics, genomics, and community genetics. Thirdly, it attempts to broach modalities of the biopower exerted by the Omani regime over its citizens: IBD are targeted by various public health measures that jeopardize patients' autonomy by aiming to control their bodies through their matrimonial behaviour. In addition, two aspects of the intersections between Omani social hierarchy and IBD are noteworthy: the creation of a patients' association that constitutes a potential disturbance of the social order; and the way IBD mutations traced by genomics are considered direct historical documents that challenge representations of the recently crafted "Omanity" in a context of regional concern regarding national identities' durability...|$|R

WSU Libraries {{provides}} access to electronic copy of this article via commercial databases and library online catalog: [URL] problems of radical translation occupy a central place {{in a number of}} long-standing controversies in philosophy and anthropology. The philosophical difficulties here concern the accurate recovery of speaker meaning in translation, in light of the following two problems: (1) the radical translator’s unwanted possession, in principle, of too many right answers-i. e., the availability in principle of empirically equivalent, yet divergent manuals of translation for a given society; and (2) the prima facie undesirable, yet perhaps inescapable need to impose what is grammatically and ontologically familiar to the linguist and to the target language community upon the source language community in translating their discourse. In short, these problems make clearly problematic whether translations meeting standard criteria of adequacy can ever be said to reveal what the source language speakers really mean. As many anthropologists, especially those in the ‘language and culture’ tradition generated by Boas, Cassirer, Sapir, and Whorf, take the recovery of such culturally specific significance as central to their discipline, worries about how to select translation manuals and related ethnographic systematizations (such as kinship organizations and <b>disease</b> <b>taxonomies)</b> that have demonstrable ‘cognitive (or psychological) validity’ seem to run very deep indeed. And such concerns cannot but be deepened by the fact that much reflection in the philosophical community on these problems, particularly as embodied in the work of W. V. Quine, is against the objective determinability of meaning in translation. For while anthropologists generally worry about how to validate claims about meaning and synonymy in light of these methodological difficulties, presuming them to be surmountable in principle, Quine cites just these problems in order to denigrate the various current notions of meaning and synonymy-by rendering illusory the ‘underlying’ semantic (or psychological) reality they purport to reveal.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} taxonomy in understanding the epidemiology of fruit rotting diseases and in determining the biosecurity status of the fungi associated with those <b>diseases.</b> The <b>taxonomy</b> of most highly specialised fruit-rotting pathogens is well understood, but some degree of uncertainty or confusion applies to the taxonomy of many less specialised pathogens. The taxonomic lumping of morphologically similar but genetically and biologically distinct taxa often confounds our ability to understand diseases, frustrates the interpretation of research data, and can result in misinformation about biosecurity status. Such unspecialised pathogens are widespread in New Zealand, but whether they cause a problem in a specifi c orchard depends on environmental conditions, management of the orchard, and host plant susceptibility. As management practices and preferred cultivars change, so does the spectrum of these low-specifi city taxa that cause disease problems. Five examples illustrate the need for unambiguous taxonomy to facilitate more effective control and management strategies of plant pathogens.

The global health response was widely scrutinised and criticised, and though the outbreak is now over, {{there are still many}} lessons that can be learned from the 2014 EVD outbreak. This thesis will use the EVD outbreak in two ways. Firstly, I will use the EVD outbreak as a case study through which I will strive to address the ethical concerns for using experimental treatment during the outbreak, and I will address ethical concerns of the use of quarantine during the outbreak. Second, I will use the EVD outbreak as a launch pad to examine broader and more abstract ethical principles of the ethics of infectious disease control, such as the principles of reciprocity, transparency, proportionality, and the harm principle. This discussion will highlight how physical, biological features of a disease very much impact the application of the above principles when it comes to controlling the disease in an ethical manner. Finally, from this observation, I have created a ‘disease taxonomy’ that categorises infectious diseases based upon, what I argue, are the most ethically relevant biological features of infectious <b>diseases.</b> The <b>taxonomy</b> can aid in preparing for, understanding, and responding to the most pertinent ethical issues that surround various infectious diseases.

We retrospectively collected data concerning large-colony-forming GCBHS bacteremia that occurred {{during a period of}} 8 years at the Massachusetts General Hospital. A total of 222 cases of beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia were identified; data on the Lancefield grouping were available in 192 cases: 45 cases (23. 6 %) were group A, 96 cases (50 %) were group B, 7 cases (3. 6 %) were group C (large colony forming), and 44 cases (22. 9 %) were group G. The medical records for cases of large-colony-forming GCBHS bacteremia were reviewed. In one case, the isolate was thought to be a contaminant; the other six cases are reported (five males and one female; mean age, 55 years). All patients had severe underlying conditions, and none had a history of exposure to animals.

40|$|AbstractBiomedical taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies in {{the form}} of the International Classification of <b>Diseases</b> as a <b>taxonomy</b> or the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus as an OWL-based ontology, play a {{critical}} role in acquiring, representing and processing information about human health. With increasing adoption and relevance, biomedical ontologies have also significantly increased in size. For example, the 11 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, which is currently under active development by the World Health Organization contains nearly 50, 000 classes representing a vast variety of different diseases and causes of death. This evolution in terms of size was accompanied by an evolution in the way ontologies are engineered. Because no single individual has the expertise to develop such large-scale ontologies, ontology-engineering projects have evolved from small-scale efforts involving just a few domain experts to large-scale projects that require effective collaboration between dozens or even hundreds of experts, practitioners and other stakeholders. Understanding the way these different stakeholders collaborate will enable us to improve editing environments that support such collaborations. In this paper, we uncover how large ontology-engineering projects, such as the International Classification of Diseases in its 11 th revision, unfold by analyzing usage logs of five different biomedical ontology-engineering projects of varying sizes and scopes using Markov chains. We discover intriguing interaction patterns (e. g., which properties users frequently change after specific given ones) that suggest that large collaborative ontology-engineering projects are governed by a few general principles that determine and drive development. From our analysis, we identify commonalities and differences between different projects that have implications for project managers, ontology editors, developers and contributors working on collaborative ontology-engineering projects and tools in the biomedical domain...|$|R

AimTo better understand patient's decision-making processes {{regarding the use of}} chelation therapy as a treatment for coronary artery disease. MethodsBased on qualitative interviews with 32 coronary artery <b>disease</b> patients, a <b>taxonomy</b> of decision-related issues, hierarchical decision-model, and survey based on the model were developed. The model was then pilot tested with another group of 30 patients and revised accordingly. The final model was tested with another group of 167 patients (27 current users, 72 previous users, and 68 never users of chelation therapy). The primary examination of the model was to determine the degree to which it successfully identified people who fell within each behavioral group. This was done by dividing the total number of successes {{by the total number of}} cases on all paths (or questions in the questionnaire). ResultsThe most important elements in the decision to use or not use chelation therapy were: previous experience with or learning about chelation therapy, openness to alternative treatments, satisfaction with current level of (traditional) care, physician opinion regarding chelation therapy, costs associated with chelation therapy, perceived access to chelation therapy provider, current state of health (good or bad), and wanting to do ‘all one can’ for heart health. When tested, the ability of the model to predict the appropriate outcome was nearly 93 %. The most salient junctures in the model that led participants to different behavioral outcomes were: considering using non-traditional treatments; perceptions regarding potential risks and benefits; cost; and believing that using chelation therapy was ‘doing all that they can’ to help their heart health. ConclusionsDescriptive decision-modeling is a useful method to depict cardiac patients’ decision-making concerning the use of chelation therapy. It can also assist healthcare providers and policy makers in directing interventions and policy aimed at enhancing the use of evidence-based therapies for cardiac patients...|$|R
40|$|Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} as the causal agent of brown spot and black pit of potatoes. Brown spot is a foliar disease with potential to cause 30 % yield loss and postharvest losses of up to 10 %. Losses are mainly due to premature defoliation. In this study, morphological and epidemiological characteristics of A. alternata were studied {{in order to understand}} the extent to which different light regimes influence radial growth, sporulation and pathogenicity of this pathogen. The role of low temperatures on initial sporulation was also investigated. Exposure of isolates to low temperatures (4 °C) in the dark increased number of spores produced by isolates under all light conditions. Light did not have any effect on pathogenicity and isolate genetic capability had no influence on radial growth of isolates. The combined isolate and light effect (gene-environment interaction), had significant influence on both radial growth and <b>disease</b> severity. The <b>taxonomy</b> of the genus Alternaria has been highly debateable over the years, especially in small spored Alternaria species where identification is based entirely on morphological characteristics. This is mainly due to presence of closely related taxa such as Ulocladium, Macrosporium and Stemphylium that complicate correct identification of this genus. An investigation was carried out to determine the phylogenetic relationship as well to determine the relationship between molecular characterization and morphological identification. All isolates were identified as A. alternata based on morphology. The identity was further confirmed by molecular phylogeny using the GAPDH, EF 1 α and a combined phylogeny of these gene regions. All isolates formed one section with A. alternata. The isolates also grouped together with A. arborescens, A. tenuissima, A. longipes and A. gaisen, which were all recently characterized into the Alternata section. Comparison of RFLP digests of the ITS 1 and ITS 4 region revealed no genetic variability. The GAPDH and EF gene regions can therefore be used to delineate among Alternaria isolates and was in congruence with morphological identification. PCR-RFLP can be a useful tool in detecting genetic variability among isolates. Control of brown spot has mainly been through the use of strobilurins; however, recent disease epidemics on potatoes in South Africa led to an investigation into the failure of strobilurins to control brown spot. Samples were collected during the 2012 - 2013 growing season and eight Alternaria isolates were recovered from five growing regions. In vitro sensitivity tests showed that six of the eight isolates had reduced sensitivity to azoxystrobin. Sequence analysis of the cytochrome b gene revealed a mutation that led to an amino acid substitution which consequently led to reduced sensitivity. This study will lead to a better understanding of this new disease of potatoes that has proven to be of economic importance. Correct identification is paramount in disease management and this study has shown some reliable molecular technics that can be used to identify species in this genus correctly. This study was also able to link failure to control brown spot to fungicide resistance, and alternative control strategies can now be recommended to control this pathogen.
