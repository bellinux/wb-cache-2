40|$|Producing indices {{composed}} of multiple input variables has been embedded in some data processing and analytical methods. We aim {{to test the}} feasibility of creating data-driven indices by aggregating input variables according to principal component analysis (PCA) loadings. To validate the significance of both the theory-based and data-driven indices, we propose principles to review innovative indices. We generated weighted indices with <b>the</b> variables obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first years of <b>the</b> two-year panels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Medical Expenditure Panel Survey initiated between 1996 and 2011. Variables were weighted according to PCA loadings and summed. The statistical significance and residual deviance of each index to predict mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>years</b> was extracted {{from the results of}} discrete-time survival analyses. There were 237, 832 surviving the first years of panels, represented 4. 5 billion civilians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, of which 0. 62 % (95 % CI = 0. 58 % to 0. 66 %) died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>years</b> of <b>the</b> panels. Of all 134, 689 weighted indices, there were 40, 803 significantly predicting mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>years</b> with or without the adjustment of age, sex and races. <b>The</b> significant indices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> both models could at most lead to 10, 200 years of academic tenure for individual researchers publishing four indices per year or 618. 2 years of publishing for journals with annual volume of 66 articles. In conclusion, if aggregating information based on PCA loadings, there can be a large number of significant innovative indices composing input variables of various predictive powers. To justify the large quantities of innovative indices, we propose a reporting and review framework for novel indices based on the objectives to create indices, variable weighting, related outcomes and database characteristics. The indices selected by this framework could lead to a new genre of publications focusing on meaningful aggregation of information...|$|R

5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>year.</b> The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

Hattusili chose not to attack Halab directly and began with conquering Yamhad's vassals and allies, starting with Alalakh <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>year</b> of his Syrian campaigns c. 1650 BC (Middle chronology) or slightly later. Hattusili then turned to attack the Hurrians in Urshu northeast of Halab, and won in spite of military support from Halab and Carchemish for the Hurrians. The Hittite king then defeated Yamhad in the battle of Mount Atalur, and sacked Hassum along with several other Hurrian cities in the sixth year of his Syrian wars. After many campaigns, Hattusili I finally attacked Halab during the reign of Hammurabi III. The attack ended in a defeat, the wounding of the Hittite king and his later death c. 1620 BC. Hattusili's campaigns considerably weakened Yamhad, causing it to decline in status: the monarch ceased to be styled a Great King.|$|E
