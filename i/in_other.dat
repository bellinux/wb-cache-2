60|$|That {{which makes}} me to suppose them to be Vegetables, is for that I perceiv'd many of those {{hillocks}} bare or destitute, as if those bodies lay yet conceal'd, as G. <b>In</b> <b>others</b> of them, they were just springing out of their gummy hillocks, which all seem'd to shoot directly outwards, as at A. <b>In</b> <b>others,</b> as at B, I found them just gotten out, with very little or no stalk, and the Cods of an indifferent cize; but <b>in</b> <b>others,</b> as C, I found them begin to have little short stalks, or stems; <b>in</b> <b>others,</b> as D, those stems were grown bigger, and larger; and <b>in</b> <b>others,</b> as at E, F, H, I, K, L, &c. those stems and Cods were grown a great deal bigger, and the stalks were more bulky about the root, and very much taper'd towards the top, as at F and L is most visible.|$|R

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species <b>in</b> <b>other</b> genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and <b>in</b> <b>other</b> groups.|$|E

60|$|It remains only to observe, {{as further}} {{illustrating}} {{the evolution of}} quantitative ideas after this manner, that measures of value were similarly derived. Barter, {{in one form or}} other, is found among all but the very lowest human races. It is obviously based upon the notion of equality of worth. And as it gradually merges into trade by the introduction of some kind of currency, we find that the measures of worth, constituting this currency, are organic bodies; in some cases cowries, <b>in</b> <b>others</b> cocoa-nuts, <b>in</b> <b>others</b> cattle, <b>in</b> <b>others</b> pigs; among the American Indians peltry or skins, and in Iceland dried fish.|$|R
