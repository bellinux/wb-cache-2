5|$|Also defined herewith: tarsometatarsus. The {{third and}} most {{conspicuous}} {{portion of the}} bird's leg, from which the toes spring; the foot. In birds, the true tarsus has disappeared, with the proximal tarsals having <b>fused</b> with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having <b>fused</b> with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|E

5000|$|Unofficially, the [...] "low-profile mini" [...] <b>fuse</b> is {{sometimes}} incorrected called [...] "micro" [...] since the term means smaller than mini, but recently <b>fuses</b> using the micro name have been released. Regular blade-type <b>fuses,</b> {{also known as}} standard <b>fuses,</b> were developed in 1976 for low voltage use in motor vehicles. The mini <b>fuses</b> were developed in the 1990s. Blade type <b>fuses</b> can be mounted in <b>fuse</b> blocks, in-line <b>fuse</b> holders, or <b>fuse</b> clips.|$|R
50|$|In IEC standards, the {{replaceable}} {{element is}} called a <b>fuse</b> link and the assembly of <b>fuse</b> link and <b>fuse</b> holder {{is called a}} <b>fuse.</b> North American standards call the replaceable element only the <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the <b>fuse</b> holder is displaced and the <b>fuse</b> holder will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the <b>fuse</b> blows. Mechanical tension on the <b>fuse</b> link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the <b>fuse</b> blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the <b>fuse</b> link out of the <b>fuse</b> holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and <b>fuse</b> holder. This quenches any arc in the <b>fuse</b> holder.|$|R

50|$|Automotive <b>fuses</b> {{are used}} to protect the wiring and {{electrical}} equipment for vehicles. There are several different types of automotive <b>fuses</b> and their usage is dependent upon the specific application, voltage, and current demands of the electrical circuit. Automotive <b>fuses</b> can be mounted in <b>fuse</b> blocks, inline <b>fuse</b> holders, or <b>fuse</b> clips. Some automotive <b>fuses</b> are occasionally used in non-automotive electrical applications. Standards for automotive <b>fuses</b> are published by SAE International (formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers).|$|R

5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. The head capsule is made up of six <b>fused</b> segments, each with either a pair of ganglia, or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are <b>fused</b> into the brain, while the three {{following}} pairs are <b>fused</b> into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's esophagus, called the subesophageal ganglion.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are <b>fused</b> into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are <b>fused</b> into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a <b>fused</b> eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, <b>fuses</b> {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base <b>fuses</b> would screw into a <b>fuse</b> socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of <b>fuses</b> with an excessive current rating, later <b>fuse</b> boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S <b>fuses)</b> which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the <b>fuse.</b> This means that <b>fuses</b> can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) <b>fuse</b> rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison <b>fuse</b> boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) <b>fuses,</b> by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison <b>fuse</b> holder, and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lucas type <b>fuses</b> {{are used}} in old British-made or {{assembled}} automobiles. The physical length of this ceramic type of <b>fuse</b> is either 1 inch or 1.25 inch, with conical ends. Glass tube <b>fuses</b> have straight ends. Lucas type <b>fuses</b> usually use the same color-coding for the rated current. Lucas <b>fuses</b> have three ratings; the continuous current {{they are designed to}} carry, the instantaneous current at which they will <b>fuse,</b> and the continuous current at which they will also <b>fuse.</b> The figure found on Lucas <b>fuses</b> is the continuous <b>fusing</b> current which is twice the continuous ampere rating that the system should be using; this can be a source of confusion when replacing Lucas <b>fuses</b> with non Lucas <b>fuses.</b> The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube <b>fuse</b> have a different length as compared to the standard US item. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube <b>fuse</b> is 1 and 5/32" [...] mm long, while the US standard 1/4" [...] glass tube <b>fuse</b> is 1 and 1/4" [...] mm long.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of <b>fused</b> vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six <b>fused</b> trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines <b>fused</b> into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be <b>fused</b> together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. <b>Fused</b> demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is <b>fused.</b> These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E
5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster <b>fused</b> together, and the petiole was still present but enlarged.

2500|$|Semi-enclosed <b>fuses</b> are <b>fuse</b> wire {{carriers}} {{in which}} the fusible wire itself can be replaced. [...] The exact <b>fusing</b> current is not as well controlled as an enclosed <b>fuse,</b> and it is extremely important to use the correct diameter and material when replacing the <b>fuse</b> wire, and for these reasons these <b>fuses</b> are slowly falling from favour.|$|R
50|$|A {{common design}} of <b>fuse</b> box that was {{featured}} on homes built from 1940 to 1965 was the 60-amp <b>fuse</b> box that featured four plug <b>fuses</b> (i.e. Edison base) for branch circuits {{and one or}} more <b>fuse</b> blocks containing cartridge <b>fuses</b> for purposes such as major appliance circuits. After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a <b>fuse</b> box could have <b>fuse</b> blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug <b>fuses</b> (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.|$|R

5|$|Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with <b>fused</b> carpels), {{with three}} connate (<b>fused)</b> carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in Scoliopus and Medeola). There {{is a single}} style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E
5|$|Hexactinellida (glass sponges) have {{silicate}} spicules, {{the largest}} of which have six rays and may be individual or <b>fused.</b> The main components of their bodies are syncytia in which large numbers of cell share a single external membrane.|$|E
5000|$|North-American built {{automobiles}} up to 1981 had electrical systems {{protected by}} cylindrical glass cartridge <b>fuses</b> rated 32 volts DC and current ratings from 4 amperes to 30 amperes.
