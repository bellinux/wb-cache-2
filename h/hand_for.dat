5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other <b>hand.</b> <b>For</b> instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 new {{recruits}} for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E

Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby, {{commander}} of the Channel Squadron, transferred his flag to Agincourt as her sister Minotaur, his former flagship, was taken in <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> a refit that lasted until 1875. That year Agincourt was paid off in turn for a refit and re-armament that lasted until 1877. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the government became concerned that the Russians might advance on the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered Hornby to form a Particular Service Squadron to show the flag at Constantinople and deter any Russian threat. Agincourt served as the flagship for his second-in-command and the squadron sailed up the Dardanelles in a blinding snowstorm in February 1878. After those tensions faded, the ship returned to the Channel, where she served as second flag until 1889 including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. Over her active career, she served as flagship to no less than 15 admirals. That year she was again paid off and was subsequently held in reserve at Portsmouth until 1893, when she was transferred to Portland {{for use as a}} training ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{an article}} was {{published}} about the bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake.

The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US$500. By July 4, 1966, the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the gazebo in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> its dedication.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Big Four {{held the}} top four places in the rankings for a whole {{calendar}} {{year for the first}} time. This also prompted the first uses of the term 'Big Four' to refer to the players, although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray who themselves were still regarded ahead {{of the rest of the}} tour. At the Australian Open, Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5-set epic, obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer, while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on. Nadal continued to dominate early in the season, but suffered from injury in June, allowing Federer to take the upper <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the season. Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins, taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open, thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments, and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively. Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
5|$|Martin Keown {{took care}} of the free-kick which Popescu unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to clear, only to give Overmars a shot on goal, a volley which went over. One minute later, Galatasaray's first opportunity came when Erdem received a straight ball from a Hagi taken free–kick, and took a shot on goal, which goalkeeper David Seaman managed to keep out with his left <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> a corner. The corner was taken, but no Galatasaray player was available to direct the ball towards the goal. Arsenal would create more opportunities into the match, when Sylvinho snatched the ball from Hagi and ran down to Galatasaray's left, before putting in a cross to the running Henry, who was halted by a clearance from Bülent Korkmaz. As Galatasaray grew more into the game minute, Erdem exchanged passes with Şükür, whose bicycle kick went completely off target. Arsenal began creating more chances – in the 35th minute, Overmars made a low powerful shot on goal, forcing Cláudio Taffarel to make a diving save. Overmars then made another run into the area but his attempt went across the goal. Galatasaray nearly took the lead with only two minutes of the first half remaining, when Şükür found Erdem, who beat the offside trap. However, his shot went just wide.|$|E
