Here, the relationships between leaf area index and five climate variables – air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, specific humidity and soil temperature – are investigated across a range of land use types in Borneo, including primary tropical forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity.

Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate,</b> tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments.

Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes, such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions.

40|$|Epiphytic bryophytes and lichens are an {{important}} component of the endangered forest biota in temperate forests, their diversity and composition patterns being regulated by tree, stand and landscape scale factors. The aim of this study is to improve ecological understanding of such factors in managed coniferous– deciduous mixed forests of Hungary in the context of forest management. In particular, this study investigate the effect of tree species composition, stand structure (tree size distribution, shrub layer and dead wood), microclimate (light, temperature and air humidity), landscape and historical factors on the stand level and tree level composition of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens. The relationships were explored by multivariate methods (redundancy analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning) and indicator species analysis.

For bryophytes, the continuity of <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate</b> and the presence of shrub layer are also important, while lichen assemblages are influenced by light availability. Landscape and historical variables were less influential than stand scale factors. On the basis of our results, the main strategy of management focusing on epiphyte diversity conservation should include: (1) the maintenance of tree species diversity in mixed stands; (2) increasing the proportion of deciduous trees (mainly oaks and hornbeam); (3) the maintenance of large trees within the stands; (4) the presence of shrub and regeneration layer; (5) the creation of heterogeneous light conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of gaps can strongly influence forest regeneration and habitat diversity within forest ecosystems.

Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} understand the effects of gap creation and variations in gap size on <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate</b> and soil water content. The study site, in North West England, was a mixed temperate broadleaved deciduous forest dominated by mature sessile oak (Quercus petraea), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) with some representatives of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). Solar radiation (I), air temperature (T (A)), soil temperature (T (S)), relative humidity (h), wind speed (v) and soil water content (I) were measured at four natural treefall gaps created after a severe storm in 2006 and adjacent sub-canopy sites. I, T (A), T (S), and I increased significantly with gap size; h was consistently lower in gaps than the sub-canopy but did not vary with gap size, while the variability of v could not be explained by the presence or size of gaps. There were systematic diurnal patterns in all microclimate variables in response to gaps, but no such patterns existed for I.

Using six shrub species, we tested how seasonal changes and light conditions affect their constitutive defense to insect damage. We monitored leaf perforation, concentrations of total phenols, condensed tannins, nitrogen (N), and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC). Leaf damage caused by insects was low in Sambucus nigra, Cornus sanguinea, and Frangula alnus, intermediate in Corylus avellana and Prunus serotina, and high in Prunus padus. Leaves of all the species, when growing in high light conditions, had high concentrations of defense metabolites. Except for C.  avellana, leaves of the other shrub species growing in full sun were less injured than those in shade. This may be due to higher concentrations of defense metabolites and lower concentrations of nitrogen. Similar patterns of the effects of light on metabolites studied and N were observed for leaves with varying location within the crown of individual shrubs (from the top of the south direction to the bottom of the north), as for leaves from shrubs growing in full sun and shrubs in the shade of canopy trees. A probable cause of the greater damage of more sunlit leaves of C.  avellana was the fact that they were herbivorized mostly by Altica brevicollis, a specialist insect that prefers plant tissues with a high TNC level and is not very sensitive to a high level of phenolic compounds...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} current state and developmental trajectory of forest restoration projects in Tauranga City {{with the aim of}} establishing whether they will eventually develop into functioning forest ecosystems similar to their natural counterparts. Three forest types historically present in Tauranga were studied: coastal Metrosideros excelsa forest, semi-coastal broadleaved forest, and semi-coastal Dacrycarpus dacrydioides swamp forest. Forty-five variable-area plots were established in thirteen categories comprising at least two planted sites of different ages for each forest type, naturally regenerating sites within the city, and old-growth reference forests outside of the city. Vegetation parameters including tree diameters, numbers of saplings and seedlings, cover abundance and groundcover were measured or recorded. Site characteristics such as aspect and slope were also recorded. Soil samples were taken in each of the thirteen <b>forest</b> categories and <b>microclimate</b> conditions were recorded over a period of eight months using micro data loggers. Data were analysed by comparing species population structures along with diversity and naturalness in each forest category. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and Multi-Response Permutation Procedures were used to examine the relationships between restoration sites and reference sites in each forest type and across all three forest types. Environmental data were compared using ANOVA and relationships between physical, environmental, and vegetation characteristics were examined using Spearman rank correlations. Results from the planted restoration sites were compared with the naturally regenerating forests and the reference forests. Coastal forest restoration sites were found to be developing into Metrosideros excelsa forest but recruitment of mid- and late-successional species was failing, probably due to browse from exotic animals and isolation from seed sources. This was the case even in mature Metrosideros excelsa forest on Mauao. Restricted regeneration of canopy species was evident in the semi-coastal broadleaved reference sites but the reason for this was not clear. Naturally regenerating sites were being invaded by Prunus campanulata which has the potential to dominate the vegetation. The understorey in the restoration sites was developing through regeneration and colonisation of species that had not been planted, indicating that the vital ecosystem function of seed dispersal has been restored. However, successional canopy species were failing to recruit. Old-growth Dacrycarpus dacrydioides forest at White Pine Bush was found to be on a trajectory towards Beilschmiedia tawa-dominated forest. Naturally regenerating swamp forest in Kopurererua Valley was dominated by Salix cinerea and had almost no regeneration of native species. Planted restoration sites in Kopurererua Valley and Te Maunga are likely to become Dacrycarpus-dominated stands but with lower stem densities than natural stands. The Dacrycarpus dacrydioides in the older restoration sites at Te Maunga were beginning to naturally regenerate but seedlings are only likely to survive where there is sufficient light and reduced competition. Across all forest types the proportion of exotic species decreased from an average of 50 % in the youngest restoration sites to just 1. 5 % in the reference <b>forests.</b> <b>Microclimate</b> conditions generally became more similar to reference forest conditions with increasing stand age. While younger sites had similar average temperatures and relative humidity to reference sites, the fluctuations in temperature and humidity significantly decreased with stand age from an average range of 28. 6 °C and 76. 7 % RH in the youngest restoration sites, to an average range of 19. 9 °C and 48. 9 % RH in the reference sites.

Understanding the influence of forests on agriculture not only improves the agricultural practices but also enhances eco-friendly development and sustainability. This paper investigates the relationship between <b>forest</b> edge <b>microclimates</b> and agricultural cropproduction. The study adopted a Bio-geographical approach buttressed on the Mono-Climax Theory (MCT) and Holdridge’s Deterministic Approach (HAD). Data for this study comprised of agricultural cropproduction for 2012 collected from farmers along the edge of Thathe Forest in Limpopo, South Africa,in all the four cardinal directions. Vegetation density and composition from the forest edge in all the four cardinal directions was collected through quadrats. Linear regression between agricultural productivity, as the dependent variable, and vegetation composition and density, as independent variables, was employed to determine the relationship. Results reveal that agricultural crop production, vegetation density decrease andcomposition change as one moves from the forest edge. We conclude that Thathe forest creates an important micro-climate for agriculture. As such the forest should be conserved for sustainable agricultural production and development.

These data were compared with values from an open site at the same location. Air temperatures could be up to 38 C lower under the canopy than at the open site under sunny conditions in summer, but the differences averaged 0. 6 and 0. 98 C {{during the summer months}} and barely differed over winter. Effects of forest cover on soil temperatures were much greater and under the woodland they neither fell below 08 C nor rose above 208 C even at 5 mm depth, in contrast to temperatures under bare earth and grass. The temperature of a grass tussock at the soil surface under the canopy was intermediate between soil and air temperature; in comparison to grassland plants at an open site it experienced a much smaller range of temperatures. The differences between both soil and air temperature under the canopy and in the open were significantly correlated with solar radiation, presence or absence of canopy leaves and wind speed.

40|$|The {{relation}} between vegetation surface temperature and remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices has been examined {{by a number}} of authors. The observed linear decrease in surface temperature with the increase in vegetation cover density has generally been explained in terms of the increase in latent heat flux associated with greater amounts of transpirationally active vegetation. However, these investigations have initially concentrated in spatially uniform crop or pasture targets on level terrain, excluding more complex forested environments with variable Sun-sensor-surface geometry. In irregular terrains, the vegetation surface temperature may be strongly influenced by topographic parameters, such as altitude and insulation angle, so that the actual <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate</b> is often difficult to evaluate. Moreover, in the thermal regime, the emission of radiative flux within the canopy element is very tightly coupled to the environment through driving mechanisms such as meteorological conditions. In fact, the allocation of absorbed solar radiation into sensible heat flux and latent heat flux is dominated by the availability of water at the Earth's surface and thus by precipitations and air temperature conditions. In this paper, which uses remotely sensed inputs of surface temperature and vegetation fractional cover, the effects of topographic parameters and vegetation cover density on surface temperature of vegetation are investigated based on Landsat 5 satellite images obtained in the daytime of two clear summer days with different antecedent meteorological conditions. For both scenes analysed, results indicate that altitude as well as the orientation of the surface relative to the Sun were the most important factors controlling surface temperatures of beech forests of Simbruini Mountains, in central Italy...|$|E

The Ward’s method of hierarchical agglomerative classification with Euclidean distance {{was used for}} the differentiation of the communities on the plots. Species data for this analyse were represented by logarithm-transformed activities [log(x+ 1) ]. The single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical testing of differences in structural parameters (e. g. species richness and diversity) amongst distinguished groups of the plots. The species diversity and activity differs on glades without trees and coarse woody debris. The highest number of species was found in clear-cut areas. The lowest number of species was found on the plots with the living forest particularly invaded by bark beetle. This fact is caused {{by the fact that the}} clear-cut plots are invaded by ubiquitous and anthropotolerant species with good migration possibilities. These species are adapted to habitats without trees and are able to leave even in the habitats with very sparse or without vegetation.

Aims: To investigate {{the influence of}} edge effects on the plant community and microclimate of a cerrado fragment in south-eastern Brazil. Methods: Several plant community variables (density, basal area, richness and cover by each vegetation layer) and microclimatic variables (light, air temperature and humidity), were measured in 10 transects across a savanna fragment surrounded by exotic grasses, and were used to fit semi-parametric models relating these variables with {{the distance from the}} habitat edge. Results: Differences in microclimate and tree communities were poorly related to distance from the edge. On the other hand, there were detectable edge effects on the ground layer community (i. e. plants less than 50 cm in height). Edges had a negative effect on native plants of this layer (density and richness of all species and cover of native grasses), while favouring invasive grasses. Conclusions: Unlike reports for edge effects in <b>forest</b> ecosystems, <b>microclimate</b> does not explain changes in this cerrado fragment. The most significant edge effect threatening the conservation of cerrado vegetation is the widespread invasion by African grasses.

Carabid beetles, as a family, were more common in grazed plots in all sites. Curculionid beetles were more common in ungrazed plots in the birch dominated sites. This difference was mainly due to the species that feeds on deciduous leaves. In the pine dominated sites with high Cladina cover and more changes in ground vegetation, the number of curculionids feeding on conifers was higher in grazed plots. Species richness and diversity (H’) of both families were higher in grazed plots. Of the total 27 species, 11 were found only in grazed plots, while not a single species was found only in ungrazed plots. The relative difference between plots in diversity and evennes (H’/H’max) had humped response to the difference in Cladina cover. The diversity values were greater in grazed plots at the intermediate levels of grazing impact, and only in sites with very low or extremely high Cladina cover difference was the diversity higher in ungrazed plots. The response of beetle diversity resembled the hypotheses suggested for the relationship between grazing and vegetation diversity: greatest positive effect at intermediate grazing intensity and negative effects at unproductive sites...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fragmentation}} creates forest edges, and {{the effect}} of those edges increases as the size of forest fragments decreases. Edge effects include changes to microclimatic conditions at the forest edge, which affect vegetation structure. No previous studies have directly tested the relationship between microclimate and vegetation structure (for instance, basal area, trees mean height, dead trees and damage trees) at the edge of forest fragments in the Atlantic Forest domain. We tested the following three hypotheses: (i) the microclimatic conditions differ between the edge and the interior of the forest, (ii) the forest structure differs between the edge and the interior of the forest and (iii) changes to microclimatic conditions at the forest edge negatively affect vegetation structure at the edges. Our results demonstrate that edge habitats are significantly more susceptible to strong winds, lower humidity and higher air temperatures than <b>forest</b> interiors. The <b>microclimate</b> may be considered the principal factor that explains the difference between the vegetation structure of the forest edge and the forest interior. Our results suggest that even large forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest may be impacted by negative edge effects...|$|R
50|$|Iwonicz-Zdroj {{is one of}} Poland’s oldest health {{resorts and}} spas, dating back to 1578, which was famous outside Poland already in the 18th century. The town lies in the {{south-eastern}} part of Podkarpackie voivodship, Krosno province. The town is surrounded on all sides by high mixed forest. It lies at 400 m above sea level. This unusual location among hills of Beskid Niski, in the valley of Iwonicki Potok (Iwonicz Stream), undeniably rates Iwonicz highly among those places, which charm guests with their beauty and still immaculately clean air. The resort is {{at a distance of}} 80 km to the south from the voivodship capital - Rzeszów, and 16 km from Krosno. It is about 180 km away from Kraków. The Iwonicz climate is described as foothills climate with properties of sub-alpine climate, what is important and advantageous in health resort treatment. The Iwonicz <b>forests</b> create a <b>microclimate</b> around the resort, regulating humidity and temperature of the air, protecting it from winds and are a source of ozone. The resort is situated {{in the area of the}} greatest insolation and lowest cloudiness in Poland, which, all-in-all makes it a perfect spot for soothing, refreshing and regenerating the body.|$|R
40|$|We {{synthesize}} {{findings from}} one of the world’s largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of 1, 000 km 2 in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38 -year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate,</b> tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna. Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination. Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales...|$|E
40|$|In {{temperate}} forests, wind throw often creates canopy gaps {{which can}} dramatically change the micro {{climate and soil}} water balance. The main focus of this thesis is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of the microclimatic conditions in gaps and the sub-canopy in broadleaved deciduous forests. This was achieved by applying a combination of numerical modelling and remote sensing techniques. An analysis {{of the effects of}} canopy gap size on microclimate and soil water content was conducted in a semi-natural broadleaved deciduous forest, Eaves Wood, located in North West England. The results showed that solar radiation, air temperature, soil temperature and soil water content significantly increased with gap size; air humidity was consistently lower in gaps than the sub-canopy but did not vary with gap size. However, the variability of wind speed could not be explained by the presence or size of gaps. A spatially explicit model of forest gap microclimate and soil water balance, FORGAP-BD (FORest GAP - Broadleaved Deciduous) was developed based on previous reviewed literatures and field measurements. The spatial input variables for FORGAP-BD such as leaf area index, land surface elevation, gap and canopy properties and canopy radiation extinction coefficient were derived from LiDAR and multi spectral remotely sensed data. A preliminary study demonstrated the effectiveness of combining numerical modelling and remote sensing approaches for analysis of the spatio-temporal variability of <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate</b> and soil water balance. Refinements were made to the methodologies for extracting canopy and gap properties using LiDAR and multi spectral data, in order to improve the gap microclimate and soil water content simulations. The outputs of the FORGAP-BD model were then validated using in situ data collected at Eaves Wood, U. K. The results demonstrated that FORGAP-BD driven by remotely-sensed inputs was able to accurately simulate the diurnal fluctuations and spatial distribution of solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and soil water content across the study site. Multi-temporal LiDAR data were used to characterise the dynamics of gaps over a ten year period for a broadleaved deciduous forest, Frame Wood, U. K. The dominance of the process of gap contraction by lateral crown expansion was revealed. The spatial outputs from the multi-temporal remotely-sensed data were used to drive the FORGAP-BD model in order to assess the influence of gap dynamics on micro climate. The effects of different types of gap and canopy change were examined. Importantly, by linking gap properties and their influences upon microclimates this research has generated a potentially valuable tool for understanding the consequences of gap dynamics on a range of abiotic and biotic properties and processes. Hence, the approach developed here provides the basis on which to assess the implications of forestry and conservation practices and natural or anthropogenic disturbances in temperate forest ecosystems.

40|$|El microclima en un rodal virgen de Nothofagus pumilio (BV) y el efecto de una corta de regeneración (CR) y de un sector desarbolado (SD) fueron estudiados durante siete años. Tres estaciones microclimáticas registraron las {{variables}}: radiación solar global (RSG), temperaturas del aire (Ta) y del suelo a 15 (TS 15) y 30 cm (TS 30) de profundidad, humedad relativa (HRa) y velocidad del viento (V). Los resultados mostraron que las tendencias en las variables meteorológicas se ajustaron al comportamiento que éstas normalmente exhiben en bosques de similares características. BV presentó diferencias estadísticamente significativas con SD en todas las variables microclimáticas, excepto con Ta, y durante los períodos de receso vegetativo con Tmina, TS 15 y TS 30. En CR se produjeron cambios estadísticamente significativos respecto a BV en las variables RSG, HRa, TS 15, TS 30 (solamente durante período receso vegetativo) y V. Las mayores diferencias encontradas entre BV y CR fueron que RSG aumentó en promedio 4, 4 y 3, 5 veces en CR durante períodos de crecimiento y receso vegetativo, respectivamente; y que la V aumentó 1, 2 veces en CR. Las diferencias en las condiciones microclimáticas registradas sugieren que en CR se verifica un microclima distinto al del BV. Debido a que el microclima y el balance hídrico en el rodal influyen en la vegetación, las disparidades encontradas entre BV y CR son importantes y entregan una base útil para evaluar las implicancias de la práctica forestal más utilizada en estos bosques. The <b>forest</b> <b>microclimate</b> in a Nothofagus pumilio {{primary forest}} (BV) {{and the effect}} of a regeneration felling (RG) and an open field (SD) were studied during seven years. Three weather stations measured the global solar radiation (RSG), the air temperature (Ta), the soil temperature at 15 (TS 15) and 30 (TS 30) cm depth, the relative humidity (HRa) and the wind speed (V). The results showed that the trends in meteorological variables were similar to those found in forests with similar characteristics. Almost all meteorological variables recorded in BV showed statistical differences, compared to SD, with the exception of Ta, and during the leafless period with Tmina (minimum air temperature) TS 15 and TS 30. When CR was compared to BV the variables RSG, HRa, TS 15, TS 30 (only during leafless period) and V showed significant differences. The higher differences between BV and CR were that in CR the RSG was 4. 4 and 3. 5 times higher than in BV, for the fully-leaved and the leafless period; and V was 1. 2 times higher in CR than in BV. These differences suggest that the microclimate in CR changed respect BV. Because the microclimate and the water balance in the stand affect the vegetation, the differences found between BV and CR are important, and provide a baseline of information to evaluate the effects of the regeneration felling, the most frequently implemented cut in these forests...|$|E

All of the changes need to be managed wisely by the central {{government}} and local government which are the result of democratic choice of the people, so that the new spatial plan should be built to meet the space requirements for housing, infrastructure and facilities of the city/county, prospective economic area, nature reserve conservation, cultural and green open space in proportion, according to the carrying capacity of sustainable tropical environment. Regarding to these problem, the local goverments have to get the responsibility for carrying out basic tasks of regional development planning cities/counties, including conducting review, change, and/or the (re) development of developments planning. In practice, the (re) development planning should be done with the consultants or academics from lancape architecture/architecture/planning laboratories of university, which are technically regulated in accordance with applicable legislation. The presence of experts are expected to provide input about the knowledge (technological know-how) of city/ ounty spatial plan, allocation of space, the intensity of the room, the basic building coefficient, coefficient floor building, green base coefficient. In addition, an ecologist can provide insight about the environment, conservation of natural heritage and cultural lanscape, tropical <b>forest</b> conservation, <b>microclimate</b> planning, government legislation which is concerning to environmental policies, and others.

This theoretical concept can only work if the different stakeholders, including local politicians, pay attention, spirit, and power of a large investment for green politics in the long run, without constrained by short-term interests. Such green political movements should be infiltrated into the regulation on spatial plan of city/county...|$|R
40|$|Extract] Introduction Disturbances, {{both natural}} and anthropogenic, shape forest {{ecosystems}} by controlling their species composition, structure and functional processes. The tropical forests of the Wet Tropics of northeast Australia have been moulded by their natural disturbance and land-use history and over many millennia but particularly over the past 100 years 1. Forests of the region are subjected {{to a range of}} natural disturbances, including bush fires, droughts, floods, occasional landslides and tropical cyclones. All these natural disturbances interact in complex ways with anthropogenic disturbances across the landscape, such as land-use change resulting from forest conversion to agricultural systems, indigenous fire management regimes, earlier logging practices, urban and peri-urban development and infrastructure projects, such as major roads, powerline corridors and dams. Tropical cyclones are significant natural disturbance phenomena for forest ecosystems in the Wet Tropics of northeast Australia, especially for forests near the coast 2. For this reason, even continuous forests in the region have been described as hyper-disturbed ecosystems with patches of damaged forest constantly recovering from previous cyclonic events, often in concert with floods, droughts and fires. Cyclones are part of the ecosystem dynamics of these forested landscapes and recovery of canopy cover following such events is often remarkably rapid, although forest structure and composition may take many decades to recover. The same cannot be said for fragmented forests in the Wet Tropics, located within either an agricultural, urban, linear infrastructure or grassland matrix. These forest fragments are particularly vulnerable to impacts of tropical cyclones and their associated strong winds, largely due to their high forest edge to area ratios. Severe cyclones cause widespread defoliation of rainforest canopy trees, removal of vines and epiphytes, along with the breakage of crown stems and associated tree falls. These catastrophic impacts typically result in significant changes in <b>forest</b> <b>microclimates</b> in the understorey and canopy, and complex vegetation and faunal responses to newly created light, temperature and humidity regimes. Cyclonic disturbance has also been shown to accelerate invasion by exotic tree, vine and grass species leading to a decline in biodiversity of native plant species in some forest regions. Given the relatively high frequency of tropical cyclones, there is a general consensus that they contribute to the structure and function of tropical rainforests in cyclone-prone areas, with ecosystem impacts and recovery processes occurring at several spatial and temporal scales. Impacts of tropical cyclones on forests at the landscape-scale (> 10 km) are the result of the complex interaction of anthropogenic, meteorological, topographical and biotic factors. Three main factors control forest damage at this scale: 1) wind velocity gradients resulting from cyclone size, speed of forward movement, cyclone intensity and proximity to the storm track, complicated by local convective-scale effects; 2) variations in site exposure and other effects of local topography (e. g. severe lee waves or leeward acceleration, windward exposure, topographic shading); and 3) differential response of individual ecosystems to wind disturbance as a function of species composition and forest structure. Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry, with maximum wind gusts were near 240 km h 1, crossed the coast near Innisfail (Fig. 1) as a Category 4 storm on 20 March 2006 causing extensive damage to human communities, primary industries, infrastructure and ecosystems across a 100 km strip of coastal lowlands and adjacent uplands. The system was moving at 25 km h- 1 when it crossed the coast and was still Category 4 status when it crossed over the Atherton Tablelands some 60 km from the coast (Fig. 1). Cyclone Larry produced numerous tornado-type features within the system’s eyewall and feeder bands that have been linked to patches of catastrophic forest damage. Larry was a very 'compact' system with its radius of maximum winds extending only 20 - 30 km from the centre (BOM, this report). We examine the landscape-scale impacts of Cyclone "Larry" on the ecosystems of far north Queensland and provide a comparison with previous cyclones that have impacted along the wet tropical coast of Queensland over the period 1858 - 2006. We also discuss responses to the natural resource management issues facing the affected region in the aftermath...|$|R
40|$|The desert {{tortoise}} (Gopherus agassizii) {{has traditionally}} been viewed as an archetypal desert-adapted vertebrate. However, evidence from historical ecology, phylogenetics, anatomy, physiology, and biogeography qualifies this view significantly. Ancestors of G. agassizii stabilized as an essentially modern morph some 17 - 19 million yrs ago ago, perhaps 12 million yrs before the formation of major regional deserts in North America. Some physiological mechanisms for avoiding or accommodating desert stressors may be symplesiomorphies, primitive character states common to most ectothermic amniotes. Prominent among these are slow metabolic rates and high tolerances for osmotic flux in body fluids. Other functional characteristics for accommodating contemporary aridity are exaptations shared with forest-dwelling batagurid and manourine chelonian antecedents, originally evolved for terrestrialism, not aridity. Large brittle-shelled eggs, herbivory, and a generalized and expansive digestive tract may all be among these symplesiomorphies, at least relative to the gopherine clade. Other anatomical and behavioral features {{are associated with a}} fossorial life style which may have developed in sandy habitats within grasslands and along <b>forest</b> edges, where <b>microclimates</b> were semi-arid, but at a time North American landforms had not yet experienced desert aridity. Burrow excavation may have evolved in response to the stress of intense insolation in exposed scrub, grasslands, and meadows, only later serving as protection against cold, heat, and predators.
