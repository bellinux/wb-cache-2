40|$|The main {{target of}} my diploma thesis {{is to find}} how much the women are {{satisfied}} with their life, namely in life aspects, which are closely associated with gender problems. At first there is sketched when, where and who started to concerned with standing of woman in society. Next I describe the gender from biological view, then if the gender indicitive allocation of roles has the biological grounds or not. In the next chapter there're founded the grounds of gender <b>indicative</b> <b>allocation</b> of roles {{in the area of}} individual socialization, mainly in infancy period. In the fourth chapter I try to describe individual parts of life, where, in my opinion, the gender disparity the most reflexed is. This is concretely concerned the family field, employment, I deal the cult of beauty as well. The last chapter is about effort of European Union and about the achieving of identical standing of men and women, I lightly touch also the worldwide problem of woman's standing. The important part of this diploma thesis is questionary, what finds the satisfaction of men and women with their lifes, namely in life aspects, where are adherent to gender problematic. There's also regarded the influence of education in the qestionary investigation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{experiment}} tested {{an intuitive}} principle {{in the radio}} in-dustry: that production effects (i. e., laser sounds, voice modulation, etc.) in-crease listener attention to messages. Professional voice talent created 5 - 10 second promotional announcements (promos) for nine fictitious stations. Each contained a slogan considered typical of industry practices (“Channel 97 WRRK–The Classic Rock Station”). Three of the promos were pro-duced as announcer only, three with laser effects, and three with an echo ef-fect. The promos systematically alternated between 2 -minute segments of talk show content to resemble typical broadcast programming. Heart rate data were collected, time locked to the media presentation, from 62 partici-pants as they listened to the stimulus. Afterwards, recognition data were collected. Results show cardiac deceleration following production effects, <b>indicative</b> of automatic <b>allocation</b> of attention. Memory data show an ex-pected increase in recognition for information in the promos containing pro-duction effects, although not all memory tests reach statistical significance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis {{with the aim}} to investigate the EU regional policy and in particular to consider how it has impacted on national states authority. The original point of this work consists in constructing an index to rank the power of regions in each state that consider the total Regional Policy funds allocation in the sample 2000 - 2006 and the <b>indicative</b> financial <b>allocation</b> for the sample 2007 - 2013. The idea behind this index is that powerful regions {{will be able to}} protect their interests in the allocating process. Thus, we can “measure” the power of regions, indirectly, by mean of the loss bore by them in the re-negotiating process. At this purpose it is important to underline that enlargement had as concomitant result that the regional disparities have doubled, so that the challenge for each region (and each state) is becoming very strong. Thus, the power of region (where and if it exists) has to emerge with particular evidence in this context. In this work I propose an analysis that may be thought as divided into two main parts. The first one with the aim to provide a synthesis of the main results achieved in literature about this issue and in particular the debate between Multilevel-Governance and State Centric literature. In a second part, as I said before, I investigate the empirical evidence concerning the EU model of governance with particular attention to the EU regional policy. The empirical evidence here considered is consistent with some assertion provided by Multilevel Governance literature. ...|$|R
40|$|Condensed tannin (CT) {{contents}} of European aspen (Populus tremula L.) vary among genotypes, {{and increases in}} nitrogen (N) availability generally reduce plants’ tannin production in favor of growth, through poorly understood mechanisms. We hypothesized that intrinsic tannin production rates may co-vary with gene expression responses to soil N and resource allocation within the phenylpropanoid pathway (PPP). Thus, we examined correlations between soil N levels and both expression patterns of eight PPP genes (measured by quantitative-reverse transcription PCR) and foliar phenolic compounds (measured by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) in young aspen genets with intrinsically extreme CT levels. Monitored phenolics included salicinoids, lignins, flavones, flavonols, CT precursors and CTs. The PPP genes were consistently expressed more strongly in high-CT trees. Low N supplements reduced expression of genes throughout the PPP in all genets, while high N doses restored expression of genes {{at the beginning and}} end of the pathway. These PPP changes were not reflected in pools of tannin precursors, but varying correlations between gene expression and foliar phenolic pools were detected in young and mature leaves, suggesting that processes linking gene expression and the resulting phenolics vary spatially and temporally. Precursor fluxes suggested that CT-related metabolic rate or sink controls are linked to intrinsic carbon allocation strategies associated with N responses. Overall, we found more negative correlations (<b>indicative</b> of <b>allocation</b> trade-offs) between PPP gene expression and phenolic products following N additions in low-CT plants than in high-CT plants. The tannin-related expression dynamics suggest that, in addition to defense, relative tannin levels may also be indicative of intraspecific variations in the way aspen genets respond to soil fertility...|$|R
40|$|European aspen (Populus tremula) is a {{fast growing}} tree species, rich in {{phenolic}} compounds. Defense theories suggest that soil nitrogen greatly influence plant allocation togrowth and defense; however, the allocation priorities {{are not well}} understood. Further,although foliar phenolic compounds are considered defensive, specialist organisms may positively associate with and alter them. There are two classes of phenolics in aspen,condensed tannins (CTs) and salicinoids. They are likely to shape the interactions of themany organisms, for example, herbivorous insects and endophytic fungi and three-way interactions among host genotype, specialist herbivores and endophytic fungi could be greatly altered by aspen geno- and chemotypes’ responses to soil nitrogen. Firstly, I focused on the allocation of carbon to growth and defense in aspen genotypes with varied tannin content in response to nutrient addition. Nitrogen promoted plant growth and suppressed foliar CT levels. At the molecular level expression of genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway (PPP) decreased under low additions of N (equivalent to 15 kg/ha), whereas genes {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the pathway increased in response to high levels of N (~ 150 kg/ha). Aspens high in CTs displayed consistently stronger PPP gene expressions compared to CT-low aspens, and correlations between PPP genes and phenolic products varied with tannin content, as an effect of leaf age, in response to N enrichment, and individually with genotype. More negative correlations (<b>indicative</b> of <b>allocation</b> trade-offs) between PPP gene expressions and phenolic products were found in aspen genets with low tannin levels compared to aspens with inherently high tannin levels. Secondly, I studied the connection between foliar phenolic compounds and endophytic fungi in the presence and absence of a specialist herbivorous beetle (Chrysomela tremula) and as an effect of soil nitrogen addition. Richness and abundance of fungal endophytes associated with aspen genotypes and phenolic profile, however this specificity disappeared in the presence of the leaf beetles. Herbivory both enhanced endophyte richness andabundance in the leaves and it also increased in response to nitrogen addition...|$|R
40|$|Plant invertases are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} that have enzymatic function in cleaving sucrose to fructose and glucose. Cell wall invertase, located on {{the exterior of the}} cell wall of plant cells, {{plays a key role in}} the unloading of sucrose from the apoplast to the sink tissues. Cell wall invertase interacts with an inhibitor, cell wall invertase inhibitor, post-transcriptionally to regulate its activity. The inhibitor is constitutively expressed in pollen development, early developing seeds, and senescing leaves: <b>indicative</b> of sucrose <b>allocation</b> being a limiting factor at these stages of development. We introduced algal bicarbonate transporters LCIA/CCP 1 to Camelina sativa for the purpose of increasing photosynthetic capacity. The bicarbonate transporters concentrate CO 2 at RuBisCO by pumping CO 2 in the form of bicarbonate through the membrane, then converting it back to CO 2 at RuBisCO, increasing CO 2 concentration. Results from these plants have shown an increase in seed number, but not seed mass, along with a faster rate of maturity and senescence. This is indicative of acclimation to high CO 2 conditions, resulting from insertion of the bicarbonate transporters. RNA sequencing was performed and a putative invertase inhibitor was recognized as being expressed in the transgenic C. sativa but not in the wild type. Our strategy is to knock out two invertase inhibitors using induced RNA silencing, dramatically altering sucrose allocation into developing seeds and resulting in an increase in seed biomass. It is the aim of this research to increase the biomass of C. sativa seeds in order to increase its effectiveness as an agent to create sustainable biofuels...|$|R
