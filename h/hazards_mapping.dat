40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of risks prevention plans frequently causes lively debates between state services (which conduct risks prevention plans and prior hazards studies) and relevant territorial authorities. The {{development of}} coastal risks prevention plans, identified as priorities after Xynthia storm in 2010, also faced hard difficulties. Debates mostly concerned coastal <b>hazards</b> <b>mapping</b> process, realized before the plans which strongly depend of them. A questionnaire survey of state services focuses on around sixty coastal hazards studies, concerning coastal flooding, coastline recession and sand dunes migration. The results define territories characteristics (current issues in territory and future territorial development), technical studies characteristics, project management and dialogue process between stakeholders.

After Xynthia storm, it also became a priority to review <b>hazards</b> <b>mapping</b> principles. Hazards concerned are coastal flooding, coastline retreat and sand dunes migration. During three years of intense coastal hazard mapping, several scientist controversies and complaints, sometimes going to conflict between state services and relevant territorial authorities, have been noticed concerning the hazard mapping process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Flood is {{a natural}} hazard, and a natural process or {{phenomena}} occurring in the land that could be damaging for human {{as well as for}} natural environment. The flood <b>hazard</b> <b>maps</b> display flood <b>hazard</b> information in a given area which can be used in area development and management planning. The Geographic Information System (GIS) assisted <b>hazard</b> <b>mapping</b> is fast and reliable technique that can give information with just a click of your fingertips. The spatial analyst, integrated in GIS, was used in this study to develop a methodology for flood <b>hazard</b> <b>mapping</b> in Bucao River Watershed (BRW) and Santo Tomas River Watershed (STRW) in Zambales as a support tool in identifying flood susceptible areas in the watershed. Thematic maps such as elevation, slope, distance to major rivers and land cover were used to generate the flood <b>hazard</b> <b>maps</b> within the watershed.

40|$|Site-specific seismic slope {{stability}} analyses are required in California by the 1990 California Seismic <b>Hazards</b> <b>Mapping</b> Act for sites located within mapped hazard zones and scheduled for development {{with more than}} four single-family dwellings. A screen analysis is performed to distinguish sites for which only small ground deformations are likely from sites for which larger, more damaging landslide movements could occur. No additional analyses are required for sites that pass the screen, whereas relatively detailed analyses are required for sites that fail the screen. We present a screen analysis procedure {{that is based on}} a calibrated pseudo-static representation of seismic {{slope stability}}. The novel feature of the present screen procedure is that it accounts not only for the effects of ground motion amplitude on slope displacement, but also accounts for duration effects indirectly via the site seismicity. This formulation enables a more site-specific screen analysis than previous formulations that made a priori assumptions of seismicity/duration. This screen procedure has recently been adopted by the Landslide Hazard Implementation Committee for implementation by practicing engineers and engineering geologists in southern California...|$|E

40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) provides an all-weather imaging capability for measuring ground-surface deformation and inferring changes in land surface characteristics. InSAR enables scientists to monitor and characterize hazards posed by volcanic, seismic, and hydrogeologic processes, by landslides and wildfires, and by human activities such as mining and fluid extraction or injection. Measuring how a volcano’s surface deforms before, during, and after eruptions provides essential information about magma dynamics and a basis for mitigating volcanic hazards. Measuring spatial and temporal patterns of surface deformation in seismically active regions is extraordinarily useful for understanding rupture dynamics and estimating seismic risks. Measuring how landslides develop and activate is a prerequisite to minimizing associated <b>hazards.</b> <b>Mapping</b> surface subsidence or uplift related to extraction or injection of fluids during exploitation of groundwater aquifers or petroleum reservoirs provides fundamental data on aquifer or reservoir properties and improves our ability to mitigate undesired consequences. Monitoring dynamic water-level changes in wetlands improves hydrological modeling predictions and the assessment of future flood impacts. In addition, InSAR imagery can provide near-real-time estimates of fire scar extents and fire severity for wildfire management and control. All-weather satellite radar imagery is critical for studying various natural processes and is playing an increasingly important role in understanding and forecasting natural hazards...|$|E

Eight scenario loss estimations associated with segments of the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Elsinore faults were calculated for Riverside County using HAZUSTM. Input parameters were adjusted based on our GIS database of soil, liquefaction and landslide mapping. The inventory exposure in Riverside County consists of 402, 000 buildings valued at over $ 61 billion, with a population exposure of 1. 2 million. Loss estimations for the eight scenario events varied from 1, 100 to 10, 500 casualties and $ 2. 2 to $ 13. 2 billion.

40|$|In 2000, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Environmental Office at the John C.

NASA had previously developed a GIS database at SSC {{to assist in}} the NASA Environmental Office's management of the Center. This GIS became the basis for the NASA-wide EGIS project, which was proposed after the applicability of the SSC database was demonstrated. Since its completion, the SSC EGIS has aided the Environmental Office with noise pollution modeling, land cover assessment, wetlands delineation, environmental <b>hazards</b> <b>mapping,</b> and critical habitat delineation for protected species. At SSC, facility management and safety officers are responsible for ensuring the physical security of the facilities, staff, and equipment as well as for responding to environmental emergencies, such as accidental releases of hazardous materials.

Through the SSC-EGIS, the Enivronmental Office inventories, assesses, and manages the nearly 139, 000 acres that comprise Stennis Space Center and its surrounding acoustical buffer zone. The SSC-EGIS contains in-house data {{as well as a}} wide range of data obtained from outside sources, including private agencies and local, county, state, and U. S. government agencies. The database comprises cadastral/geodetic, hydrology, infrastructure, geo-political, physical geography, and socio-economic vector and raster layers.

30|$|Numerous {{research}} have been attempted on landslide hazards to study slope instability <b>hazards</b> <b>mapping</b> (Carrara et al. 1991; Carrara et al. 1999; Guzzetti et al. 1999; Barredo et al. 2000; Pack and Tarboton 2004; Guzzetti et al. 2005; Roering et al. 2009; Pirasteh et al. 2011; Su et al. 2015). Also, some researchers applied deterministic models for landslide susceptibility mapping and modelling (Binaghi et al. 1999; Westen and Terlien 1996; Watts 2004; Sarkar and Kanungo 2004; Pradhan and Pirasteh, 2010; Zhou et al. 2003; Lee and Dan 2005; Lee et al. 2004; Westen et al. 2008; Jebur et al. 2014). Moreover, they have applied the logistic regression model to landslide hazard mapping (Lee and Pradhan 2006; Choi et al. 2012). Recently, landslide hazard evaluation {{carried out by}} using fuzzy logic, and artificial neural network models (Lee et al. 2004; Yilmaz 2010; Lee et al. 2014). During the last decade, researchers indicated that landslide susceptibility and deformation measurement have extensively performed particularly for the landslides assessment (Luzi et al. 2000; Schulz 2004; Su and Bork 2006; Streutker and Glenn 2006; Schulz 2007). They have integrated traditional and advanced methods such as classical geodetic surveying techniques (i.e. theodolites, photogrammetry, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)), LiDAR, satellite based observation systems, and the GIS technology by applying stochastic and deterministic models. However, the weakness is that the points collected from theodolites, photogrammetry, levels and GNSS, satellite imageries, perform quite low in density. For example, McKean and Roering (2003) studied the low-density digital elevation model (DEM) to determine the potential to differentiate morphologically components within a landslide (Lee and Dan 2005; Glen et al. 2006; Lee and Pradhan 2006; Yilmaz 2010; Niculită 2016). They explored how to {{provide insight into the}} material type and activity of the slide. As a result, the literature review indicated that these techniques and low pixel resolutions of DEM and satellite imageries could not provide sufficient enough accuracy to visualize the objects extracting an informative description of the landslide locations and to predict the probability of the landslides occurrence.|$|E
30|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{hydrodynamic model}} {{was used to}} simulate flooding (Ramirez and Rajasekar 2015). The methodology includes three stages: (1) simulation of Ukai dam release discharge reaching the city, (2) simulation of the combined effect of the tides and the dam released water, (3) delineating the vulnerable infrastructure and population. A loss and damage assessment of Surat City due to floods was carried out (Bahinipati et al. 2015). This study exclusively considered the textile industry which was affected during the 2006 floods. The storm drainage from the Surat city passes through various tributaries (creeks) and ultimately drains into the Mindhola River. Following the floods during 2006, flood <b>hazards</b> <b>mapping</b> of the urban floodplain of the Tapi catchment area was carried out using GIS and remote sensing techniques (Singh and Sharma 2009). Ukai dam release scenarios combined with tidal effects were used to run a two-dimensional flood model (CAESAR-Lisflood) using a fine spatial resolution (30  m) topography (Ramirez et al. 2016). Simulations were carried out for extreme conditions, and probabilistic flood risk maps were prepared for the city. The flood impact assessment {{and the extent of}} inundation in the low-lying area are carried out (Patel et al. 2017) using a 1 D/ 2 D coupled hydrodynamic model (HEC-RAS 5) considering two hundred and ninety-nine cross sections, five major bridges and two hydraulic structures along the river course. The model set-up considered the conditions (tidal level at the river mouth and the Ukai Dam release) during the 2006 flood as boundary conditions. The results indicated that[*]~[*] 75 – 77 % area of the city was inundated during the flood. Areas within the city which are prone to flooding and submergence were identified using Digital Elevation Model and Geographical Information System (Patel and Dholakia 2010). Modelling studies incorporating climate factors are almost absent in the region. As the city is predicted to be prone to flooding induced by climate change impacts, {{there is a need for}} studies addressing this issue.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Beef, {{sheep and}} goat meat {{consumption}} provides essential nutrients in highly bioavailable form, and poses a zoonotic pathogen threat. In Nairobi, these luxury products are difficult to access by poor households, yet little is known on the city’s food system in terms of food safety and security risks. An understanding of the food systems is essential to assess and contextualize the chains supplying poor households and to determine population exposure to <b>hazards.</b> <b>Mapping</b> is therefore crucial to assess food security and food safety risks. The present study characterised the Nairobi beef, {{sheep and goat}} food systems using value chain analysis. Methods: Data collection targeted the different stakeholders involved in beef, sheep and goat meat food systems from: (1) urban and periurban farmers; (2) livestock and meat traders, abattoir/market owners and workers, and livestock and meat transporters in all Nairobi markets; (3) managers of the main beef, sheep and goat meat processing companies; (4) urban and periurban retailers; (5) 205 low income consumers and (6) government/regulatory officers. Data were collected through focus groups discussion and individual interviews, and complemented with secondary data. Qualitative data were obtained on people, animals, products and chains interactions to identify all the existing stakeholders and chains, and assess their organizational, spatial and temporal structure. Quantitative data were collected to assess flow of products in the different chains and their contribution to the supply of these commodities to Nairobi. Data were recorded and entered in thematic templates for analysis. Mapping analysis was done {{through the creation of}} 'Chain profiles', which groups patterns of operations/flows of commodities. Mapping of these profiles was done at 3 levels: (1) people chain profile (map interactions of actors); (2) Geographical chain profiling (map of routes of animals and products); and (3) Product profiling. Findings and interpretations: Eight chain profiles that make up the beef, sheep and goat meat food systems were identified. A critical profile was the ‘less integrated terminal markets’, composed of chains where no group or person own a large proportion of different activities. This profile represents three quarters of the city’s beef, sheep and goat meat supply and contains two significant markets (Figure 1). Large companies integrate market, product transport and distribution, and mainly export or supply to high class retailers and consumers. Six beef keeping activities were identified in the city, mainly as temporary settlements. Sheep and goat keeping was mainly small scale (1 - 5 animals) and their animals are mostly slaughtered in households for festive occasions. In low income households beef was obtained from butcheries (83 %), while goats were obtained from butcheries (51 %) and markets (40 %). This study shows the importance of specific chains to the food security of a city, and describes the dimensions of urban human-livestock interactions. In combination with an understanding of chains governance and barriers, this study provides a powerful approach, missing to date, for the investigation of nutrition and food safety risks...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} people {{suffering}} from natural disasters, and {{the economic impact of}} those disasters, continue to increase as the years go by. Better preparation and risk management strategies can help lessen the impacts of these disasters. One important aspect of risk management is risk assessment, which can be accomplished with a <b>hazard</b> <b>map.</b> One application of <b>hazard</b> <b>maps</b> is to forecast volcanic ashfall following an eruption to help people and organisations prepare themselves for, and mitigate the detrimental impacts of, volcanic ashfall. 	This research evaluated the key elements of a <b>hazard</b> <b>map</b> and how to make a <b>hazard</b> <b>map</b> most effective through the study of short-term ashfall forecast maps in New Zealand. A mixed-methods approach was taken for this research. Interviews were conducted with scientists at GNS and stakeholders who use the ashfall forecast maps. After the data from the interviews was analysed, an internet-based survey was created and sent out to anyone interested in participating. The survey served as a low-resolution verification of the high-resolution data gathered in the interviews. After each stage of information gathering, the ashfall forecast map design was updated. 	This research found that there are seven basic elements which should be considered when creating a <b>hazard</b> <b>map.</b> These elements are: simplicity of the map, base map, map scale, the use of colour, geographical information, the inclusion of uncertainty, and time. This research also found key lessons which can be applied to any <b>hazard</b> <b>map</b> creation process. These lessons are: established practices should be revaluated periodically, communication between the information provider and the enduser is critical, the information provider must decide between satisfying the individual or the group, education and outreach are important, audience feedback is necessary for an effective <b>map,</b> and that <b>hazard</b> <b>maps</b> are just one step in the risk mitigation process...|$|R
40|$|The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion (HERP) of Japan {{published}} the national seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>maps</b> of Japan in March 2005, at {{the initiation of}} the earthquake research committee of Japan (ERCJ), {{on the basis of}} a long-term evaluation of seismic activity and a strong-motion evaluation. Meanwhile, the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) also promoted the special research project named National Seismic <b>Hazard</b> <b>Mapping</b> Project of Japan to support preparation of the seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>maps.</b> Under the guidance of ERCJ, we carried out a study of the <b>hazard</b> <b>maps.</b> There are 2 types of hazard map: one is a probabilistic seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>map</b> (PSHM), which shows the relation between seismic intensity value and its probability of exceedance within a certain time; the other is a scenario earthquake shaking map (SESM). For the PSHM, we used an empirical attenuation formula for strong-motion, which followed seismic activity modeling by ERCJ. Both peak velocity on the engineering bedrock (Vs= 400 m/s) and on the ground surface are evaluated for sites with a spacing of approximately 1 km, The potential JMA seismic intensities on the ground surface are also evaluated using an empirical formula. For the SESMs, based on source modeling for strong-motion evaluation, we adopted a hybrid method to simulate waveforms on the engineering bedrock and peak ground velocity. For this project, we developed an open web system to provide information interactively and retrievally, and named the system Japan Seismic Hazard Information Station, J-SHIS ([URL] 55 www. j-shis. bosai. go. jp). We aimed to distribute the process of uncertainty evaluation, and to meet multi-purpose needs in engineering fields. The information provided by J-SHIS includes not only the <b>hazard</b> <b>map</b> results, but also various information required in the processes of making the <b>hazard</b> <b>maps,</b> such as data on seismic activity, source models, and underground structure...|$|R
