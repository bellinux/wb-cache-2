The Concordia accident, like many others before it, has shaken the maritime profession once again with many questions being asked without being able to provide credible answers. Old ships have been designed to lower standards (it is common knowledge that new ships are safer than old ships, with the latter comprising the majority of the population), new standards are holistic and goal-based offering knowledge of the standard these ships are designed to, which is not true for old ships, emergency response is an altogether different science in modern ships and many others. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, there is another more fundamental weakness in the regulations for <b>damage</b> <b>stability,</b> perhaps at the heart of most problems with cruise ships safety, old and new. A critical review into <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> legislation, {{as it applies}} to passenger ships, offers compelling evidence that cruise ship characteristics and behaviour have not been accounted for in the derivation of relevant <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> rules. As a result, the regulatory instruments for <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> currently in place do not provide the right measure of <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> for cruise ships and, even more worryingly, the right guidance for design improvement. This leads to a precarious situation where cruise ships are underrated when it comes to assigning a <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> standard whilst depriving designers of appropriate legislative instruments to nurture continuous improvement.

40|$|With {{artefacts}} {{on human}} endeavours at sea dating {{as far back}} as 6500 BC, it is mind boggling to think that it was not until 250 BC when the first recorded steps to establish the foundation of naval architecture, floatability and stability, were made by Archimedes. It is even more astonishing that practical pertinence and function of these two very basic principles remained dormant for nearly two millennia after this, before the first attempts to convey the meaning of stability to men of practice took place in the eighteenth century by Hoste and Bouguer. Pertinent regulations, especially after accidents involving water ingress and flooding (through subdivision and <b>damage</b> <b>stability),</b> were introduced even much later. Notably, the first Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 addressed subdivision and led eventually and after heavy loss of life to the adoption of the first internationally agreed system of subdivision in SOLAS 1929 (Safety of Life at Sea), while the first specific criterion on residual static stability standards was introduced at the 1960 SOLAS Convention. This 'tortoise' pace gave way to the steepest learning curve in the history of naval architecture with the introduction of the probabilistic <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> rules in the late 60 s {{as an alternative to the}} deterministic requirements. Prompting and motivating the adoption of a more rational approach to <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> and survivability necessitated the development of appropriate methods, tools and techniques capable of meaningfully addressing the physical phenomena involved. Within 50 years, this new impetus has climaxed to the 'zero tolerance' concept of Safe Return to Port, introduced in July 2009, and to an open proclamation by the Secretary of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that deterministic requirements have no future. More important, the use of a probabilistic framework and of first-principles tools to address ship safety quantitatively and consistently has given rise to aspirations and henceforth capability in identifying and evaluating the key contributors to passenger ship safety. The revelation was plain and clear, namely: <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> or, more precisely, lack thereof constitutes by far the key risk contributor for passenger ships. Resolving this problem will be equivalent to solving ('nailing') passenger ship safety problems. The author, having played a protagonist role in contemporary developments on <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> and survivability and having been involved closely in implementing such developments to the design of modern mega-ships, will attempt to provide a succinct account of pertinent developments on <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> and survivability and demonstrate their implications on passenger ship design and operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} for <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> and survivability {{of a ship}} struck in a collision in arbitrary sea-state are, from a structural point of view, determined by {{the size and shape}} of the damage opening in its side-shell. In the current investigation, explicit finite element analyses (FEA) are presented of a ship-to-ship collision scenario in which the damage opening of a struck ship is calculated for a selection of damage degradation models and realistic material properties, here referred to as model and material properties uncertainties. The model uncertainty is considered as a possible (user-related) insecurity in the selection of the most appropriate damage criterion for the analysis; the shear failure and the forming limit diagram (FLD) criteria were compared in the current investigation. The uncertainty in material properties is accounted for in the constitutive material model description and the material parameters used in the two damage criteria. The size and shape of the damage openings predicted by the FEA are used in <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> analyses in which the struck ship is subjected to wave motions in an arbitrary sea-state and flooding into the damage opening. The survivability of the struck ship is estimated for all of the damage opening cases. One of the main conclusions is that the high degree of accuracy that a researcher on structure analysis strives for has to be considered together with the natural variation of the sea-state that defines the characteristics in the following <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> analysis. Consequently, by adoption of a holistic approach in which structural integrity and <b>damage</b> <b>stability</b> research are combined using a systematic parameter (sensitivity) and collision-scenario-based analysis, simplified models and criteria can be developed more efficiently and with higher precision. It will also be clearer which variables are the most important to focus on when analysing the survivability or risk for capsizing...|$|R
