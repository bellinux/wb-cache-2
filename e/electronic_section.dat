This hardcopy text, comprising {{the main body}} and an appendix, {{is accompanied by a}} disk with programs, data files and a brief manual. The main body discusses purpose, design principle and usage of the computer software for the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) expert system. The appendix provides a brief instruction on the manipulation of the demonstration program and relevant information on accessing the diskette. The computer software of the expert system has been developed in C++ language to simulate spectra and to select analytical lines in ICP-AES. This expert system is based on a comprehensive model of non-LTE ICP-AES, which includes expertise in plasma discharges, analyte ionization and excitation, and spectral-line shapes. The system also provides several databases in which essential elemental and spectral data are stored. A logic reasoning engine is utilized for selection of the best analytical line with a main criterion of minimizing the true detection limit. The system is user-friendly with pop-up menus, an editor for database operation, and a graphic interface for the display of simulated spectra. The system can simulate spectra and predict spectral interferences with good accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} {{interest}} in artificial implementations of biological systems has been arising. In particular, several research groups have been working in mimicking the mammalian olfactory system with the so-called electronic noses (e-noses). The e-noses, {{which are based on}} a sensor array, a fluid-dynamic system, and a data processing unit, are systems devoted to detecting and analyzing volatiles, where a deep knowledge of the target application is needed. In order to achieve effective results the sampling system, the measurement protocols, the sensor array, and the pattern recognition techniques have to be carefully designed. The increasing complexity of such design poses issues in sensory feature extraction and fusion, drift compensation, and data processing, especially when high efficiency is required for real-time applications. The interconnection and cooperation of several modules devoted to processing different tasks, such as control, data acquisition, data filtering interfaces, feature selection, and pattern analysis, are already mandatory. Moreover, heterogeneous techniques used to implement such tasks may introduce module interconnection and cooperation issues. In this paper, we address the development of a dedicated instrument able to perform real-time transduction, fusion, and processing of chemoresistive sensor array signals. In particular, this instrument realizes a dynamic and efficient management of data processing techniques and automatically controls the measurement protocols and the sampling system. An array of conducting poly (alkoxy-bithiophenes) sensors, the fluid-dynamic system, the <b>electronic</b> <b>section,</b> the framework's base architecture, and the implementation of dedicated application processes are described. The classification task is based on a self-organizing map where models for artificial neurons and connections were derived from the base structures available in the framework core. According to the target application, this instrument is portable and easily tailored, calibrated, and trained. Classification of olive oil headspaces supports its utility in supplying high-efficiency routine for volatile organic compounds detection and analysis...|$|E
40|$|IN {{recent years}} applied {{physiology}} {{has begun to}} play an important part in medical diagnosis. The object {{of this paper is to}} provide some base-line normal values for nerve conduction in three peripheral nerves—the ulnar, median, and lateral popliteal nerves—as these nerves are frequently the subject of conduc-tion tests. It has been well described by Weiss (1956) that when a nerve is constricted there is generalized thinning of the axon distal to the point of constriction. Conduction velocity in nerve is proportional to the calibre of the axon (Hodes et ah, 1948), and this proportionality is valid also for nerves after injury (Hursh, 1939). It therefore follows that, as the calibre of the axon decreases, so also does conduction velocity. Now that more modern techniques have been developed and concentric needle electrodes are standard equipment it is felt that a series of normal subjects should be examined, their conduction velocities and latencies recorded, and the artifacts encountered discussed. In previously published series skin electrodes (Hodes et ah, 1948; Norrise/a/., 1953) and coaxial needle electrodes (Thomas et ah, 1959) have been used to pick up the action potential from the activated muscles. MATERIALS AND METHODS Conduction velocity was measured in thirty medical and physiotherapy students on three nerves—the median, ulnar, and lateral popliteal. The equip-ment used was the standard electromyograph at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, designed and developed in the <b>electronic</b> <b>section.</b> A bipolar electrode consisting of two saline-soaked tufts 1 cm. in diameter and 2 cm. apart was supplied from a balanced constant-voltage stimulator delivering a rectangular pulse of 0 - 1 millisecond duration percutaneously. A concentric needle electrode was used to pick up the action potential from the muscle under study, and this was photographed synchronously from the cathode-ray oscilloscope on the electro-myograph. To decrease skin resistance and current distortion at the source of stimula-tion the skin over the nerve under study was prepared with an abrasive paste consisting of pumice suspended in glycerin. This partially removed the stratum corneum of the epidermis, which layer offers the highest impedance to th...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to design and build a {{prototype}} of recoating system for a laser cutting machine {{to turn it into}} a selective laser sintering printing machine. This prototype will be used to study new sintering materials and to design, if decided, a SLS 3 D printing Machine (Selective Laser Sintering). This project has been developed in the installations and funded by Fundació CIM. The project develops the mechanical design and the electronic system design. Both parts are explained on this paper, so new users can use the machine and can understand the system. With this paper, it is expected that it can be improved in a future to test other parameters and configurations. The paper is divided in three basic blocks that are summed up here: The first block is an introduction to the 3 D printing technologies. The most used of them are explained and selective laser sintering is explained in deep. With this block the reader can understand why it is important to develop the SLS technology and what has to be done to improve the machines and the technology. The second block is a discussion on the mechanical design of the machine. The general idea of the machine is explained so the user can understand why the machine is designed in this way. After that, each part is detailed to see how the different mechanical challenges where overtaken. At the end of the block, there is a small calculations section needed on the electronic part. The third block is an extensive explanation of the electronic system that controls and moves the machine. In that block, the different components are explained so the user can understand its basics working principles. It is also explained how the selection of the electronic components was done. Then everything is put together to see the whole electronic system. Along with this paper, there are annexes that provide some extra information for the reader. One of this annexes refers to the mechanical part and the other one has some datasheets and coding for the <b>electronic</b> <b>section.</b> The whole design has been done in SOLIDWORKS cad software and its electric extension ELECWORKS.
