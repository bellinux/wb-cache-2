40|$|We explore downsampling {{of optical}} {{frequency}} combs {{by way of}} pulse gating for efficient spectral broadening and f- 2 f interferometry. We downsample a 250 MHz repetition-rate comb to 25 MHz, thereby enabling detection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> carrier-envelope offset frequency. Pulse gating can both increase timing jitter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> pulse train and induce spurious frequency offsets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> spectrum.

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> optical sources, {{as well as in}} <b>the</b> stabilization <b>of</b> their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect <b>the</b> microwave frequency <b>of</b> a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (<b>the</b> output <b>of</b> a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years <b>of</b> effort in <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequency standard, and <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> elements at <b>the</b> red end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> elements at <b>the</b> blue end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequency <b>comb</b> output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, <b>the</b> frequency <b>comb</b> output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> and <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|R
