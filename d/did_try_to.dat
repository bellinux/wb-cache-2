25|$|Since President Lincoln had {{approved}} the Red River Campaign plan before promoting Ulysses Grant to Lieutenant-General and appointed him General-in-Chief, Grant {{felt he could}} not stop the campaign. Grant <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hurry its execution because {{he would have preferred}} to use a 10,000man force which was diverted to the campaign to reinforce Major-General William Sherman in Sherman's drive from north Georgia to Atlanta. Grant also {{would have liked to have}} pinned down more Confederate troops in Alabama with an attack on the Confederate stronghold at Mobile.|$|E
25|$|The {{initials}} GWR have {{an association}} with the Great Western Railway especially in the South West of England, {{and there is a}} popular misconception with listeners that the station stands for Great Western Radio. Indeed, neighbouring GWR Wiltshire was called Wiltshire Radio (WR) before its merger with Radio West. However, according to group management, the letters GWR did not stand for anything. In fact the station management at the time <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> secure the name Great Western Radio, however it was already the trading name of a Bristol electronics shop, who refused to relinquish the title.|$|E

25|$|The {{two sisters}} were {{committed}} to their studies {{and by the end}} of the term had attained such competence in French that Madame Héger made a proposal for both to stay another half-year, even offering to dismiss the English master, according to Charlotte, so that she could take his place, while Emily was to teach music as she had by that time become a competent piano teacher. However, the illness and death of their aunt meant that they returned to Haworth and though they <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> open a school at their home, they were unable to attract students to the remote area.|$|E
25|$|Those Australian {{producers}} who <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break into TV faced almost insurmountable challenges. Imported American and British programs benefited from high budgets, an international talent pool and huge economies of scale, {{thanks to their}} very large domestic markets (relative to Australia), established worldwide distribution networks; additionally, since most American production houses and networks were based in Los Angeles, they had access to resources and expertise built up over decades by the Hollywood movie studios. These disadvantages were further exacerbated {{by the fact that}} American producers and networks offered Australian channels significant discount rates on bundled programming. Taken as a whole, these factors meant that local producers were faced with a relative production-cost ratio on the order of 10:1 or more in favour of the imported product.|$|E
25|$|Robert Neville is the {{apparent}} sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism. It {{is said that}} the pandemic {{was caused by a}} war, and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population. The narrative details Neville's daily life in Los Angeles as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease, to which he is immune. Neville's past is revealed through flashbacks; the disease claimed his wife and daughter, and he was forced to kill his wife after she seemingly rose from the dead as a vampire and attacked him. Before he killed her, Neville says he <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep her with him but gives no details about this.|$|E

25|$|The stocky, redheaded Cosier was a middle-order batsman {{who often}} {{attacked}} the bowling when a more judicious method was {{the order of}} the day. Given an extended trial at international level over four seasons, he never really established himself as a Test batsman, although he was vice-captain of Australia for a brief period. He had two major highlights at Test level – a hundred on his Test debut at Melbourne against the West Indies in 1975–76, and a 168 against Pakistan the following season. Test bowlers were quick to exploit his technical deficiencies, in particular a very short backlift and abbreviated footwork. Cosier was all brute force with little finesse, but he <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> modify his technique somewhat during the 1978–79 Ashes series, when he was incongruously used as an opener.|$|E
25|$|During the Holocaust Europe's Jews {{were cut}} off from and disowned by the outside world. Jews were {{systematically}} impoverished, starved and murdered. Where Jews <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fight the Nazis, Zionists were prominent in the resistance. However those fighting {{never had a chance}} of success, and were always bloodily suppressed by the Nazis. The only instances where Jews had been successful, were when they fought in the woods as partisans, for example the Bielski partisans, a group of 1213 Jews who survived the whole war while making trouble for the Nazis. Nazi allies Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Croatia (mainly Romania) were {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least 10% of the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. Axis governments, local police forces and local volunteers across Europe played a critical role in rounding up or executing Jews for the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|The trio {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on October 28, 2013 that, due to their touring schedule and Braille and Odd Thomas's responsibilities as the owners of Humble Beast, they were delayed in completing their second album. For the recording, they stayed within the basic sound exhibited on Satellite Kite. Courtland Urbano in an interview stated that he personally dislikes an artist drastically changing style from their first to second album. However, the group <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> build upon and progress from its previous work. On Instruments of Mercy, Urbano avoided computer generated sounds entirely, instead using only live instrumentation, analog synthesizers, and natural found sounds. The album features sound effects such as dripping water, dial tones, wind chimes, rain, chirping birds, footsteps, and rustling leaves, and instrumentation such as electric and acoustic guitar, tambourine, drums, xylophone, piano, keyboard, strings, and glockenspiel.|$|E

25|$|The authors <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> verify Maha Yazawin's dates {{which did}} not agree with those given in Zatadawbon Yazawin. Maha Yazawin's dates for Pagan Dynasty were off by as much as 42 years from Zata (for the {{accession}} date of Anawrahta). Earlier historians had already tried to reconcile the glaring differences between the two prior chronicles. In 1798, Yazawin Thit tried to bridge the gap; its dates are about 15 more years closer to Zata's dates but still 27 years off. (Zata's dates later {{turned out to be the}} most accurate based on inscriptional evidence.) The authors of Hmannan chose to stay with Yazawin Thit's dates for the most part with just a few minor tweaks as seen in the table below. It shows a comparison of the regnal dates of the early Pagan kings (from Pyinbya, the fortifier of Pagan, according to the chronicles) as reported in the three chronicles.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} nationalists opposed intervention, {{particularly}} within {{states that the}} nationalists were hostile to. Although {{the vast majority of}} Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced Irish nationalists staunchly opposed taking part. The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912 and, by July 1914, there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain. The UK government placed Ireland under martial law in response to the Easter Rising; although, once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make concessions to nationalist feeling. However, opposition to involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 1943, the Scholls {{brought a}} {{suitcase}} full of leaflets {{to the university}} main building. They hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find {{when they left the}} lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls noticed that there were some left-over copies in the suitcase and decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmied. Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into Gestapo custody. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl {{at the time of his}} arrest by the Gestapo. While Sophie Scholl got rid of incriminating evidence before being taken into custody, Hans <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and trying to swallow it down. However, the Gestapo recovered enough of it and were able to match the handwriting with other writings from Probst, which they found when they searched Hans's apartment.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo {{was created}} in 1847, and Bishop John Timon, its first prelate, {{immediately}} saw {{the lack of an}} organized healthcare system in the City of Buffalo. There were some private clinics, but no large central hospital, public or private. The city's mainly Protestant and nativist leadership, of whom John C. Lord was the de facto leader did not adequately address the healthcare needs of the rapidly growing and mostly Catholic working class, partly due to prejudice. Some <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> establish a Protestant hospital, but efforts faded away for lack of popular interest. Bishop Timon took efforts into his own hands, traveling to Baltimore in March 1848, seeking a religious order to administer the new hospital. The Sisters of Charity (now known as the Daughters of Charity) agreed to the task, and on 3 June 1848, eight Sisters of Charity, Sisters Ursula Mattingly, Ann de Sales Farren, Hieronimo O'Brien, Anacaria Hoey, Clare McDurby, Mary Aloysia Lilly, Mary Eliza Dougherty, and Agatha O'Keefe, arrived in Buffalo. On 1 October 1848, Sisters of Charity Hospital officially opened as the city's first large healthcare facility, under the leadership of Sister Ursula Mattingly, DC. The first patients were a group of six sailors.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} {{localized}} by Aksys Games; Chunsoft {{was first introduced}} to Aksys through Spike, when Chunsoft {{was looking for a}} company that could publish the first game in the United States. During Aksys' evaluation period of it, many people at the company did not believe in the game and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. Eventually, they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company. They worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting to make dialogue sound like what a native speaker would say rather than strictly adhering to the Japanese wording. Ben Bateman, the editor of the first two games' localizations, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, examining it line by line or scene by scene, rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same idea in English. Most parts of the games that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese versions, but a different one; Bateman <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make similar types of jokes with similar contents and ideas. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add to the writing, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
500|$|Libby was not {{originally}} {{going to}} be killed off, but since Ana Lucia Cortez was considered an unpopular character, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans. They decided [...] Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. Additionally the producers and writers ran out of ideas for a compelling storyline for the character. According to Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof, the writers <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> develop her story through her romance with Hurley but they ran out of possible avenues for the character. The writers also thought her story was not as dramatic when juxtaposed with the other characters.|$|E

Peters worked with the New York chapter of the Mattachine Society to secure interviews with two additional gay subjects, Lars Larson and Jack Nichols, {{both of whom were}} fully accepting of their sexuality. Nichols later recalled his encounter with Wallace: [...] Peters added more footage of psychiatrists espousing that model along with scenes from the 1965 convention of the East Coast Homophile Organizations. CBS gave final approval to [...] "The Homosexuals" [...] and scheduled it to air in the spring of 1966.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the pet frogs of Potter's youth, influences on Jeremy include Potter's sport fishing father Rupert William Potter and illustrator Randolph Caldecott. Margaret Lane, author of The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter, notes, [...] "Mr. Potter was fond of taking his friends fishing and Beatrix ... {{from an early age}} had been familiar with [...] hazards and excitements of angling and dry-fly fishing ... as a girl [...] had often enough had to endure her father and his friends relating their fishing adventures, and the picture of Mr Jeremy Fisher retailing his mishap to Sir Isaac Newton is so rich in observation, both of amphibians and elderly gentlemen, that one is ever afterwards prone to confuse them in memory". Mr. Potter not only fished for sport but collected the works of Randolph Caldecott. In Jeremy Fisher, Potter tried to copy Caldecott but felt she had failed. [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> copy Caldecott," [...] she stated, [...] "but ... I did not achieve much resemblance." [...] Biographer Linda Lear writes Potter declared, [...] "I have the greatest admiration for his work [...] a jealous appreciation; for I think that others, whose names are commonly bracketed with his, are not on the same plane at all as artist-illustrators".|$|E
