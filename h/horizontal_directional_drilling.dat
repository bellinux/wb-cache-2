5000|$|Michels Corporation {{was founded}} as Michels Pipeline Construction, Inc., but {{changed its name}} in 2001 to better reflect its utility {{construction}} services. As of 2015, Michels Corporation was ranked No. 33 on the Engineering News-Record Top 400 Contractors list. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, Michels Directional Crossings won Project of the Year honors from Trenchless Technology magazine in the new installation category for its notable <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drill</b> projects.|$|R
50|$|Many {{prerequisites}} enabled this {{suite of}} technologies to become productive. Probably, the first requirement was {{the realization that}} oil wells, or water wells, are not necessarily vertical. This realization was quite slow, and did not really grasp {{the attention of the}} oil industry until the late 1920s when there were several lawsuits alleging that wells drilled from a rig on one property had crossed the boundary and were penetrating a reservoir on an adjacent property. Initially, proxy evidence such as production changes in other wells was accepted, but such cases fueled the development of small diameter tools capable of surveying wells during <b>drilling.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drill</b> rigs are developing towards large-scale, micro-miniaturization, mechanical automation, hard stratum working, exceeding length and depth oriented monitored drilling.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Ground {{penetrating}} radar {{technology is}} used to provide a fast and accurate method for target location compare to other geophysical sensing techniques. An existing ground penetrating radar system developed by Open Fuel (Pty) Ltd {{is used in the}} detection and avoidance of obstacles for a sub-surface <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drill</b> mechanism. This ground penetrating radar system could be implemented as a portable surface-based version of the system for geophysical applications. A factor limiting its implementation is a personal or a laptop computer required to execute the human-machine interface software package for the radar system. Thus, there exists a need to produce a radar user interface to replace the computer required by the current ground penetrating radar system, while maintaining the original functionality of the radar system, while maintaining the original functionality of the radar system. The purpose of this design project was to develop a user interface for a ground penetrating radar system in hardware. The radar user interface had to allow for the autonomous operation of the ground penetrating radar system and the human-machine interface application software. abstrac...|$|R

40|$|The Greater Green River Basin (GGRB) of Wyoming has {{produced}} abundant {{oil and gas}} out of multiple reservoirs for over 60 years, and large quantities of gas remain untapped in tight gas sandstone reservoirs. Even though GGRB production {{has been established in}} formations from the Paleozoic to the Tertiary, recent activity has focused on several Cretaceous reservoirs. Two of these formations, the Ahnond and the Frontier Formations, have been classified as tight sands and are prolific producers in the GGRB. The formations typically naturally fractured and have been exploited using conventional well technology. In most cases, hydraulic fracture treatments must be performed when completing these wells to to increase gas production rates to economic levels. The objectives of the GGRB production improvement project were to apply the concept of <b>horizontal</b> and <b>directional</b> <b>drilling</b> to the Second Frontier Formation on the western flank of the Rock Springs Uplift and to compare production improvements by drilling, completing, and testing vertical, horizontal and directionally-drilled wellbores at a common site...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic hammers {{have been}} {{extensively}} applied to <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> well <b>drilling</b> in hard rock formations. However, the service {{life of a}} hydraulic hammer is still unsatisfactory due to the heavy wear or abrasion of the horizontal anvil, {{which leads to the}} failure and the reduction of service life in <b>directional</b> well <b>drilling.</b> In order to improve the performance life of a hydraulic hammer, the new type of anvil with a horizontal oriented slider has been designed. The abrasion property of the horizontal oriented slider have been numerically simulated and analyzed by Finite Element Analysis. Simulation and experimental results have shown that the abrasion rate exponentially varies with the mass of the anvil and the friction coefficient of horizontal oriented slider, nevertheless the abrasion rate of horizontal anvil is almost logarithmically varies with moving velocity of oriented slider. The maximum abrasion rate of horizontal oriented sliders will exceed 4 % while moving velocity of the horizontal anvil is larger than 3 m/s. While the mass of the anvil is 100 kg, the maximum abrasion rate of horizontal oriented slider is 7. 5 ?. However, the maximum abrasion rate of a horizontal oriented slider will be up to 16. 5 % while the friction coefficient is more than 0. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, Michels began a {{new method}} known as <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drilling</b> to {{construct}} underground utilities. The company expanded on this when it designed and manufactured {{the most powerful}} directional drilling rig to date in 1996. The rig was called [...] "Hercules-1200" [...] for its 1,200,000 pounds of push/pullback.|$|E
50|$|Directional {{drilling}} (or slant drilling) is {{the practice}} of drilling non-vertical wells. It {{can be broken down}} into four main groups: oilfield directional drilling, utility installation directional drilling (<b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drilling),</b> directional boring, and surface in seam (SIS), which horizontally intersects a vertical well target to extract coal bed methane.|$|E
50|$|Ditch Witch® {{remains a}} leader in the {{industry}} it essentially created.

50|$|The {{ability of}} a bit design to satisfy the two primary goals is {{constrained}} {{by a number of}} factors, most importantly the wellbore diameter. Other constraints are dictated by its intended use: formation type (hardness, plasticity, abrasiveness) to be drilled, operating environment at depth (temperature, pressure, corrosiveness), the capabilities of the equipment used in the operation (rotating speed, available weight on bit, pump horsepower) and the angle of the wellbore (vertical, <b>directional,</b> <b>horizontal).</b> Modern <b>drill</b> bit designs try to balance these constraints to achieve the primary goals.|$|R
40|$|The project {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} measurements-while-drilling (MWD) module that provides real-time reports of drilling conditions at the bit. The module is to support multiple types of sensors and to sample and encode their outputs in digital form under microprocessor control. The assembled message is to be electromagnetically transmitted along the drill string back to its associated receiver located in a collar typically 50 [...] 100 feet above the bit. The receiver demodulates the transmitted message and passes it data to the third party wireline or MWD telemetry system for relay to the surface. The collar also houses the conventional MWD or wireline probe assembly. The completed Phase 1 program began with the preparation of detailed performance specifications and ended with the design, fabrication and testing of a functioning prototype. The prototype was sized for operation with 6 - 3 / 4 -inch multi-lobe mud motors due to the widespread use of this size motor in <b>horizontal</b> and <b>directional</b> <b>drilling</b> applications. The Phase 1 prototype provided inclination, temperature and pressure information. The Phase 2 program {{objective is to}} expand the current sensor suite to include at least one type of formation evaluation measurement, such as formation resistivity or natural gamma ray. The Near-Bit system will be subjected to a vigorous series of shock and vibration tests followed by field testing to ensure it possesses the reliability and performance required for commercial success...|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s while GO was {{developing}} other {{new technologies and}} breaking into markets, which included Venezuela, Africa, and the North Sea, the domestic oil and gas business was starting to escalate. With a fleet of wireline units that now numbered in the hundreds, Gearhart continued to branch out and had visions {{of a company that}} offered a complete package. GO wanted to offer energy producers a line of services that included wireline services, perforating, drilling services, core analysis, seismic services and so on. Fort Worth had now become a research and development center. Gearhart researchers were concentrating on a new technology called Measure While Drilling (MWD). This new product was being developed for market by the same team that had given life to DDL earlier. MWD was what made controlled <b>directional</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> possible. MWD saved time and money over the traditional methods of wireline logging by eliminating the wireline. After a few years of testing, Gearhart and its Canadian affiliate, Computalog, were gaining advances over their competition.|$|R

5000|$|A {{tunnel boring}} machine (TBM), {{also known as a}} [...] "mole", is a machine used to {{excavate}} tunnels with a circular cross section through a variety of soil and rock strata. They may also be used for microtunneling. They can bore through anything from hard rock to sand. Tunnel diameters can range from a metre (done with micro-TBMs) to 19.25 metres to date. Tunnels of less than a metre or so in diameter are typically done using trenchless construction methods or <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drilling</b> rather than TBMs.|$|E

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to trenching, loops may be laid by mini <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drilling</b> (mini-HDD). This technique can lay piping under yards, driveways, gardens or other structures without disturbing them, with a cost between those of trenching and vertical drilling. This system also differs from horizontal & vertical drilling as the loops are installed from one central chamber, further reducing the ground space needed. Radial drilling is often installed retroactively (after the property has been built) due to the small nature of the equipment used {{and the ability to}} bore beneath existing constructions.|$|E
50|$|Trenchless {{construction}} {{includes such}} construction methods as tunneling, microtunneling (MTM), <b>horizontal</b> <b>directional</b> <b>drilling</b> (HDD) {{also known as}} directional boring, pipe ramming (PR), pipe jacking (PJ), moling, horizontal auger boring (HAB) and other methods for the installation of pipelines and cables below the ground with minimal excavation. Large diameter tunnels such as those constructed by a tunnel boring machine (TBM), and drilling and blasting techniques are larger versions of subsurface construction. The difference between trenchless and other subsurface construction techniques depends upon {{the size of the}} passage under construction.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Alois Gruber senior {{laid the}} {{foundations}} of AGRU’s future in engineered plastics with the decision to begin production of plastic pipes.
