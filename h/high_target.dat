25|$|In December 2012, {{during the}} tour of Pakistani cricket team in India in 2012–13, he came across as a very {{different}} and aggressive batsman and scored so brilliantly and briskely and helped Pakistan to win the first T20I and 2nd ODI with his heroics of brilliant batting and nearly chasing a mountain <b>high</b> <b>target</b> of 191 in the second T20I. His scores were 61 and 55 in first and second T20I respectively and scored 76 runs in the 2nd ODI and sharing an opening stand of 141 with Nasir Jamshed and also bowled brilliantly as always economically to help Pakistan win their first ODI series in India since 7 years. He is now {{considered to be the}} main allrounder of Pakistan Cricket team. He had a great series against Sri Lanka in Dec 2013, where he scored 122 in the first match, 140* in the third and 113* in the fourth match. Thus he became, the second batsman after Zaheer Abbas to score 3 centuries in an ODI series. Hafeez was initially selected in the Pakistan squad for the 2015 World Cup but was ruled out 6 days before the World Cup due to a calf injury. He was replaced by Nasir Jamshed.|$|E

40|$|The {{formalism}} {{for evaluating}} first strike costs and incentives for military targeting generalize to include <b>higher</b> value <b>targets.</b> That introduces two new allocations {{to the usual}} allocation between missiles and military targets, {{but they can be}} performed analytically. As the number of weapons on each side decreases, the optimal fraction of second strike weapons allocated to military values falls. The shift to <b>high</b> value <b>targets</b> is more pronounced below about 1, 000 weapons for nominal parameters. Below 500 weapons the first striker's cost of action drops below its cost of inaction. A strike would induce a second strike of about 250 weapons on <b>high</b> value <b>targets.</b> An increase in the first striker's preference for damage to the other's <b>high</b> value <b>targets</b> increases or a decrease in its preference for preventing damage to its own <b>high</b> value <b>targets</b> decreases first strike costs and stability margins. Including defenses complicates allocations slightly. The main effect is increased attrition of second strikes, particularly at larger defenses, which makes it possible to significantly reduce damage to <b>high</b> value <b>targets.</b> At 1, 000 weapons, by 300 to 400 interceptors the first striker's costs are reduced to 30 % below that of inaction and the number of weapons delivered on the first striker's <b>high</b> value <b>targets</b> is reduced to about 100...|$|R

40|$|Considering the ination {{targeting}} regime, we appraise how {{the target}} level {{should be set}} {{in the presence of}} uncertainty about the commitment strength. First, based on a concise framework, where condence crises and imperfect information are neglected, we conclude that a <b>higher</b> <b>target</b> for ination increases the credibility in the precommitment. Optimal <b>target</b> is <b>higher</b> than the one obtained using the Cukierman-Liviatan [5] model, where the increasing credibility effect is not considered. Second, extending the model to make condence crises possible, multiple equilibria solutions become possible too. In this case, <b>higher</b> <b>targets</b> for ination may increase the probability of above the target ination. On the other hand, multiple (bad) equilibria may be avoided. The optimal target depends on the likelihood of each equilibrium to be selected and on the policymaker's willingness to avoid a condence crisis. Finally, uniqueness is ensured when common knowledge is perturbed, even considering spec-ulative attacks, as in Morris-Shin[6]. The rst result is also recovered, i. e. a <b>higher</b> <b>target</b> for ination increases the credibility in the precommitment. Adding a precise public signal, self-fullling actions and equilibrium multiplicity may still exist for some lack of common knowledge (as in Angeletos and Werning[1]). In this case, <b>higher</b> <b>targets</b> for ination may increase the prob-ability of above the target ination again, reducing the policymaker's credibility. From another aspect, multiple (bad) equilibria may be avoided. The optimal target depends on the likelihood of each equilibrium to be selected and on the policymaker's willingness to avoid a condence crisis. Results also indicate that more precise public information may open the door to bad equilibrium, contrary to the conventional wisdom that more central bank transparency is always good when an ination targeting regime is considered.

50|$|At some point, {{there is}} a {{sustained}} increase in some type of spending for some reason. (One reason may simply be that, once inventories sink to their desired level, there stops being negative intended inventory investment, which goes up from negative to zero; but again {{there may be other}} reasons as well.) At this point there is negative unintended inventory investment as firms are caught by surprise by the external increase in demand and they fail to simultaneously raise their production. Now inventories are too low, again for two reasons, and we are back where we started in the cycle. The recession has bottomed out, sustained spending is once again <b>high,</b> <b>target</b> inventory levels are higher than actual inventory levels, and intended inventory investment is positive.|$|E

Geodetic positioning work with cameras was usually performed with one camera observing simultaneously with one or more other cameras. Camera systems are weather dependent and that is one major reason why they fell out of use by the 1980s.|$|E
