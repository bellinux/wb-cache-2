He briefly served in the War of 1812, then returned to Kentucky and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 1813. He was re-elected to a second term, though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816. Allied with Kentucky's Debt Relief Party, he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817; in 1821, he accepted Governor John Adair's appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky.

25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> fact).|$|E

25|$|In 1944, as he attacks a Hydra {{base in the}} Nazi-occupied Danish Straits, Steve Rogers recalls {{parts of}} his life that got <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point: his mother's blessing to become a soldier; {{his first meeting with}} Bucky Barnes, who {{protected}} him from bullies as a boy; the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, when Bucky and Steve decided to enlist; Bucky training Steve to pass the physical; and the point when Bucky passed the physical but Steve failed. Johann Schmidt watches Rogers fight, and recalls how he got to this point: meeting Adolf Hitler; capturing Arnim Zola to research creating super soldiers; and finding Abraham Erskine and blackmailing him into continuing his super soldier research under the employ of the Nazis. Howard Stark, via radio, assists Rogers, remembering when he was recruited by Colonel Phillips to join the Strategic Scientific Reserve, and when he helped Peggy Carter rescue Erskine from Schmidt. Dum Dum Dugan and the Howling Commandos arrive to assist Rogers, and they remember their formation—thrust together in a Hydra work camp, forming close friendships after a failed escape attempt. After they defeat the Hydra soldiers, Rogers destroys Schmidt's main weapon at the base, an Asgardian artifact.|$|E

Meanwhile, House begins to regret recruiting former CIA doctor Samira Terzi (Michael Michele) when she fails to demonstrate the intelligence he witnessed at Langley. Wilson, who believes that House is being distracted by Terzi's looks, offers up the solution to quickly fire her and then ask her out on a date. He also notes House's propensity to hire attractive women, which led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> situation. House argues that he's [...] "not that guy"; Wilson retorts [...] "every guy is that guy".
