5|$|From 1855 to 1907, the {{position}} of <b>first</b> <b>minister</b> was known as Premier. After the colony was granted dominion status, {{the position}} became known as Prime Minister. Democratic government was suspended in 1934 and replaced by an appointed Commission of Government, until 1949 Newfoundland became a province of Canada. Since the reinstitution of democratic government in 1949, {{the position of}} <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> has been known as Premier.|$|E
5|$|Several {{procedures}} {{enable the}} Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> {{or members of}} the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary year, the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> on issues related to the substance of the statement.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral {{legislature}} with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and {{are elected}} {{on a first}} past the post system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. MSPs serve for a four-year period (exceptionally five years from 2011–16). The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the Monarch to serve as <b>First</b> <b>Minister.</b> Other ministers are appointed by the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of the devolved government. The Scottish Government is headed by the <b>First</b> <b>Minister,</b> who is accountable to the Scottish Parliament and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the Deputy <b>First</b> <b>Minister,</b> currently John Swinney MSP, who deputises for the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> {{during a period of}} absence of overseas visits. Alongside the Deputy First Minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet ministerial responsibility. Swinney is also currently Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills. The Scottish Government's cabinet comprises nine cabinet secretaries, who form the Cabinet of Scotland. There are also twelve other ministers, who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas. As a result, junior ministers do not attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
5|$|The party, or parties, {{that hold}} the {{majority}} of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> {{from a number of}} candidates {{at the beginning of each}} parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be <b>First</b> <b>Minister,</b> and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as <b>First</b> <b>Minister,</b> and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the <b>First</b> <b>Minister.</b> Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|The monarch has {{a similar}} {{relationship}} with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Sovereign appoints the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales. In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts {{on the advice of}} the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The Sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> and deputy <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E
