5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, the <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> been on {{creating}} {{an awareness of}} the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge College {{was built}} as Scotland's first {{college in the}} late 19th century. As Coatbridge has {{moved away from the}} {{traditional}} heavy industries the teaching <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> shifted from traditional industry courses towards commerce, care and the arts. St Ambrose, St Andrew's and Coatbridge High are the best-known secondary schools serving Coatbridge. The first two are Roman Catholic. St Ambrose was the subject of an HMI follow-up assessment visit in January 2009. Sports journalist and broadcaster Bob Crampsey was formerly headmaster of St Ambrose. Singer and television presenter Michelle McManus is a former pupil of the school. Prominent football referee Willie Collum taught religious education at St Ambrose in the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the CRNC officially {{left the}} control of the RNC by reconstituting as a 527 group, {{allowing}} it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount of money for issue-advocacy work. As a 527 group, the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> turned towards developing volunteers and other support activities rather than outright campaigning. The shift has allowed the CRNC to vastly expand its fundraising efforts. During its first two years, the CRNC raised $17.3 million, most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs, while leaving more than $2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the full-time positions.|$|E

5|$|Recent <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> been {{to reduce}} therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed {{the hypothesis that}} therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those patients with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes {{as well as for}} those who lack early response to treatment.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
