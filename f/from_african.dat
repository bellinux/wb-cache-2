5|$|In Basse Casamance, {{the rice}} cycle {{structures}} {{the lives of}} the population and plays a central economic and religious role. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, show them to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, <b>from</b> <b>African</b> rice to Asian rice, a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings <b>from</b> <b>African</b> American English.|$|E
5|$|Omar Daher Gadid was {{the only}} male athlete {{competing}} for Djibouti at the 2000 Summer Olympics, competed in the men's marathon on 1 October. In a field of 100 runners, 19 did not complete the race including Gadid. The medals were shared between athletes <b>from</b> <b>African</b> nations with the gold and bronze going to Ethiopia's Gezahgne Abera (two hours, ten minutes and 11 seconds) and Tesfaye Tola (two hours, 11 minutes and ten seconds) respectively, and the silver won by Eric Wainaina from Kenya (two hours, ten minutes and 31 seconds).|$|E

5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended <b>from</b> <b>African</b> slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E
5|$|By late 1988, the Pioneer Square station {{structure}} was 70 percent complete, and work had begun on the station's entrances and the vaulted ceiling. The station {{was the subject}} of two controversies during its construction over the use of South African materials in its construction, as the country was then under a Metro boycott for its Apartheid policies. In late 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham was forced to remove steel beams used for temporary shoring at the station box after unknowingly sourcing it from South Africa. Metro later acquired South African black granite {{to be used in the}} station's platform and mezzanine, which was discovered and returned; the incident resulted in the resignation of Metro's executive director, amid outcry <b>from</b> <b>African</b> American leaders.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights activists}} had {{previously}} alleged, and on February 28, 2017 investigative journalism reported confirmation, that child labor {{is used in}} {{a portion of the}} worldwide supply of cobalt sourced <b>from</b> <b>African</b> artisanal mines. This revelation prompted cell phone maker Apple Inc., on March 3, 2017, to stop buying the ore from suppliers such as Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt who source from artisanal mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and only using suppliers that are verified to meet its workplace standards. In 2017, some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of Cobalt, Ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) {{was formed}} by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local {{interests}} to the British government. In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern Rhodesia in what was the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, often called the Central African Federation (CAF), for mainly political reasons. Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition <b>from</b> <b>African</b> nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. Hastings Banda, a European-trained doctor working in Ghana who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda {{was elected president of}} the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} Portuguese {{settlement}} efforts was launched {{for the purpose}} of territorial conquest. It is true that both gradually came to occupy and farm a broad area around their initial bridgeheads (in the case of Luanda, mostly along the lower Kwanza River). However, their main function was trade – overwhelmingly the slave trade. Slaves were bought <b>from</b> <b>African</b> intermediaries and sold to Brazil and the Caribbean. In addition, Benguela developed a commerce in ivory, wax, and honey, which they bought from Ovimbundu caravans which fetched these goods from among the Ganguela peoples {{in the eastern part of}} what is now Angola.|$|E
5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed {{the possibility of}} an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena's presence <b>from</b> <b>African</b> deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude {{the possibility of an}} Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first spotted hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1.3–1.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of hyenas in Europe and a separation of African spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population. The third spotted hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, {{with the exception of the}} leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.|$|E

25|$|These {{included}} excluding <b>Africans</b> <b>from</b> the West <b>African</b> Medical Service {{and saying}} that no European should take orders <b>from</b> an <b>African,</b> which {{had the effect of}} ruling out <b>African</b> doctors <b>from</b> serving with the army.

5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made <b>from</b> <b>African</b> hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{activity}} in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis <b>from</b> <b>African</b> tropical waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.|$|E
