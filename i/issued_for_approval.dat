40|$|Addressing {{climate change}} {{has become a}} common issue {{around the world in}} the 21 st century and equally an {{important}} mission in Chinese forestry. Understanding the development of monitoring and assessment of forest biomass and carbon storage in China is important for promoting the evaluation of forest carbon sequestration capacity of China. The author conducts a systematic analysis of domestic publications addressing “monitoring and assessment of forest biomass and carbon storage” {{in order to understand the}} development trends, describes the brief history through three stages, and gives the situation of new development. Towards the end of the 20 th century, a large number of papers on biomass and productivity of the major forest types in China had been published, covering the exploration and efforts of more than 20 years, while investigations into assessment of forest carbon storage had barely begun. Based on the data of the 7 th and 8 th National Forest Inventories, forest biomass and carbon storage of the entire country were assessed using individual tree biomass models and carbon conversion factors of major tree species, both previously published and newly developed. Accompanying the implementation of the 8 th National Forest Inventory, a program of individual tree biomass modeling for major tree species in China was carried out simultaneously. By means of thematic research on classification of modeling populations, as well as procedures for collecting samples and methodology for biomass modeling, two technical regulations on sample collection and model construction were published as ministerial standards for application. Requests for approval of individual tree biomass models and carbon accounting parameters of major tree species have been <b>issued</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> as ministerial standards. With the improvement of biomass models and carbon accounting parameters, thematic assessment of forest biomass and carbon storage will be gradually changed into a general monitoring of forest biomass and carbon storage, in order to realize their dynamic monitoring in national forest inventories. Strengthening the analysis and assessment of spatial distribution patterns of forest biomass and carbon storage through application of remote sensing techniques and geostatistical approaches will also be one of the major directions of development in the near future...|$|E

40|$|When {{settling}} up {{spatial development}} for a construction, development of building land {{is a very}} demanding activity, one that enables the transition from un-build up areas to built-up areas. Spatial development for construction is read as assurance (provision) for such infrastructure, which is required {{to ensure that the}} designed spatial development will serve it's purpose. Legislation on settling up spatial development for construction in areas in Slovenia dating from 1931 to 2005 has been collected and analyzed. Many changes have occurred in these areas and in their respective terminologies. Especially the law on building up the land from the year 1984, its later instruction and the 4 th part of the currently valid law on settling up environment: Spatial development for construction has been analyzed. Contents for getting assurance for spatial development with infrastructure according to the law of Building areas from 1984 and by the Law Building areas from 1997 are extended. With the law on settling up a spatial from 2002 and its subsequent corrections, spatial development for construction is becoming an integral part of settling up the spatial, also gaining influence on spatial planning, above all in rational spatial development. Legally formal, from 1977 on, developed land has been a precondition <b>for</b> <b>issue</b> of <b>approval</b> <b>for</b> construction. ...|$|R
