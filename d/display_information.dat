The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000. It then was donated to the Edison Association of Illuminating Companies. The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The <b>display</b> <b>information</b> for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years. In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to <b>display</b> <b>information</b> quickly showing the {{analysis}} of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E

5|$|Map-making in China {{preceded the}} Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE– 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and <b>display</b> <b>information</b> on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|E

25|$|A recent area of {{research}} is {{in the field of}} bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can <b>display</b> <b>information</b> beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Evans & Sutherland (E) {{decoupled}} their PS300 graphics processor/display, which contained its own <b>display</b> <b>information</b> transformable through a dataflow architecture. Complex graphical objects could be downloaded over a serial line (e.g. 9600, 56K baud) or Ethernet interface and then manipulated without {{impact on the}} host. The architecture was excellent for high performance display but very inconvenient for domain-specific calculations, such as electron-density fitting and energy calculations. Many crystallographers and modellers spent arduous months trying to fit such activities into this architecture. E designed a card for the PS-300 which had several calculation algorithms using a 100 bit wide finite state machine {{in an attempt to}} simplify this process but it was so difficult to program that it quickly became obsolete.|$|E

An array of dials and switches are mounted {{on either side of}} a centrally placed CRT monitor, controlling the navigational, communications, and weapons-control computers. BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar <b>Display</b> <b>Information</b> System (TARDIS), a [...] multi-function display, to replace the rear cockpit's Combined Radar and Projected Map Display; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004.|$|E
500|$|System Shock {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The game is set inside a large, multi-level space station, in which players explore, combat enemies and solve puzzles. Progress is largely non-linear {{and the game}} is designed to allow for emergent gameplay. As in , the player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons, to interact with objects and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. View and posture controls on the HUD allow the player to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, and crawl. Practical uses for these actions include taking cover, retrieving items from beneath the player character and navigating small passages, respectively. The HUD also features three [...] "Multi-Function Displays", which may be configured to <b>display</b> <b>information</b> such as weapon readouts, an automap and an inventory.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 767 {{flight deck}} uses six Rockwell Collins CRT screens to display Electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) information, allowing pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously {{performed by the}} flight engineer. The CRTs replace conventional electromechanical instruments found on earlier aircraft. An enhanced flight management system, improved over versions used on early 747s, automates navigation and other functions, while an automatic landing system facilitates CAT IIIb instrument landings in low visibility situations. The 767 became the first aircraft to receive CAT IIIb certification from the FAA for landings with [...] minimum visibility in 1984. On the 767-400ER, the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the Next Generation 737. To retain operational commonality, the LCD screens can be programmed to <b>display</b> <b>information</b> {{in the same manner}} as earlier 767s. In 2012, Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787-based cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens that can display two windows each.|$|E

500|$|To {{improve the}} tank's firepower, the gun mount around the loader's turret hatch was {{modified}} {{to allow the}} installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5in) machine gun, while the main gun's firepower was augmented through {{the introduction of the}} new CETME437A armor-piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). [...] The gun's accuracy was improved through the installation of the new Mark9 modification A/D fire control system, designed by Hughes Aircraft Company. [...] The new system allowed firing during the day and during night operations, and increased the likelihood of a first round impact. [...] The fire control system was also modernized through the exchange of the old M282 gunner's periscope with a new periscope and a new [...] laser rangefinder. [...] A new ballistics computer, the NSC-800, was issued, as well as a new digital panel for the gunner, designed and manufactured by the Spanish company INISEL. [...] The tank commander also received a control unit that allowed the choice of ammunition for the gun and provided information on the ballistics of the round and the target to be engaged. [...] As a result, the loader received a presentation unit to <b>display</b> <b>information</b> on which round to load into the gun's breech and to communicate ballistic data received, including angular velocity, wind velocity, gun elevation and vehicle inclination. [...] The fire control system also allowed for the future upgrade to a more sophisticated stabilization system for the tank's main gun. [...] Survivability improvements included the addition of new steel side-skirts, a new smoke generating system linked to the engine and a new fire suppression system.|$|E
