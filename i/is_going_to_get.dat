500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with Howard Stern, Rollins {{was asked about}} rumors that he had Joe Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin – who was {{a fan of the}} Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album, The End of Silence, and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that {{they had a lot of}} money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: [...] "My place <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> popped." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1937–1938 film tie-in serial {{comic strip}} [...] "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" [...] written by Merrill De Maris, {{one of the}} writers of the film, is centred {{primarily}} around the relationship between Snow White and the Queen. It further explores {{the source of the}} Queen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to her castle seeking {{the most beautiful woman in}} all the world and is shocked when he says he meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the Queen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch form, she later tells the captive Prince that she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Snow White and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a [...] "miserable hag". This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much less dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept. The film was also adapted into an other comics including in 1969, 1983, and 1991.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
