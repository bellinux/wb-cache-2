40|$|The {{ability of}} {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) to {{establish}} lifelong latency in neurons suggests that HSV-derived vectors <b>hold</b> promise <b>for</b> gene <b>delivery</b> to the nervous system. However, vector toxicity and transgene silencing have created significant barriers to vector applications to the brain. Recently, we described a vector defective for all immediate-early gene expression and deleted for the joint region between the two unique genome segments that proved capable of extended transgene expression in non-neuronal cells. Sustained expression required the proximity of boundary elements from the latency locus. As confirmed here, we have also found that a transgene cassette introduced into the ICP 4 locus is highly active in neurons but silent in primary fibroblasts. Remarkably, we observed that removal of the virion host shutoff (vhs) gene further improved transgene expression in neurons without inducing expression of viral genes. In rat hippocampus, the vhs-deleted vector showed robust transgene expression exclusively in neurons for at least 1 month without evidence of toxicity or inflammation. This HSV vector design <b>holds</b> promise <b>for</b> gene <b>delivery</b> to the brain, including durable expression of large or complex transgene cassettes...|$|R
40|$|To tailor {{the erosion}} rate of polyanhydrides while {{retaining}} their surface erosion characteristics, new three-component polyanhydrides of sebacic acid, 1, 3 -bis(p -carboxyphenoxy) propane and poly(ethylene glycol) were synthesized. The hydrophilicity of the polymer increased and its mechanical strength decreased with increasing PEG content. Correspondingly, the erosion rate increases with increasing PEG content, whereas it decreases with increasing specimen thickness. This {{indicates that the}} incorporation of poly(ethylene glycol) into traditional two-component polyanhydrides retains their surface erosion properties while making the erosion rate tunable. The new polyanhydrides <b>hold</b> potential <b>for</b> drug <b>delivery</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|Although small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{treatment}} <b>holds</b> {{great promise}} <b>for</b> {{the treatment of}} cancers, the field has been held back by the availability of suitable <b>delivery</b> vehicles. <b>For</b> cervical cancer the E 6 and E 7 oncogenes are ideal siRNA targets for treatment. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to explore the potential of dendrosomes <b>for</b> the <b>delivery</b> of siRNA targeting E 6 and E 7 proteins of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Optimization of dendrimer generation and nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) ratio was carried out using dendrimer-fluorescein isothiocyanate oligo complexes. The optimized N/P ratios were used in formulating complexes between dendrimers and siRNA targeting green fluorescence protein (siGFP). Although formulation 4 D 100 (dendrimer-siRNA complex) displayed the highest GFP knockdown, it was also found to be highly toxic to cells. In the final formulation 4 D 100 was encapsulated into dendrosomes so as to mask these toxic effects. The optimized dendrosomal formulation (DF), DF 3 was found to possess a siGFP-entrapment efficiency of 49. 76 % ± 1. 62 %, vesicle size of 154 ± 1. 73 nm, and zeta potential of + 3. 21 ± 0. 07 mV. The GFP knockdown efficiency of DF 3 (dendrosome) was found to be almost identical to that of 4 D 100, but the former was completely nontoxic to the cells. DF 3 containing siRNA against E 6 and E 7 was found to knock down the target genes considerably, as compared with the other formulations tested. Our results imply that dendrosomes <b>hold</b> potential <b>for</b> the <b>delivery</b> of siRNA and that a suitable targeting strategy could be useful for applications in vivo. From the Clinical Editor: siRNA treatment <b>holds</b> great promise <b>for</b> the treatment of cancers, but overall, the availability of suitable delivery vehicles remains a major issue. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of dendrosomes <b>for</b> the <b>delivery</b> of siRNA targeting specific proteins in cervical cancer cells in vitro. The results suggest that dendrosomes <b>hold</b> potential <b>for</b> the <b>delivery</b> of siRNA and a suitable targeting strategy could be useful for applications in vivo. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} with a {{core size}} of 2 nm covalently coated with glycans to maintain solubility, targeting molecules for brain endothelium, and cargo molecules <b>hold</b> great potential <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> of therapies into the CNS. They have low toxicity, pass through brain endothelium in vitro and in vivo, and move rapidly through the brain parenchyma. Within minutes of infusion the nanoparticles {{can be detected}} in neurons and glia. These nanoparticles are relatively easy to synthesize in association with their surface ligands. They can be detected by electron microscopy, ICP-mass spectrometry, and spectroscopy. However, modification of the basic gold nanoparticle is required for in vivo imaging by MR or radioactive methods. Depending on their surface coat, the nanoparticles cross the brain endothelium by the plasma membrane/cytosolic route (passive transport) or by vesicular transcytosis (active transport). A primary aim of current research {{is to improve the}} biodistribution of the nanoparticles <b>for</b> CNS drug <b>delivery.</b> Smaller gold nanoparticles are removed rapidly via the kidney, while larger nanoparticles are taken up by mononuclear phagocytes in various tissues.

All the formulations (F 1 to F 6) were evaluated for the physicochemical parameters and were subjected to in vitro drug release studies. The amount of Ibuprofen released from tablets atdifferent time intervals was estimated by UV spectrophotometer. The formulation F 6 released 98. 34 % of Ibuprofen. The results of the study showed that formulation F 6 is most likely to provide targeting of Ibuprofen for local action in the colon owing to its minimal release of the drug in the first 5 h. The results of the presentstudy have demonstrated that the film coated tablet system is a promising vehicle for preventing rapid hydrolysis in gastric environment and improving oral bioavailability of Ibuprofen for the treatment of disease of colon region...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Previously, we {{have shown}} that the {{amphiphilic}} oligopeptide SA 2 (Ac-Ala-Ala-Val-Val-Leu-Leu-Leu-Trp-Glu-Glu-COOH) spontaneously self-assemble into nano-sized vesicles in aqueous environment. Relative weak individual intermolecular interactions dominate such oligopeptide assemblies. In this study we aimed at improving the stability of such peptide vesicles by covalently crosslinking the oligopeptide vesicles using disulfide bonds. Two and three cysteines were introduced in the SA 2 peptide sequence to allow crosslinking (Ac-Ala-Cys-Val-Cys-Leu-(Leu/Cys) -Leu-Trp-Glu-Glu-COOH). Results. Upon disulfide formation the crosslinked vesicles remained stable under conditions that disrupted the non-crosslinked peptide vesicles. The stabilized vesicles were more closely examined in terms of particle size (distribution) using atomic force microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy, as well as dynamic light scattering analysis, showing an average particle radius in number between 15 and 20 nm. Using entrapment of calcein it was shown that intermolecular crosslinking of peptides within the vesicles did not affect the permeability for calcein. Conclusion. Introduction of cysteines into the hydrophobic domain of the SA 2 amphiphilic oligopeptides is a feasible strategy for crosslinking the peptide vesicles. Such small crosslinked oligopeptide vesicles may <b>hold</b> promise <b>for</b> drug <b>delivery</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{synthetic}} nonviral vectors <b>hold</b> promise <b>for</b> the <b>delivery</b> of plasmid DNA, their gene-transfer efficiencies are {{far from}} matching those of viruses. To systematically investigate the structure–activity relationship of cationic lipids, a small library of cationic lipid–peptoid conjugates (lipitoids) was synthesized. The compounds were evaluated {{for their ability to}} form complexes with plasmid DNA and to mediate DNA transfer in vitro. Results: Lipid–peptoid conjugates were conveniently prepared in high yield using solid-phase synthesis. Several lipitoids condensed plasmid DNA into 100 nm spherical particles and protected the DNA from DNase digestion. A subset of lipitoids with a repeated (aminoethyl, neutral, neutral) sidechain trimer motif conjugated with dimyristoyl phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DMPE) mediated DNA transfer with high efficiency. Conclusions: Automated solid-phase synthesis of cationic lipids allowed the rapid synthesis of a diverse set of transfection reagents. The most active compound DMPE–(Nae–Nmpe–Nmpe) 3 (Nae, N-aminoethyl glycine; Nmpe, N-p-methoxyphenethyl-glycine) is more efficient than lipofectin or DMRIE-C (two commercial cationic lipid transfection reagents) and is active in the presence and absence of serum. The activity in the presence of serum suggests potential for applications in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{gastric cancer}} with serosal {{invasion}} is usually unresectable, so anticancer drugs are infused intravenously as a palliative treatment; however, patients with unresectable gastric cancer die {{within a few}} months after exploration, with or without palliative surgery. 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) is the cornerstone chemotherapy regimen for gastric cancer, having mild to moderate toxicity and response rate. 1) However, the activity of single agents, including 5 -FU, against gastric can-cer is approximately 20 % or less. 2) To improve the therapeu-tic effect of anticancer drugs on gastric cancer, intraarterial administration has been studied. 3, 4) When the anticancer drugs are administered via the vasculature route, however, they are distributed through the whole body via the blood stream, leading to inadequate delivery to target sites in the stomach, as well as potential toxicity in other organs. These circumstances underscore the need for novel and more effec-tive strategies for the treatment of gastric cancer. Thus, stomach- and site-selective drug delivery is a very important strategy for the optimization of chemotherapy in terms of efficacy and safety. We originally elucidated that phenol red, bromphenol blue, and bromosulphonphthalein as model drugs are adequately absorbed from the gastric serosal surface and accumulate site-selectively in the stomach in rats. 5, 6) Although the gastric serosal surface application of anticancer drugs <b>holds</b> promise <b>for</b> site-selective <b>delivery</b> in the stomach, {{little is known about the}} gastric and systemic distribution characteristics of anticancer drugs following application on the gastric serosal surface.
