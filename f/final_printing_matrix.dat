5000|$|To {{make each}} <b>final</b> color <b>print,</b> the <b>matrix</b> films were soaked in dye baths of colors {{nominally}} complementary {{to those of}} the camera filters: the strip made from red-filtered frames was dyed cyan-green and the strip made from green-filtered frames was dyed orange-red. The thicker the gelatin in each area of a frame, the more dye it absorbed. Each matrix in turn was pressed into contact with a plain gelatin-coated strip of film known as the [...] "blank" [...] and the gelatin [...] "imbibed" [...] the dye from the matrix. A mordant made from deacetylated chitin was applied to the blank before printing, to prevent the dyes from migrating or [...] "bleeding" [...] after they were absorbed.|$|R
