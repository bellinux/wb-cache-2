We briefly motivate the derivation of the model and show how to choose realistic boundary conditions {{to make the system}} well-posed. We firstly consider one-dimensional patterns and carry out a nonlinear perturbation analysis for the case where the uniform steady state is linearly unstable to a single mode. In two-dimensions, we show that if the displacement field in the model is represented as a sum of orthogonal parts, then the model can be decomposed into two sub-models, only one of which is capable of generating pattern. We thus focus on this particular sub-model. We present a nonlinear analysis of spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by the sub-model on a square domain and discuss mode interaction. Our analysis show that when a two-dimensional mode number admits two or more <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> pairs, the solution of the full nonlinear system of partial differential equations is a mixed mode solution in which all the <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> pairs are represented in a frequency locked oscillation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{the model and}} the {{experimental}} demonstration of a new optical resonator formed by inserting a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) in a closed fiber loop. The spectral characteristics of the ring depend on the reflectivity of the FBG. When the FBG reflectivity tends to zero, the overall resonant system exhibits the usual <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> conditions. On the other hand, when the reflection coefficient FBG is not vanishing, the spectral features of the resonator display split resonant modes associated to the degeneracy removal of two counterpropagating modes that resonate within the cavity. The splitting magnitude is maximal {{in the region of}} maximum reflectivity of the FBG. Moreover, it varies by acting on the FBG physical parameters (e. g. strain, temperature, group index). By considering the spectral region where the splitting magnitude variation is almost maximal, i. e. quasi <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> condition, we prove that the device can be used also as a slow light sensor by monitoring the power change associated with the applied strain showing, in this case, a sensitivity of 3. 6 x 10 ^(6) x eps^(- 1).

40|$|Microwave ovens {{have long}} been {{recognised}} {{as a means of}} reducing heating times versus conventional convection ovens. The principle design feature is based on the procurement of uniform heating within any material placed in the interior of the microwave cavity oven. Materials within the oven are subjected to a degree of heating dependent on their electromagnetic properties. For many applications, it is desirable to maintain control over the distribution of heat deposition. This can be achieved through focussing of the electromagnetic field within the cavity. Two new mechanisms are identified where an increased level of control over the heating pattern and its location could be advantageous. The research described within this thesis aims to improve heating selectivity in microwave cavity ovens by the identification and enhanced control of modal patterns in degenerate and non-degenerate resonators. This is achieved through the analysis of two novel oven arrangements. The first of these addresses the requirement for highly selective heating in hyperthermia treatment. It is demonstrated that proper selection of a forced <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> set can lead to an enhancement in field focussing within the centre of the cavity through constructive and destructive interference of the fields in each mode pattern. It is found that a highly selective peak of field can be produced within the centre of a large cylindrical waveguide cavity for the purpose of hyperthermia treatment. The peak is produced using a quasi <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> set excited at approximately 1 : 3 GHz. The second example presents an open oven design for the curing of epoxy and encapsulant materials within the micro-electronics packaging industry. It is intended that the oven be placed on the arm of a precision alignment machine such that the curing and placement stages of production be combined, suggesting an increase in production efficiency. Two excitation schemes are presented based on the coupling of quasi <b>degenerate</b> <b>mode</b> sets through a wide frequency range and the excitation of a single high order mode enabling uniform field distribution for heating of encapsulant material and increased selective heating through spatial alignment of modal field peaks, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the open-ended microwave oven for curing. Both proposed excitation methods within the open oven design are investigated with results presented. Optimisation of the heating fields is achieved through inclusion of lowloss materials within the oven. Curing of an encapsulant material covering a commercial chip package is achieved and the overall design validated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We find two general families of stable/unstable modes: (i) <b>degenerate</b> <b>modes</b> with symmetric and anti-symmetric patterns; (ii) single modes that are either symmetric or anti-symmetric. The concentration profiles of <b>degenerate</b> <b>modes</b> have strong peaks near the channel walls, while single modes diminish there. Once excited, both families would be detectable through high-speed imaging. We find that unstable modes occur in concentrated suspensions whose velocity profiles are sufficiently flattened near the channel centreline. The patterns of growing unstable modes suggest that they are triggered due to Brownian migration of particles between the central bulk that moves with an almost constant velocity, and highly-sheared low-velocity region near the wall. Modes are amplified because shear-induced diffusion cannot efficiently disperse particles from the cavities of the perturbed velocity field.
