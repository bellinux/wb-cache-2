The United States Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> determined that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing. There is debate over whether HFCS presents greater health risks than other sweeteners. Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have continued to grow during the early 21st century.|$|E
25|$|From 1980 to 1985, over 800 {{patients}} {{were treated with}} automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators. By 1988, nearly 5,000 people had benefited from the device. The U.S. Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> estimated that 416,000 AICDs were implanted between 1990 and 2002 in the United States.

As more effective therapies are developed for the prevention and treatment of acute lung injury, outcomes will continue to improve for pediatric cancers which are responsible for more deaths in children over one year of age than any other disease.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{approved}} several {{drugs for}} managing {{some of the}} major manifestations of TSC. The antiepileptic medication vigabatrinwas approved in 2009 for treatment of infantile spasms and was recommended as first-line therapy for infantile spasms in children with TSC by the 2012 International TSC Consensus Conference. Adrenocorticotropic hormone was approved in 2010 to treat infantile spasms. Everolimus was approved for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012. Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC. In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} March, {{veterinary}} organizations {{reported more}} than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, with one online database self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> received reports of several thousand cats and dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part {{because there is no}} centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States, as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). As a result, many sources speculate the actual number of affected pets may never be known, and experts are concerned that the actual death toll could potentially reach into the thousands.|$|E

25|$|No single {{agency is}} {{responsible}} for all food safety regulations and enforcement in China, and the departments' duties often overlap. There are also local and regional food safety agencies, {{but there is no}} clear hierarchy of agencies at the local or national levels. In response to complexity of numerous agencies monitoring and regulating food safety, the National People's Congress established the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The State Food and Drug Administration was supposed to oversee the all aspects of food safety regulations and unify food safety controls. However, the State Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> not become the main governing department as the government had intended, and the other national agencies have continued to regulate and monitor food safety. This unclear division of duties has created conflict and confusion when citizens have sought to complain or when a major crisis needed to be resolved.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> warned several {{pharmacies}} {{about making}} unsubstantiated {{claims about the}} safety and effectiveness of compounded hormone products.

The Australian Menopause Society has similarly stated that {{there is no evidence that}} bioidentical hormones administered using lozenges are any safer than their approved counterparts. [...] The International Menopause Society has stated [...] "There are no medical or scientific reasons to recommend unregistered 'bioidentical hormones'. [...] The measurement of hormone levels in the saliva is not clinically useful.

2500|$|In May 2009, Lyndsey Layton {{from the}} Washington Post accused {{manufacturers}} {{of food and}} beverage containers {{and some of their}} biggest customers of the public relations and lobbying strategy to block government BPA bans. She noted that, [...] "Despite more than 100 published studies by government scientists and university laboratories that have raised health concerns about the chemical, the Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> deemed it safe largely because of two studies, both funded by a chemical industry trade group". In August 2009 the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative series into BPA and its effects showed the Society of the Plastics Industry plans of a major public relations blitz to promote BPA, including plans to attack and discredit those who report or comment negatively on BPA and its effects.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the {{question}} of physical injury to the eye from a laser pointer, several other undesirable effects are possible. [...] These include short-lived flash blindness if the beam is encountered in darkened surroundings, as when driving at night. [...] This may result in momentary loss of vehicular control. [...] Lasers pointed at aircraft are a hazard to aviation. A police officer seeing a red dot on his chest may conclude that a sniper is targeting him and take aggressive action. In addition, the startle reflex exhibited by some exposed unexpectedly to laser light of this sort {{has been reported to}} have resulted in cases of self-injury or loss of control. [...] For these and similar reasons, the US Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> advised that laser pointers are not toys and should not be used by minors except under the direct supervision of an adult.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{relative}} rarity of coral snake bites {{combined with the}} high costs of producing and maintaining an antivenom supply mean that antivenom (also called [...] "antivenin") production in the United States has ceased. According to Pfizer, the owner of the company that used to make the antivenom Coralmyn, it would take between $5–$10 million for researching a new synthetic antivenom. The cost was too large for the small number of cases presented each year. The existing American coral snake antivenom stock technically expired in 2008, but the U.S. Food and <b>Drug</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> extended the expiration date every year through at least April 30, 2017. [...] Foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers have produced other coral snake antivenoms, but the costs of licensing them in the United States have stalled availability (see above). Instituto Bioclon is developing a coral snake antivenom. [...] In 2013, Pfizer was reportedly working on a new batch of antivenom but had not announced when it would become available. , the Venom Immunochemistry, Pharmacology and Emergency Response (VIPER) institute of the University of Arizona College of Medicine was enrolling participants in a clinical trial of INA2013, a [...] "novel antivenom," [...] according to the Florida Poison Information Center.|$|E

'poison ivy,' 'poison oak,' 'poison sumac,' 'insect bites,' 'athlete's foot,' or 'rashes caused by soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry.'" [...] For these applications, over-the-counter preparations such as Burow's solution are typically used, while diluted forms are used as gargles for conditions like aphthous ulcers of the mouth, including with amino acid additives to improve palatability and taste. [...] The most common use of Burow's solution is in treating ear infections including otomycosis, though it is generally not as effective as clotrimazole in these fungal infections. [...] Topical astringent powder Domeboro contains aluminium sulfate tetradecahydrate, , and calcium acetate monohydrate, , and forms an aluminium acetate solution similar to Burow's solution when dissolved.
