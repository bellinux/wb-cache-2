5000|$|Respondent-plaintiff {{had argued}} that Celotex Corp.'s motion for summary {{judgment}} was insufficiently [...] "supported," [...] and that the moving party must provide affidavits. On this basis, {{the court of appeals}} reversed the decision to grant summary judgment for Celotex Corp., but the Supreme Court stated in its decision that affidavits were not necessary, as long as it demonstrated the lack of a <b>genuine</b> <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{then turned}} to the final issue: whether there were <b>genuine</b> <b>issues</b> <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> as to whether Kodak has monopolized, or {{attempted}} to monopolize, the Kodak equipment service and parts markets, in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. The Court said that the evidence that Kodak controls nearly 100% of the parts market and 80% to 95% of the service market, with no readily available substitutes, was sufficient to survive summary judgment under the stringent monopoly standard of § 2. Kodak contended, however, that {{as a matter of law}} a single brand of a product or service can never be a relevant market under the Sherman Act. The Court disagreed: [...] "Because service and parts for Kodak equipment are not interchangeable with other manufacturers' service and parts, the relevant market from the Kodak equipment owner's perspective is composed of only those companies that service Kodak machines." [...] This is, the Court continued, a fact issue. Summary judgment is therefore inappropriate.|$|R
5000|$|A {{request for}} admissions {{is a list}} of {{questions}} which are similar in some respects to interrogatories, but different in form and purpose. Each [...] "question" [...] {{is in the form of}} a declarative statement which the answering party must then either admit, deny, or state in detail why he or she can neither admit nor deny the truthfulness of the statement (e.g. for lack of knowledge, etc.). This effectively puts the admissions in the form of true-false questions. For example, in a case involving an automobile accident, the plaintiff might include in his or her request a statement such as [...] "Defendant Smith was driving a Blue Dodge Caravan on the morning of the accident". Under Rule 36(a)(5), the answering party may also object to the request, and state the reason for his or her objection, so long as the objection is not solely because the request would present a <b>genuine</b> <b>issue</b> of fact <b>for</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1870, he {{embarked}} seriously on {{the production}} of a breechloading rifle, paying the closest attention to every detail of the barrel and cartridge. Before long his first experimental breechloading rifles appeared, and at Wimbledon in 1871 two of them were used, with one of which the principal prize for military breechloading rifles was won by Sir Henry St. John Halford, 3rd Baronet, whose acquaintance he had made in 1862 at the Wimbledon meeting, and who henceforth was his friend and assistant in his experiments. From 1877, the record of the Metford rifle was an unbroken succession of triumphs. Between that date and 1894, it failed only four times to win the Duke of Cambridge's prize, while it took a preponderating share of other prizes. The advance in military small arms abroad, and especially the increased rapidity of loading, caused the appointment of a committee in February 1883 to deal with the question. Metford designed for them the detail of the [...]42 bore for the rifle provisionally <b>issued</b> <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> early in 1887, and on the adoption of the [...]303 magazine rifle he gave much assistance in designing the barrel, chamber, and cartridge.

5000|$|In the {{majority}} of states, physical punishment by a parent remains legal under statutes making exceptions to the state's law on the crimes of assault, criminal battery, domestic violence and/or child abuse. These exceptions usually establish that no crime has been committed when certain actions are applied to a minor by that child's parent or legal caregiver. However, the line between permitted corporal punishment and punishment legally defined as abuse varies by state and is not always clear (laws typically allow [...] "reasonable force" [...] and [...] "non-excessive corporal punishment"). Such language is often vague and is necessarily subjective and fact-driven, so that most cases present a fact <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> as to reasonableness or non-excessiveness. Examples of law permitting bodily punishment of children include two different articles of the Minnesota Legislature allow parents and teachers to use corporal punishment {{as a form of}} discipline by creating explicit exceptions to the state's child abuse statutes for [...] "reasonable and moderate physical discipline." [...] Application of exceptions for physical punishment raise legal issues as well. In 2008 the Minnesota Supreme Court considered a case involved a man who had struck his 12-year-old son 36 blows with a maple paddle. The trial court held that this constituted abuse, but was reversed on appeal. In affirming the reversal, the Minnesota Supreme Court stated that [...] "We are unwilling to establish a bright-line rule that the infliction of any pain constitutes either physical injury or physical abuse, because to do so would effectively prohibit all corporal punishment of children by their parents" [...] and [...] "it is clear to us that the Legislature did not intend to ban corporal punishment".|$|R

40|$|The {{conduct of}} {{randomized}} controlled trials in livestock with production, health and food-safety outcomes presents unique challenges {{that may not}} be adequately reported in trial reports. The objective of this project was to modify the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to reflect the unique aspects of reporting these livestock trials. A 2 -day consensus meeting was held on 18 – 19 November 2008 in Chicago, IL, USA, to achieve the objective. Prior to the meeting, a Web-based survey was conducted to identify <b>issues</b> <b>for</b> discussion. The 24 attendees were biostatisticians, epidemiologists, food-safety researchers, livestock-production specialists, journal editors, assistant editors and associate editors. Prior to the meeting, the attendees completed a Web-based survey indicating which CONSORT statement items may need to be modified to address unique <b>issues</b> <b>for</b> livestock <b>trials.</b> The consensus meeting resulted in the production of the REFLECT (Reporting Guidelines <b>for</b> Randomized Control <b>Trials)</b> statement <b>for</b> livestock and food safety and 22 -item checklist. Fourteen items were modified from the CONSORT checklist and an additional sub-item was proposed to address challenge trials. The REFLECT statement proposes new terminology, more consistent with common usage in livestock production, to describe study subjects. Evidence was not always available to support modification to or inclusion of an item. The use of the REFLECT statement, which addresses issues unique to livestock trials, should improve the quality of reporting and design <b>for</b> <b>trials</b> reporting production, health and food-safety outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} defined {{by the presence of}} muscle weakness. The motor features of disease are heterogeneous in site of onset and progression. There are also extra-motor features in some patients. The genetic basis for extra-motor features is uncertain. The heterogeneity of ALS is an <b>issue</b> <b>for</b> clinical <b>trials.</b> Areas covered: This paper reviews the range and prevalence of extra-motor features associated with ALS, and highlights the current information about genetic associations with extra-motor features. Expert commentary: There are extra-motor features of ALS, but these are not found in all patients. The most common is cognitive abnormality. More data is required to ascertain whether extra-motor features arise with progression of disease. Extra-motor features are reported in patients with a range of causative genetic mutations, but are not found in all patients with these mutations. Further studies are required of the heterogeneity of ALS, and genotype/phenotype correlations are required, taking note of extra-motor features...|$|R
