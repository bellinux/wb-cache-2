5|$|On February 8, 2013, NBC {{announced}} that the episode would be expanded to fill a one-hour television block, although it still counts as one official episode. The episode received largely positive reviews, although many were critical of the episode's <b>extended</b> <b>length,</b> which they argued felt padded. The episode was viewed by 4.06 million viewers and received a 2/6 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E
5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} <b>extended</b> <b>length,</b> soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E

5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the <b>extended</b> <b>length</b> WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

25|$|Increasing displeasure on {{the part}} of fans and the media with the {{continued}} use of the strategy in ensuing seasons—particularly in high-profile playoff games—prompted the league in 2008 to revisit the possibility of a rule change. However, discussion of the issue at the league's competition committee meeting that year failed to yield adequate support for the idea. According to an ESPN study in 2016, offensive efficiency was higher than the Golden State Warriors when the Hack-a-Shaq strategy was used against a team. NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the competition committee would look into changing the rule {{before the start of the}} 2016–2017 season due to <b>extended</b> <b>length</b> of games.|$|E

500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the <b>extended</b> <b>length</b> would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|E

During the War of 1812 she made several <b>extended</b> <b>length</b> cruises in company with her sister ship [...] and captured, or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships. At the end of 1813, {{due to a lack}} of materials to repair her, she was placed in ordinary for the remainder of the war. In 1815 she returned to service for the Second Barbary War and made patrols through 1816. In the 1820s she helped suppress piracy in the West Indies, made several voyages to South America, and was the first U.S. warship to visit China. Congress spent her last ten years of service as a receiving ship until ordered broken up in 1834.|$|E

The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly. In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.|$|E

500|$|Reviews from {{critics were}} mostly strong, with many {{saying that the}} <b>extended</b> <b>length</b> of {{gameplay}} and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: [...] "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, Pokémon Gold and Silver blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating. Nintendo Power listed the Gold and Silver versions of it combined as the sixth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.|$|E

[...] IGN Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10. While he said the episode was entertaining, he felt that it {{did not need to be}} an hour and a half. Emily Yahr of The Washington Post agreed about the <b>extended</b> <b>length,</b> and did not like what she called [...] "lame attempts to fill time", which she said [...] "detracted from what started as a decent episode". She did, however, cite several [...] "promising storylines", including Rachel's, and noted, [...] "Usually, New Directions leader Rachel Berry is a caricature of all things annoying—but this episode, we see her genuinely struggling with wanting to love herself the way she is". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson summed it up as follows: [...] "Not an epic episode, just sort of … meh." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times reacted more positively and wrote, [...] "The 90-minute episode had a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, some good lessons, character development, a few good numbers and more than a few surprises." ...|$|E
500|$|The trio {{became so}} excited {{with the concept}} they came up with, they decided to do initial {{development}} on their own instead of pitching it to someone else. The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, Variety first reported {{the existence of the}} show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping Sense8 around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the [...] "clearly impossible" [...] response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested if they had the freedom to [...] "do anything", like [...] "crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies" [...] and [...] "live births even" [...] to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise commercial aspects. By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the <b>extended</b> <b>length</b> of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names.|$|E
