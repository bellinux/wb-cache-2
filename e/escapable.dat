50|$|On {{the belief}} that the {{international}} system is anarchic and that each State must independently seek its own survival, Waltz argues that weaker states try to find a balance with their rivals and to form an alliance with a stronger state to obtain a guarantee of security against offensive action by an enemy state. On the other hand, Mearsheimer and other offensive realists argue that Anarchy encourages all states to always increase their own power because one state can never be sure of other states' intentions. In other words, defensive realism contends that security can be balanced in some cases and that the security dilemma is <b>escapable.</b> While offensive realists do not disagree, they do not agree fully with the defensive view instead contending that if states can gain an advantage over other states then they will do so. In short, since states want to maximize their power in this anarchic system and since states cannot trust one another, the security dilemma is inescapable.|$|E
50|$|Aurelianus, the new praetorian prefect of {{the east}} after Eutropius' execution, {{stripped}} Alaric of his title to Illyricum in 400. Between 700 and 7,000 Gothic soldiers and their families were slaughtered in a riot at Constantinople on July 12, 400. Gainas, who at one point had been made magister militum, rebelled, but {{he was killed by}} the Huns under Uldin, who sent his head back to Constantinople as a gift. With these events, particularly Rome's use of the feared Huns and cut off from Roman officialdom, Alaric felt his position in the East was precarious. So, while Stilicho was busy fighting an invasion of Vandals and Alans in Rhaetia and Noricum, Alaric led his people into an invasion of Italy in 401, reaching it in November without encountering much resistance. The Goths captured a few unnamed cities and besieged the Western Roman capital Mediolanum. Stilicho, now with Alan and Vandal federates in his army, relieved the siege, forcing a crossing at the Adda river. Alaric retreated to Pollentia. On Easter Sunday, April 6, 401, Stilicho launched a surprise attack which became the Battle of Pollentia. The battle ended in a draw, and Alaric fell back. After brief negotiations and maneuvers, the two forces clashed again at the Battle of Verona, where Alaric was defeated and besieged in a mountain fortress, taking heavy casualties. At this point, a number of Goths in his army started deserting him, including Sarus, who went over to the Romans. Alaric and his army then withdrew to the borderlands next to Dalmatia and Pannonia. Honorius, fearful after the near capture of Mediolanum, moved the Western Roman capital to Ravenna, which was more defensible with its natural swamps and more <b>escapable</b> with its access to the sea. Moving the capital to Ravenna may have disconnected the Western court from events beyond the Alps towards a preoccupation with the defense of Italy, weakening the Western Empire as a whole.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} which stressor qualities (<b>escapable</b> vs. inescapable stress and unconditioned vs. conditioned stress) can potentiate fear in the elevated plus-maze. While inescapable stress potentiated fear, <b>escapable</b> stress did not, but <b>escapable</b> stress increased the locomotor activity (closed arm entries). Inescapable stress only potentiated fear when re-exposure to the former shock compartment, 24 h after footshock and without further footshock, took place just before to 90 min before testing in the elevated plus-maze. We conclude that fear-potentiation in the plus-maze depends on stressor controllability and contextual conditioning. Fear-potentiation was reduced by the anxiolytic diazepam (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mg/kg, s. c.) and was further enhanced by the anxiogenic DMCM (1. 0 mg/kg, s. c.). The fear-potentiated plus-maze test may be a valuable tool in the search for novel anxiolytics and in the study of the neurobiology of fear-potentiation, fear conditioning and generalization of fear. ...|$|E

At first, the base-line performance level of all subjects were estimated in pretest phase. Then the experiment was consisted of three experimental blocks, each of which had pretreatment phase and test phase. Subjects in the inescapable condition performed insolvable anagram tasks and were exposed to the aversive stimulus (noise) of which termination was independent of their own behavior. Subjects in the <b>escapable</b> condition could terminate the aversive stimulus by solving the anagram tasks. Subjects in the control condition and the noise condition had notreatment, but in the noise condition aversive stimulus was directly given during performing test problems. As predicted, test performance of the inescapable gpoup was poorer than the <b>escapable</b> or the control group and similar to the noise group. This result provides support for the learned helpless hypothesis on the cognitive task. In addition, subjects who could not escape from noise attributed their failures to task difficulty rather than to their ability, and showed more irrational expectancy changes.

40|$|Models used {{to predict}} {{digestibility}} and fill of the dietary insoluble fibre (NDF) treat the ruminoreticular particulate mass as a single pool. The underlying assumption is that escape of particles follows first-order kinetics. In this paper, we proposed and evaluated a model of two ruminoreticular sequential NDF pools. The first pool is formed by buoyant particles (raft pool) and the second one by fluid dispersed particles (<b>escapable</b> pool) ventrally to the raft. The transference of particles between these two pools results from several processes that reduce particles buoyancy, assuming the gamma distribution. The exit of <b>escapable</b> pool particles from the ruminoreticulum is exponentially distributed. These concepts were evaluated by comparing ruminoreticular NDF masses as 43 and 27 means from cattle and sheep, respectively, to the same predicted variable using single- and two-pools models. Predictions of the single-pool model were based on lignin turnover and the turnover associated to the descending phase of the elimination of Yb-labelled forage particles in the faeces of sheep. Predictions of the two-pool model were obtained by estimating fractional passage rates associated to the ascending and descending phases of the same Yb excretion profiles in sheep faeces. All turnovers were scaled to the power 0. 25 of body mass for interspecies comparisons. Predictions based on lignin turnover (single pool) and the two-pool model presented similar trends, accuracies and precisions. The single-pool approach {{based solely on the}} descending phase of the marker yielded biased estimates of the ruminoreticular NDF mass...|$|E
40|$|It is {{critical}} to {{develop an understanding of}} the neuronal circuitry elements that underly resilience in order to develop {{a better understanding of how}} the brain copes with later stressors. Thus our lab has taken a circuit level approach in understanding how exposure to an <b>escapable</b> stressor aids in future coping events. Recent work from our lab has identified that female rodents do not develop resilience from <b>escapable</b> stress (ES) as do their male counterparts, which introduces an interesting model to dissect the neuronal circuitry underlying resilience. In addition to this, the role of the infralimbic cortex (IL) in ES mediated attenuation of fear is of interest due to previous work within our lab. Thus, within this study we work to develop a greater understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying stress and resilience through two experiments. In this study we 1) aim to understand the role of infralimbic cortex (IL) projections to the basomedial amygdala (BMA) in ES mediated fear attenuation, and 2) work to determine the effectiveness of ketamine as a protective agent in females and to also dissect the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to both the dorsal medial striatum and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in females.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the hematopoietic response of rats pretreated with CV and {{exposed to the}} impact of acute <b>escapable,</b> inescapable or psychogenical stress on responsiveness to an in vivo challenge with Listeria monocytogenes. No consistent changes were observed after exposure to <b>escapable</b> footshock. Conversely, the impact of uncontrollable stress (inescapable and psychogenical) was manifested by an early onset and increased severity and duration of myelossuppression produced by the infection. Small size CFU-GM colonies and increased numbers of clusters were observed, concurrently to a greater expansion in the more mature population of bone marrow granulocytes. No differences were observed between the responses of both uncontrollable stress regimens. CV prevented the myelossuppression caused by stress/infection due to increased numbers of CFU-GM in the bone marrow. Colonies of cells tightly packed, with a very condensed nucleus; in association with a greater expansion in the more immature population of bone marrow granulocytes were observed. Investigation of the production of colony-stimulating factors revealed increased colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in the serum of normal and infected/stressed rats treated with the algae. CV treatment restored/enhanced the changes produced by stress/infection in total and differential bone marrow and peripheral cells counts. Further studies demonstrated that INF-? is significantly reduced, whereas IL- 10 is significantly increased after exposure to uncontrollable stress. Treatment with CV significantly increased INF-? levels and diminished the levels of IL- 10. Uncontrollable stress reduced the protection afforded by CV to a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes, with survival rates being reduced from (50 %) in infected rats to 20 % in infected/stressed rats. All together, our results suggest Chlorella treatment as an effective tool for the prophylaxis of post-stress Continue Continuation myelossupression, including the detrimental effect of stress on the course and outcome of infection...|$|E
40|$|Conditioned place {{preference}} (CPP) is {{a classical}} conditioning paradigm {{used to evaluate}} the rewarding or aversive properties of a stimulus. A stimulus can be an audio, visual, or sensory prompt but can also be stimuli associated with behaviors. Environments associated with sexual and aggressive encounters can become rewarding to both male and female Syrian hamsters regardless of social status. However, we have observed that individually-housed, non-aggressive hamsters find social interaction without aggression or sexual behaviors rewarding. Therefore, we expanded upon our previous experiments using CPP to test the hypothesis that group-housed, male hamsters (n= 12) can develop a preference for a negative social experience such as social defeat. The CPP paradigm consisted of an initial preference test (15 min X 2), a conditioning phase (10 min X 5 days), and a final preference test (15 min). The hamster was placed into a CPP apparatus containing two main testing chambers, black and white, connected by a neutral, clear chamber. The pretest was conducted to establish a baseline for comparison to the posttest to determine changes in {{the amount of time spent}} in either (black/white) chamber. An individually-housed male (n= 11) was paired with a group-housed male in their non-preferred chamber for conditioning. The order of placement in the chambers was alternated daily. Control animals (n= 5) were used to evaluate effects of habituation across conditioning trials. The result of our experiment showed that group- housed animals developed a CPP for social defeat. We observed that the preference scores increased from 0. 34 (± 0. 01) to 0. 41 (± 0. 04), p =. 08 and the difference scores decreased from 243. 67 (± 21. 72) to 171. 25 (± 60. 34), p 3 ̆c. 05. There were no significant differences between pretest and posttest scores for controls for both preference scores and for difference scores from pretest to posttest. The results of this experiment suggest that that our subjects developed a CPP for social defeat and that their response may have been influenced by the type of social defeat. We believe that an <b>escapable</b> defeat with different aggressors’ parings, as was conducted in our experiment, produced social interaction with novelty but with lower stress levels, leading the animals to develop a CPP for social defeat. The hamster’s reactions to the experiment conducted suggest that their response may have been influenced by the type of social defeat that was experienced. There are two types of social defeat models: inescapable and <b>escapable.</b> An inescapable defeat implies that an animal cannot avoid its aggressor whereas an <b>escapable</b> defeat implies that the animal can. Animals exposed to an inescapable defeat have been found to produce generalized aversion and avoidance towards not only a familiar aggressor but a novel, non-aggressive aggressor with the avoidance greater with the familiar aggressor than the unfamiliar; whereas, animals exposed to an <b>escapable</b> defeat only produce avoidance towards its previous aggressor. However, our previous and current research indicates that all Syrian hamsters regardless of social (aggressive/submissive) and housing (group/individual) status all formed a CPP for social behavior, albeit social aggression or social defeat. Our CPP experiment paradigm, similar to that of an inescapable defeat model in that the animal can avoid its aggressors, perhaps produced a positive CPP for social defeat because the hamsters found the controllability of the defeat with novel aggressors across the conditioning trials to be stimulating. While, the hamsters displayed a CPP for social defeat they were not completely resilient and demonstrated higher vigilance to their surroundings as evidenced by the increased duration in the neutral chamber following social defeat. The hamsters’ behaviors suggest that the conducted experiment produced a combination of mild social defeat with novel interactions that produced less aversion and perhaps lower generalized anxiety which was sufficient to develop a CPP for social defeat...|$|E

However, a decrease of the maximum response to soterenol, a partial agonist at beta 1 -adrenoceptors, occurred only after inescapable foot-shock. The enhanced sensitivity to ISO was abolished by butoxamine (a selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist) and accompanied by a marked increase in the pA 2 Value of this antagonist. We conclude that the ability to control the shock prevented the down-regulation of the pacemaker beta 1 -adrenoceptors but not the increased participation of beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the response of the rat sinoatrial node to catecholamines after repeated foot-shock...|$|E

However, interesting results were found in analyzing the influence of behavioral factors. The degree of control exerted over the shock was inversely related to ACTH and corticosterone levels. In addition, individual differences in the exploratory activity to novelty were correlated with poststress lymphoproliferation and antibody formation.

Three ruminally fistulated buffalo steers received a diet consisting just alfalfa that was harvested at 15 % of flowering and chopped in three sizes. Individual small rectangular bales were chopped with a forage field harvester for theoretical cut length 19 and 10 mm for preparation of long and medium particle size, also the fine particles were prepared by milling. The geometric means and its standard deviation were 8. 5, 5. 5 and 2. 5 mm; and 1. 24, 1. 16 and 1. 06 mm, in coarse, medium and fine, respectively. The experimental design was a repeated 3 × 3 Latin squares with 21 day periods. The diets were offered twice daily at 09 : 00 and 21 : 00 h at ad libitum level. The rumens were evacuated manually at 3, 7. 5 and 12 h post-feeding and total ruminal contents separated into mat and bailable liquids. Dry matter weight distribution of total recovered particles was determined by a wet-sieving procedure and used to partition ruminal mat and bailable liquids among percentages of large (≥ 4. 0 mm), medium (< 4. 0 mm and ≥ 1. 18 mm), and fine (< 1. 18 mm and ≥ 0. 05 mm) particles. Intake did not influence markedly the distribution of different particle fractions, whereas particle size and time post-feeding had a pronounced effect. With increasing time after feeding, percentage of large and medium particles significantly decreased, whereas the percentage of fine particles significantly increased. The ruminal digesta particle distributions illustrated intensive particle breakdown in the reticulo-rumen for coarse particle more than others. Dry matter contents and the proportion of particulate dry matter in the rumen increased as intake increased, i. e. ruminal mat increased at the expense of bailable liquids.

Intra-DRN administration of the CRH 2 receptor antagonist anti-sauvagine- 30 before IS dose-dependently blocked IS-induced behavioral changes; the CRH 1 receptor antagonist 2 -methyl- 4 -(N-propyl-N-cyclo-proanemethylamino) - 5 -chloro- 6 -(2, 4, 6 -trichloranilino) pyrimidine (NBI 27914), administered in the same manner, did not. Moreover, the highly selective CRH 2 receptor agonist urocortin II (Ucn II) dose-dependently caused behavioral changes associated with IS in the absence of shock. Ucn II was effective at doses 100 -fold lower than those previously required for CRH. The relationship between CRH 2 receptors and DRN 5 -HT is discussed.

40|$|Many {{stressors}} elicit {{changes in}} corticotrophin (CRH), enkephalin (ENK), and neurotensin (NT) mRNA levels within the medial parvocellular {{region of the}} paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (mpPVN), and the pattern of changes in mRNA levels appears {{to depend on the}} physical characteristics of the stressor. We questioned whether psychologically distinct stressors would cause different patterns of neuropeptide mRNA expression within the PVN. Psychologically distinct stressors were created by employing a paradigm of <b>escapable</b> (controllable) vs non-escapable (yoked) tail shock. An adult male rats could terminate the stress stimulus by performing wheel-turning behaviour; his behaviour also terminated the stress for his yoked partner, who had no control over the termination of the shock. Four h post-stress, brains were collected and processed for in-situ hybridization histochemistry. Tail-shock stress stimulated a significant increase in CRH, ENK, and NT mRNA levels within the mpPVN. The number of CRH identified neurones coexpressing AVP mRNA was also significantly elevated in both stress groups. Moreover, the pattern and magnitude of the stress-induced increases in mRNA was similar in both stress groups. Additionally, no stress-induced changes in CRH mRNA levels were observed in the central nucleus of th...|$|E
40|$|Helplessness deficits are {{characterized}} by an organism’s failure to escape <b>escapable</b> situations after exposure to aversive stimuli. It has recently been learned that helplessness is the mammalian default protective response, {{and that it is}} subdued as mammals learn to control their environment. Human helplessness responses are mediated by our ability to think; explanations for adverse stimuli that tend toward the individual’s inability to control a stimulus can cause a person to exhibit helplessness deficits. This paper proposes a theory of cultural helplessness, positing that information and beliefs spread through cultural transmission can provide individuals with automatic explanations, which can potentially lead to helplessness deficits across a population when group members are subjected to similar aversive stimuli. This theory is applied to a group of African-American law students who have the ability to score well on the LSAT and pass the Bar Exam on the first try, but do not. Positive psychology, applied as part of an interdisciplinary strategy, is proposed as a way to help these students to perceive themselves as being in control of their fate, thus allowing them to achieve according to their ability...|$|E
40|$|There is high {{consensus}} that stress-related disorders like depression {{are shaped by}} naturexnurture interactions. However, the complexity appears larger than envisaged and naturexnurture research is progressing too slowly. An important reason is that mainstream research is focussing {{on the idea that}} a combination of genotypic stress-sensitivity and stress exposure inevitably leads to maladaptive stress-coping responses, and thereby stress-related disorders. However, stress-coping responses can also be adaptive and adhere to the expected norm. Here I elaborate the 'environment' mismatch hypothesis proposed by Mathias Schmidt (Psychoneuroendocrinology, 36, 330 - 338, 2011) to the stress-coping (mis) match (SCM) hypothesis postulating that stress-coping responses-as programmed by naturexage-dependent nurture interactions-are adaptive when they match current stress conditions, but maladaptive when they mismatch current stress conditions. For instance, acquisition of an active stress-coping response during nurture may lead to the programmed release of active coping responses in current life. This is adaptive when current stress is <b>escapable,</b> but maladaptive when current stress is inescapable, leading to agitation. A model par example for naturexnurture interactions is the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism, which will be discussed in the framework of the SCM hypothesis. The potential role of the prefrontal-amygdala circuit and the therapeutic implications of the SCM hypothesis will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to assess the ability of the Small Ruminant Nutrition System (SRNS) mechanistic model to predict metabolizable energy intake (MEI) and milk yield (MY) when using a heterogeneous fiber pool scenario (GnG 1), compared with a traditional, homogeneous scenario (G 1). The second objective was to evaluate an alternative approach to estimating the dry matter intake (DMI) of goats {{to be used in the}} SRNS model. The GnG 1 scenario considers an age-dependent fractional transference rate for fiber particles from the first ruminal fiber pool (raft) to an <b>escapable</b> pool (λ r), and that this second ruminal fiber pool (i. e., <b>escapable</b> pool) follows an age-independent fractional escape rate for fiber particles (k e). Scenario G 1 adopted only a single fractional passage rate (k p). All parameters were estimated individually by using equations published in the literature, except for 2 passage rate equations in the G 1 scenario: 1 developed with sheep data (G 1 -S) and another developed with goat data (G 1 -G). The alternative approach to estimating DMI was based on an optimization process using a series of dietary constraints. The DMI, MEI, and MY estimated for the GnG 1 and G 1 scenarios were compared with the results of an independent dataset (n = 327) that contained information regarding DMI, MEI, MY, and milk and dietary compositions. The evaluation of the scenarios was performed using the coefficient of determination (R 2) between the observed and predicted values, mean bias (MB), bias correction factor (C b), and concordance correlation coefficient. The MEI estimated by the GnG 1 scenario yielded precise and accurate values (R 2 = 0 &# 183; 82; MB = 0. 21 Mcal/d; C b = 0. 98) similar to those of the G 1 -S (R 2 = 0. 85; MB = 0. 10 Mcal/d; C b = 0. 99) and G 1 -G (R 2 = 0. 84; MB = 0. 18 Mcal/d; C b = 0. 98) scenarios. The results were also similar for the MY, but a substantial MB was found as follows: GnG 1 (R 2 = 0. 74; MB = 0. 70 kg/d; C b = 0. 79), G 1 -S (R 2 = 0. 71; MB = 0. 58 kg/d 1; C b = 0. 85) and G 1 -G (R 2 = 0. 71; MB = 0. 65 kg/d; C b = 0. 82). The alternative approach for DMI prediction provided better results with the G 1 -G scenario (R 2 = 0. 88; MB = - 71. 67 g/d; C b = 0. 98). We concluded that the GnG 1 scenario is valid within mechanistic models such as the SRNS and that the alternative approach for estimating DMI is reasonable and can be used in diet formulations for goats...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with determining whether a mobile robot, called the pursuer, is up to maintaining visibility of an antagonist agent, called the evader. This problem, a variant of pursuit-evasion, has been largely studied, following a systematic treatment by increasingly relaxing a number of restrictions. In [8], we considered a scenario where the pursuer and the evader move at bound speed, traveling around a known, 2 D environment, which contains obstacles. Then, considering that, {{in an attempt to}} escape, the evader travels the shortest path to reach a potential escape region, we provided a decision procedure that determines whether or not the pursuer is up to maintain visibility of the evader and obtained complexity measures of this surveillance task. In this paper, we prove that there are cases for which an evader may escape only if it does not travel the shortest path to an <b>escapable</b> region. We introduce planning strategies for the movement of the pursuer that keeps track of the evader, even if the evader chooses not to travel the shortest path to an escape region. We also present a sufficient condition for the evader to escape that does not depend on the initial positions of the players. It can be verified only using the environment. All our algorithms have been implemented and we show simulation results. I...|$|E
