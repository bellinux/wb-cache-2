5|$|Constance Dallas, {{the first}} woman to win {{election}} to City Council, was elected in a close vote in the 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over <b>incumbent</b> councilman Robert S. Hamilton. In the 1st district, which took in South Philadelphia, attorney Thomas I. Guerin defeated Dominic J. Colubiale. In the 2nd, the Republicans' lone district-level victory came as electrical equipment salesman William M. Phillips bested Louis Vignola, a labor union official. In the 3rd district, made up of the southern half of West Philadelphia, <b>incumbent</b> Harry Norwitch defeated another <b>incumbent</b> from the old city council, George Maxman, who had held office since 1936. In the 4th, which covered the northern half of West Philadelphia, state representative Samuel Rose defeated <b>incumbent</b> James G. Clark.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the investment response of <b>incumbents</b> to new entry in 39 chemical product industries. The behavior of <b>incumbents</b> in highly concentrated industries differed {{from that of}} <b>incumbents</b> in low-concentration industries. In concentrated industries <b>incumbents</b> increased their rate of investment following entry, but reduced investment to accommodate capacity expansions made by other <b>incumbents.</b> This asymmetric response did not arise in less concentrated industries. Significant excess capacity existed in concentrated industries following entry, {{but there is little}} evidence that <b>incumbents</b> built such capacity as a deterrent before entry. Thus, the results support "mobility-deterrence" theories rather than the conventional excess-capacity deterrence argument. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of innovative entrants on <b>incumbents</b> is considered important for technological change. We analyze this influence {{for the global}} transition towards alternative technology vehicles (ATVs). Our results indicate that entrants' ATV-related knowledge accumulation stimulates average <b>incumbent's</b> ATV-related research. Regarding global entrants, <b>incumbents</b> with higher ATV patent stocks increased patenting stronger; supporting previous literature on competitive reactions to entry. Responding to domestic entrants, however, <b>incumbents</b> with low ATV patent stocks increased whereas <b>incumbents</b> with high stocks decreased patenting; suggesting that advanced <b>incumbents</b> outsource research or overtake entrants. Further, certain characteristics and not merely the quantity of entrants drive incumbents' responses...|$|R

5000|$|Nevertheless, congresspersons in office, or <b>incumbents,</b> {{have strong}} {{advantages}} over challengers. One reporter noted [...] "nearly all <b>incumbents</b> raise far more (money) than do their challengers," [...] which brings {{a huge advantage}} to <b>incumbents.</b> <b>Incumbents</b> get the majority of PAC money according to the logic that [...] "PACs give most of their money to <b>incumbents</b> {{because they are more}} likely to win; <b>incumbents</b> win largely because PACs heavily finance them." [...] There is consensus among political analysts that money is important for winning elections. [...] "Election to Congress ... is therefore like getting life tenure at a university," [...] wrote one critic. In 1986, of 469 House and Senate elections, only 12 challengers succeeded in defeating <b>incumbents.</b> Most challengers are at a huge disadvantage in terms of fundraising.|$|R

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and <b>incumbent</b> Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of <b>incumbent</b> slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an <b>incumbent</b> to be challenged.|$|E

The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident <b>incumbent</b> Democrats, pairing Cordray with the twenty-two-year <b>incumbent</b> Mike Stinziano.

50|$|Congressional <b>incumbents</b> in the United States {{enjoy an}} electoral {{advantage}} over challengers, but a wave election often boosts challengers, resulting in many more <b>incumbents</b> losing than usual during wave elections. A wave election can put into play seats {{that would otherwise}} be considered safe for the party holding the seat, and help even flawed challengers defeat <b>incumbents.</b> Since at least 1954, wave elections have always benefited one party {{at the expense of the}} other, but the term has also been used to describe a hypothetical scenario in which numerous <b>incumbents</b> from both parties lose their seats. The first election after redistricting is often a wave election, since many <b>incumbents</b> are less firmly rooted in their districts following redistricting, and many other <b>incumbents</b> retire or suffer primary defeats.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of logit demand that extends to a multi-firm {{industry}} the traditional duopoly framework of network competition with access charges. Firstly, we show that, when <b>incumbents</b> do not face the threat of entry and compete in prices, they inefficiently establish the reciprocal access charge below cost. This inefficiency disappears if <b>incumbents</b> compete in utilities instead of prices. Secondly, we study how <b>incumbents</b> change their choices under the threat of entry when they determine an industry-wide (non-discriminatory) access charge. We show how <b>incumbents</b> may accommodate all possible entrants, only a group of them, or may completely deter entry. When entry deterrence is the preferred option, <b>incumbents</b> distort upwards the access charges. entry deterrence; interconnection; telecommunications...|$|R
