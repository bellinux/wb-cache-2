5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the {{transfer}} of knowledge is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by the International Federation <b>for</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the American College of Emergency Physicians, the British Association <b>for</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medicine, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Australasian College <b>for</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medicine. The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' emergency medicine organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E

5|$|There {{are other}} {{conferences}} on international emergency medicine as well, {{including the one}} that the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) has held every two years since 1987. However, WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than emergency medicine system development, {{and many of its}} member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine. Additionally, the European Society <b>for</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of Emergency Medicine, develops recommendations <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society <b>for</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries.|$|E

Where households had experienced a recent emergency (in the last 2 years), the survey investigated how they responded during the emergency and whether any changes were made to ensure better preparedness in the future...|$|R

5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion it is difficult <b>for</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
