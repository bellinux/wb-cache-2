40|$|Goldenseal (<b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis L., Ranunculaceae) is {{a popular}} {{medicinal}} plant and has been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The herbaceous perennial is distributed in North America under deciduous forest canopies {{throughout much of the}} south and eastern seaboard north into Canada. The rhizome, rootlets and root hairs produce medicinally active alkaloids. Although berberine, one of the <b>Hydrastis</b> alkaloids, has shown anti-fungal activity, the influence of <b>Hydrastis</b> alkaloids on the plant rhizosphere fungal ecology has not been investigated. While a Fusarium spp. was previously isolated from H. canadensis, this is the first report of a F. oxysporum endophyte isolated from <b>Hydrastis</b> root tissue. Additionally, F. solani was isolated from non-rhizosphere soil surrounding <b>Hydrastis</b> root tissue. A bioassay was developed to study the effect of goldenseal isoquinoline alkaloids on three Fusarium isolates, including the two species isolated from <b>Hydrastis.</b> And, in order to accurately detect the alkaloids, a HPLC-MS method was developed. The whole root extract treatment stimulated macroconidia germination and chlamydospore formation, while inducing mycotoxin production in the <b>Hydrastis</b> endophyte. Chlamydospore formation, macroconidial germination and mycotoxin production of PSU isolate, F. commune, was reduced by the whole root extract. The second <b>Hydrastis</b> isolate, F. solani, responded to the whole root extract by increasing germination rates, but with no other effects. The findings suggest that the <b>Hydrastis</b> root extract appears to provide selective advantage for the endophytic isolate and influences the fungal ecology associated with its root system...|$|E
40|$|The genus <b>Hydrastis</b> {{has been}} {{variously}} {{classified as a}} monotypic taxon in the Ranunculaceae, the Berberidaceae, the Glaucidiaceae, or its own monogeneric family, the Hydrastidaceae.

One conclusion of this review was that Tobe and Keating overlooked certain important papers which might have substantially altered their conclusions, viz., that <b>Hydrastis</b> is sufficiently distinct from the other genera of the Ranunculaceae to warrant a classification as a monogeneric family. Another conclusion was that, with the present information available, <b>Hydrastis</b> can be classified as a subfamily within the Ranunculaceae, but that molecular data might well alter this conclusion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The growing {{popularity}} of Chinese herbal medicine in the United States has prompted large-scale import of raw herbs from Asia. Many of the Asian herbs have phylogenetically related North American species. We compared three phylogenetically related species, namely Coptis chinensis (Huanglian), <b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis and Coptis trifolia to show whether they can be substituted by one another in terms of alkaloid content. Methods We used microwave assisted extraction to obtain alkaloids berberine, coptisine, palmatine and hydrastine. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify each alkaloid. Results <b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis has the most berberine, whereas Coptis trifolia has the most coptisine. Hydrastine and palmatine were unique to <b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis and Coptis chinensis respectively. Conclusion Neither <b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis nor Coptis trifolia contains all the alkaloids found in Coptis chinensis used in Chinese medicine.

40|$|<b>Hydrastis</b> or goldenseal, one of {{the most}} popular {{medicinal}} herbs in the U. S. A., is used in mild pathological conditions Like cold and flu, based on the pharmacological properties of its active components, berberine (anticholinergic, antisecretory, and antimicrobial) and Beta-hydrastine (astringent). We previously reported the relaxant effect of a total ethanolic extract of <b>hydrastis</b> on carbachol precontracted isolated guinea pig trachea, and with the present study, using the same experimental model, we aimed at evaluating the contribution of its major alkaloids, berberine, Beta-hydrastine, canadine and; canadaline to the total effect. Furthermore, using specific pharmacological tools, like timolol and xanthine amine congener, we attempted to elucidate its mechanism of action. The ECS, of berberine, beta -hydrastine, canadine and canadaline, went 34. 2 +/- 0. 6, 72. 8 +/- 0. 6, 11. 9 +/- 1. 2 and 2. 4 +/- 0. 8 mug/ml, respectively. Timolol effectively antagonized the effect of canadine (EC 50 = 19. 7 +/- 3. 0 mug/ml) and canadaline (EC 50 = 17. 1 +/- 1. 2 mug/ml) but not that of berberine and Beta-hydrastine, while xanthine amine congener antagonized the effect of beta -hydrastine (EC 50 = 149. 9 +/- 35. 3 mug/ml) and canadaline (EC 50 = 26. 1 +/- 3. 0 mug/ml) but not that of berberine and canadine. Besides, the <b>hydrastis</b> extract, at concentrations between 0. 01 and 0. 1 mug/ml, potentiated the relaxant effect of isoprenaline on carbachol-precontracted isolated guinea pig trachea.

40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} 14 species of Clematis and one species each of Delphinium, Helleborus, Thalictrum, and Xanthorhiza (Ranunculaceae) is {{compared}} to that of Glaucidium palma tum (Glaucidiaceae) and <b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis (Ranunculaceae, or Hydrastidaceae of some authors). Clematis wood has features typical of wood of vines and lianas: wide (earlywood) vessels, abundant axial parenchyma (earlywood, some species), high vessel density, low proportion of fibrous tissue in wood, wide rays composed of thin-walled cells, and abrupt origin of multiseriate rays. Superimposed on these features are expressions indicative of xeromorphy in the species of cold or dry areas: numerous narrow latewood vessels, presence of vasicentric tracheids, shorter vessel elements, and strongly marked growth rings. Wood of Xanthorhiza is like that of a (small) shrub. Wood of Delphinium, Helleborus, and Thalictrum is characteristic of herbs that become woodier: limited amounts of secondary xylem, parenchymatization of wood, partial conversion of ray areas to libriform fibers (partial raylessness). Wood of Ranunculaceae other than Clematis has numerous narrow vessels, probably an adaptation to cold more than drought. Glaucidium has occasional scalariform perforation plates like those almost universally present in Paeonia, but the two genera differ strongly in other wood features. Wood of <b>Hydrastis</b> (scalariform perforation plates occasional in primary xylem, rare in secondary xylem) accords with the idea that <b>Hydrastis</b> is a lineage that separated from the base of Ranunculaceae. Features that ally Ranunculaceae with other families of Ranunculiflorae include presence of wide multiseriate rays (without accompanying uniseriate rays), vessel restriction patterns, and storied structure. Woodiness in Ranunculaceae is probably secondary, at least to some extent; the woodiness of Xanthorhiza, thought by some to represent a primitive genus in the family, could be either primary or secondary...|$|E

UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Lyle Craker <b>Hydrastis</b> canadensis L. (goldenseal) is an {{endangered}} perennial wildflower species native to eastern North America. In this study, several populations of goldenseal, (both cultivated and wild type) were analyzed for genetic variability. The {{samples were collected}} from plant populations in North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia and preserved using silica gel during collection. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis technique was used to generate DNA profiles from individual plants and to estimate genetic variability between groups (cultivated and wild type), among populations within groups and within populations using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and a UPGMA clustering phenogram. Our results demonstrate {{that the bulk of}} genetic diversity may be within and among populations, but not between groups. This indicates the need for preservation and conservation efforts at the population level. The next step would be to study goldenseal populations more in depth for underlying causes of the genetic variability observed in this study. Further study of genetic variability with different molecular markers may be needed to clarify the level of diversity for the species at the group level. Increased knowledge of genetic variability and the identification of accessions of goldenseal would prove useful for reintroduction and cultivation strategies...|$|E
