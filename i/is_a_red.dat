5|$|The University of Bristol (abbreviated as Bris. in post-nominal letters, or UoB) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> brick {{research}} university {{located in}} Bristol, United Kingdom. It received its royal charter in 1909, although like the University of the West of England and the University of Bath, it first started as the Merchant Venturers Navigation School in 1595. Its key predecessor institution, University College, Bristol, {{had been in}} existence since 1876.|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} St. Michael, Sutton Court was {{designed}} by W. D. Caroe in 1908–1909. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> brick building on Elmwood road, in Tudor style.

5|$|There are two notable optical double {{stars in}} Hydrus. Pi Hydri, {{composed}} of Pi1 Hydri and Pi2 Hydri, is divisible in binoculars. Around 476 light-years distant, Pi1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> giant of spectral type M1III that varies between magnitudes 5.52 and 5.58. Pi2 is an orange giant of spectral type K2III and shining with a magnitude of 5.7, around 488 light-years from Earth.|$|E
5|$|AK Pyxidis <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> {{giant of}} {{spectral}} type M5III and semi-regular variable that varies between magnitudes 6.09 and 6.51. Its pulsations take place over multiple periods simultaneously of 55.5, 57.9, 86.7, 162.9 and 232.6 days. UZ Pyxidis is another semi-regular variable red giant, {{this time a}} carbon star, that is around 3560 times as luminous as the Sun with a surface temperature of 3482 K, located some 2116 light-years away from Earth. It varies between magnitudes 6.99 and 7.83 over 159 days. VY Pyxidis is a BL Herculis variable (type II Cepheid), ranging between apparent magnitudes 7.13 and 7.40 {{over a period of}} 1.24 days.

5|$|As of August 2015, {{access to}} see his white {{rectangular}} marble tomb slab is denied. His remains are not under the white slab, they are under a grey circular stone near his slab. Under this grey stone <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> brick staircase which leads to an underground burial chamber that was studied {{for the first time}} ever in 2004. In the chamber are many family members. Gian Gastone had a lead coffin in a wooden frame. It was replaced with a modern coffin. Near him are the remains of many De Medici children who were buried in unmarked graves. Some of them still have their garments.|$|E

5000|$|The {{insignia}} of {{the order}} consisted of <b>a</b> badge, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> star with golden rays between the arms; at the centre <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pentagon bearing {{the image of the}} cruiser Aurora participating in the October Revolution. Above it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> flag bearing the words [...] "October Revolution" [...] in Russian. A Hammer and Sickle emblem was placed at the bottom.

5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and the High Road. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904. The square tower was added after the First World War by Canon Egan as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|England have {{typically}} worn all-white shirts, white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on the shirts <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> rose, {{rather than the}} Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior {{to the introduction of}} the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.|$|E
5|$|GJ 3021 is a solar twin—a star {{very like}} our own Sun—around 57 light-years distant with a {{spectral}} type G8V and magnitude of 6.7. It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the faint star GJ 3021B orbits {{at a distance of}} 68 AU; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> dwarf of spectral type M4V.|$|E
50|$|It is {{reported}} to have originally <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> light. It <b>is</b> now lit with a decorative gas light.|$|R
50|$|The crest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> lion {{standing}} on a rock and holding a sword. The motto remained Ne cede.|$|R

5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, {{meaning that it}} experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, President Lukashenko {{issued a}} decree {{granting}} a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, {{which has a}} ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern {{along the length of}} the hoist side of the flag. On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ("Armed Forces") arched over it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ("of Republic of Belarus") written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the center contains the symbol of the armed forces, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is the full name of the military unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, {{superimposed}} over the rays of a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in purple and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets {{at the base of the}} emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language. At the top of the emblem there is a five-pointed red star.|$|E
