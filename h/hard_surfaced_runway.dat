50|$|Until the mid-1980s, {{the runway}} was a grass strip. This was {{replaced}} by a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runway</b> with temporary buildings. The airport started operations in 1986 and was developed with funds and assistance from the Government of Ireland, private investors, Donegal County Council, the International Fund for Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund. In the 1990s the runway was extended to 1500 m and a new terminal building with modern navigational aids and equipment was added.|$|R
5000|$|The federal {{government}} acquired the airport {{at the city}} of Marianna in 1942 and added 1915 acre additional in order to construct the Marianna Army Air Field for the U.S. Army Air Forces. The airfield opened on 8 August 1942 and eventually had six <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runways</b> averaging 4000 ft in length and was a training base for the Southeast Army Air Force Training Command. In addition to the main airfield, Marianna AAF also had the following known sub-bases and auxiliaries ...|$|R
50|$|From November 1942 until June 1944, {{small numbers}} of American Army Air Forces flight cadets trained {{alongside}} the RAF students. During 1943 the school was expanded from 200 students to 300 students and two 3,000' asphalt <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runways</b> were constructed by the Defense Plant Corporation (an agency of the US Government which had assumed ownership of the physical assets of all civiliam flight schools in the United States). These runways remain in use today, with 17/35 being extended to 5000' after the war.|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{the federal}} {{government}} took over the airport: From 1938 until 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps and the California National Guard used 218 acres as an aerial observation training center; In 1940 the War Department added <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runways</b> and lights, barracks, hangars, and mechanic shops. In 1940 and 1941, 183 private pilots and 20 advanced students were trained here though a federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program for armed services fliers. In 1943, the Navy began using the airport as a training center for the Pacific Fleet.|$|R

50|$|The Nieuport 11 is {{constructed}} from 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, supported with 2024-T3 aluminum gussets, {{held together with}} blind rivets. At one point welded steel tube fuselages were also available. The wings, tail and fuselage are then covered with doped aircraft fabric. Landing gear is conventional, with 24 in spoked mainwheels with bungee suspension. The original design calls for a tailskid, {{the same as the}} World War One original aircraft, but since the skid is impractical on <b>hard</b> <b>surfaced</b> <b>runways,</b> a tailwheel is optional. The engine cowling is a horseshoe shaped semi-circular design.|$|R
50|$|Opened as Okmulgee Field in 1942 as a United States Army Air Forces airfield. Originally {{had three}} 6'000 <b>hard</b> <b>surfaced</b> <b>runways,</b> (00/18; 04/27; 15/33). began {{training}} United States Army Air Corps cadets {{under contract to}} Sooner Air Training Corp.

25|$|There are 43 {{airports}} in the Upper Peninsula. Of these, six airports have commercial passenger service: Gogebic-Iron County Airport north of Ironwood, Houghton County Memorial Airport southwest of Calumet, Ford Airport west of Iron Mountain, Sawyer International Airport south of Marquette, Delta County Airport in Escanaba, and Chippewa County International Airport south of Sault Ste. Marie. There are 19 other public use airports with a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runway.</b> These {{are used for}} general aviation and charter. Notably, Mackinac Island, Beaver Island, and Drummond Island are all accessible by airports. There are five public access airports with turf runways and thirteen airports for the private use of their owners. There is only one control tower in the Upper Peninsula, at Sawyer.|$|R
50|$|The US Navy {{moved its}} anti-submarine air-patrol {{operations}} {{from the old}} NAS Bermuda flying boat base, to the USAF Base at Kindley Field when its Martin P5M Marlin flying boats were removed from service in the 1960s. They were replaced by Lockheed P-2 Neptune landplanes, which could not operate from the existing Naval Air Station, which had no <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runway</b> ashore. The US Navy took over the airfield entirely from the USAF in 1970 and the base continued to operate anti-submarine patrols, first with Neptunes, then with Lockheed P-3 Orions. In the 1980s, the P-3s were occasionally augmented by carrier-based S-3 Vikings operating ashore, as well as Canadian Forces' Lockheed CP-140 Aurora and Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.2 aircraft.|$|R
50|$|On August 8, 1941, the Marine Corps leased {{the airport}} to become an {{outlying}} field of Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and named it OLF Camp Mitchell. In the beginning of 1942, the Army Air Forces used the field for anti-submarine patrols. The field was later closed for seven months during 1942 while two <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runways</b> and a runway lighting system were installed. The first Marine aviation units began {{to arrive at the}} field in February 1943. Among the units to train at the field during the war was Marine Aircraft Group 34 and fighter squadrons VMF-324 and VMF-511. In January 1944, plans were announced to expand the field. However, these plans were abandoned because the Marine Corps acquired surplus Army fields.|$|R

2500|$|Each Predator air vehicle can be {{disassembled}} {{into six}} main components and loaded into a container nicknamed [...] "the coffin." [...] This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station {{and it is}} designed to roll into a C-130 Hercules. The Predator primary satellite link consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40meters (5,000 by 125ft) of <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runway</b> with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.|$|R
50|$|The Luftwaffe was {{especially}} interested in the Netherlands, as the country was designated to become the main area {{for the air force}} bases from which to attack the United Kingdom. The Germans started construction of 10 so-called , major military airports, on the day after the formal Dutch surrender, 15 May 1940. Each of these was intended to have at least 2 or 3 <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runways,</b> a dedicated railway connection, major built-up and heated repair and overhaul facilities, extensive indoor and outdoor storage spaces, and most had housing and facilities for 2000 to 3000 men. Each Fliegerhorst also had an auxiliary and often a decoy airfield, complete with mock-up planes made from plywood. The construction work was performed by Dutch contractors and Dutch workers on a totally voluntary basis. The largest became Deelen Air Base, north of Arnhem (12 former German buildings at Deelen are now national monuments). Adjacent to Deelen, the large central air control bunker for Belgium and the Netherlands, Diogenes, was set up.|$|R
50|$|STS-33 Discovery (November 22-27, 1989). Launched at night, this five-day mission carried Department of Defense {{payloads}} {{and other}} secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this highly successful mission {{concluded with a}} <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> landing on <b>Runway</b> 4 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.|$|R
50|$|There are rumours that it {{was built}} in 1942, and that the <b>hard</b> <b>surfaced</b> wartime <b>runways</b> have been removed, along with all of the {{buildings}} and former wartime structures. This is not true. Donnington Airpark was not a World War II airstrip. The airpark and associated grass runways were constructed on virgin bushland by Ray Smith in 1969, as a satellite airfield to Townsville Airport, for general aviation. It has never had a sealed surface. There are other airfields in the Woodstock area.|$|R
50|$|The Lancaster Airport {{was formed}} over 75 {{years ago as}} a private airport. In 1933 the Lancaster Joint Aviation Committee was formed and the {{decision}} made to operate a municipal airport. Using War Relief Funds and knowing that the airport would benefit the local unemployed constructors the Lancaster Joint Aviation Committee moved forward on modernizing the airport. They purchased 180 acres of farmland in southern Lititz and constructed the airport. In 1936 Lancaster became the second airport in Pennsylvania to two <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> <b>runways</b> and was certified for both night and daytime operations. After World War II the airport was becoming obsolete so using government funds the airport was expanded and modernized with 22% of the funds needed for the update being raised by the community. On June 18, 1949 the airport was dedicated after upgrades were completed. Over the years the airport continued to improve; the terminal was renovated and expanded in the mid-1990s. Most recently runway 8/26 was expanded in length bringing it to 6,934 feet long and 150 feet wide.|$|R
50|$|On July 4, 1958, the Ghanaian {{government}} established Ghana Airways connecting Ghana {{with other}} countries. By the mid-1990s, Ghana Airways operated international scheduled passenger and cargo service to numerous European, Middle Eastern, and African destinations, including London, Düsseldorf, Rome, Abidjan, Dakar, Lagos, Lomé, and Johannesburg. As {{a result of}} persistent management and financial problems, Ghana Airways ceased all operations and entered into liquidation in 2004. Ghana has twelve airports, six with <b>hard</b> <b>surfaced</b> <b>runways.</b> The most important are Kotoka International Airport at Accra and airports at Sekondi-Takoradi, Kumasi, and Tamale that serve domestic air traffic. In 1990, the government spent US$12 million to improve Accra's facilities. Workmen resurfaced the runway, upgraded the lighting system and built a new freight terminal. Construction crews also extended and upgraded the terminal building at Kumasi. In early 1991, the government announced further plans to improve Accra's international airport. The main runway was upgraded, improvements were made in freight landing and infrastructure, and the terminal building and the airport's navigational aids were upgraded.|$|R
50|$|February 2015:Planning {{application}} to make {{improvements to the}} Airport were approved by Medway Council. This will bring a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> for the <b>runway,</b> refurbishment of the original 1930s hangar, a new tower and hub building providing improved facilities for the Airfield Club(PAFRA) and for local business, recreational and business flyers.|$|R
