40|$|Top {{commercial}} banks {{seemed to have}} weathered the debt crisis, however {{it remains to be}} seen whether their current strength and stability will help reestablish normal credit relationships between private banks and the developing countries. Some losses by private creditors are likely to be part of any resolution of the debt crisis, and such losses are implicit in some of the many proposals for dealing with the crisis. However, through a combination of self interest and public policy the current impasse in the debt crisis should be overcome. This may be done partly through large scale <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> sponsored by private or public agencies. <b>Debt</b> <b>swaps</b> are already being implemented bilaterally in small steps and through a variety of instruments, including debt conversions and buybacks.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{worldwide}} commitments to meet global basic learning needs made at the 1990 United Nations Conference on Education for All (EFA) in Jomtien, the 2000 World Education Forum in Dakar and the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit in New York, UNESCO has established a Working Group on <b>Debt</b> <b>Swaps</b> for Education which has met on two occasions so far, in 2006 and 2007. Drawing on experiences of bilateral donors such as Spain and Germany, this UNESCO Working Group is now promoting debt-for-education swaps, constructions whereby external debt is cancelled by the creditor {{in exchange for the}} debtor government’s commitment to mobilise domestic resources for education sector spending. The experience with <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> in the mid 1990 s was, however, far from positive, and recent improved insight in the economics of debt relief suggests extreme caution. In reviewing debt-for-education swaps between Germany and Indonesia and between Spain and El Salvador, this paper examines to what extent these second- generation <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> differ from their contested predecessors. We argue that, while the Paris Declaration’s principles of policy and system alignment appear to have been fairly well implemented on education sector level in both case studies considered, it is mainly the macro-economic nature of such swaps that remains problematic. For debt relief to hold at least some promise of translating into an efficient and effective instrument of development, it should be large and comprehensive, {{as in the case of}} the HIPC Initiative and its successor the MDRI. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{frequent}} failure of the <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> is not an accident. Instead, it follows from fundamental forces driven by the market's assessment of the scarcity of fiscal revenue relative to the demand for fiscal outlays. It follows from the observation that arbitrage forces systematically impact prices in asset markets. Ignoring these price adjustments would lead to too optimistic {{an assessment of the}} gains from swaps or buybacks. A by-product of our paper is to highlight the perils of financial engineering that ignores the intertemporal constraints imposed by fiscal fundamentals. As a country approaches the range of partial default (either on domestic or external <b>debt),</b> <b>swaps</b> may not provide the expected breathing room and could even bring the crisis forward. Our methodology combines three independent themes: exchange rate crises as the manifestation of excessive monetary injections [Krugman-Flood-Garber], the fiscal theory of inflation [Sargent-Wallace (1981) ], and sovereign debt. The integrated framework derives devaluation and external debt repudiation as part of a public-finance optimizing problem. We shows that under conditions similar to those which prevailed in Russia and Argentina prior to their meltdown, swaps are not just neutral, but could actually make the situation worse and even trigger a speculative attack. An unsettlingly clear implication of the model is that there may be very few options left once public debt reaches levels regarded as unsustainable in relation to fiscal fundamentals. Dollarization only makes matters worse, and pushes the debt write-down option to the fore. ...|$|R

40|$|The authors argue {{clearly and}} convincingly {{in this book}} that the debt crisis which has plagued the world economy {{for the past ten}} years is due to the {{inherent}} fragility of financial markets. Governments, financial institutions and borrowers, including developing countries, have simply expected too much from these markets. In a world of volatile interest rates, exchange rates and uncertain government policy, it is virtually impossible for financial institutions to effectively distinguish fundamental shifts in economic activity from random shocks.
