5|$|This {{new system}} allowed rural {{residents}} to migrate, {{it did not}} allow them to change their residence or accept any benefits in the cities. This resulted in a growing population of migrant laborers without the minimal benefits of residency including medical care, housing, or education. Many migrant women <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> the government to protect their rights. Today, up to 90% of migrants work without contracts, in violation of the Chinese labour law.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> the police, who they feel are {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E

25|$|Shi'a Muslims {{do not use}} the {{six major}} hadith {{collections}} followed by the Sunni, as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> many of the Sunni narrators and transmitters. They have their own extensive hadith literature. The best-known hadith collections are The Four Books, which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'. The Four Books are: Kitab al-Kafi by Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni al-Razi (329 AH), Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih by Muhammad ibn Babuya and Al-Tahdhib and Al-Istibsar both by Shaykh Muhammad Tusi. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as {{far as to say that}} suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E
25|$|In early 2009 tests by the Vietnam Institute of Biotechnology showed {{widespread}} {{contamination of}} municipal tap water, including {{high levels of}} e-coli. Most residents boil drinking water, because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> {{the quality of the}} tap water, or use bottled water. Some tap water samples were also contaminated with ammonia at levels that were 6–18 times higher than the allowed level. Ammonia in drinking water is not a direct health risk, but it can compromise disinfection efﬁciency, cause the failure of some filters, and it causes taste and odor problems. Arsenic levels were two to three times higher than acceptable according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Bacteria were also found in bottled water samples, according to analyses by the Ho Chi Minh City health department in 2009, leading to more than 38 water bottling firms ordered to be closed.|$|E
25|$|About {{one third}} of the women {{experienced}} sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. Inability to concentrate on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as {{directly}} rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being [...] "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies." [...] Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, [...] "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put it bluntly, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>trust</b> the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in our countries and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not say one word against imperialism, on the contrary, [...] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." [...] He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand [...] "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," [...] to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had [...] "slipped" [...] from its positions. [...] "According to you," [...] Khrushchev continued, [...] "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." [...] The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, [...] "You are like Stalin who killed people," [...] to which Hoxha replied, [...] "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too." ...|$|E
