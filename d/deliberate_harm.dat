40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> in adolescents and the factors associated with it. DESIGN: Cross sectional survey using anonymous self report questionnaire. SETTING: 41 schools in England. PARTICIPANTS: 6020 pupils aged 15 and 16 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <b>Deliberate</b> self <b>harm.</b> RESULTS: 398 (6. 9 %) participants reported an act of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> {{in the previous year}} that met study criteria. Only 12. 6 % of episodes had resulted in presentation to hospital. <b>Deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> was more common in females than it was in males (11. 2 % v 3. 2 %; odds ratio 3. 9, 95 % confidence interval 3. 1 to 4. 9). In females the factors included in a multivariate logistic regression for <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> were recent self harm by friends, self harm by family members, drug misuse, depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and low self esteem. In males the factors were suicidal behaviour in friends and family members, drug use, and low self esteem.

5000|$|There {{are many}} points of study within suicidology. Suicidology studies not only death by suicide and {{attempted}} suicide but also partial self-destruction, suicidal ideation, parasuicide, and self-destructive behaviors and attitudes. Suicidal ideation is {{when someone is}} having thoughts and/ or showing gestures of suicide. For example, {{it could be as}} simple as someone saying that [...] "life is not worth living any more" [...] or it can be extreme as [...] "I'm going to kill myself by jumping off a bridge." [...] Parasuicide is when someone causes <b>deliberate</b> <b>harm</b> to themselves. For example, if someone were to take an overdose of medicine and live. Self-destructive behaviors are anything that cause harm to oneself. This can be intentional or unintentional. Some examples are alcoholism, risky sports, some sexual disorders, and eating disorders. [...] By way of a suicide note the person who is suiciding has the last word. It is also a way for the person to explain, bring closure (or not), to give guilt, to dictate wishes, to control, to forgive or to blame. Here is a list of the parts that might go into a suicide note.|$|E
40|$|Background: Hospital-treated <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> {{and suicide}} among older adults have rarely been {{examined}} {{at a national}} level. Methods: The Irish Central Statistics Office provided suicide and undetermined death data for 1980 - 2006. The National Registry of <b>Deliberate</b> Self <b>Harm</b> collected data relating to <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> presentations made in 2006 - 2008 to all 40 Irish hospital emergency departments. Results: Rates of female suicide among older adults (over 55 years) were relatively stable in Ireland during 1980 - 2006 whereas male rates increased in the 1980 s and decreased in more recent decades. Respectively, the annual male and female suicide and undetermined death rate was 22. 1 and 7. 6 per 100, 000 in 1997 - 2006. Male and female <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> was 3. 0 and 11. 0 times higher at 67. 4 and 83. 4 per 100, 000, respectively. <b>Deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> and suicide decreased in incidence with increasing age. <b>Deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> generally involved drug overdose (male: 72 %; female 85 %) or self-cutting (male: 15 %; female 9 %). The most common methods of suicide were hanging (41 %) and drowning (29 %) for men and drowning (39 %) and drug overdose (24 %) for women.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{accounts}} of those {{with a history of}} <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> but who no longer do so, to understand how they perceive this resolution and to identify potential implications for provision of health services. DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth interview study. SETTING: Interviews in a community setting. PARTICIPANTS: 20 participants selected from a representative cohort identified in 1997 after an episode of deliberate self poisoning that resulted in hospital treatment. Participants were included if they had no further episodes {{for at least two years}} before interview. RESULTS: We identified three recurrent themes: the resolution of adolescent distress; the recognition of the role of alcohol as a precipitating and maintaining factor in self harm; and the understanding of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> as a symptom of untreated or unrecognised illness. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> who no longer harm themselves talk about their experiences in terms of lack of control over their lives, either through alcohol dependence, untreated depression, or, in adolescents, uncertainty within their family relationships.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an intervention based in general practice on the incidence of repeat episodes of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm.</b> Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial in which 98 general practices were assigned in equal numbers to an intervention or a control group. The intervention comprised {{a letter from the}} general practitioner inviting the patient to consult, and guidelines on assessment and management of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> for the general practitioner to use in consultations. Control patients received usual general practitioner care. Setting: General practices within Avon, Wiltshire, and Somerset Health Authorities, whose patients lived within the catchment area of four general hospitals in Bristol and Bath. Participants: 1932 patients registered with the study practices who had attended accident and emergency departments at one of the four hospitals after an episode of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm.</b> Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was occurrence of a repeat episode of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> in the 12 months after the index episode. Secondary outcomes were number of repeat episodes and time to first repeat. Results: The incidence of repeat episodes of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> was not significantly different for patients in the intervention group compared with the control group (odds ratio 1. 2, 95 % confidence interval 0. 9 to 1. 5). Similar findings were obtained for the number of repeat episodes and time to first repeat. Subgroup analyses indicated that there was no differential effect of the intervention according to patient's sex (P= 0. 51) or method used to cause <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> (P= 0. 64). The treatment seemed to be beneficial for people with a history of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm,</b> but it was associated with an adverse effect in people for whom the index episode was their first episode (interaction P= 0. 017). Conclusions: An invitation to consult, sent by the general practitioner of patients who have deliberately harmed themselves, and the use of management guidelines during any subsequent consultation did not reduce the incidence of repeat self harm. A subgroup analysis that indicated that patients who had previously harmed themselves benefited from the intervention was inconsistent with previous evidence and should be treated with caution. More research is needed on how to manage patients who deliberately harm themselves, to reduce the incidence of repeat episodes.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{increased}} awareness concerning links between violence to nonhuman animals and violence to humans. This {{has resulted in}} a number of cross-reporting initiatives between family service providers and animal welfare orga-nizations. The success of these initiatives rests on individuals being willing to report such violence. Thus, {{there is a need to}} determine which variables influence an individ-ual’s willingness to report deliberate animal cruelty and abuse. The aim of this study was to examine demographic and attitudinal variables to ascertain their impact on propensity to report deliberate animal harm. A telephone questionnaire resulted in 1, 208 valid responses from members of the general community. Results showed a number of variables that affected the propensity to report: gender, occupation, and ac-knowledgment of the link between family violence and deliberate animal harm. This article discusses these variables and their implications. There has been a proliferation of interest during the last decade in the potential links between cruelty to nonhuman animals and violence and aggression toward humans. Research suggests that there is a link between antisocial behavior, vio-lence, and aggression toward humans and <b>deliberate</b> <b>harm</b> to animals (Arluke, Levin, Luke, & Ascione, 1999).

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} of child protection in hospitals We {{are concerned that}} there will be practical difficulties in quality assuring the healthcare recommendations in Lord Lamming’s report 1 following the Victoria Climbie ́ enquiry. There are three recommendations where hospital chief executives are specifically tasked with monitoring and ensuring compliance: N Recommendation 70 : Hospital Trust chief executives must introduce systems to ensure that no child about whom there are child protection concerns is discharged from hospital without the permission of either the consultant in charge of the child’s care or a paediatrician above the grade of senior house officer. N Recommendation 71 : Hospital Trust chief executives must introduce systems to ensure that no child about whom there are child protection concerns is discharged from hospital without a documented plan for the future care of the child. The plan must include follow up arrangements. N Recommendation 73 : When a child is admitted to hospital and <b>deliberate</b> <b>harm</b> is suspected, the doctor or nurse admitting the child must enquire about previous admissions to hospital. In the event of a positive response, information concerning the previous admissions must be obtained from the other hospitals. The consultant in charge of the case must review this information when making decisions about the child’s future care and management. Many hospitals will have developed protocols to address these recommendations; however it may be more difficult to develop effective and efficient systems to monitor and ensure compliance. This is because at present admissions to hospital are coded using the ICD 10 coding system in which there are no codes for ‘‘concerns about deliberate harm’’. If Lord Lamming’s recommendations are to be quality assured, consideration needs to be given to introducing a method to record these children with concerns about <b>deliberate</b> <b>harm</b> in a systematic way.

It is observed in {{both men and}} women with various psychiatric disorders, but most of those who self-mutilate are women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Cocaine addiction is a significant worldwide public health problem, associated with somatic, psychological, psychiatric, socioeconomic and legal complications. Amphetamine use, but not cocaine use, has previously been associated with severe self-injurious behavior. CASE: We report here a case of a female patient with recurring self-injurious behavior ("the pleasure of bleeding") induced by cocaine abuse. DISCUSSION: The clinical characteristics of self-mutilation are manifold and {{there is a lack of}} agreement about its etiology. The complex behavior associated with cocaine abuse may be one cause of self-mutilation.

METHODS: A non-randomised intervention study that compared the psychosocial assessment of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> patients before and after a one hour teaching session for the A&E departments nursing and junior medical staff. Adequacy of psychosocial assessment was judged by examining A&E case notes. The records of the hospital's parasuicide team were examined to assess administrative changes. Staff attitude to and knowledge of <b>deliberate</b> self <b>harm</b> were also measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: 45 of 52 nurses and all 15 junior medical staff attended the teaching session. Sixteen (13 %) of 125 sets of records before and 58 (46 %) of 127 sets of records after the intervention were judged to be adequate. In the postintervention period, notes {{were more likely to be}} judged adequate when a proforma was used as part of the assessment (52 of 66 with a proforma and six of 61 without a proforma, chi 2 = 60, p < 0. 01).
