40|$|Um grupo de 67 conjuntos de cafeeiros procedentes do Departamento de Agricultura dos Estados Unidos foi recebido, em 1953, em Campinas. Destes conjuntos, 8 são oriundos da Etiópia, aí coletados por P. Sylvain, 10 de Tanganica e Quênia, porém de origem etiope, 11 correspondem a seleções da Índia, 24 de Tanganica, 10 de Quênia, 1 da Congo e 3 do Sudão². Em vista do número variável de plantas por conjunto, foram êles plantados em Campinas em dois ensaios comparativos, tendo como testemunhas linhagens selecionadas dos cultivares 'Bourbon Vermelho' 'Bourbon Amarelo' e 'Mundo Novo'. Analisaram-se o desenvolvimento dos cafeeiros, o seu vigor vegetativo, produção total de café cereja em cinco anos, tipos de sementes produzidas, tamanho das sementes do tipo chato e ocorrência de frutos com lojas sem sementes, fazendo-se referência especial aos conjuntos da Etiópia e do Sudão. Notou-se acentuada variabilidade no que {{concerne}} a êstas características nos conjuntos de procedência etiope. Assim, quanto à altura média dos cofeeifos, 8 conjuntos mostraram-se bem crescidos e 10 deram altura mais reduzida e, quanto ao vigor, apenas 5 conjuntos revelaram-se promissores. Dentre êstes, os de melhor aspecto vegetativo são o café 'Harar', 'Amfillo', 'Dalle Mixed' e 'Dilla' e, o pior deles, o 'Ennarea'. Os três conjuntos do Sudão não apresentam bom aspecto vegetativo. Quanto à produção, os conjuntos 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Gimma Tana, 'Amfillo', 'Dilla & Alghe' mostraram-se produtivos, enquanto o 'Ennarea', 'Mattu', 'Gimma Galla Sidamo', 'Gimma Mbuni' deram as piores produções dos ensaios, indicando a sua falta de adaptação ao nosso meio. Também os cafés do Sudão mostraram-se pouco produtivos. O conjunto 'Harar', além de ter produção comparável ao melhor testemunha do ensaio, encerro algumas plantas com maturação dos frutos tardia, de certo interêsse no plano de melhoramento. Notou-se também acentuada variação no comportamento das seleções do Quênia e Tanganica, mostrando-se algumas promissoras e outras reduzidas. Quase todas as seleções da Índia, ao contrário, comportaram-se mal. As porcentagens de semente do tipo chato revelaram-se abaixo de 80 por cento em 9 dos 18 conjuntos da Etiópia e apenas os cultivares 'Harar', 'Dalle Mixed' e 'Erithean Moca' deram quantidades maiores destas sementes. Os três conjuntos do Sudão deram porcentagem abaixo de 80. As do tipo moca atingiram porcentagens elevadas, acima de 15 por cento, em 14 dos 18 conjuntos, enquanto as do tipo concha são em quantidades normais em 15 conjuntos, sendo mais elevadas no café 'Ennaera' e 'Dilla'. Os três conjuntos do Sudão têm elevada quantidade de sementes do tipo moca e baixa quantidade de sementes do tipo concha. O tamanho dos grãos do tipo chato mostrou-se favorável em cinco conjuntos, sendo que o 'Harar' tem peneira das mais altas. Os dados mostraram que o aproveitamento dêste material da Etiópia poderá ser feito sòmente mediante seleção para tipos de sementes normais. O conjunto da Índia revelaram-se os menos promissores no que se refere às porcentagens de sementes do tipo chato. A constatação da ocorrência de plantas com elevada quantidade de frutos chochos, sem sementes, mostrou que o defeito ocorre em alguns conjuntos da Etiópia, Tanganica, Quênia e particulamente na Índia. A análise morfológica efetuada indicou que os conjuntos 'Harar', 'Gimma Tana', 'Ennaera', 'Tafari Kela', 'Agaro' e 'Gimma Mbuni' devem constituir variedades botânicas novas e que os cafés 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Amfillo', 'Dilla' e 'Dilla & Alghe' são promissores, podendo de ser utilizados no plano de melhoramentos em execução em Campinas. After a {{very thorough}} quarantine examination, the Plant Introduction Division of U. S. Department of Agriculture sent to Campinas, in 1953, 67 groups of coffee seedlings, developed from seeds obtained in various African coffee regions and from India. Eight {{out of the}} 67 groups of seedlings come directly from Etiópia, where they were collected by Sylvain; 10 from Tanganyka and Kenya but of Ethiopian origin; 16 from selected strains of India, 24 from Tanganyika, 10 from Kenya, 3 from Sudan and 1 from Congo. Two experiments to study the yield variability of these groups, were established with these seedlings in Campinas using selected strains of the cultivars 'Mundo Novo', 'Bourbon Amarelo' and 'Bourbon Vermelho', for yield comparison. The groups from Ethiopia reacted very differently to our condition. From these 18 groups, 8 revealed good average plant height and 10 groups showed very poor development. The groups introduced are not well adapted since only 'Harar', 'Amfillo', 'Dalle Mixed' and 'Dilla' presented good vegetative vigor. The 'Ennarea' group was the weakest. All three groups from Sudan have not developed well in Campinas. The analysis of the total weight of cherries produced {{in the last five}} years pointed out that among the Ethiopian groups 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Gimma Tana' 'Amfillo' and 'Dilla & Alghe' are good yielders, white the 'Ennarea', 'Mattu', 'Gimma Gallo Sidamo' and 'Gimma Mbuni', had the lowest yields in the experiments. Besides being a high yielder, the 'Harar' group contains a few late maturing plants which are of interest to our coffee breeding program. The group of Sudan gave very poor yield. Considerable variation was also observed among the selections from Tonganyka and Kenya, a few of them being promising due to the high yield. Most of the Indian selections are very poor yielders. Percentages of flat beans lower than 80 per cent, were found in 9 of the 18 Ethiopian groups, the 'Harar', 'Dalle Mixed' and 'Erithreon Moca' being the only groups with a good percentage of these normal beans. Peaberry type of seeds in proportion higher than 15 per cent were observed in 14 of the 18 Ethiopian groups, while the percentage of the abnormal elephant-beans (shell beans) is higher only in the groups 'Ennarea' and 'Dilla'. The three groups from Sudan gave low <b>flat</b> <b>bean</b> percentages and high amount of peaberry type of seeds. The size of the flat beans is considered good in 5 of the 18 groups, the 'Harar' group having large normal flat seeds. The plants of Ethiopion origin must be submitted to an intensive selection for high percentage of large flat beans, before being used in our coffee breeding program. The Indian groups are the least promising ones, having given very low <b>flat</b> <b>bean</b> percentages. The incidence of plants possessing high number of cherries with empty locules indicated the occurrence of this seed defect in coffee plants from Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Kenya and particularly from India. Differences in the morphological characteristics of the Ethiopian coffee pointed out that at least the 'Harar', 'Gimmo Tana', 'Ennarea', 'Tafari Kela', 'Agoro', and 'Gimma Mbuni', may be considered as new botanical varieties of Coffea arabica. The 'Harar', 'Tafari Kela', 'Amfillo', 'Dilla' and 'Dilla & Alghe' are promising material for breeding purposes. Some of their representatives can be used directly in the development of new progenies or in hybridization with coffee strains, which have been selected in Campinas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} twelve doubled haploids (DHs) of Theobroma cacao L. used as parents, a trial {{was set up}} in Côte d’Ivoire. Several traits were observed, such as yield, vigour, yield/vigour ratios, resistance to the black pod disease caused by Phy-tophthora, percentage of <b>flat</b> <b>beans</b> and mean weight of 100 cocoa beans. Out of the three progenies derived from crosses between two DHs, two showed severe draw-backs. A reduction of the heterogeneity within these progenies was occasionally ob-served for some of the traits, but failed to be consistent. When tested as female parents in combination with diploid testers, some of the DHs showed a significantly higher combining value than their parents for traits such as the mean weight of 100 beans and the yield/canopy surface ratio. The results showed the potential of DHs to improve se-lected parents in only one cycle of selection but more crosses between two DHs need to be tested in order to evaluate potential of the resulting F 1 progenies.

Thirty-nine progenies were evaluated in the 4 th generation by selfing after the 2 nd backcross between “Catuai ” and “Mundo Novo”. The evaluations were realized in coffee plants from 30 months old on, having the following characteristics: yield of eight harvests, classification for blend 16 and over, percentage of floating fruits, vegetative vigor and percentage of <b>flat</b> <b>beans.</b> The analytical procedures of selection indexes showed possibilities of applications in advanced generations of breeding being superior when compared with DIS. The DGI was not appropriate in the situation analyzed in this work.

The RI decreased up to 18 % in fruits from unripe (green) to overripe (raising) stage. In seven localities evaluated fruit RI's varied up to 12 %. In two different sites of the same locality variation on RI up to 6 % was observed. It was observed a difference of 2 % among four experimental plots in the same site. Plants of the same cultivar grown in a single experimental plot displayed RI with differences up to 3, 7 %. In the same locality variations up to 330 meters in altitude were positively correlated with variations up to 4, 4 % in the RI. Regarding to {{the influence of}} the fruit position within the plant it was observed that RI decreased, up to 4, 4 % if the fruits are located farther from the orthotropic branch, 1, 5 % in the East side and 0, 5 % at the middle and upper parts of the plants. The results pointed out that there are considerable environmental influences on the intrinsic outturn of coffee. For breeding purposes, selection for higher RI's must be based on standard sampling as to ripening stage, position in the plant, and be representative of at least 10 plants of uniform progenies evaluated in the same experimental plot...|$|R

40|$|A variedade bourbon de Coffea arabica, uma das variedades de maior interêsse econômico para São Paulo, desde 1933 vem sendo submetida a sucessivas autofecundações, com a finalidade de {{investigar}} o seu efeito sôbre a produção e o desenvolvimento geral das plantas. Neste trabalho são apresentados os dados relativos a um ensaio no qual foram incluídos, além de duas progênies So de Bourbon, progênies S 1, S 2, S 3 e S 4 derivadas dessas duas plantas matrizes e também híbridos F 1 entre plantas das gerações S 0, S 2 e S 4. Notou-se. de um modo geral, que as autofecundações sucessivas não tiveram efeito sôbre a produção total nos anos 1955 a 1958 e nem sôbre a altura, vigor vegetativo das plantas e os tipos de sementes produzidas. As variâncias correspondentes às produções, altura e vigor das plantas, não mostraram tendência de aumento ou redução como resultado das autofecundações. Comparando as variâncias dos híbridos F 1 com as das progenies das plantas que lhes deram origem notou-se que, no geral, foi maior tanto para a produção como altura e vigor das plantas, embora em quase todos os casos as diferenças não se tenham mostrado significativas. Os dados indicam que no café Bourbon a autofecundação deve ser freqüente, tal como ocorre na var. cera de C. arabica. Indicam, também, que os cafeeiros Bourbon selecionados podem ser multiplicados por autofecundação sem perigo de redução do vigor e produtividade das plantas. Coffea arabica var. bourbon, one of {{the main}} economic varieties grown in São Paulo is being subjected to successive selfing since 1933, in order to investigate the influence of this procedure on yield and development of the plants. Data concerning one trial are here discussed in which progenies of two So Bourbon mother trees were analysed in comparison with progenies S 1, S 2, S 3, and S 4 derived from these mother trees and also F 1 hybrids between plants of the So, S 2 and S 4 generations. It has been observed that successive selfing do not influence yield, height or vigor of the coffee trees, percentaga of peaberry and elephant beans and also the size of the normal <b>flat</b> <b>beans.</b> The variance values for total yield (1955 to 1958), height and vigor of the trees do not show any tendency to be increased or reduced as a result of successive selfings. A comparison of the variances of F 1 hybrids with the variances of the progenies of the parents of these hybrids indicated that, in a general way, the F 1 hybrid variances relative to the yield, plant height and vigor were higher but not statistically significant, except in one comparison. These data indicate that in the Bourbon coffee natural selfing must be frequent such as happens in the cera variety of Coffeea arabica. They also pointed out that the selected Bourbon plants can be maintained by artificial selfing of their flowers for th. 3 establishment of the multiplication plots, without expecting reduction in the yield or vigor of the plants. Artificial hybridization, for the further improvement of the bourbon variety must then be based on outcrosses with different genotypes...|$|R

Foram mensuradas também as seguintes variáveis: índice de avaliação visual, precocidade de maturação dos frutos, porcentagem de sementes dos tipos chato, moca e concha e tamanho das sementes mediante determinação da peneira média. Diferenças significativas foram verificadas na produção dentro e entre grupos de Mundo Novo S 1, Mundo Novo S 2, Bourbon Amarelo e Bourbon Vermelho, sendo a média de produção das progênies S 1, 6 % superior à do grupo Mundo Novo S 2. Foram observadas nas progênies de Mundo Novo S 1 e S 2, respectivamente, produtividade 39 % e 30 % superior à do Bourbon Amarelo e 112 % e 99 %, respectivamente, à do Bourbon Vermelho. Entre as 30 progênies mais produtivas, 4 pertencem à geração S 2 e as restantes à geração S 1 de Mundo Novo, indicando a eficiência da primeira seleção realizada em 1943. De modo geral, verificaram-se nas melhores progênies da cultivar Mundo Novo maturação média, sendo CP 447, a mais precoce e CP 502, a mais tardia. Apenas a progênie CP 474 conseguiu peneira média superior às demais. Com o presente trabalho, concluiu-se que as progênies da cultivar Mundo Novo têm ótima capacidade produtiva, boa longevidade e excelente rusticidade. As novas seleções evidenciaram ainda mais o valor dessa cultivar, sendo uma das mais produtivas que se conhece em C. arabica. Coffea arabica L. cv. Mundo Novo is {{the most}} outstanding coffee cultivars studied at the Instituto Agronômico, Campinas, State of São Paulo. Besides its rusticity, this cultivar has showed high yield capacity in all Brazilian coffee growing areas. In order to further diversify the Mundo Novo genetic background, new selection of mother trees was undertaken, in 1952, in six sites where former selections were made in Urupês, SP. Four groups of coffee progenies were planted to be compared at the Central Experimental Station, in Campinas, SP: 92 new selections (S 1), 12 progenies of selected Mundo Novo (S 2), 6 selected progenies of Bourbon Amarelo and 7 progenies of Bourbon Vermelho cultivars of C. arabica. The 117 progenies were planted in a randomized block design, with one-plant plots and 21 replications. Yield {{data were collected from}} individual plants during 33 consecutive annual harvests, from 1955 to 1987. Prior to the 1985 harvest, observations were made on the shape of plants, vegetative vigor (IAV index, 1 to 10 points varying from the worst to the best, respectively), fruit ripening (1 point for early, 3 for medium and 5 for late ripening, respectively), seed characteristics, such as <b>flat</b> <b>beans,</b> peaberry and elephant beans, and seed size. Significative differences were found in the yield inside and between progenies groups - Mundo Novo S 1, Mundo Novo S 2, Bourbon Amarelo and Bourbon Vermelho. The average yield of Mundo Novo S 1 was 6 % superior to the of Mundo Novo S 2, and both groups of Mundo Novo S 1 and S 2 were more productive than Bourbon Amarelo (39 and 30 %) and the progenies of Bourbon Vermelho (112 and 99 %), respectively. Among the 30 highest Mundo Novo yield progenies, 4 belong to S 2 and 26 to S 1, Mundo Novo progenies, indicating the efficiency of the selection of S 1 progenies. The highest yield Mundo Novo progenies have medium maturation. However individual plants in the progenies were classified as early, medium or late maturing plants. The Mundo Novo progeny CP 447 gave larger number of plants with early fruit ripening and CP 502 gave the highest number of late plants. All the best Mundo Novo progenies presented normal flat, peaberry and elephant beans seed percentages and seed size. The progeny CP 474 gave several plants with larger seeds. The highest yield S 2 Mundo Novo progenies such as P 388 - 17, MP 376 - 4 and the S 1 CP 502, CP 515, CP 474, CP 447, CP 501, CP 543, CP 475, CP 464 and CP 441 have already been multiplied in seed plots and are being extensively planted in all coffee regions of Brazil...|$|R

Estudou-se a origem da plantação inicial desse café, tanto em Urupês como em Jaú, chegando-se à conclusão de que é provavelmente originário desta última localidade. Progênies do café "Mundo Novo", anteriormente conhecido por "Sumatra" e derivado de plantas selecionadas em Urupês e Jaú, acham-se em estudo em seis localidades do Estado : Campinas, Ribeirão Prêto, Pindorama, Mococa, Jaú e Monte Alegre do Sul. No presente trabalho são apenas aproveitados dados referentes à variabilidade morfológica e característicos da produção das progênies dos primeiros cafeeiros selecionados em Urupês e estudados em Campinas, Jaú, Pindorama e Mococa. Em tôdas as localidades, observou-se variação nos caracteres morfológicos das progênies, verificando-se a ocorrência de plantas quase improdutivas. A maioria das progênies, no entanto, se caracteriza por acentuado vigor vegetativo. Foram estudadas as produções totais das progénies e das plantas, no período 1946 - 1951, notando-se que algumas progénies se salientaram pela elevada produção em tôdas as localidades. Os tipos de sementes "moca", "concha" e "chato" foram determinados em amostras de tôdas as plantas, por um período de três anos, notando-se que a variação ocorrida é da mesma ordem que a encontrada em outros cafeeiros em seleção. Procurou-se eliminar, pela seleção, cafeeiros com elevada produção de frutos sem sementes em uma ou duas lojas, característico êsse que parece ser hereditário. Os resultados obtidos de cruzamento entre os melhores cafeeiros "Mundo Novo" de Campinas e plantas da variedade murta, indicaram que esses cafeeiros são do tipo bourbon. Provavelmente, êsses cafeeiros constituem recombinações de um cruzamento primitivo entre o café "Sumatra" e o bourbon. As progênies mais produtivas do café "Mundo Novo" e livres de vários dos defeitos mencionados, já se acham em multiplicação, a fim de, em breve, serem fornecidas sementes aos lavradores, que tanto interêsse têm demonstrado por êsse café. In {{the course}} of the coffee {{breeding}} project carried out at the Instituto Agronômico, outstanding progenies have been derived from mother plants selected by either of the two following methods; a) before selection, individual yield is recorded {{for a number of years}} begining with the first crop, and b) selection of mother plants is made on the basis of vegetative vigor and the crop they have at the time of selection, regardless of their previous yields. Yield data and other observations presented in this paper refer to a group of progenies derived from plants selected according to the second method. With open pollinated seeds collected the from best plants found in 1943 in a private coffee plantation at Urupês County, (formerly Mundo Novo) State of São Paulo several progenies were planted at the Experiment Stations of Campinas, Pindorama, Jaú and Mococa, with different types of soils. The original coffee plantation of Urupês had been formed with seeds collected in Mineiros do Tietê County, in a farm nearby the place where the so called Sumatra coffee (Coffea arabica var. typica) was first planted after it was privately imported from the island of Sumatra at the end of the last century. This is probably the reason why the Mundo Novo coffee, as it is called nowadays, was formerly named Sumatra de Mundo Novo. From observations on the morphological type of Mundo Novo coffee plants, it was noted that most plants in all progenies and also in private plantations are morphologically similar to the bourbon variety, while a few plants are similar to the typica variety. Artificial crosses between the highest yielding Mundo Novo plants from progenies grown in Campinas and the murta variety (ttNana) grave indication that these plants are of the bourbon type (ttNaNa) and not of the typica type (TTNaNa), as it is the case of the ordinary Sumatra coffee. It has been assumed, therefore, that the Mundo Novo coffee probably originated from a primitive natural cross between the imported Sumatra coffee and the bourbon variety, already existent in the State of São Paulo when the Sumatra coffee was introduced. The progenies of Mundo Novo coffee here studied present a majority of vigorous and productive plants and a few weak individuals with very low productivity. Total yield per plant and per progeny were analized and discussed, for the period from 1946 to 1951. It is apparent that some progenies behave equally well in all locations and that high yield variability between plants is found in all Experiment Stations. The Mundo Novo coffee does not differ from other varieties in the percentages of the commercial seed types, namely, the normal <b>flat</b> <b>beans,</b> the peaberry type, and those resulting from the simultaneous development of two or more ovules in the same fruit locule. It was found, however, that a large percentage of Mundo Novo plants regularly produce an abnormal quantity of fruits with one or two empty locules. This constitutes a defect of the Mundo Novo coffee, which probably can be overcome by selection. It seems that this defect, which is not correlated with yield, is detenruned by genetic factors. Progenies are found where the number of plants showing unusual amounts of empty fruit locules is very low, other plants being normal is this respect. The most promising Mundo Novo plants from several progenies have already been artificially self-pollinated, and the seeds thus obtained were used to plant foundation seed plots. Within a few years seeds of selected Mundo Novo coffee plants will be available to farmers in the State of São Paulo...|$|R
