Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 56 - 60). The optimal jammer placement problem is proposed and analyzed for wireless localization systems. In particular, the optimal {{location of a}} jammer node is obtained by maximizing the minimum of the Cram´er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) {{for a number of}} target nodes under location related constraints for the jammer node. For scenarios with more than two target nodes, theoretical results are derived to specify conditions under which the jammer node is located as close to a certain target node as possible, or the optimal location of the jammer node is determined by two of the target nodes. Also, explicit expressions are provided for the optimal location of the jammer node in the presence of two target nodes. In addition, in the absence of distance constraints for the jammer node, it is proved, for scenarios with more than two target nodes, that the optimal <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> lies on the convex hull formed by the locations of the target nodes and is determined by two or three of the target nodes, which have equalized CRLBs. Numerical examples are presented to provide illustrations of the theoretical results in different scenarios. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is proposed for numerically determining the optimal <b>jammer</b> <b>location.</b> At each iteration of the algorithm, the jammer node is moved one step along a straight line with the purpose of increasing the CRLB(s) of the target node(s) with the minimum CRLB in the system. It is shown that the algorithm converges almost surely to the optimal <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> under certain conditions for an infinitesimally small step size in the absence of location constraints for the jammer node. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in finding the optimal <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> and its superiority in terms of the computational complexity compared to the exhaustive search over all feasible locations. by Mehmet Necip Kurt.

40|$|Conventional <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> {{equipment}} {{consists of}} dedicated electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment installed in an aircraft pod. This is effective against {{small numbers of}} high power jammers but is less effective when the threat is large numbers of low power, low cost jammers. The low power of GPS satellite signals makes it particularly susceptible to jamming or interference. NAVSYS has solved this more difficult jammer detection and location problem through a network centric approach where data is collected from both specialized GPS receiver equipment and conventional GPS user equipment acting as jammer sensors. The data from these sensors is relayed over a data link or network to a JLOC Master Station that can use the data to derive the various jammer locations. To determine the accuracy that this technique can achieve, NAVSYS is building three types of sensors. The first uses the diagnostic data generated from conventional GPS user equipment {{to allow it to}} act as a jammer sensor. With this data from multiple sensors, jammer or interference locations can be derived. The second sensor identifies the Angle-of Arrival (AOA) of the jammer signals at the sensor. This unit is not based on an ELINT equipment design, so it is less expensive than existing <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> hardware. With the data from one moving AOA sensor collected over a period of time, the jammer or interference positions can be found. The third sensor collects data snapshots of the jammer’s RF spectrum at multiple locations. By correlating this data at the Master Station, the jammer or interference sources can be located. The design of this system will be presented. To demonstrate the capability of a network centric <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> system, the Air Force Space Battlelab has developed the GPS Availability To Overcome Resistance (GATOR) initiative. Under this effort, the applicability of a network based <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> system to battlefield conditions will be evaluated and its data timeliness will be measured. In addition, alternative navigation technologies (ANT) will be evaluated for use when GPS is not available on the battlefield. A description of this effort as well as initial test results will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The IEEE 802. 11 {{protocol}} inherently {{provides the}} same long-term throughput {{to all the}} clients associated with a given access point (AP). In this paper, we first identify a clever, low-power jamming attack that can take advan-tage of this behavioral trait: the placement of a low-power jammer {{in a way that}} it affects a single legitimate client can cause starvation to all the other clients. In other words, the total throughput provided by the corresponding AP is dras-tically degraded. To fight against this attack, we design FIJI, a cross-layer anti-jamming system that detects such intelligent jammers and mitigates their impact on network performance. FIJI looks for anomalies in the AP load distribution to efficiently perform jammer detection. It then makes decisions with regards to op-timally shaping the traffic such that: (a) the clients that are not explicitly jammed are shielded from experiencing starvation and, (b) the jammed clients receive the maximum possible throughput under the given conditions. We implement FIJI in real hardware; we evaluate its efficacy through experiments on a large-scale indoor testbed, under different traffic scenarios, network densities and <b>jammer</b> <b>locations.</b> Our measurements suggest that FIJI detects such jammers in real-time and alleviates their impact by allocating the available bandwidth in a fair and efficient way...|$|R

Finding {{the position of}} a jammer will enable the network to actively exploit a wide range of defense strategies. Thus, in this paper, we focus on developing mechanisms to localize a jammer. We first conduct jamming effect analysis to examine how a hearing range, e. g., the area from which a node can successfully receive and decode the packet, alters with the jammer’s location and transmission power. Then, we show that the affected hearing range can be estimated purely by examining the network topology changes caused by jamming attacks. As such, we solve the <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> estimation by constructing a least-squares problem, which exploits the changes of the hearing ranges.

40|$|Abstract—Jamming {{attacks are}} {{especially}} harmful when ensuring the dependability of wireless communication. Finding {{the position of}} a jammer will enable the network to actively exploit a wide range of defense strategies. In this paper, we focus on developing mechanisms to localize a jammer by exploiting neighbor changes. We first conduct jamming effect analysis to examine how the communication range alters with the jammer’s location and transmission power using free space model. Then, we show that a node’s affected communication range can be estimated purely by examining its neighbor changes caused by jamming attacks and thus, we can perform the <b>jammer</b> <b>location</b> estimation by solving a least-squares (LSQ) problem that exploits the changes of communication range. Compared with our previous iterative-search-based virtual force algorithm, our LSQ-based algorithm exhibits lower computational cost (i. e., one-step instead of iterative searches) and higher localization accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the localization challenges in real systems by building the log-normal shadowing model empirically and devising an adaptive LSQ-based algorithm to address those challenges. The extensive evaluation shows that the adaptive LSQ-based algorithm can effectively estimate the location of the jammer even in a highly complex propagation environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} sensor networks, adversaries {{can easily}} threaten the location privacy of sensor nodes using ordinary localization techniques. By collecting basic physical layer information, such as signal strength {{and time of}} arrival, adversaries can precisely locate the target nodes. Although basic anti-localization techniques based on power control and directional antennas are believed to mitigate such localization attacks in the radio physical layer, {{there has been little}} research on location privacy protection techniques by obfuscating physical layer information. In this paper, we propose a novel jamming technique that prevents adversaries from locating target nodes by mixing the jamming signal from neighboring nodes. We introduce this beneficial use of jamming technique, which uses single- or multiple- <b>jammers,</b> to improve <b>location</b> privacy while providing similar link throughputs. In addition, we introduce the Multi Cooperator Power Control (MCPC) algorithm to control jamming noise power, which further increases location privacy by actively controlling the strength of jamming noise.
