5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man <b>got</b> <b>hold</b> of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they <b>got</b> <b>hold</b> of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

In the meantime, the new Roman commander, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, advanced north and constructed a new fleet. Civilis attempted only a short encounter with his own fleet, but could not hinder the superior Roman force from landing and ravaging the island of the Batavians, leading to the negotiation of a peace soon after.|$|E

500|$|Controversy over Banglapedia {{broke out}} even before publication, when the Inqilab group, a major Bangladeshi {{newspaper}} publishing house, <b>got</b> <b>hold</b> {{of a few}} entries on religion and related issues. There have also been complaints about an omission of Jamaat-e-Islami's activities during the Bangladesh Liberation War. A study by Bdnews24.com, a news portal, claimed that Banglapedia is biased and inaccurate about Bangladesh's indigenous population. The encyclopedia is also reported to have used derogatory coinage such as Mogh for Marma and Rakhine, Tipra for Tripuri and Murang for Mros, as well as upajati (literally [...] "sub-nation", used to mean [...] "tribal") to define them all. Leaders of the indigenous community, including Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council member and Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti leader Rupayan Dewan and General secretary of Adivasi Forum Sanjib Drong, have endorsed the study's findings. Chief editor Islam acknowledged the complaint and promised to amend the second edition accordingly.|$|E

500|$|The Pistols {{were soon}} playing other {{important}} venues, debuting at Oxford Street's 100 Club on 30 March.

A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April demonstrated the band's growing musical competence, but by all accounts lacked a spark.

Two days before his disappearance, De Mauro interviewed Graziano Verzotto, a Christian Democrat politician and former right-hand man of Mattei on Sicily. Verzotto had been head of public relations of ENI and knew De Mauro quite well. Verzotto also knew Mafia boss Giuseppe Di Cristina quite well; he had been best man at De Cristina’s wedding.

500|$|Newsmakers {{believes}} that the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds helped define chamber pop as [...] "intimate, precisely arranged songs with rock's sweep but without its bluesy clamor." [...] Following the album was the group's unfinished 1966–67 work Smile, a collaboration between Brian Wilson and lyricist Van Dyke Parks that also heavily influenced the genre. According to the High Llama's Sean O'Hagan, Pet Sounds had been [...] "the beginning of the great pop experiment. But it wasn't allowed to continue, because rock and roll <b>got</b> <b>hold</b> {{of the whole thing}} and stopped it. Pop didn't take off again until this decade [...]" [...] Author Carl Wilson (no relation) says that Brian's [...] "pained vulnerability", [...] "uses of offbeat instruments", [...] "intricate harmonies", and [...] "the Smile saga itself" [...] became a common reference point for chamber pop bands. Just as ork-pop acts shared a love for Wilson, they also held an admiration for one another's work. In the late 1980s, the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records also made sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that embodied and defined the chamber pop style.|$|E
500|$|In 1677, a {{particularly}} brutal German General Kops leading {{the forces of}} Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I designed to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general for the Hungarians, , responded in kind, by flaying alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I {{had had enough of}} the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities. After the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Sicily fell under Habsburg rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming it was gone a whole eight days since last he killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled. [...] In the short-lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops <b>got</b> <b>hold</b> of Horea's 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|On the {{way back}} to the ashram, Uttanka had tied the {{earrings}} in a deerskin. While travelling, he stopped and climbed a tree to pluck some fruit for his refreshment. He tied the deerskin to a branch, but the deerskin became untied and the earrings fell on the ground. A snake immediately <b>got</b> <b>hold</b> of the earrings and vanished into an ant-hill. In grief, Uttanka fell from the tree. For 35 days, he dug the ant-hill with a stick to get the snake out and retrieve the earrings. The earth began to shake due to the repeated strikes. At that time, Indra– riding his chariot– saw Uttanka's futile efforts. As in the Adi Parva, Indra used his Vajra to enable Uttanka to enter the beautiful Nagaloka. There, Uttanka saw a horse with the [...] "tail which had black and white hair, a copper-coloured muzzle, and eye of the same colour that seemed to flame forth in splendor". The horse told Uttanka to blow from behind, as in the Adi Parva version. The horse was the fire god Agni who was the guru of Gautama, who had offered his help to retrieve the earrings. When Uttanka followed the directive of the horse, flames and smoke emerged from every pore of the horse and choked the dwellings of the snakes. Thus choked, the serpents, headed by Vasuki came out, worshipped Uttanka and surrendered the earrings and asked that they be pardoned. When Uttanka returned to the hermitage of Gautama to give the earrings to Ahalya, he narrated the sequence of events that occurred in procuring the earrings.|$|E
