5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his <b>eyes</b> <b>turned</b> towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his <b>eyes</b> <b>turned</b> red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E

50|$|In {{cases of}} accommodative esotropia, the <b>eyes</b> <b>turn</b> inward {{due to the}} effort of {{focusing}} far-sighted eyes, and the treatment {{of this type of}} strabismus necessarily involves refractive correction, which is usually done via corrective glasses or contact lenses, and in these cases surgical alignment is considered only if such correction does not resolve the <b>eye</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|R
500|$|As per Priyadas' account, Tulsidas {{followed}} {{the instruction of}} Hanumana and started living in an Ashram at Ramghat in Chitrakuta. One day Tulsidas went to perform the Parikrama (circumambulation) of the Kamadgiri mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognise them and took his eyes off them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas if he saw Rama and his brother Lakshmana on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas {{that he would have}} the sight of Rama once again the next morning. Tulsidas recalls this incident in a song of the Gitavali and laments how [...] "his <b>eyes</b> <b>turned</b> his own enemies" [...] by staying fixed to the ground and how everything happened in a trice.|$|E
500|$|Jonah is of {{symbolic}} and prophetic significance, which was commonly perceived {{and had been}} represented in countless works of art including manuscripts and stained glass windows. Through his reluctance to obey God, he was swallowed by a [...] "mighty fish". He spent three days in its belly and was eventually spewed up on dry land where he went about God's business. Jonah was thus seen as presaging Jesus, who having died by crucifixion, spent part of three days in a tomb and was raised on the third day. So, on {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel, Jonah, with the [...] "great fish" [...] beside him and his <b>eyes</b> <b>turned</b> towards God the Creator, represents a [...] "portent" [...] of the Passion and Resurrection of Christ. The Jonah figure placed right over the altar activated the Passion motif. [...] "When Perugino's altar painting was removed and... Last Judgement fresco came to cover the altar wall", after at least twenty five years Michelangelo depicted Christ just below Jonah: not only for his role as precursor of Christ, Christianity and Christocentrism, but also because his powerful torsion of the body, bent backwards from the bust to the eyes and with his forefingers that now point the glorious Jesus to the characters of the ceiling, assumes a function of link between the Old and New Testament.|$|E
2500|$|Case 1. A {{girl had}} 2 {{seizures}} in sleep at 6 years of age. In the first fit {{she was found}} vomiting vigorously, <b>eyes</b> <b>turned</b> to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and {{by the next morning}} was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her <b>eyes</b> <b>turned</b> to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, [...] "Where am I?" [...] "There, there," [...] the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later {{she closed her eyes and}} became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years. [...] The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures. [...] At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.|$|E
