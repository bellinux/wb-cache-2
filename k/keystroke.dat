5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a <b>keystroke</b> – takes place.|$|E
5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a <b>keystroke.</b> From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E

In this way, frequently used or repetitive sequences of <b>keystrokes</b> and mouse movements can be automated. Separate programs for creating these macros are called macro recorders.|$|R
30|$|Excluding {{irregular}} touches (e.g., fumbling phones) and multi-touch behaviour (e.g., zooming gestures), {{our test}} {{is focused on}} the most common case that a user types characters on a qwerty soft keyboard with his or her single-touch behaviour. The user app used for test is SMS. When a user types text in SMS, the translation results of <b>keystrokes</b> will be analyzed by IM-Visor to decide whether the <b>keystrokes</b> are sensitive. The conclusions can be classified into two types: Sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> and non-sensitive <b>keystrokes.</b>|$|R

25|$|The KLM {{is based}} on the <b>keystroke</b> level, which belongs to the family of GOMS models. The KLM and the GOMS models have in common that they only predict {{behaviour}} of experts without errors, but in contrast the KLM needs a specified method to predict the time because it does not predict the method like GOMS. Therefore, the KLM has no goals and method selection rules, which in turn makes it easier to use. The KLM resembles the model K1 from the family of GOMS models the most because both are at the <b>keystroke</b> level and possess a generic M operator. The difference is that the M operator of the KLM is more aggregated and thus larger (1.35 seconds vs. 0.62 seconds), which makes its mental operator more similar to the CHOOSE operations of the model K2. All in all, the KLM represents the practical use of the GOMS <b>keystroke</b> level.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} a keyless digital security system using a hardware programming tool. The system uses a 4 x 4 keypad that allows users to enter four <b>keystrokes</b> as security password. These <b>keystrokes</b> are converted to BCD codes by the keypad encoder. The designed system comprises of two basic components fused together as a block (the Memory logic and the Security logic). The memory logic is the storage medium for the 4 -keystrokes while the security logic compares entry <b>keystrokes</b> to <b>keystrokes</b> that are stored in the memory logic...|$|R
25|$|In the {{composing}} section, {{the operator}} enters the text for {{a line on}} the keyboard. Each <b>keystroke</b> releases a matrix from the magazine mounted above the keyboard. The matrix travels through channels to the assembler where the matrices are lined up {{side by side in}} the order they were released.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{typewriter}} designs {{removed the}} direct mechanical {{connection between the}} keys and the element that struck the paper. Not {{to be confused with}} later electronic typewriters, electric typewriters contained only a single electrical component: the motor. Where the <b>keystroke</b> had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the typebar.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keystroke</b> logging (often called keylogging) is {{a method}} of {{capturing}} and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legally to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies {{to find out about}} illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for various illegal or malicious acts. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypass other security measures.|$|E
30|$|Malicious IME apps and PHAs will upload user {{sensitive}} data to remote servers, which cause harm to users. To evaluate the defense effectiveness of IM-Visor against malicious IME apps, we construct malicious IME apps by repackaging some popular ones {{to make them}} send sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> to a remote server. We want {{to see whether they}} can still leak out sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> during the IM-Visor protection. To evaluate the defense effectiveness of IM-Visor against PHAs, we analyze the commonly used IME apps’ network packets. As we can see, without IM-Visor, these IME apps may send user sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> outside, and with IM-Visor, user sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> won’t be found in their network packets.|$|R
5000|$|Through {{analysis}} of <b>keystrokes,</b> the <b>keystrokes</b> of the input stream {{were divided into}} four classes: Correct (C), Incorrect Fixed (IF), Fixes (F), and Incorrect Not Fixed (INF). These key stroke classification are broken down into the following ...|$|R

25|$|New {{versions}} of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers {{as they come}} to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or <b>keystroke</b> logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keystroke</b> logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E
25|$|As {{implemented}} in the MS-DOS operating system and its successor Microsoft Windows, a ç/Ç pair, not required in Spanish but needed for Catalan, Portuguese, and French, is typically added, {{and the use of}} the acute accent and dieresis with capital letters (Á, É, Í, Ó, Ú, Ü) is supported. Although not needed for Spanish, another dead key with ` (the grave accent) in lower-case position and ^ (the circumflex accent) in upper-case position was included. · (the mid-line period, required in Catalan) is also found. To make room for these characters not on the standard English keyboard, characters used primarily in programming, science, and mathematics—, {, }, /, \, |, <, and >—are removed, requiring special <b>keystroke</b> sequences to access.|$|E
30|$|Isolation {{ahead of}} IME Translation Issue. In {{existing}} mobile devices, an IME app {{is the first}} entity to receive user touch events, and then translates <b>keystrokes</b> to text. To achieve a pre-IME design, we must recognize sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> and isolate them before an IME app could access them.|$|R
30|$|Challenges. To {{leverage}} {{the above}} three key ideas, {{we are facing}} three main challenges. First, in the existing modern mobile devices, an IME app is the first service to receive (sensitive or non-sensitive) <b>keystrokes</b> from Android event subsystem, and translates them to text. Distinct from a post-IME design which does a rollback after the IMEs translating <b>keystrokes,</b> in a pre-IME design, how can we intercept and isolate sensitive <b>keystrokes</b> ahead of IME translation? This is called the “Isolation ahead of IME translation issue” (Challenge 1). Second, after we succeeding in intercepting and isolating those sensitive <b>keystrokes,</b> how can we build a trusted path for user apps to access these sensitive <b>keystrokes?</b> We call it the “Trusted path issue” (Challenge 2). Finally, recalling the reason why users got incentives to use IMEs in the first paragraph, an IME app does provide convenience and extra benefits. In a pre-IME design, how can we retain the value added feature for user apps? We call it the “Benefits retaining issue” (Challenge 3).|$|R

25|$|An {{area where}} feminists have made inroads into the digital {{humanities}} {{world is the}} creation of online exhibits that highlight the history of feminism. One example is the online exhibit Click!: The Ongoing Feminist Revolution, created by a team working with Clio, Inc.: Visualizing History. This free-access, ad-free online historical exhibit features 46 film clips taken from 27 documentary films, extensive interactive timelines, in-depth essays supported by primary documents, photos, and other resources. Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution highlights the collective action and individual achievements of women from the 1940s to the present. In the spirit of 1970s consciousness-raising, the name refers to the “click” moment when women discovered the powerful ideas of contemporary feminism. The name also refers to the computer <b>keystroke</b> that connects women (and men) to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The sale of Load Balancer {{left the}} company with staff and cash, but no product. Freedman had {{developed}} and marketed a 3-day UNIX security course in 1992, and had developed significant contacts within the banking, defense, and chip-making communities. These customers all had similar problems in managing large UNIX networks, specifically concerning the control and audit {{of the actions of}} the systems' administrators. The problem was that the root account used by systems administrators when reconfiguring parts of the system, was able to edit any of the audit trails created by the system. Freedman designed a new product, PowerBroker, that was similar in concept to today's sudo products, but which allowed centralized control and auditing of an entire network even down to the <b>keystroke</b> level, with the logs stored on a dedicated remote computer to which the system administrators typically did not have access. By vetting all access and logging through this remote machine, a secure log could be maintained. The system was ported to over 22 versions of UNIX to accommodate the newer, larger networks with hundreds or thousands of machines. Dean Huxley was responsible for most of the system-level programming on PowerBroker with Kevin Chmilar and Earle Lowe also contributing.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} {{that despite the}} WPA/WPA2 encryption, hackers may {{still be able to}} steal other users' data, especially since the LinkNYC Wi-Fi network has millions of users. To reduce the risk of data theft, LinkNYC is deploying a better encryption system for devices that have Hotspot 2.0. Another concern is that hackers could affect the tablet itself by redirecting it to a malware site when users put in PII, or adding a <b>keystroke</b> logging program to the tablets. To protect against this, CityBridge places in [...] "a series of filters and proxies" [...] that prevents malware from being installed; ends a session when a tablet is detected communicating with a command-and-control server; and resets the entire kiosk after 15 seconds of inactivity. The USB ports have been configured so that they can only be used to charge devices. However, the USB ports are still susceptible to physical tampering with skimmers, which may lead to a user's device getting a malware infection while charging; this is prevented by the more than 30 anti-vandalism sensors on each Link.|$|E

40|$|In many {{applications}} autocompletion functionality saves <b>keystrokes,</b> increases user experience, and helps {{the user to}} comply with standardized terminology. Intuitively, the more context information we have about the user, the more accurate autocompletion suggestions we can give. In this paper we research the added value of contextual information for autocompletion algorithms, measured as {{the average number of}} saved <b>keystrokes.</b> In our experiments, a context is represented as a set of SNOMED CT terms. Using the structure of SNOMED CT we determine the semantic distance of each SNOMED CT term to the context terms. The resulting distance function is injected in the autocompletion algorithms to reward terms that are semantically close to the context. Our results show that semantic enhancement saves up to 18 % of <b>keystrokes,</b> in addition to the percentage of <b>keystrokes</b> saved for the non-semantic base algorithm...|$|R
500|$|High-profile {{advertising}} {{was central}} to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out {{in stark contrast to}} the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double-page spread. The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan [...] "Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you". The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as [...] "a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs." [...] The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed ("it's still very simple to teach yourself computing") and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single <b>keystroke</b> – the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as [...] "eliminat a great deal of tiresome typing". The ZX81's British character was emphasised; it was [...] "designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain." [...] Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81's purpose: ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and <b>keystroke</b> logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E
