5|$|Although Bristol's economy {{no longer}} relies upon its port, which {{was moved to}} docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s and to the Royal Portbury <b>Dock</b> <b>in</b> 1977 as ship size increased, {{it is the largest}} {{importer}} of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9million long tons (4million tonnes) to 11.8million (12million). Tobacco importing and cigarette manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.|$|E

5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to <b>dock</b> <b>in</b> many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency.

5|$|The ship {{rejoined the}} Mediterranean Fleet in March 1891, but {{was forced to}} return home in September 1892 with {{persistent}} boiler problems and she was reduced to the Chatham reserve.
