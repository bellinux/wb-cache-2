5|$|In 2009, Skopje had 26,056 firms {{but only}} 145 {{of them had}} a large size. The large {{majority}} of them are either small (12,017) or very small (13,625). A large share of the firms deal with trade of goods (9,758), 3,839 are specialised in business and real estate, and 2,849 are manufacturers. Although <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number,</b> large firms account for 51% of the local production outside finance.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that Jehovah's Witnesses do not entirely oppose the idea of {{national}} service, but rather the notion of armed military service. Thio Li-ann has commented that it may be administratively possible to devise a non-military national service for Jehovah's Witnesses, who are very <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of toponymy and language is unequivocal. Placenames in Orkney with a Celtic derivation are <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number</b> {{and it is}} clear that Norn, a local version of Old Norse, was widely spoken by the inhabitants into historic times. Norn was also spoken in Shetland and evidence for Pictish elements in placenames is virtually non-existent, the three island names of Fetlar, Unst and Yell excepted.|$|E

5|$|In late 546, when John Troglita reached Carthage, the {{situation}} was dire: the imperial troops, under Marcentius the dux of Byzacena and Gregory the Armenian in Carthage, were <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number</b> and demoralized. They held out in the coastal cities, blockaded by the Moors of Byzacena under their chieftain Antalas, while the Leuathae and Austurae tribes from Tripolitania were raiding Byzacena with impunity. Diplomatic efforts, however, secured the allegiance of the Moorish leaders Cutzinas and Ifisdaias, who joined the imperial army with several thousands of their men. In addition, the tribesmen of the Aurès Mountains under Iaudas withdrew to Numidia on learning of Troglita's arrival and pursued a course of armed neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Artillery had {{available}} a {{total of}} 676 howitzers and field guns: 310 Krupp 75mm field guns, partly produced in licence; 52 105mm Bofors howitzers, the only really modern pieces; 144 obsolete Krupp 125mm guns; 40 150mm sFH13's; 72 Krupp 150mm L/24 howitzers and 28 Vickers 152mm L/15 howitzers. As antitank-guns 386 Böhler 47mm L/39s were available, which were effective weapons but too <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number,</b> being only at {{a third of the}} planned strength; another three hundred antiquated 6 Veld (57mm) and 8 Staal (84mm) field guns performed the same role for the covering forces. Only eight of the 120 modern 105mm pieces ordered from Germany had been delivered {{at the time of the}} invasion. Most artillery was horse-drawn.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of these used in France and England {{was in the}} Namur region {{in what is now}} Wallonia (Belgium). From there, they spread first to the Pays de Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex, where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491, followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number</b> until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery forges for the production of bar iron.|$|E

5|$|V. I. Lenin's policy, {{the right}} of nations to {{self-determination}} aimed at preventing the disintegration of Russia {{during the period of}} military weakness. He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the proletariat of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labor movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number,</b> favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was resolved by the defeat of Red Finland and weakness of Russia.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number,</b> reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
5|$|Singing {{schools in}} Baltimore were <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number</b> until the 1830s. Singing masters began {{incorporating}} secular music into their curriculum, and divested themselves from sponsoring churches, {{in the early}} part of the 1830s. Attendance increased drastically, especially after the founding of two important institutions: the Academy, established in 1834 by Ruel Shaw, and the Musical Institute, founded by John Hill Hewitt and William Stoddard. The Academy and the Institute quickly became rivals, and both gave successful performances. Some Baltimore singing masters used new terminology to describe their programs, as the term singing school was falling out of favor; Alonzo Cleaveland founded the Glee School during this era, focusing entirely on secular music. In contrast, religious musical instruction by the middle of the 19th century remained based around itinerant singing masters who taught for a period of time, then continued to new locations.|$|E

To alleviate the problems of overcrowding, the nine car trains have been phased out and replaced with 12-car ones. 15-coach trains were introduced on 21 November 2009. However, these are <b>few</b> <b>in</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
