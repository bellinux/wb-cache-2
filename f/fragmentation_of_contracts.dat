40|$|The {{international}} {{literature on}} non-standard employment has mostly focussed on {{its impact on}} employment, and more recently on working and living conditions. This volume explores these issues with special reference to Italy. Italy is characterized by very low participation rates (particularly women’s), a high degree <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>contracts</b> and a very intense non-standard work diffusion that make this context a particularly interesting case for analysis. New elements of discussion are provided {{with reference to the}} interaction of non-standard work, employment probability and living conditions. Interesting insights on the impact of non-standard work on the transition to stable employment and workers’ careers emerge, suggesting a possible failure of companies’ internal systems of work evaluation. The effects on labour productivity and on companies’ performance are analysed. Within this framework, a new perspective on quality of work is suggested...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{connection}} between labour and housing insecurity in Australia {{during the period of}} restructuring and growth between 1992 and 2007, defined as a market-dominant regime of security. The period is characterised by a steady decline in the rate of unemployment, yet there is substantial evidence to suggest that both labour and housing markets have become more insecure for working households. The central research question posed in this thesis is: How has labour insecurity contributed to housing insecurity during a market-dominant regime of security? In reviewing trends in the labour market I argue that there has been growing insecurity in both household employment and income, resulting from the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and working-time relations and from growing inequality of earnings. In the housing market I argue that there has been growth in insecurity in both tenure and access emerging from declining affordability and reduced flexibility of households to adjust to sudden changes that threaten their household income. In making connections between labour and housing insecurity I draw on theoretical concepts informed by critical realist ontology, political economy, and Bourdieu’s relational class framework to argue that labour and housing insecurity is contingently and unequally mediated through collective and cumulative household capital. Combining descriptive and statistical modelling of the Australian HILDA survey with in-depth biographical labour and housing histories I examine the contingent conditions when labour insecurity does and does not contribute to housing insecurity. Based on an analysis of these extensive and intensive data I find that housing insecurity for renters and purchasers, as well as delays in moving into home ownership, is more likely to occur amongst households with no permanent employment, reliant on self-employment, or who are unemployed. Housing insecurity amongst moderate to higher income purchasers {{is more likely to be}} associated with above-average housing costs and changes within their household than from insecurity in employment. In-depth analysis of labour and housing histories over time reveals how the strategies used to mitigate insecurity are strongly mediated by unequal amounts of collective and cumulative household capital...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed-field agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} showed that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA in Raji cells was induced by infection with the P 3 HR- 1 strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). S 1 nuclease treatment of the agarose plugs containing cells suggested {{that the majority of}} DNA fragments did not contain single-strand gaps. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis was required for DNA fragmentation. Phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of EBV DNA polymerase, did not inhibit <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. These findings suggest that EBV-specific early proteins participate in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal DNA of P 3 HR- 1 cells was also fragmented by treatment with n-butyrate plus 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), which induced activation of latent EBV genome following viral replication. In addition, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> DNA preceded cell death during lytic infection.

40|$|A {{potential}} effect of ICTs {{is that they}} alleviate the traditional space-time constraints of paid-work activities and allow for the decomposition of work into multiple segments of sub-tasks, which can be performed at different times and/or locations. Such separation of activities into discrete pieces is commonly termed the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> activity. Regrettably, only limited empirical evidence {{is available on the}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work activity and the factors that contribute to it. The goal {{of this paper is to}} extend the previous work in the activity fragmentation arena in three ways: (i) to operationalize measures <b>of</b> spatial <b>fragmentation</b> and reformulate some <b>of</b> the temporal <b>fragmentation</b> measures for the specific purpose <b>of</b> investigating the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the work activity; (ii) to analyse fragmentation not only in terms of the individual indicators, but also as a multi-dimensional construct including all dimensions of spatial and temporal fragmentation collectively; (iii) to test a detailed set of ICT-related, work-related, and sociodemographic variables to identify the factors that are crucial in the occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the work activity. The study shows that there is heterogeneity in the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work. Three internally homogeneous patterns <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> which diverge in the degree <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> are identified: (1) a less temporally and spatially fragmented work pattern; (2) a less spatially and more temporally fragmented work pattern; (3) a more spatially and temporally fragmented work pattern. The multiple discriminant analysis suggests that ICT variables and work-related variables as well as personal-household attributes are associated with the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work. However, the degree of association differs considerably among representative patterns <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> polyatomic {{molecules}} is {{a fundamental}} chemical reaction in intense laser fields when the electric field strength of the laser pulse is comparable to or exceeds the intramolecular Coulomb binding fields. For hydrocarbon molecules, because of the migration of light hydrogen atom (or proton) {{that can lead to}} chemical bond rearrangement <b>of</b> molecules, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon molecules may result in new fragment species that could not be realized from the initial geometry of molecules by direct bond breaking, making the full characterization <b>of</b> their dynamical <b>fragmentation</b> processes difficult.

40|$|Although {{relationships}} between <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development {{and other forms}} of administrative and land cover fragmentation are important, they are poorly understood. This research aimed to better understand these relationships in order to inform land use planning in the Roaring Fork/Colorado River Corridor of Colorado. Change in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development between 1985 and 1999 was modeled as a function of other forms of administrative and land cover fragmentation using two different regression specifications. While a standard “global ” regression provided a good averaged model of change for the entire study area, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) demonstrated how the process changed locally over space. Results of the global regression showed that the intercept was close to zero and therefore the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development was expected to be close to zero in the absence of other forms <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> Results <b>of</b> the GWR showed that the {{relationships between}} change in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development and other fragmentation variables (initial edge density of urban development, edge density of public/private interface, farmland density and road density) varied significantly within the study area. By modeling this variation, GWR helped to identify ways to reduce <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development in two different regions of the study area. The analysis suggested that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development in one area, Aspen–Basalt, was more strongly driven by amenity-related variables, while in the New Castle area fragmentation was more strongly driven by infrastructure-related variables. Ultimately, local analysis may help fine-tune “one-size-fits-all ” land use polices for specific regions...|$|R
