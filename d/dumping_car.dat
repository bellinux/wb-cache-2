50|$|The Woodford haulage {{system was}} used on {{industrial}} tramways, specifically in quarries and strip mines {{in the early}} decades of the 20th century. This used a 250 Volt center third rail to power remotely-controlled self-propelled side <b>dump</b> <b>cars.</b> The remote control system was operated like a model railroad, with the third rail divided into multiple blocks that could be set to power, coast, or brake by switches in the control center.|$|R

50|$|CMRR also rosters {{several pieces}} of freight {{equipment}} used in work train and storage service. In Kingston, this includes two 50-foot boxcars, former D&H 26076 and NYC 72462, used for storage.

25|$|Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which {{eliminate}} {{problems with}} coal freezing in bottom <b>dump</b> <b>cars.</b> The unloader includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down {{to dump the}} coal. Swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together. Unloading a unit train takes about three hours.|$|R
5000|$|In 1893, Timothy Long {{filed for}} a patent on a rotary car dumper. [...] This dumper {{required}} the car to be uncoupled because the dumper rolled {{the car to the}} side as it dumped.In 1901, Erskine Ramsay filed {{for a patent}} on a rotary dumper where the center of rotation of the dumper was aligned with the coupling. [...] When combined with railway couplers that were free to rotate, this permitted <b>dumping</b> <b>cars</b> without uncoupling them from the train.|$|R

Phoenicia equipment also includes a privately owned N5G steel caboose, CMRR 673 (former Lehigh Valley 95041). This caboose {{was used as a}} gift shop at Mt.

50|$|In the 1850s, Paraiso {{was made}} a rail stop on the Panama Railroad, though it {{was little more than}} a village with an {{exceptional}} natural spring. In 1882, when the French Canal Company began work, Paraiso was the southernmost point of French dry season excavation effort. Decauville <b>dumping</b> <b>cars</b> continued to carry soil out of the area for years, though by the end of the 19th century, Canal works were little more than a token effort and the population of Paraiso was about 800, living in 125 frame houses and 100 huts.|$|R
50|$|SFG {{also owns}} several pieces of {{maintenance}} equipment, including several flat <b>cars,</b> Difco side <b>dump</b> <b>cars,</b> Hart ballast hoppers, four Russel snow plows, a steel flanger plow and two Pyle regulator type snow plows.

5000|$|A {{spreader}} {{is a type}} {{of maintenance}} equipment designed to spread or shape ballast profiles. The spreader spreads gravel along the railroad ties. The various ploughs, wings and blades of specific spreaders allow them to remove snow, build banks, clean and dig ditches, evenly distribute gravel, as well as trim embankments of brush {{along the side of the}} track. [...] The operation of the wings was once performed by compressed air, and later hydraulics. [...] Besides the MoW-operation spreaders are also used in open cast mines to clean the tracks from overburden tipped from <b>dump</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Roosevelt and Taft {{initially}} dismissed Stevens' concerns, {{but by the}} end of February 1907, {{the administration}} had decided not to use a contractor to build the canal (the abrupt resignation of Stevens may have influenced Roosevelt's decision). [...] Oliver stated he had been [...] "whangdoodled" [...] by Roosevelt. [...] MacDonald blamed the transcontinental railroads for the decision, arguing they had been trying to thwart the canal's construction. [...] Though the government had decided against giving the canal contract to Oliver, he did receive a contract for 500 steel <b>dump</b> <b>cars</b> to be used on the canal project.|$|R

50|$|White, who {{continued}} to live in New York City, served as President of Michigan Limestone. In 1911, Carl D. Bradley was hired as General Manager of the Calcite Plant. Bradley oversaw construction of the limestone processing plant, which included a powerhouse, crusher, mill or screenhouse, conveyor distribution system, harbor, loading slip, ship loader, repair shop, and office building. Steam shovels were purchased for use in mining, and steam locomotives and <b>dump</b> <b>cars</b> were used to move the stone from the quarry to the crusher. Production at the quarry began in early 1912 and the first cargoes of stone were shipped in June of that year.|$|R

Most were flatcars, but some had gondola sides, others had roofs (either with open sides or like conventional boxcars) and others carried shallow rectangular tanks with a capacity of [...] of drinking water. The boxcars and tank cars were regarded as top-heavy and prone to derailment; so most loads were carried on flatcars and gondolas. Approximately 1,600 4-wheel side <b>dump</b> <b>cars</b> were produced in several versions for construction earth-moving. The total number of cars shipped to Europe was 2,385.|$|R
50|$|Built as {{the steam}} {{revolution}} was just starting, the only power equipment they had were a steam-driven pile driver, steam tugs, and steam locomotives equipped with gondola and <b>dump</b> <b>cars</b> for carrying fill material; {{the rest of}} the work had to be done by machete, axe, pick, shovel, black powder, and mule cart. As more track was laid, they had to continually add backfill to the roadbed as it continued to slowly sink into the swamp. Once about 2 mi of track were laid, the first solid ground was reached, at what was called then called Monkey Hill (now Mount Hope). This was soon converted to a cemetery that hosted almost continuous burials.|$|R
5000|$|New Zealand's car {{assembly}} industry {{has its roots}} in pre-car trades. In the early 20th century, coachbuilders and wheelwrights quickly moved into building bodies for imported motor vehicle chassis. In 1926 after the announcement that General Motors would begin local assembly a deputation of members of the New Zealand Coach and Motor Body Builders' Federation waited on the Prime Minister asking for greater protection because they said American manufacturers were <b>dumping</b> <b>cars</b> in New Zealand and flooding the market. The Prime Minister deferred any decision until he had heard from other interested parties. The local managing director of General Motors responded that the failure of chassis imports to grow was [...] "entirely due to public preference and price".|$|R

The Laurel Fork has been mistakenly identiifed as owner of c/n 2195 due to a Lima clerical error. The equipment roster for the rail company also included two log loaders; a steam shovel; 40 flat cars; 12 service cars; and a Model T Ford on <b>dump</b> <b>car</b> wheels that was used for inspection trips. As a freight-only carrier, the Laurel Fork Railway owned no passenger equipment.|$|R

The 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about eleven billion dollars.|$|R
