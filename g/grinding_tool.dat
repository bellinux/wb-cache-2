5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. <b>Grinding</b> <b>tool</b> alignment, <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> referencing and <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} investigation {{has been carried}} out to develop and describe the distribution of pressure gradient underneath and across the topological surface of laboratory <b>grinding</b> <b>tools.</b> The surface pressure plays a key role during polishing process of ceramic tiles in gloss gaining and development of surface roughness. Analogous to the surface topography changes of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> and ceramic tiles, the wear of the work tools and work pieces are proportional to the grinding work that was performed between the surfaces during the polishing process. The present work intends to evaluate the influence of the gradual distribution of surface pressure in polishing ceramic tiles with line contact. For this purpose, two <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> were assembled together as a polishing head and installed on a CNC tribometer machine with a deflection angle of 2. 2 ° from the base coordinate system of the machine. In this thesis, the theory of pressure distributed gradually underneath and across the polishing tools was successfully defined by implementing a new polishing tool composed of rotating shaft with pivot joint, helical springs and two abrasive blocks attached on it. These findings enhance the understanding of pressure distribution from previous study of polishing with flat contact using single abrasive block. With these comparisons the process outcome in terms of gloss level and fine surface finish could be further optimised. The effect of the material removal and gloss development due to polishing tools configuration with preferred process parameters were found to be minimised or maximised according to the kinematics chosen. Differences were clearly illustrated {{at the end of the}} work...|$|R

A new finish method uses an {{effective}} electrode connecting with a nonconductive <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> {{to execute the}} design of compound processes of electrochemical finishing and grinding following turning is investigated. The submitted processes {{can be used for}} various turning operations. Through simple equipment attachment, electrochemical finishing and grinding can follow to execute the finishing process on the same machine. Among the factors affecting electrochemical finishing the performance of grinding combined with electrochemical finishing is primarily discussed. In the experiment, the electrode is used with continuous and pulsed direct current. The <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> moves following the electrode and grinds the workpiece surface. The experimental parameters are electrical current rating, feed rate of electrode and <b>grinding</b> <b>tool,</b> rotational speed of workpiecel, pulsed period, and geometry of finish-tool. The results show that pulsed direct current with longer off-time can slightly improve the finish effect for its dregs discharge mobility. Using an adequate rotational speed of workpiece with high rotational speed is advantageous to the finish effect. A thinner plate-form electrode with a smaller end radius is associated with larger discharge space and produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better finish effect.

Knowing {{what factors}} {{influenced}} pre-hispanic people???s choice {{of raw materials}} for maize-grinding tools is important in increasing our understanding of intensified maize preparation and changes in patterns of social, economic, and political development. Analyzing data from several collections in three areas of Central Mexico, the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo, the Apizaco region in Tlaxcala, and the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico, I focused on three factors: durability, design of metate, and access to source material.

This process also includes the use of a penetrant chemical known as a hardener.

During concrete polishing the surface is processed through a series of steps (in general a minimum of 6 grinding steps of processing is considered polished concrete) utilizing progressively finer <b>grinding</b> <b>tools.</b> The <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> are progressive grits of industrial diamonds in a bonded material such as metal/hybrid/resin often referred to as diamond polishing pads.
