5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} {{kept getting}} better for Pittsburgh {{in the second}} half. Humphries was intercepted by cornerback Rod Woodson on the third play of the quarter, and O'Donnell's 33-yard aerial strike to tight end Eric Green set up Anderson's 23-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 13–3. But on the fifth play of the Chargers ensuing drive, quarterback Stan Humphries faked a handoff, fooling the Steelers defensive backs long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> tight end Alfred Pupunu wide open to complete a 43-yard touchdown.

Billaud-Varenne was arrested, {{and as a result of}} the Jacobin-led insurrection of 12 Germinal of the Year III (1 April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate deportation to French Guiana, along with Collot d'Herbois and Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac. After Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup, he refused the pardon offered by the French Consulate.

25|$|Though some {{television}} series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, {{with a laugh}} track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and I Love Lucy creator Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy needed to work {{in front of an}} audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer were lucky <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

500|$|As in 1947 and 1949, Clark {{focused his}} {{campaign}} on {{the corruption of the}} Republican organization, calling it [...] "the most corrupt political machine in the United States". Poling admitted that corruption existed, but pledged to root it out himself if elected. Philadelphia's two newspapers, the Inquirer and the Bulletin, had traditionally endorsed Republicans, but in 1951 favored the Democrats. Poling's association with the Republican party bosses clinched the Inquirer's endorsement for Clark; in an editorial, the editors said [...] "the only way Philadelphia can get a change at City Hall is by throwing out the Republican ward-boss clique". Clark and his running mate, district attorney candidate Richardson Dilworth, bought radio time and made street-corner speeches. In one speech, Dilworth called the Republican leadership [...] "political hogs and extremely avaricious gentlemen". In a broadcast, Clark called his non-politician opponent the ignorant tool of corrupt interests, saying [...] "he can know nothing about the subject personally for he has not been in politics in Philadelphia long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out."

500|$|The {{communal}} {{understanding of}} redemption and human self-worth {{has changed since}} Newton's time. Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome {{in order to achieve}} a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, [...] "grace" [...] and the meaning behind the words of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] have become as individual as the singer or listener. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins [...] "When we've been there ten thousand years"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. [...] "Grace", however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the power of God.|$|E
500|$|Several {{others were}} quick to join Hill in his {{criticism}} of Fielding and the Grub Street campaign. Bonnell Thornton, a poet and essayist, was responsible for Have at you All; or, the Drury Lane Journal, a production that satirised Fielding and his works. Particular {{attention was paid to}} Amelia in Have at you All; the fifth number, for example, featured [...] "a new chapter in Amelia, more witty than the rest, if the reader has but sense <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out the humour." [...] On 15 January, Tobias Smollett [...] published a disparaging twenty-eight-page pamphlet entitled A Faithful Narrative of the base and inhuman Arts that were lately practised upon the Brain of Habbakuk Hilding, Justice, Dealer and Chapman, who now lies at his own House in Covent-Garden, in a deplorable State of Lunacy; a dreadful Monument of false Friendship and Delusion. The pamphlet was notorious for its viciousness, and variously accused [...] "Habbakuk Hilding" [...] (Fielding) of literary theft, scandalousness, and smuttiness, while deriding his marriage to Mary Daniels. It also posited that Fielding founded The Covent-Garden Journal to further the ambitions of politician and statesman George Lyttelton, with whom Fielding had recently formed a friendship; the source of this inference remains unclear, since Lyttelton received no particular mention in the first few numbers.|$|E
500|$|Opinion on Kain's {{character}} {{has been largely}} positive in critical reviews of the Legacy of Kain games.

For Blood Omen 2, although critics expressed disappointment with the game itself, they praised Kain's character nevertheless; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin branded him [...] "a very intriguing protagonist" [...] and [...] "as memorable of a main character as they come", while IGN's Douglass C.

500|$|Although Congregation did not chart, it {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Michael Azerrad called it [...] "superb" [...] in Rolling Stone, while Daniel Fidler from Spin viewed the record as [...] "a clean move toward musical excellence", showing the Afghan Whigs [...] "bursting its Sub Pop chains with catchy, heavy guitar riffs, downright lovable song arrangements, melodies that jerk your emotions back and forth, and yes, endearing, raspy vocals that wail, moan, scream, and shout". Brad Webber of the Chicago Tribune found the album {{more accessible to}} listeners than contemporary Seattle or Minneapolis-based, guitar-oriented grunge bands, writing that the Afghan Whigs were [...] "on rock's cutting edge" [...] while stirring [...] "a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs". In Musician magazine, J. D. Considine said the band was [...] "clever <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> hooks {{in the sort of}} gnarled riffs and guitar noise Fugazi plays for atmosphere", as well as [...] "canny enough to avoid most of the mannerisms that make much Amerindie rock seem so cliched." [...] Considine concluded in his review, [...] "The best reason to join this Congregation is that the songs are catchy enough to hold their own against the best work of bands like Dinosaur Jr. or the Replacements." [...] Option was less impressed, appreciating the record's [...] "sheer listenability", [...] "clear recording and dynamic performances", but criticizing Dulli's lyrics and the band's cover of [...] "The Temple".

[...] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had [...] "registered an enduring appeal among viewers", with Braeden replying that, [...] "Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from {{the wrong side of the}} tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict." [...] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he [...] "always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: [...] "Young and Restless Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [...] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them." [...] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: [...] "Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years." [...] They also described their relationship as being a [...] "dominant force" [...] in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: [...] "Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever get it together long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any happiness with each other.
