2500|$|In 1978 a {{temporary}} agreement regulating fishery in a [...] zone, named The <b>Grey</b> <b>Zone</b> in some {{documents from the}} same period, was signed, which has since been renewed annually. From the Norwegian side, the agreement was negotiated by Labour Party politician Jens Evensen and his protégé Arne Treholt, who was later exposed as a Soviet spy and convicted of high treason. The agreement was highly controversial in Norway. Many Norwegians believed that Evensen and Treholt gave too many concessions to the Soviet Union, {{and that they were}} motivated by Soviet sympathies. The agreement caused consternation in parliament and government, and Evensen had difficulty receiving acceptance from his own government, where many held the opinion that he had exceeded his authority. The opposition criticized him for having accepted less than Norway's rightful claim. Treholt, who was then serving a twenty-year sentence, admitted in 1990 that he had acted as an informer for the Soviet negotiators. The arrest and conviction of Treholt in 1984 and 1985 had a devastating effect on Evensen, who withdrew completely from public life in Norway. In 1989, Evensen compared Treholt to Vidkun Quisling.|$|E

2500|$|Officially {{claiming}} to be neutral, Finland lay in the <b>grey</b> <b>zone</b> between the Western countries and the Soviet Union. The [...] "YYA Treaty" [...] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. However, Finland maintained capitalism unlike most other countries bordering the Soviet Union. Property rights were strong. While nationalization committees were set up in France and UK, Finland avoided nationalizations. After failed experiments with protectionism in the 1950s, Finland eased restrictions and made {{a free trade agreement}} with the European Community in 1973, making its markets more competitive. Local education markets expanded and an increasing number of Finns also went abroad to study in the United States or Western Europe, bringing back advanced skills. There was a quite common, but pragmatic-minded, credit and investment cooperation by state and corporations, though it was considered with suspicion. Support for capitalism was widespread. Savings rate hovered among the world's highest, at around 8% until the 1980s. In the beginning of the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita reached the level of Japan and the UK. Finland's economic development shared many aspects with export-led Asian countries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ The Indian city is no Paris. Far {{from being}} a city of love, it spells of crowds, chaos and confusion. Within desperately {{strained}} urban infrastructures lie <b>grey</b> <b>zones,</b> <b>grey</b> markets, and grey practices. In Mumbai alone, the most populous city in India of 30 million, {{more than half of}} its population lives in <b>grey</b> <b>zones</b> such as slums, with speculation that by 2025, they will pervade much of Mumbai’s urban landscape 1. Characteristic of slums are inhabitants sharing small spaces but paradoxically, such forced intimacies come with major social distance architected by caste, class, gender norms and even the color of one’s skin. In a contemporary urban culture where arranged marriages still dictate one’s social life and being ‘fair and lovely’ is a ticket to social mobility, the city can serve as a traditional and chronic entrapment...|$|R

40|$|AIMS – There {{are many}} <b>grey</b> <b>zones</b> {{between work and}} leisure time, where colleagues drink together. Managers are more often {{involved}} in grey-zone situations than other employees, and the managerial arena is dominated by men. What {{is the significance of}} female managers’ visibility in their understanding of their own consumption of alcohol? What leads female managers to moderate their work-related alcohol consumption? DATA AND METHODS – To capture the female managers’ perspectives, we conducted 13 in-depth interviews. The female managers represented various kinds of work within care or nursing, media or publishing, public administration and commodity trading. RESULTS – The female managers’ reflections and experiences of consuming alcohol in <b>grey</b> <b>zones</b> explain how their heightened visibility as women leads them to moderate their alcohol consumption. Three themes were especially salient: (1) need to be in control, (2) concern about stigmatisation, and (3) life stages marked with caring tasks. CONCLUSIONS – The results show the importance of external factors in work-related drinking. Women’s visibility is significant in relation to cultural dimensions, moderating work-related drinking even when women are managers. The women place demands upon themselves based on their own conceptions of others’ expectations of female managers...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis {{doctoral}} project {{investigates the}} use of theatre practice to engage across the'victim'/'perpetrator' binary in the Kashmir valley; a binary that is framed in this project as a tripartite division between Civil Society, Militants/Ex-Militants, and the Indian Armed Forces. Using Primo Levi's (1988) concept of "grey zones" to investigate how narratives from these spaces might be given theatrical form, this thesis utilised six concepts to frame the aesthetic, pedagogic, and ethical principles of a practice-based-research undertaking: Immersive Theatre, Documentary Theatre, devised theatre workshops, affect, situational ethics, and performance auto-ethnography. With one Kashmiri theatre company operating as my central collaborator, the first two phases consisted of devised theatre workshops and performances with Civil Society and Ex-Militants in Kashmir. Exploring instances from these projects through thick description, critical analyses, and auto-ethnographic writing, the <b>grey</b> <b>zones</b> of Civil Society in Kashmir are situated as being within acts of aggression that occur between civilians who are differently privileged, while it is Ex-militants who are discovered as occupying a liminal space when studying narratives of militancy in the region. By contrasting these two phases of practice-based research with the third phase of 'failed' attempts to engage with the Indian Armed Forces, this thesis postulates that the <b>grey</b> <b>zones</b> within the experience of government soldiers might only be accessed by making theatre with cadets at military academies. By drawing out the parallels and disjunctures between the manifestations of the three phases of theatre practice, this project offers outcomes that contribute to scholarship around theatrical interventions in times and places of war. The concluding outcomes are framed by one question: if an outside theatre maker were to create one performance piece that contains cross-community narratives from Kashmir, what ethical, pedagogical, and aesthetic considerations might arise as a result. Amongst the strategies that are put forward to answer this question, there are three outcomes that are particularly significant: a re-articulation of <b>grey</b> <b>zones</b> as existing both between and {{within each of the}} three groups; the proposal of a process-based spectatorship when utilising novelty in form and content; a re-framing of the discussion around affect and effect by considering artists' intention and spectators' response vis-à-vis a theatrical creation...|$|R
