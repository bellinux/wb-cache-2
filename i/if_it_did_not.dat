5|$|Pushkar Lake's history {{dates back}} to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The {{inscriptions}} found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> lie on the trade route.|$|E
5|$|The General Government {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} a German general who was {{accountable}} to the Army. After a brief tenure by Colmar von der Goltz in 1914, command was held by Moritz von Bissing and later, from April 1917, by Ludwig von Falkenhausen. The German authorities aimed to use the occupation to benefit the German economy and industrial production but hoped to keep the Belgian state and economy functioning <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> impede their main objectives.|$|E

5|$|Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2–2 on the season, {{and faced}} the {{potential}} of being ineligible for a postseason bowl game <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> improve its winning percentage. The Hokies won their next eight games, finishing {{the season with a}} 10–2 record. With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia, and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami, Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a conference championship game) and a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game. Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.|$|E
5|$|French troops entered Korçë on November 29, 1916 {{during a}} {{military}} operation that aimed to connect the Allied front in Thessaloníki in the Macedonian front to the region in south Albania, which was held by the Italian troops. French troops in Korçë were under General Maurice Sarrail, and under direct command of Colonel Descoins. There were two groups of rebels active {{in the region of}} Korçë, one was led by Themistokli Gërmenji and another by Sali Butka. In the meantime, Albanian irregular bands, headed by Butka and cooperating with the Austrian forces, completely ravaged Moscopole, and threatened that if Korçë would suffer the same fate <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> raise the Albanian flag and surrender to Albanian authorities.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E

5|$|Montreal {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the Northeast Division in 1998–99 and missed the playoffs. Their 75 points was the lowest total in a full season in 40 years. The season concluded with rumours of the team being sold and relocated <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> receive government subsidies to help alleviate pressures from Quebec's tax system and the record-low value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports. Montreal missed the playoffs again the next two seasons, and annual losses of $10–$12million {{and a desire to}} focus on its core brewing business led Molson to put the franchise up for sale in the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|Several ferries in the New York City {{area were}} {{affected}} when plans for NYC Ferry were made public. NY Waterway would give over its East River route to NYC Ferry. New York Water Taxi remained separate, but was to eliminate 200 jobs; it had stated that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> win {{the contract with}} the city to operate NYC Ferry, then it would shut down. Since the company did not win the NYC Ferry contract, it had been expected to shut down in October 2016, but continued operations {{through the end of}} the year before being purchased by Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises in January 2017. The city-owned Staten Island Ferry remains a separate entity. In addition, the ferry service would add 155 jobs to the New York Harbor area.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
