25|$|An {{older and}} more {{traditional}} method of killing seals is with a hakapik: a heavy wooden club with a <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> and metal hook on the end. The hakapik is used because of its efficiency; the animal can be killed quickly without damage to its pelt. The <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> is used to crush the seals' thin skulls, while the hook is used to move the carcasses.|$|E

According to Jonas Blane, the order of precedence for his team after he is disabled, is, from top to bottom: Mack Gerhardt, Charles Grey, Hector Williams, and Bob Brown based on seniority.|$|E

2500|$|This site yields {{some of the}} {{earliest}} evidence anywhere for the Roman use of water-powered trip hammers to crush ore (Burnham 1997). The ore was probably crushed on the famous Carreg Pumsaint, a block of stone erected many years ago before the Romans had left the site. There are parallels with similar stones at other ancient Roman mines in Europe, and the hollows in the block were formed by a trip hammer probably worked by a water wheel or a [...] "water lever". Such a water-powered hammer would have been moved regularly as each hollow became too deep, so producing the series of overlapping oval hollows in its surfaces. The <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> must have been of substantial size judging by the width of the hollows shown in the drawing. The stone is the only example so far discovered at the site, but is not unique, and Burnham refers to others of similar shape from Spain. As one side of the stone became worn, it was simply turned to reveal another side, so the block could be re-used several times. When found years after the Romans had left, in the Dark Ages, it gave rise to the legend of the five saints, who left the impression of their heads in the stone after being found asleep by the devil.|$|E
6000|$|The {{reception}} of the first consignment of San Tome silver for shipment to San Francisco {{in one of the}} O.S.N. Co.'s mail-boats had, of course, [...] "marked an epoch" [...] for Captain Mitchell. The ingots packed in boxes of stiff ox-hide with plaited handles, small enough to be carried easily by two men, were brought down by the serenos of the mine walking in careful couples along the half-mile or so of steep, zigzag paths {{to the foot of the}} mountain. There they would be loaded into a string of two-wheeled carts, resembling roomy coffers with a door at the back, and harnessed tandem with two mules each, waiting under the guard of armed and mounted serenos. Don Pepe padlocked each door in succession, and at the signal of his whistle the string of carts would move off, closely surrounded by the clank of spur and carbine, with jolts and cracking of whips, with a sudden deep rumble over the boundary bridge ("into the land of thieves and sanguinary macaques," [...] Don Pepe defined that crossing); hats bobbing in the first light of the dawn, on the heads of cloaked figures; Winchesters on hip; bridle hands protruding lean and brown from under the falling folds of the ponchos. The convoy skirting a little wood, along the mine trail, between the mud huts and low walls of Rincon, increased its pace on the camino real, mules urged to speed, escort galloping, Don Carlos riding alone ahead of a dust storm affording a vague vision of long ears of mules, of fluttering little green and white flags stuck upon each cart; of raised arms in a mob of sombreros with the white gleam of ranging eyes; and Don Pepe, hardly visible in the rear of that rattling dust trail, with a stiff seat and impassive face, rising and falling rhythmically on an ewe-necked silver-bitted black brute with a <b>hammer</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

50|$|Framing hammers, {{used for}} framing wooden houses, are heavy duty rip hammers with a {{straight}} claw. The <b>hammer</b> <b>heads</b> typically weigh from 20 to 32 ounces (567 to 907 grams) for steel heads, and 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 454 grams) for titanium heads. Heavy heads, longer handles and milled faces allow for driving large nails quickly into dimensional lumber.|$|R
60|$|From {{the time}} they began their work, every pains had been taken to deaden sounds. The blanket hung across the passage had acted as a muffler, to some extent; but a piece of cloth had always been tied over the <b>hammer</b> <b>heads</b> of the axes, to prevent the sharp clinking sounds of the blows on the chisels, or stone, being heard.|$|R
5000|$|Claw hammers can be {{constructed}} many ways but generally come {{in one of two}} forms. The first, and most popular, type of hammer is the two piece hammer. This hammer is constructed from a forged steel head with a hole for fixing a handle. One end is made to fit the hole in the <b>hammer</b> <b>head,</b> then a steel wedge is driven into the wood which forces it to expand and secure the <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> to the handle. Other handle materials include glass fiber and even carbon fiber.|$|E

5000|$|Lancaster Museum holds {{artefacts}} {{from the}} area such as stone axe and <b>hammer</b> <b>heads</b> (some weighing up to 4 kg) {{dating back to the}} New Stone Age. Many of these artefacts and their original location suggest that this was an ancient burial ground, or barrow; the area is still known locally as [...] "The Barrows". The Barrows are the only sea-cliffs in Lancashire and contain, in a relatively small area, woodland, open grassland, sandy beaches and deep rock pools.|$|R
25|$|The harquebusier {{would usually}} have been {{armed with a}} doglock carbine, hung from a swivel {{attached}} to a baldric, pistols, either wheellock or flintlock, in saddle holsters and a stout, straight-bladed, sword. The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch, very useful to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe or pick, these were hafted weapons with axe or <b>hammer</b> <b>heads</b> and armour-piercing spikes.|$|R
5000|$|Adze-end variations: As with non-ice-tool adzes, {{those of}} ice tools vary in several aspects; other ice tools have a <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> {{in place of}} the adze, or are modular, {{permitting}} switching styles of adze or hammer, and/or between adze and hammer.|$|E
50|$|A hakapik is a club, of Norwegian design, {{used for}} killing seals. The hakapik is a {{multipurpose}} hunting tool—a heavy wooden club, with a <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> (used to crush a seal's skull), and a hook (used to drag away the carcass) on the end.|$|E
50|$|A {{typical power}} hammer {{consists}} of a frame, an anvil, and a reciprocating ram holding a <b>hammer</b> <b>head</b> or die. The workpiece {{is placed on the}} lower anvil or die and the head or upper die strikes the workpiece. The power hammer is a direct descendant of the trip hammer, differing in that the power hammer stores potential energy in an arrangement of mechanical linkages and springs, in compressed air, or steam, and {{by the fact that it}} accelerates the ram on the downward stroke. This provides more force than simply allowing the weight to fall. Predecessors like trip hammers, steam drop hammers, board or strap hammers, used the power source to raise the ram or <b>hammer</b> <b>head,</b> but let it fall solely under gravity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} the spinet was its drop action (sometimes called indirect blow action). In this device, the keys did not engage the action directly; rather they pulled upward on rods called [...] "stickers," [...] which in turn pulled upward on levers located {{below the level of}} the keyboard, which in turn engaged the action. The stickers were sufficiently long that the <b>hammer</b> <b>heads</b> (the highest part of the action) ended up at roughly the same vertical level as the keyboard.|$|R
40|$|A 'micro-hammer' is {{proposed}} as convenient, repeatable broad-band ultrasonic source for point source/point receiver applications. Its operation provides a short force pulse on a surface {{similar to that}} of the impact of a free particle. The theoretical basis of that concept is discussed and two prototype designs described. Evaluation of prototypes with <b>hammer</b> <b>heads</b> of around 1 mg mass demonstrates that signals of practical usefulness can be obtained from low cost devices. Some discussion of the application of such devices to routine practice is given...|$|R
50|$|Wear {{and tear}} {{is a form}} of {{depreciation}} which is assumed to occur even when an item is used competently and with care and proper maintenance. For example, repeated impacts may cause stress to a <b>hammer's</b> <b>head.</b> This stress is impossible to prevent in the normal use of the tool for its designed task, and any attempt to avert it impedes its functionality. At the same time, it is expected that the normal use of a hammer will not break it beyond repair during a reasonable life cycle.|$|R
