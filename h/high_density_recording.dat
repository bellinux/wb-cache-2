50|$|Exchange spring media (also {{exchange}} coupled composite {{media or}} ECC) is a magnetic storage technology for hard disk drives that allows {{to increase the}} storage density in magnetic recording. The idea, proposed in 2004 by Suess et al., is that the recording media consists of exchange coupled soft and hard magnetic layers. Exchange spring media allows a good writeability due to the write-assist nature of the soft layer. Hence, hard magnetic layers such as FePt, CoCrPt-alloys or hard magnetic multilayer structures can be written with conventional write heads. Due to the high anisotropy these grains are thermally stable even for small grain sizes. Small grain sizes are required for <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>recording.</b> Interestingly, {{the introduction of the}} soft layer does not decrease the thermal stability of the entire structure if the hard layer is sufficient thick. The required thickness of the hard layer for best thermal stability is the exchange length of the hard layer material.The first experimental realization of exchange spring media was done on Co-PdSiO multilayers as the hard layer which was coupled via a PdSi interlayer to a FeSiO soft layer.|$|E

40|$|Write spacing {{losses in}} {{perpendicular}} magnetic recording have been investigated experimentally for a ring head and a single pole head. In ring head recording, an increase of write spacing causes the change of magnetization mode in the Co-Cr layer from perpendicular to longitudinal. In single pole head recording, the magnetization mode remains perpendicular, even for large write spacing. Furthermore, the reproduced voltage in saturation recording decreases with increased write spacing, since the magnetization transition length is broadened by the decreasing write head field gradient resulting from disappearance of head-to-medium magnetic coupling. Therefore, in {{perpendicular magnetic recording}}, a slight reduction of the head-to-medium spacing leads to a remarkable improvement in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>recording</b> characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In <b>high</b> <b>density</b> digital {{magnetic}} <b>recording</b> systems, the nonlinear {{effects in}} the write process appear in the readback waveform as shifts in the peak positions {{and changes in the}} ampli-tude. The pulse shift causes a nonlinear intersymbol interference (ISI) on the readback signal. In this paper, a Volterra-DFE, in which a Volterra filter is used in the feedback section of decision feedback structure, is proposed to equalize the nonlinear ISI. By theoretical analysis, the minimum mean squared error (MSE) of the Volterra-DFE is found to be a function of sampling phase. This will affect the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the playback system. A baud-rate timing recovery system in conjunction with channel estimator is used to operate the sampling clock on the optimum phase.
