40|$|The {{invasive}} round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas, 1814) {{has increased}} its European range dramatically over recent decades, with international shipping suspected as the main vector. Here, we provide the first population and morphological data for a newly established round goby population in the upper Elbe (Ústí nad Labem, Czech Republic). Surveys in 2013 along the same stretch {{found no evidence of}} gobies, indicating introduction within the past two years. Analysis of morphological similarity confirms the most likely source as the recently established population in the tidal Elbe near the port of Hamburg. Due to the species’ restricted range (< 15 km; with density localised on Ústí nad Labem port), distance from proposed source (600 km; no reports from the intervening stretch) and the speed with which this distance was crossed (less than three years), we suggest port-to-port transfer as the most likely vector route.

It was the first unassisted triple play since 1968, and the first in the National League since 1927. Morandini was also the first second baseman in National League history, and the first in the regular season, to turn an unassisted triple play; all previous occurrences were made by first basemen or shortstops.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{asymptotic}} expansions for option pricing {{with emphasis on}} small noise “singular perturbations” which are, as we shall see, better suited than the more popular small time asymptotics to approximate typical stochastic volatility models. In particular, we argue that analytic solutions are unlikely for more advanced models, and therefore numerical methods of calculation are required. The following are the main results of the thesis. We show that zeroth order implied volatility is given by the large deviation rate function under minimal assumptions. We then show a small noise sample path large deviations principle for a class of two dimensional positive diffusions of relevance to finance. We numerically calculate the large deviations rate function for an example process, Gatheral’s Double CEV model, and <b>highlight</b> the <b>speed</b> and accuracy of the approximation. We then investigate Yoshida-Watanabe asymptotic expansions and develop a Mathematica program to derive them automatically. Lastly, we develop a small noise asymptotic expansion for marginal densities of solutions of SDEs (joint work). Using this we determine the large strike implied volatility for the Stein-Stein model and the Schobel and Zhu model by rescaling into a small noise problem. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|The Shetland Islands, {{northern}} Scotland, have {{a highly}} active and diverse maritime environment, and local marine industries form {{an important part}} of the local economy. The potential for damage caused by non-native species is high. As part of an assessment of the current status of non-native species in Shetland, a series of rapid assessment surveys, coupled with a settlement panel monitoring programme, were carried out at 18 sites between May 2012 and October 2014. Eight non-native species were detected in our surveys, three of which (Corella eumyota Traustedt, 1882; Bugulina simplex Hincks, 1886; and Dasysiphonia japonica (Yendo) Kim, 2012) had not been previously recorded. Observations by SCUBA also reported the first UK record of Schizoporella japonica Ortmann, 1890 growing on natural substrate. A literature review revealed three additional non-native species that have been documented in Shetland but were not detected in our survey work. The results from this study <b>highlight</b> the <b>speed</b> at which non-native species can spread over regional scales, and that more active harbours contain greater numbers of non-native species, indicating the potential of hull fouling and ballast water exchange for transporting non-native species...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{leading to}} extinction or coexistence of competing species {{is of great}} interest in ecology and related fields. Recently a model of intra- and interspecific competition between two species was proposed by Gabel et al. [Phys. Rev. E 87 (2013) 010101], in which the scarcer species (i. e., with smaller stationary population size) can be more resistant to extinction when it holds a competitive advantage; the latter study considered populations without spatial variation. Here we verify this phenomenon in populations distributed in space. We extend the model of Gabel et al. to a d-dimensional lattice, and study its population dynamics both analytically and numerically. Survival of the scarcer in space is verified for situations in which the more competitive species {{is closer to the}} threshold for extinction than is the less competitive species, when considered in isolation. The conditions for survival of the scarcer species, as obtained applying renormalization group analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, differ in detail from those found in the spatially homogeneous case.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{interaction}} {{continues to}} be a major contributory factor in marine casualties and hazardous incidents, in particular, in the case of overtaking operations. The situation becomes even worse when the overtaking operation occurs in shallow and narrow channels, where the interaction can cause the vessels to collide and, in one case has caused the capsizal of the smaller vessel with loss of life. The aim {{of this article is to}} propose a methodology, as well as to discuss the development of a numerical program, to predict the ship-to-ship interaction during overtaking operations in shallow water. Since the vessels involved in this study have different forward speeds, an uncoupled method will be used to solve the boundary value problem. The in-house multibody hydrodynamic interaction program MHydro, which is based on the 3 D Rankine source method, is used and extended here to investigate the interactive forces and wave patterns between two ships during an overtaking operation. The calculations given in this article are compared with model test results as well as published computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. Very satisfactory agreement has been obtained, which indicates that the proposed methodology and developed program are successfully validated to predict the hydrodynamic interaction between two ships advancing in confined waters.

40|$|Abstract—Energy use of {{computer}} communication systems has quickly become a vital design consideration. One effective method for reducing energy consumption is dynamic speed scaling, which adapts the processing speed {{to the current}} load. This paper studies how to optimally scale speed to balance mean response time and mean energy consumption under processor sharing scheduling.

These results show that a simple scheme that halts when the system is idle and uses a static rate while the system is busy provides nearly the same performance as the optimal dynamic speed scaling. However, the results also <b>highlight</b> that dynamic <b>speed</b> scaling provides at least one key benefit — significantly improved robustness to bursty traffic and mis-estimation of workload parameters.

40|$|A longstanding {{idea in the}} {{literature}} on human cooperation is that cooperation should be reinforced when conditional cooperators are more likely to interact. In the context of social networks, this idea implies that cooperation should fare better in highly clustered networks such as cliques than in networks with low clustering such as random networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, in which 24 individuals played a local public goods game arranged on one of five network topologies that varied between disconnected cliques and a random regular graph. In contrast with previous work, we found that network topology had no significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement between connected neighbors. We then tested both of these possibilities in two subsequent series of experiments in which artificial “seed ” players were introduced, making either full or zero contributions. First, we found that although players did generally behave like conditional cooperators, they were as likely to decrease their contributions in response to low contributing neighbors as they were to increase their contributions in response to high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that positive effects of cooperation did not spread beyond direct neighbors in the network. In total we report on 113 human subjects experiments, <b>highlighting</b> the <b>speed,</b> flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of web-based experiments over those conducted in physical labs...|$|R
