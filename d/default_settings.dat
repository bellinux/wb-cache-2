5|$|Version 2002 was {{announced}} August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release. The installation was noted as quick and simple by both PC Magazine and CNET. An installation requires a reboot, and afterwards the Security Assistant guides users through a questionnaire to best configure the settings. A problem CNET encountered when upgrading from the prior release was {{the loss of}} customized settings. PC Magazine found the <b>default</b> <b>settings,</b> aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat permissive. Windows 95 support was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|Running a {{full scan}} {{complies}} {{a list of}} Internet-enabled applications. Users set permissions or accept Norton's <b>default</b> <b>settings.</b> The firewall detects and blocks port scans and logs intrusion attempts. This version does not run a trace on attackers, however Symantec is planning an online tool to do so. To ensure rogue programs can not masquerade as trustworthy applications, Norton verifies programs against a list of digital signatures for known programs, update Tracker warns users if hackers attempt {{to gain access to}} users' computers. The firewall blocked all access attempts from Shields Up and Port Checker. This version includes a wizard to simplify firewall setup to accommodate for multiple computers sharing an Internet connection. With this release, Norton can prevent specified personal information from being transmitted via a compatible instant messenger client, e-mail, and websites. Ad-blocking includes the Ad Trashcan, where users can place ads that slipped past ad-filtering.|$|E

25|$|Camel case {{is used in}} some wiki markup {{languages}} for {{terms that}} should be automatically linked to other wiki pages. This convention was originally used in Ward Cunningham's original wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as TiddlyWiki, Trac and PmWiki make use {{of it in the}} <b>default</b> <b>settings,</b> but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or plugin to disable it. Wikipedia formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to explicit link markup using square brackets and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as AboutUs.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that, for a {{range of}} state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the differences in generalisation performance obtained using <b>default</b> parameter <b>settings</b> and using parameters tuned via cross-validation can be similar in magnitude to the differences in performance observed between state-of-the-art and uncompetitive learning systems. This means that fair and rigorous evaluation of new learning algorithms requires performance comparison against benchmark methods with best-practice model selection procedures, rather than using <b>default</b> parameter <b>settings.</b> We investigate the sensitivity of three key machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest and rotation forest) to their <b>default</b> parameter <b>settings,</b> and provide guidance on determining sensible default parameter values for implementations of these algorithms. We also conduct an experimental comparison of these three algorithms on 121 classification problems and find that, perhaps surprisingly, rotation forest is significantly more accurate on average than both random forest and a support vector machine...|$|R

[...] Also, leaving enabled the dynamic loading of PHP extensions (via enable_dl configuration directive) in a shared web hosting environment can lead to security issues.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Windows10 heavily {{emphasizes}} freemium services, and contains various advertising facilities. Some outlets have considered these to be a hidden [...] "cost" [...] of the free upgrade offer. Examples include media storefronts, Office 365, paid functionality in bundled games such as Microsoft Solitaire Collection, <b>default</b> <b>settings</b> that display promotions of [...] "suggested" [...] apps in Start menu and [...] "tips" [...] on the lock screen that may contain advertising, ads displayed in File Explorer for Office 365 subscriptions on Creators' Update, and various advertising notifications promoting the Microsoft Edge web browser {{when it is not}} set as default.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the game's playability, the Japanese {{release was}} judged [...] "impossible to play" [...] by GameSpot and IGN, which both felt the Western {{versions}} were an improvement, {{even though the}} game was still [...] "far more sensitive than it ought to be". Still, Game Revolution found the car <b>default</b> <b>settings</b> unbalanced and hard to re-adjust properly, and criticized the game's inconsistent AI, like Allgame and IGN. Famitsu reported long load times and a high difficulty level, noting that the game was aimed more toward fans of sim racing than fans of arcade-style gameplay, due {{to the difficulty of}} steering. Game Informer and GameZone echoed Famitsus review, stating that the load times quickly become a [...] "game-ending nightmare", and calling the game's handling [...] "touchy", [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "revolutionary", but acknowledging that most players would simply find it too challenging and frustrating to be fun. While Game Informer alleged that [...] "there is a masterpiece for driving simulator buffs buried in here", Allgame was much more negative, stating that the cars [...] "seem overly light on their tires" [...] and that it [...] "feels like you're driving on ice".|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{introduce}} a simple-to-use graphical tool that enables researchers to easily prepare time-of-flight mass spectrometry data for analysis. For ease of use, the graphical executable provides <b>default</b> parameter <b>settings</b> experimentally determined {{to work well}} in most situations. These values can be changed by the user if desired. PrepMS is a stand-alone application made freely available (open source), and is under the General Public License (GPL). Its graphical user interface, <b>default</b> parameter <b>settings,</b> and display plots allow PrepMS to be used effectively for data preprocessing, peak detection, and visual data quality assessment.

2500|$|Despite being traditionally-based on British English, Malaysian English has, {{in recent}} decades, been {{strongly}} influenced by American English. This can be commonly seen in web-based media and documents produced within organisations. [...] When using computers, the writer is typically unaware {{of the differences between}} British and American English and uses the <b>default</b> <b>settings</b> on their software spell-checker. Most computer software in Malaysia, including Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, come pre-set with American English as the default and these settings are seldom changed to British English, resulting in the proliferation of American English in many places of work, local universities and other places with heavy reliance on documents and content created by using computers. In schools and in the print media however, Malaysians revert to British English.|$|E

It also was receiving serious attention from conservative writers such as National Review Online's Jim Geraghty. [...] By the afternoon of September 9, Charles Foster Johnson of Little Green Footballs had posted his attempt to recreate one of the documents using Microsoft Word with the <b>default</b> <b>settings.</b> [...] The September 9 edition of ABC's Nightline made mention of the controversy, along with an article on the ABC News website.|$|E

2500|$|... iTunes {{allows users}} to choose {{different}} ways to categorize their collection, and displays content according to the selection. The <b>default</b> <b>settings</b> show the music collection sorted by album, laying out the artwork in a grid similar to the iPad Music app (iOS 3.1-6.1.3, 8.4). When selected, albums extend downwards, showing their contents, and allowing users to browse the store for missing or related content. The content listings are themed depending on the predominant color of the album artwork. Film and television shows are {{laid out in the}} same manner, with their posters or artwork laid out in a grid. Users may alternately arrange their music collection as a list of every song, by genre, or by artist. These show details in a list structure, but the latter two include the album artwork as thumbnails to aid navigation. Items are automatically arranged alphabetically by album name, but users may rearrange this if using the song list option.|$|E
2500|$|Use of {{the term}} [...] "spyware" [...] has {{eventually}} declined as the practice of tracking users has been pushed ever further into the mainstream by major websites and data mining companies; these generally break no known laws and compel users to be tracked, not by fraudulent practices per se, but by the <b>default</b> <b>settings</b> created for users and the language of terms-of-service agreements. In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, [...] on a Wall Street Journal analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of tracking users' browsing activity, linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: [...] "Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you move on without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is New York Times. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter that you went there and also your identity within those accounts. Let's say you moved on to something like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back {{who you are and}} that you went there."

2500|$|In Microsoft Word {{running on}} a {{computer}} whose keyboard has a numeric keypad, an em dash can be typed with [...] (on the numeric keypad, with the numeric hyphen usually in the top-right corner), and an en dash can be typed with [...] This does not work with the hyphen key on the main keyboard (between [...] "0" [...] and [...] "=" [...] with a US or UK layout), which has completely different functions. With Microsoft Word's <b>default</b> <b>settings,</b> in both Windows and Macintosh versions, an em dash symbol, which {{is not always a}} true em dash from the font, is automatically produced by Autocorrect when two unspaced hyphens are entered between words (as in [...] "word--word"). An en dash, which again, is not always a true en dash from the font, is automatically produced when one or two hyphens surrounded by spaces are entered: ("word - word") or ("word -- word"). This feature can be disabled by customizing Autocorrect. Other dashes, spaces, and special characters are possible, found through the Tools menu. Unassigned symbols, such as the true minus sign, can be assigned keyboard shortcuts through the Insert menu. To determine if the true en or em dash from the font are being used rather than a cross-referenced character from the Symbol font, copy and paste samples of the dashes into a text editor such as Windows Notepad. Using the true dash is important if one ever needs to share documents with other users in other applications or operating systems.|$|E
