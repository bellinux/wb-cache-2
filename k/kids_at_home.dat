60|$|The {{splendor of}} the brightly lighted hall, which was {{situated}} {{in one of the}} meanest streets of perhaps the most densely populated quarter in London, broke upon the two boys suddenly and hit each in his vital part, tapping an invitation on Tommy's brain-pan and taking Shovel coquettishly in the stomach. Now was the moment when Shovel meant to strip Tommy of the ticket, but the spectacle in front dazed him, and he stopped to tell a vegetable barrow how he loved his dear father and his dear mother, and all the dear <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Then Tommy darted forward and was immediately lost in the crowd surging round the steps of the hall.|$|E

Jostled, but obstinate, he would remain there, trying to express the view newly opened to his sympathies of the human and equine misery in close association. But it was very difficult. “Poor brute, poor people!” {{was all he could}} repeat. It did not seem forcible enough, and he came to a stop with an angry splutter: “Shame!” Stevie was no master of phrases, and perhaps for that very reason his {{thoughts}} lacked clearness and precision. But he felt with greater completeness and some profundity. That little word contained all his sense of indignation and horror at one sort of wretchedness having to feed upon the anguish of the other—at the poor cabman beating the poor horse in the name, as it were, of his poor <b>kids</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> And Stevie knew what it was to be beaten. He knew it from experience. It was a bad world. Bad! Bad! ...|$|E

30|$|Deep mutual {{understanding}} between nursery {{teachers and parents}} at parent-teacher meetings or seminars will allow both of them {{to keep up with}} each other’s efforts and prevent children from feeling confused. Another example is parental involvement in the nurseries’ events.

In addition, parents can form a closer relationship with each other and eventually deepen their understanding on how to raise their <b>kids</b> better <b>at</b> <b>home.</b>|$|R
