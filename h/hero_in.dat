5|$|Documents with {{accounts}} of the battle include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the writings of Anglo-Norman historian William of Malmesbury and the Annals of Clonmacnoise.

5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture.

5|$|Restored after World War II, since 1949 {{this oil}} {{painting}} {{has been on}} display in the National Museum in Warsaw. In 1999 the Battle of Grunwald was loaned to Lithuania, where it garnered a positive reception because it prominently features Vytautas, who is considered a national <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> that country. By the 2000s, the painting needed restoration. In 2010, the poor condition of the painting prevented its inclusion it in a special exhibition at Wawel Castle to mark the 600th anniversary of the battle. The painting was renovated, with the work finished in 2012. After restoration the painting is once again on display at the National Museum.|$|E
