5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create significant cost savings, but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were {{in line with the}} conclusions of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E

The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum {{investigated}} a {{claim that}} Borislow falsely marketed the magicJack as having a free 30-day trial of the product. In reality, the customer must specifically cancel the trial prior to the 30-day mark, otherwise the credit card would be automatically billed. While Borislow maintained that his company's actions were not illegal, he reached a settlement on April 15, agreeing to pay the state of Florida $125,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the investigation.

5|$|The folios {{are made}} of vellum {{parchment}} primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the material, time of scribes and binding, it equals the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.|$|E

The initial projections <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the line were made in the 2004 FEIS, with Phase 1 estimated to cost $3.8 billion, Phase 2 estimated to cost $3.4 billion, and Phases 3 and 4 each estimated to cost $4.8 billion.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> building another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.|$|E
5|$|Because of the academy's congressional {{nomination}} process, {{students come}} from all 50states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands. The academy is also authorized up to 60international exchange cadets, who undergo the same four-year curriculum as fully integrated members of the Corps of Cadets. Cadets attend the United States Military Academy free of charge, with all tuition and board {{paid for by the}} Army in return for a service commitment of five years of active duty and three years of reserve status upon graduation. Starting {{on the first day of}} a cadet's second class year, non-graduates after that point are expected to fulfill their obligations in enlisted service. Cadets receive a monthly stipend of $1,017.00 for books, uniforms, and other necessities, as of 2015. From this amount, pay is automatically deducted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> uniforms, books, supplies, services, and other miscellaneous expenses. In addition the monthly pay that the remaining amount ranges from $100 to $400 in the first three years, cadets receive meals in the dining halls, and have access to the Internet and a phone in their barracks. The student population was 4,487 cadets for the 2007–2008 academic year. The student body is 15.1% female. Ninety-two percent of entering students re-matriculated for a second year; the four-year graduation rate was 80% and the six-year rate was 81%.|$|E
