5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the <b>French</b> <b>Army</b> {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin. It had been {{the legacy of the}} French King and its fusion with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon's reforms had transformed it into a military machine that had dominated Europe since 1805. Each corps of the <b>French</b> <b>Army</b> was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action.|$|E
5|$|The Lebaudy Patrie was a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{built for the}} <b>French</b> <b>army</b> in Moisson, France, by sugar producers Lebaudy Frères. Designed by Henri Julliot, Lebaudy's chief engineer, the Patrie was completed in November 1906 and {{handed over to the}} military the following month. The Patrie bears the distinction of being the first airship ordered for military service by the <b>French</b> <b>army.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Salle {{removed the}} already limited {{autonomy}} of the Council on February 16, 1918. After the armistices and capitulations {{at the end of}} First World War, it was agreed that France and Italy should continue to govern the territories they occupied, and that France, Italy and the British Empire together should govern Shkodër. As a result, the <b>French</b> <b>army</b> moved from Korçë on June 15, 1920. After the <b>French</b> <b>army</b> left Korçë, the fate of the territory that it administered was decided by the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E

5|$|On late June, Louis XIV {{replaced}} Noailles for Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme. Noailles charged Saint-Sylvestre of incompetence and, as {{did with}} other high officers, of looting {{the country on}} his own benefit, which had put on arms the peasantry against the <b>French</b> <b>army.</b> On 8 July Vendôme led his troops before Castellfollit. Having expelled its population and eaten horses and mules, the French garrison, diminished by desertions, was in an unsustainable position, and Vendôme came to evacuate and demolish the fortress. After that, the <b>French</b> <b>army</b> took the way to Hostalric and demolished its defenses, returning to Girona on 28 July.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} months many English soldiers, who were unpaid and decimated by disease and {{disappointed by the}} progress of the war, amongst them Captain Roger Williams, deserted the States-General army and went to serve in Francis, Duke of Anjou's <b>French</b> <b>army.</b> By the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours, Francis had been recognized by the States-General as the sovereign of the Netherlands instead of Philip II of Spain. Even Norreys, in the end, left the States' service and put himself under Anjou's command. Thus, in command of the English infantry, he found himself at the Battle of Steenbergen in 1583, when he covered the rearguard of the defeated <b>French</b> <b>army.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>French</b> <b>army</b> {{of around}} 69,000 {{consisted}} of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns. Napoleon had used conscription {{to fill the}} ranks of the <b>French</b> <b>army</b> throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured heavy cavalry, and seven of highly versatile lancers who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Legions serving {{alongside}} the <b>French</b> <b>Army</b> during the Napoleonic Wars saw combat {{in most of}} Napoleon's campaigns, from the West Indies, through Italy and Egypt. When the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807, many of the veterans of the Legions formed a core around which the Duchy's army was raised under Józef Poniatowski. This force fought a victorious war against Austria in 1809 and {{would go on to}} fight {{alongside the}} <b>French</b> <b>army</b> in numerous campaigns, culminating in the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, which marked the end of the Napoleonic empire, including the Legions, and allied states like the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|Al-Qassam's militia grew when it {{was joined}} by another militia based in the {{mountains}} {{following the death of}} its commander Umar al-Bitar. However, as the French tightened their control of the area, they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh's major landowners to drop their financial support for al-Qassam and pay taxes to the French Mandate government. This further isolated al-Qassam who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920. There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading attacks against the <b>French</b> <b>Army</b> until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July. As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo, al-Qassam and members of his unit fled past <b>French</b> <b>Army</b> lines with forged passports to Tartus.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that the Russian left was {{shifting}} position when the <b>French</b> <b>Army</b> arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of the Russian left. The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is still disputed by historians to this day.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{developments}} in the Macedonian Front of World War I the city of Korçë came under French control (1916–20).

5|$|In 1798 a large French {{expeditionary force}} under General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt, then under the nominal {{control of the}} Ottoman Empire, in an {{extension}} of the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. The fleet that had convoyed the <b>French</b> <b>army</b> was anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria, and was discovered there by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson on 1 August. In the ensuing Battle of the Nile the French Mediterranean Fleet was almost totally destroyed, preventing the French forces in Egypt from maintaining regular reinforcement and communication from France and ending the possibility of a wholesale evacuation of the <b>French</b> <b>army.</b> Following an unsuccessful campaign in Syria, Bonaparte returned to France without his army, eventually seizing control of the French government during the events of 18 Brumaire.|$|E
