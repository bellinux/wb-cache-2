5|$|The archdiocese offers {{religious}} <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> {{in all of}} its 111 parishes {{for children}} who attend public and other non-religious schools. According to the 2007 Official Catholic Directory, there were 95,837 students enrolled in these classes. This same source lists as teachers 2760 laity, 58 religious sisters, and 43 priests and religious brothers. Religious <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are also offered to adults throughout the archdiocese. In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a background check before they could work with children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the effect of {{experience}} in physical <b>education</b> <b>class</b> on the degree of fan about physical <b>education</b> <b>class</b> and participation in sport. In order to determine these assignments, questionnaire was administered to two hundred and fifth-six male and female college students. First, the scale of experience in physical <b>education</b> <b>class</b> for each term (elementary school, junior high school and high school). As a result of factor analysis, three main factors were extracted respectively; “Pleasure”, “Activity frustration”, “Interpersonal frustration”. These scales include 25 - 27 items and α-coefficients were enough high to support the high reliability of each factor. Second, the results of analyses of variance on the degree of fan about physical <b>education</b> <b>class</b> in the scale of experience in physical <b>education</b> <b>class</b> for each term revealed that the subjects who answered Like showed higher in “Pleasure”, the subjects who answered Dislike showed higher in “Activity frustration” and “Interpersonal frustration”.

In early December 1945, the 2/3rd's remaining personnel returned to Australia aboard the British aircraft carrier HMS Implacable, arriving in Sydney, and the following month, in January 1946, after final clearances had been obtained the unit was disbanded. During the war the battalion lost 202 men killed or died on active service, of which 56 were killed in action, 139 died while prisoners of war and seven in accidents or illness on active service. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, three Military Crosses, four Military Medals, one British Empire Medal and 21 Mentions in Despatches.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} the obstacles face physical education at schools in Al Madenah Al Munawarah, {{in addition to}} examining physical education obstacles at schools according to the variables of: years of experience, education qualification, and school’s geographic location.

Furthermore, questionnaire is made up from (56) items, that are distributed to the study’s sample accordingly. The results revealed that viewing physical <b>education</b> <b>class</b> dimension {{is the most serious}} obstacle, while psychological and incentive dimension is the least severe obstacle.

5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious <b>education</b> <b>classes.</b> Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E
5|$|Aston first gained {{full-time}} employment in 1970, {{working as a}} field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, {{he worked on the}} sites and monuments record and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum. This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were interested in it. As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught extramural adult <b>education</b> <b>classes,</b> this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial archaeology, and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, Landscape Archaeology. With archaeologist James Bond he authored The Landscape of Towns (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.|$|E

25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
