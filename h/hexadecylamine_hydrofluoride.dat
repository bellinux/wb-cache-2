Antiplaque ac-tivity {{was correlated with}} the physicochem-ical properties, lipophilicity and basicity. The {{results indicate that the}} basicity of the amine is the primary requirement for activ-ity. The lipophilic character then exerts a modulating effect on amines with the proper pKa values. Alkylamines have been known to lhave anti-bacterial activity for more than 30 years. l More recently, this class of compounds has been shown to have possible applications in the dental area. Initial studies by Green and Waalsh 2 showed that a number of alkylamines with chain lengths of from 12 to 18 carbons were able to retard solubility of tooth enamel subjected to acid treatment. It was postulated that these compounds exerted their effect by forming a protective coating on the tooth. Muhlemann, Schmid, and Konig 3 expanded these studies by testing a isumber of alkylamine hydrofluorides and found these salts were more active than the corresponding alkylamines in retarding enamel dissolution. In addition, dentifrices containing two alkylamine hydrofluorides, <b>hexadecylamine</b> <b>hydrofluoride</b> and dieth-anol aminopropyl-N-etlhanol octadecylamine dihydrofluoride, were found by Marthaler 4 to have a caries-inhibiting effect. Finally Shern, Swing, and Crawforda reported that oleylamine hydrofluoride and diethanol ami-nopropyl-N-ethanol octadecylamine dihydro-This investigation was supported by the Nationa...|$|E
