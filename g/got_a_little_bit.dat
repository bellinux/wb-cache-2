I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E

500|$|Vedder {{said that}} the band was able to [...] "team up" [...] and have a [...] "partnership" [...] while the album was being recorded. The band spent {{a large amount of}} time rehearsing the songs to get the best takes possible. Gossard commented that there was more [...] "contouring" [...] and [...] "honing" [...] of demo {{material}} than on previous records. Regarding the recording sessions, drummer Jack Irons said, [...] "We didn't put any time limit on it. It was like, 'When this record's done, we call it a record.' We took out time to come up with ideal sounds and feel for every song, so that each had its own identity. We would cut a track and go back and listen to it and openly discuss it." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Yield was a superfun record to make. And so much of it was Ed kind of sitting back." [...] He added that [...] "everybody really <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're {{an integral part of the}} band." [...] The band discussed the album's production on the documentary Single Video Theory.|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E

500|$|Following {{the short}} tour for No Code, the band {{went into the}} studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The {{sessions}} for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between {{all members of the}} group, with Ament stating that [...] "everybody really <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're {{an integral part of the}} band." [...] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code, with Vedder saying, [...] "What was rage in the past has become reflection." [...] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles [...] "Given to Fly" [...] and [...] "Wishlist". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.|$|E

On February 6, 2015, representatives for O'Donnell confirmed she would once again exit the panel, citing her reasons as a [...] "personal decision". In a statement, made to The Hollywood Reporter, O'Donnell said, [...] " [...] <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> worse right before the holidays — [...] was kind of concerned.

So I felt like I left a tenth and a half a second or so right there, but I felt like I nailed Turns 2 and 3 pretty well.

2500|$|With {{the backing}} of AMC, a fourth series of Hustle was {{virtually}} guaranteed, and by late 2006 {{it was clear that}} the cable network was taking a commanding role in the show's development. Despite the increased funding AMC provided, which allowed the writers to set episodes in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, the series was quickly mired in casting concerns. It was first rumoured in April 2006 that Adrian Lester might not return as Mickey Bricks in the fourth series; the BBC confirmed his departure in September that year, elevating Marc Warren's character to the lead role and casting Ashley Walters as a new member of the group. The BBC was quick to dispel any suggestion that Lester's resignation was connected to the shift in production focus, stating [...] "it is a shame that, due to his current filming commitments, Adrian cannot join us this time round...", while Lester explained his action as [...] "need to do something else, be associated with something else". However, Lester also admitted that he felt that the series [...] "just <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too 'light'".|$|E

[...] In June 2014, Roche signed for newly promoted Division 1 Féminine team ASPTT Albi. She failed to settle in France, scoring once in ten appearances before quitting the club amidst the FIFA Puskas Award publicity. On 18 February 2015 Roche signed with the Houston Dash.

In the mean while there is no proof that Alma returns Kendricks's interest, if he feels any.

60|$|With his {{own mother}} and sister, John Eames was in these days quite a hero. He was a hero with them now, because in his early boyish days there had been so little about him that was heroic. Then {{there had been a}} doubt whether he would ever earn his daily bread, and he had been a very heavy burden on the slight family {{resources}} in the matter of jackets and trousers. The pride taken in our Johnny had not been great, though the love felt for him had been warm. But gradually things had changed, and John Eames had become heroic in his mother's eyes. A chance circumstance had endeared him to Earl De Guest, and from that moment things had gone well with him. The earl had given him a watch and had left him a fortune, and Sir Raffle Buffle had made him a private secretary. In the old days, when Johnny's love for Lily Dale was first discussed by his mother and sister, they had thought it impossible that Lily should ever bring herself to regard with affection so humble a suitor;--for the Dales have ever held their heads up in the world. But now there is no misgiving on that score with Mrs. Eames and her daughter. Their wonder is that Lily Dale should be such a fool as to decline the love of such a man. So Johnny was received with the respect due to a hero, {{as well as with the}} affection belonging to a son;--by which I mean it to be inferred that Mrs. Eames had <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of fish for dinner as well as a leg of mutton.|$|E
