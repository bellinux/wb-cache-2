40|$|Abstract—The {{approach}} {{investigated in}} this work employs LADAR measurements to detect and track pedestrians over time. The algorithm can process range measurements from both line and 3 D scanners. The use of line scanners allows detection and tracking at rates up to 75 Hz. However, this type of sensor may not always perform satisfactorily in uneven terrains. A 3 D LADAR is used to improve operation in uneven terrains, by first estimating the local ground elevation, and then performing the detection using the measurements corresponding to a certain height above the ground. The information pipeline used to <b>feed</b> <b>sensor</b> data into the algorithm {{is the same for}} both types of sensors. The perceptual capabilities described aim to form the basis for safe and robust navigation in robotic vehicles, necessary to safeguard pedestrians operating in the vicinity of a moving robotic vehicle.

40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} flame {{dynamics}} in natural fires require solving complex mechanisms and involve large and small, length and time scales. These models demand heavy resources and computational time periods {{that are far}} greater than the time associated with the processes being simulated (hours to model seconds). If comprehensive computational models are ever {{to be used to}} estimate, forecast and understand fire growth in support of emergency response, the computational time has to be shorter than the event itself: super-real time. A mechanism to achieve these computational speeds is by means of theoretical models steered by continuous calibration against sensor measurements. In this paper, the concept of super-real time predictions steered by measurements is studied in the simple yet meaningful scenario of upward flame spread. Experiments have been conducted with PMMA slabs to <b>feed</b> <b>sensor</b> data into a simple analytical model. The sample is 150 mm wide, 40 mm thick and 200 mm tall. CCD cameras and thermocouples embedded into the solid provide estimates of the evolution of the pyrolysis front. Heat flux gauges estimate the radiative heat flux from the flame to the solid. Flame height is measured with CCD cameras, and a PIV system is used to characterize the flow field. A simple algebraic expression from the literature linking flame spread, flame characteristics and pyrolysis evolution has been used to model upward flame spread. Th...|$|E
30|$|We chose a {{large sample}} of data {{collected}} by the real FMSoS from November 23, 2015, to December 31, 2015. This interval was important because during these months a number of floods occurred. This enabled us to establish whether or not our simulation results in a diversity of situations. We sent 1000 samples for each sensor, being sent every 5 min, and 1000 for crowdsourcing systems. Considering that we only had data to <b>feed</b> <b>sensors</b> in a simulation, we adapted them so to have similar data for stimuli generators for crowdsourcing systems and drones. For crowdsourcing systems, the aforementioned scale was used to classify risk between 0 and 6. So we could simulate how people would react and behave due to the changes in water level registered before by sensors. Then, we created a dataset correspondent to the data used to <b>feed</b> <b>sensors.</b> This dataset is available externally 17. For drones, we used 5000 drone data, since the drone receives every 500 m a measurement and 2500 m flown every 5 min, totaling this amount for the entire days that we consider in our sample.|$|R

40|$|Fire Safety Engineering is {{required}} {{at every stage}} in {{the life cycle of}} modern-day buildings. Fire safety design, detection and suppression, and emergency response are all vital components of Structural Fire Safety but are usually perceived as independent issues. Sensor deployment and exploitation is now common place in modern buildings for means such as temperature, air quality and security management. Despite the potential wealth of information these sensors could afford fire fighters, the design of sensor networks within buildings is entirely detached from procedures associated to emergency management. The experiences of Dalmarnock Fire Test Two showed that streams of raw data emerging from sensors lead to a rapid information overload and do little to improve the understanding of the complex phenomenon and likely future events during a real fire. Despite current sensor technology in other fields being far more advanced than that of fire, there is no justification for more complex and expensive sensors in this context. In isolation therefore, sensors are not sufficient to aid emergency response. Fire modelling follows a similar path. Two studies of Dalmarnock Fire Test One demonstrate clearly {{the current state of the}} art of fire modelling. A Priori studies by Rein et al. 2009 showed that blind prediction of the evolution of a compartment fire is currently beyond the state of the art of fire modelling practice. A Posteriori studies by Jahn et al. 2007 demonstrated that even with the provision of large quantities of sensor data, video footage, and prior knowledge of the fire; producing a CFD reconstruction was an incredibly difficult, laborious, intuitive and repetitive task. Fire fighting is therefore left as an isolated activity that does not benefit from sensor data or the potential of modelling the event. In isolation sensors and fire modelling are found lacking. Together though they appear to form the perfect compliment. Sensors provide a plethora of information which lacks interpretation. Models provide a method of interpretation but lack the necessary information to make this output robust. Thus a mechanism to achieve accurate, timely predictions by means of theoretical models steered by continuous calibration against sensor measurements is proposed. Issues of accuracy aside, these models demand heavy resources and computational time periods that are far greater than the time associated with the processes being simulated. To be of use to emergency responders, the output would need to be produced faster than the event itself with lead time to enable planning of an intervention strategy. Therefore in isolation, model output is not robust or fast enough to be implemented in an emergency response scenario. The concept of super-real time predictions steered by measurements is studied in the simple yet meaningful scenario of concurrent flow flame spread. Experiments have been conducted with PMMA slabs to <b>feed</b> <b>sensor</b> data into a simple analytical model. Numerous sensing techniques have been adapted to feed a simple algebraic expression from the literature linking flame spread, flame characteristics and pyrolysis evolution in order to model upward flame spread. The measurements are continuously fed to the computations so that projections of the flame spread velocity and flame characteristics can be established at each instant in time, ahead of the real flame. It was observed that as the input parameters in the analytical models were optimised to the scenario, rapid convergence between the evolving experiment and the predictions was attained.

40|$|Abstract — In {{a massive}} stream of {{sequential}} {{events such as}} stock <b>feeds,</b> <b>sensor</b> readings, or IP traffic measurements, tuples pertaining to recent events are typically more important than older ones. It is important to compute various aggregates over such streams after applying a decay function which assigns weights to tuples based on their age. We focus on the computation of exponentially decayed aggregates {{in the form of}} quantiles and heavy hitters. Our techniques are based on extending existing data stream summaries, such as the q-digest [1] and the “spacesaving” algorithm [2].

40|$|Streams {{of events}} appear {{increasingly}} today in various Web {{applications such as}} blogs, <b>feeds,</b> <b>sensor</b> data streams, geospatial information, on-line financial data, etc. Event Processing (EP) is concerned with timely detection of compound events within streams of simple events. State-of-the-art EP provides on-the-fly analysis of event streams, but cannot combine streams with background knowledge and cannot perform reasoning tasks. On the other hand, semantic tools can effectively handle background knowledge and perform reasoning thereon, but cannot deal with rapidly changing data provided by event streams. To bridge the gap, we propose Event Processing SPARQL (EP-SPARQL) as a new language for complex events and Stream Reasoning. We provide syntax and formal semantics of the language and devise an effective execution model for the proposed formalism. The execution model is grounded on logic programming, and features effective event processing and inferencing capabilities over temporal and static knowledge. We provide an open-source prototype implementation and present a set of tests to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach...|$|R

The solution allows to (electrically) <b>feed</b> <b>sensors</b> located in hardly accessible places of mechanical constructions with simultaneous half-duplex data transmission (e. g. measurement “question-response”), when conventional power supply (requiring e. g. electricity networks, storage batteries, batteries, etc.) is eliminated. The mechanism of power transmission consists in “sending ” of mechanical energy through an actuator in a form of “pure ” sinusoidal ultrasonic wave and next “receiving ” it and transforming into useful electrical current by a harvester. Both magnetostrictive and piezoelectric harvesters/actuators were used. For information transfer F 2 F (frequency- double frequency) procedures were used, they {{are a kind of}} FM (Frequency Modulation). To optimise transmission (the highest possible efficiency and acceptably low noise level), software allowing to select the right type of an actuator, modulation and the recommended frequency band was developed.

40|$|Processing large data streams {{is now a}} major {{topic in}} data management. The data {{involved}} can be truly massive, and the required analyses complex. In a stream of sequential events such as stock <b>feeds,</b> <b>sensor</b> readings, or IP traffic measurements, data tuples pertaining to recent events are typically more important than older ones. This can be formalized via time-decay functions, which assign weights to data based on the age of data. Decay functions such as sliding windows and exponential decay have been studied under the assumption of well-ordered arrivals, i. e., data arrives in non-decreasing order of time stamps. However, data quality issues are prevalent in massive streams (due to network asynchrony and delays etc.), and correct arrival order is not guaranteed. We focus on the computation of decayed aggregates such as range queries, quantiles, and heavy hitters on out-of-order streams, where elements do not necessarily arrive in increasing order of timestamps. Existing techniques such as Exponential Histograms and Waves are unable to handle out-of-order streams. We give the first deterministic algorithms for approximating these aggregates under popular decay functions such as sliding window and polynomial decay. We study the overhead of allowing out-of-order arrivals when compared to well-ordered arrivals, both analytically and experimentally. Our experiments confirm that these algorithms can be applied in practice, and compare the relative performance of different approaches for handling out-of-order arrivals...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to give recovery crane operators the ability to visualize the crane 2 ̆ 7 s center of gravity, while picking up a load. With this ability, the operators will know when the crane is close to tipping over. Currently, no system dynamically calculates the center of gravity. This {{is especially important for}} recovery cranes, which typically work on un-level ground. This system can save a recovery crane company millions in damage to the crane, and prevent injuries to the operator or support personnel on site.
