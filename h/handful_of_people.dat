5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} and years after the typhoon, natives in Ulithi were {{examined}} for increased levels of stress. Unexpectedly, only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, with the majority seemingly unfazed by Ophelia. There was some talk among residents of leaving Ulithi and moving to nearby islands such as Yap, Palau, Saipan, or even the Philippines; however, mentions of this diminished relatively quickly. The devastation to the island's infrastructure hastened a previously gradual change in buildings. Reconstruction efforts had entirely abandoned traditional Ulithi building styles {{in favor of more}} modern ones. The survival of concrete buildings prompted an overall desire among people to construct all buildings with concrete. Alongside the infrastructural overhaul, a shift in dietary changes to a more western style occurred.|$|E
25|$|The band's tour {{stories have}} become legendary. During their first European tour in 1997, after having played {{a show in}} Wels {{in front of a}} <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> at an indoor skate park with Flatline and Racial Abuse the band was stopped at the Austrian border on their way to Zagreb. The members were strip searched and held for hours, while the van was {{disassembled}} by the customs officials. Another incident happened {{on the last day of}} a tour in Quebec in 1999, when they had all their money and merchandise seized.|$|E

He releases albums through his own record label Corwood Industries, keeping a Houston post office box so fans can write to Corwood for a typewritten catalogue and order Jandek’s albums, usually at low prices. Many of his albums feature photos of a caucasian man at various ages; although it seemed likely {{that this man was}} the principal performer, this presumption was not certain until his live debut in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Early in the investigation, {{the police}} felt {{confident}} that the assailant or assailants {{were familiar with the}} victims and that the victims probably knew their killer. The investigators theorized that the time of the killings had not been coincidental. Based on the fact that only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> knew that Anne would be visiting on that precise time, the investigators concluded that the killer had the house under careful surveillance, and acting when seeing her car parked outside. The main theory is that Anne Orderud Paust was the main target of the killer or killers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have seen}} the Yongle Emperor as in a lifelong pursuit of power, prestige, and glory. He {{respected}} and worked hard to preserve Chinese culture by designing monuments such as the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, while undermining and expelling from Chinese society people from foreign cultures. He deeply admired and wished to save his father's accomplishments and {{spent a lot of}} time proving his claim to the throne. His military accomplishments and leadership are rivaled by only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in world history. His reign was a mixed blessing for the Chinese populace. The Yongle Emperor's economic, educational, and military reforms provided unprecedented benefits for the people, but his despotic style of government set up a spy agency. Despite these negatives, he is considered an architect and keeper of Chinese culture, history, and statecraft and an influential ruler in Chinese history.|$|E

25|$|After {{defeating}} John Pulman in two close {{finals in}} 1955 and 1956, Davis {{chose not to}} play in the 1957 Championship—held in Jersey and, for financial reasons, featuring just four entrants—thus leaving the path clear for his rival Pulman. After the war Davis and his wife had invested in a hotel in Llandudno, and this gave them some financial security away from snooker. This proved a wise move; by the early 1960s Davis was playing exhibitions in aid of cancer charities, but soon even this limited amount of snooker activity dried up. Following tours of Canada and Australia (where he won an international tournament in 1960) and after an exhibition in Pontefract where he performed in front of only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> Davis effectively went into retirement. He hardly played for four seasons before being contacted by Rex Williams, who was keen to restart interest in snooker.|$|E
25|$|From 1920 to 1950, Mexico was {{the third}} largest {{producer}} of handcrafts, behind Japan and China, with the support described above. However, this support {{did not lead to}} major museum collections or higher valuations on the work being produced. Some crafts did not benefit from being associated with the new myth of Mexican identity. One in particular is waxcrafting, as it is mostly associated with Catholic religious items and motifs. Today, only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> still work with wax and for all intents and purposes, the craft is dead in Mexico. The glorification of crafts and national icons, archetypes and prototypes {{in the first half of}} the 20th century had some negative effects. Certain images such as the China Poblana, rural scenes, charros etc.,began to appear almost ubiquitously on products artisans were making. The promotion of Mexican artesanía was accepted earlier by foreigners than by Mexicans themselves. Very few examples of crafts from the early 20th century survive and most of the best collections of it are in North American or European hands.|$|E

In his response to the criticism—an article entitled [...] "Why We Love Bobby Singer"—Williams wrote, [...] "I think it's a shame when people like Jim Beaver or Eric Kripke have to step forward to address this vocal minority, especially when the minority is just a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> gathering at a certain TV website that's known for being snarky and negative about everything.

Several groups were represented and spoke at the protest, including: Indivisible KC, Kansas City Progressive Caucus, The Muslim Civic Initiative, and Edward Cantu, an associate law professor at the University of Missouri–Kansas City. The Knoxville, Tennessee protest was organized by David T. Payne and held at Market Square. Only 18 people expressed interest in attending the event on its Facebook page, and fewer than ten individuals ended up participating.
