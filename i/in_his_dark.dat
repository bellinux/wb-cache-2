25|$|In 1935, as anti-Semitism {{was growing}} in Germany, Vishniac was {{commissioned}} by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in Central Europe to photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe {{as part of a}} fund-raising drive to help support these poor communities. Vishniac developed and printed these pictures <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> room in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again {{at the behest of the}} JDC. Vishniac used both a Leica and a Rolleiflex camera in his photography. In 1939, his wife and children moved to Sweden to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in Nice that summer.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 1922, Crosby and Polly {{were married}} in the Municipal Building in New York City, and two days later they re-boarded the RMS Aquitania and moved with her {{children}} to Paris, France. There they joined the Lost Generation of expatriate Americans disillusioned {{by the loss of}} life in World War I and the moral and social values of their parents' generation. Crosby continued his work at Morgan, Harjes et Cie, the Morgan family’s bank in Paris. They found an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans overlooking the Seine, on the exclusive Île Saint-Louis, and Polly would don her red bathing suit and row Crosby down the Seine <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> business suit, formal hat, umbrella and briefcase to the Place de la Concorde where he would walk the last few blocks to the bank on Place Vendôme. As she rowed back home, Polly, who was well endowed, would enjoy whistles, jeers and waves from workmen. She said the exercise was good for her breasts.|$|E

It gained notability again in 1987 when Orbison {{released}} a re-recorded anthology of his greatest hits; the year prior David Lynch had used the song provocatively <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> thriller Blue Velvet, helping to revive Orbison's career. The theme of the song was interwoven in similar compositions throughout his tenure as a musician. As a result, several collections of Orbison's music share {{the title of the}} song.

2500|$|Frank Miller {{has also}} stated that All Star Batman & Robin does exist in the same {{continuity}} as the other storylines <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Dark</b> Knight Universe.

However, this has been proven difficult as The Dark Knight Returns is set during the Cold War with an older Batman while All Star Batman & Robin features a younger Batman in a more modern setting, specifically 2008. An additional story, titled Holy Terror, Batman!, was also to be included within the same continuity. However, in 2010, Miller stated {{that he was no}} longer working on the project. [...] He later clarified his statement by explaining that it would feature a new character called The Fixer rather than Batman, and not be published by DC. In 2007, Frank Miller's [...] "Dark Knight Universe" [...] was officially designated as Earth-31 within the new DC Comics Multiverse composed of 52 alternate universes.|$|E
