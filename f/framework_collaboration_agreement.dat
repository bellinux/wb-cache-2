40|$|In the <b>framework</b> of a <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> {{with the}} TERA Foundation, CERN {{provided}} the design, drawings and engineering specifications for two kickers, one chopper and three bumper magnets {{as well as}} three magnetic and two electrostatic septa, power supplies for the electrostatic septa, kickers and bumpers including control electronics for the PIMMS/TERA proton and carbon ion medical synchrotron. The first application {{will be in the}} Italian National Centre for Hadrontherapy, to be constructed in Pavia.

40|$|The works {{presented}} in this document are developed under <b>framework</b> of the <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreements</b> signed between the Centro de Estudios Hidrográficos (CEDEX), FLUMEN research group (UPC), GEAMA (UdC) and CIMNE. The result of this agreement is a numerical simulation cade that put together the experience o/ all the partners in the different aspects of river dynamics. The new tool called lBER, is aimed to the hydrodynamic and morphological simulation of rivers flow. Nowadays IBER includes a hydrodynamic module that allows 2 D modellization of rivers, a turbulence module and a sediments transport module that considers both bedload and suspended salid discharge. IBER offers, as well, a user friendly interface that takes profit of the capabilities of GiD, both in pre and post process. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) is developing, {{within the}} <b>framework</b> of a <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), prototypes of five {{corrector}} magnets, from skew quadrupoles to dodecapoles, which will equip the high-luminosity interaction {{regions of the}} high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider. These magnets {{are based on a}} superferric design, which allows a relatively simple, modular, and easy-to-construct magnet. In this paper, we review the main features of the corrector magnets, and we present the results of the manufacture of the sextupole superconducting coils, from the development of suitable solutions for the winding and impregnation to the quality assessment on the series coils, including the results of the first cryogenic tests on a single coil...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{has become}} an {{important}} production factor. Tacit knowledge is embodied {{in the minds of}} people, and {{is part and parcel of}} their skills. Since businesses concentrate on strategic tasks, many others are outsourced. This also applies to R&D. External knowledge sources help firms to leverage its internal R&D efforts. Internal and external knowledge have to be knitted together on the work floor giving rise to innovative products and processes. Since tacit knowledge is embodied in personnel, it is interesting to look at the role of the functions and the qualifications of R&D personnel in relation to activities developed in the <b>framework</b> of technical <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreements.</b> Using the R&D OECD survey of firms in Belgium, insights are offered in the way that external knowledge impacts on the organisation of the internal division of labour. We demonstrate that absorptive capacity, embodied in people, is a key element in using external knowledge. status: publishe...|$|R
