500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E

60|$|We have to {{discourage}} the cheap tricks of controversy, the retort, the search for inconsistency. We {{have to realize that}} these things are as foolish and ill-bred and anti-social as shouting in conversation or making puns; and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> habits of thought purged from the sin of assurance. We have to do this for our own good quite as much as for the sake of intercourse.|$|E
60|$|I am {{very clear}} in my mind on this {{perpetual}} need of competition. I admit that upon that turns the practicability of all the great series of organizing schemes that are called Socialism.

We Socialists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> all these questions far more thoroughly than we have done hitherto. We owe that to our movement and the world.|$|E

6000|$|... 192. Plate XIV. {{gives you}} examples, from more {{advanced}} art, of true Greek representation; the subjects being the two contests of leading import to the Greek heart--that of Apollo with the Python, and of Hercules with the Nemean Lion. You {{see that in}} neither case is there the slightest effort to represent the [Greek: lyssa] or agony of contest. No good Greek artist would have you behold the suffering, either of gods, heroes, or men; nor allow you to be apprehensive {{of the issue of}} their contest with evil beasts, or evil spirits. All such lower sources of excitement are to be closed to you; your interest is to be in the thoughts involved by the fact of the war; and in the beauty or rightness of form, whether active or inactive. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> this subject with you afterwards, and to compare with the pure Greek method of thought, that of modern dramatic passion, engrafted on it, as typically in Turner's contest of Apollo and the Python: in the meantime, be content with the statement of this first great principle--that a Greek, as such, never expresses momentary passion.|$|E
6000|$|While {{he was at}} home, the {{schoolmaster}} of the place, who {{saw that}} the lad had abilities, was never tired of urging {{him to go to}} school, and do himself justice by getting himself a first-rate education, or at least as good a one as could be obtained in America. James was ready enough to take this advice, if the means were forthcoming; but how was he to do so? [...] "Oh, that's easy enough," [...] said young Bates, the master. [...] "You'll only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> of hours as a carpenter, take odd jobs in your vacations, live plainly, and there you are." [...] In England there are few schools where such a plan would be practicable; but in rough-and-ready America, where self-help is no disgrace, there are many, and they are all well attended. In the neighbouring town of Chester, a petty Baptist sect had started a young school which they named Geauga Seminary (there are no plain schools in America--they are all [...] "academies" [...] or [...] "institutes"); and to this simple place young Garfield went, to learn and work as best he might for his own advancement. A very strange figure he must then have cut, indeed; for a person who saw him at the time described him as wearing a pair of trousers he had long outworn, rough cow-hide boots, a waistcoat much too short for him, and a thread-bare coat, with sleeves that only reached a little below the elbows. Of such stuff as that, with a stout heart and an eager brain, the budding presidents of the United States are sometimes made.|$|E
