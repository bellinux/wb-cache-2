If the fault is present, the output will be different than it would be if the fault were not present. Given a circuit, the goal of an automatic test pattern generation system is to generate a set of input sets that will detect every possible single stuck-at fault in the circuit. These two papers describe a new method for generating test patterns: the Boolean satisfiability method. The new method is quite general and allows for the addition of any heuristic used by the structural search methods. The Boolean satisfiability method has produced excellent results on popular test pattern generation benchmarks. The first paper, Efficient Generation of Test Patterns Using Boolean Difference, gives an overview of a successful test pattern generation system using the Boolean satisfiability method.

Current treatment drawbacks involve topical medications not being able to reach the nail bed at therapeutic concentrations, systemic antifungal drugs failing to eradicate the fungus before the nails are renewed, severe side effects and selection of resistant fungal isolates. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a promising alternative to conventional treatments. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the in vitro effectiveness of toluidine blue O (TBO) irradiated by Light emitting diode (LED) in the reduction of T. rubrum viability. METHODS: The fungal inoculums' was prepared and exposed to different TBO concentrations and energy densities of Light emitting diode <b>for</b> <b>evaluate</b> the <b>T.</b> rubrum sensibility to PDT and production effect fungicidal after photodynamic treatment. In addition, the profiles of the area and volume of the irradiated fungal suspensions were also investigated. RESULTS: A small reduction, in vitro, of fungal cells was observed after exposition to 100 µM toluidine blue O irradiated by 18 J/cm² Light emitting diode. Fungicidal effect occurred after 25 µM toluidine blue O irradiation by Light emitting diode with energy density of 72 J/cm². The analysis showed that the area and volume irradiated by the Light emitting diode were 52. 2 mm² and 413. 70 mm³, respectively.

This information is used to improve the image homogeneity of magnetic resonance imaging when a surface coil is used for reception, and to increase image encoding speed by reconstructing images from under-sampled (aliased) acquisitions using parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for higher spatiotemporal image resolutions. The proposed algorithm estimates the spatial sensitivity profile of surface coils from the original anatomical images directly without using the body coil for additional reference scans or using coil position markers for electromagnetic model-based calculations. No prior knowledge about the anatomy {{is required for the}} application of the algorithm. The estimation of the coil sensitivity profile based on the wavelet transform of the original image data was found to provide a robust method for removing the slowly varying spatial sensitivity pattern of the surface coil image and recovering full FOV images from two-fold acceleration in 8 -channel parallel MRI.

40|$|Abstract Background Assessment of T-cell diversity, besides giving {{insights}} about the molecular basis of tumor antigen recognition, has clinical implications since it provides criteria <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> antigen-specific <b>T</b> cells clinically relevant for spontaneous and vaccine-induced anti-tumor activity. Melan-A {{is one of}} the melanoma antigens most frequently recognized by peripheral and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in HLA-A 2 + melanoma patients. Many clinical trials involving anti-tumor vaccination have been conducted using modified versions of this peptide. Methods We conducted an in-depth characterization of 210 T-cell receptor beta chain (TRB) clonotypes derived from T cells of HLA-A 2 + melanoma patients displaying cytotoxic activity against natural and A 27 L-modified Melan-A peptides. One hundred and thirteen Melan-A-specific clonotypes from melanoma-free subjects, 199 clonotypes from T-cell clones from melanoma patients specific for melanoma antigens other than Melan-A, and 305 clonotypes derived from T cells of HLA-A 2 + individuals showing unrelated specificities, were used as control. After sequence analysis, performed according to the IMGT definitions, TRBV and TRBJ usage, CDR 3 length and amino acid composition were compared in the four groups of clonotypes. Results TRB sequences of Melan-A-specific clonotypes obtained from melanoma patients were highly heterogeneous, but displayed a preferential usage of few TRBV and TRBJ segments. Furthermore, they included a recurrent "public" amino acid motif (Glycine-Leucine-Glycine at positions 110 - 112 - 113 of the CDR 3) rearranged with dominant TRBV and TRBJ segments and, in one case, associated with a full conservation of the entire TRB sequence. Conclusion Contrary to what observed for public anti-Melan-A T-cell receptor alpha motifs, which had been identified in several clonotypes of both melanoma patients and healthy controls, the unexpectedly high contribution of a public TRB motif in the recognition of a dominant melanoma epitope in melanoma patients may provide important information about the biology of anti-tumor T-cell responses and improve monitoring strategies of anti-tumor vaccines. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) is a progressive disease condition. As the disease progresses {{the function of}} beta (β) cells (cells which regulate insulin) decline, thereby increasing the circulating blood glucose levels. If left unmanaged the disease progresses from onset to development of T 2 DM related complications and eventually death. When managed, in certain individuals, T 2 DM onset can be prevented and/or slowed down and in certain T 2 DM individuals, remission is observed. There are some known modifiable risk factors such as diet and physical activities {{that are associated with}} the speed and direction of progression, but much is still unknown. In order to develop effective intervention and management programs, it is first important to understand the factors that predict speed and direction of T 2 DM progression. Purpose: This dissertation <b>evaluated</b> <b>T</b> 2 DM disease progression with three key objectives: a) evaluate factors that predict T 2 DM onset; b) <b>evaluate</b> rate of <b>T</b> 2 DM “remission” and, c) evaluate factors that predict T 2 DM “remission” in Medicare patients 65 years and older who did not undergo bariatric surgery. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of a Medicare Advantage health plan was conducted using administrative data. An individual was identified as T 2 DM if they had: ≥ 2 medical claims for T 2 DM coded 250. xx excluding type 1 diabetes; or ≥ 2 pharmacy claims related to T 2 DM; or ≥ 2 combined medical claims, pharmacy claims for T 2 DM in 12 months. A T 2 DM individual was in “remission” if they had no T 2 DM related claims for more than 12 months continuously. This is different from the standard American Diabetes Association definition of remission which includes HbA 1 c values and hence is represented in quotation (as “remission”). 89, 390 individuals were <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 DM onset and 10, 059 T 2 DM individuals were <b>evaluated</b> <b>for</b> <b>T</b> 2 DM “remission” over a period of 8 years from 2008 to 2015. Cox proportional hazards was used to identify significant variables associated with T 2 DM onset and “remission. ” Results: The factors that were significantly associated with T 2 DM onset were: male gender; non-white ethnicity (African American, Hispanics); statin use; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; heart failure; ulcer of lower limbs; atherosclerosis; other retinopathy; angina pectoris; blindness and low vision; absence of other chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD) (pConclusions:In line with previously published studies, the study presented here also found that hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gender and race are significantly associated with T 2 DM onset. In addition to these known factors, this study identified additional factors associated with T 2 DM onset such as: statin use; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; heart failure; ulcer of lower limbs; atherosclerosis; other retinopathy; angina pectoris; blindness and low vision and absence of other chronic ischemic heart disease. This study found that in Medicare T 2 DM patients 65 years and older “remission” does occur without bariatric surgery. This study verified known factors such as absence of dyslipidemia and race to be associated with T 2 DM “remission. ” In addition to these known factors this study found that no statin use; low diabetes complications severity index score (DCSI); no hypertension; no neuropathy; no retinopathy; presence of other chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD) and female gender were significantly associated with T 2 DM “remission. ” These findings could be used for the development of T 2 DM related disease intervention and management programs. The DCSI score of T 2 DM individuals could be used to help stratify them based on T 2 DM severity for design and individualized, targeted outreach. Lastly, in this study hypertension, hyperlipidemia, statins use were associated with T 2 DM onset and T 2 DM “remission. ” Since these factors are also associated with metabolic disease, their mutual relation needs to be evaluated further, upon availability of laboratory and physician notes data. Metabolic disease is a known predictor for T 2 DM onset and future studies might find that metabolic disease might also be a predictor for T 2 DM “remission. ...|$|R

Our expressions are direct, and do not use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Wigner 3 -j symbols, though we compare our results with methods that use these, to prove their accuracy. We test our expressions on a number of simple calculations, and show their accuracy. <b>For</b> <b>evaluating</b> a N <b>t</b> term truncation of the translation (involving O(N 2 t) multipoles), compared to previous exact expressions that rely on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Wigner 3 -j symbol that require O N 5 t operations, our expressions require O(N 4 t) evaluations, with a small constant multiplying the order term. The recent trend in evaluating such translations has been to use approximate "diagonalizations," that require O(N 3 t) evaluations with a large coefficient for the order term. For the Helmholtz equation, these translations in addition have stabilty problems unless the accuracy of the truncation and approximate translation are balanced. We derive explicit exact expressions for achieving "diagonal" translations in O(N 3 t) operations. Our expressions are based on recursive evaluations of multipole coefficients for rotations, and are accurate and stable, and have a much smaller coeffiicient for the order term, resulting practically in much fewer operations.
