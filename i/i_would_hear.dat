[...] Cast in April 2005, Owen spent several weeks collaborating with Cuarón and Sexton about his role. [...] Impressed by Owen's {{creative}} insights, Cuarón and Sexton brought him on board as a writer. [...] "Clive {{was a big}} help," [...] Cuarón told Variety.

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hear</b> a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. I never thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hear</b> myself say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's a Long Way There": [...] "I {{wrote that}} song about how I {{moved to another}} state and I missed Adelaide a lot. I used to drive home 8–10hours each month to visit my family. That's where the title came from. And then {{as we used to}} play 7 nights a week, we were battling for material, we'd go for very long jams on that song, {{sometimes}} 20minutes at a time. And during the long outros, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hear</b> and come up with different passages, so I would often jot them down and rehearse them and add or take out a bit here and there. Today, I believe that the lyric is about a personal journey, a journey through lifetimes to your soul evolution." ...|$|E
