50|$|<b>Itopride</b> is {{contraindicated}} in hypersensitivity to <b>itopride</b> or benzamides; lactation, GI hemorrhage, obstruction or perforation. <b>Itopride</b> {{may not be}} indicated {{for those}} suffering from Parkinson's disease or other conditions involving dopamine regulation issues. <b>Itopride</b> should be used with special caution in {{the young and the}} elderly. Little information is available at this time regarding the safe use of <b>itopride</b> during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that <b>itopride</b> may have prokinetic effects throughout the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach {{to the end of}} the colon. The pharmacokinetics of <b>itopride</b> appear to differ between Asian and Caucasian populations, with Caucasians having 30-50 percent lower blood levels of <b>itopride</b> after oral administration. <b>Itopride</b> poorly penetrates across the blood brain barrier because of its high polarity and thus <b>itopride</b> does not tend to cause any central nervous system adverse effects. <b>Itopride</b> has no effect on potassium channels.|$|E
50|$|After oral {{administration}} <b>itopride</b> undergoes rapid and extensive absorption with levels of <b>itopride</b> peaking {{in the blood}} plasma after only 35 minutes. <b>Itopride</b> is primarily eliminated via the kidneys having an elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours.|$|E
50|$|These studies {{concluded}} that {{the reduction in the}} severity of symptoms of functional dyspepsia after 8 weeks of treatment with <b>itopride</b> indicated that <b>itopride</b> was significantly superior to placebo and that <b>itopride</b> yielded a greater rate of response than placebo in significantly reducing pain and fullness.|$|E
50|$|The {{conclusion}} of this study revealed that <b>itopride</b> is devoid of any abnormal effect on QT interval. Therefore, {{it may be possible}} that <b>itopride</b> could be considered as a better and certainly safer prokinetic agent than either cisapride or mosapride, and <b>itopride</b> should also be considered a welcome treatment addition for symptomatic nonulcer dyspepsia and other gastric motility disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Itopride</b> {{belongs to}} the same benzamide group as cisapride, a drug found to affect QT {{interval}} and possibly predispose those using it to cardiac arrhythmias. However, <b>itopride</b> {{does not have any}} adverse effect on the QT interval.|$|E
50|$|<b>Itopride</b> is a {{relatively}} new drug and it is not currently approved for normal prescribed use nor OTC use in either the US nor the UK. However, this does not necessarily indicate that <b>itopride</b> is not effective or safe.|$|E
50|$|Anticholinergic agents {{reduce the}} action of itopride.It {{is worth noting that}} <b>itopride</b> is a {{relatively}} new drug and that it is, therefore, possible that other drugs may interact with <b>itopride,</b> rendering contraindications or side effects that are not currently known.|$|E
50|$|<b>Itopride</b> (INN) (brand name Ganaton) is a prokinetic benzamide {{derivative}} unlike metoclopramide or domperidone. These drugs inhibit dopamine and acetylcholine esterase enzyme {{and have}} a gastrokinetic effect. <b>Itopride</b> is indicated {{for the treatment of}} functional dyspepsia and other gastrointestinal conditions. It is a combined D2 receptor antagonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Itopride</b> {{was shown}} to {{significantly}} improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia and motility disorders in placebo-controlled trials.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{in a study}} {{conducted}} with healthy adult volunteers, <b>itopride</b> was shown as unlikely to cause cardiac arrhythmias or ECG changes {{in part to the}} lack of significant interaction and metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, unlike cisapride and mosapride, as it is metabolized by a different enzyme set. New molecular studies on guinea pig ventricular myocytes also supported the cardiac safety profile of <b>itopride,</b> as it did not affect certain potassium mechanisms that may have been affected by cisapride or mosapride. Moreover, <b>itopride</b> has no affinity for the 5-HT4 receptors, unlike other benzamides such as cisapride and mosapride, which are 5-HT4 agonists. The affinity of cisapride for 5-HT4 receptors in the heart has been implicated in the undesirable cardiac effects of cisapride itself.|$|E
50|$|Leukopenia, a {{reduction}} in the normal level of white blood cells, can be a potentially life-threatening reaction to <b>itopride.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} marketed in {{combination}} with <b>itopride</b> under the brand names Ganaton Total, Kurepan-IT, Nupenta-ITR, P-Bit-ISR, Pepnil-ITO, Prolus-ISR, and Protopan-I.|$|E

50|$|<b>Itopride</b> is {{typically}} taken {{three times a}} day. The dose is usually taken {{on an empty stomach}} about an hour before meals. However, the dosage and details of administration may vary depending on the patient's age, symptoms, and other factors.|$|E
50|$|Central {{nervous system}} adverse effects do not tend to occur due to poor {{penetration}} across the blood brain barrier, although a slight raising of prolactin levels may occur. Raising of prolactin levels {{is more common}} with high dose regimes of <b>itopride.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Itopride</b> is not {{currently}} {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for use in the}} United States, nor is it yet approved in the United Kingdom.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of dyspeptic {{symptoms}} in clinical practice reflect the high prevalence of functional disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Prokinetic agents are the current mainstay in the therapy of functional dyspepsia. One of these drugs is <b>itopride.</b> We evaluated therapeutic efficacy of <b>itopride</b> according to the literature review. The therapeutic potential of <b>itopride</b> is connected with a dual effect: influencing of enzyme acetylcholinesterase activity and blocking dopamine D 2 receptors. After the <b>itopride</b> administration, the contractility of smooth muscle in the upper GI tract increases. <b>Itopride</b> is a drug with rapid absorption from the small bowel; its peak serum concentration occurs 35 minutes after oral administration. <b>Itopride</b> does not pass the blood-brain barrier and {{does not affect the}} heart rate by influencing the QT segment. <b>Itopride</b> is a safe prokinetic agent with positive influence on the symptoms of functional dyspepsia such as postprandial fullness, bloating, and gastric emptying. <b>Itopride</b> could also be used for the therapy of the mild form of gastro-oesophageal reflux...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntroduction: <b>Itopride</b> {{is a new}} prokinetic agent which {{combines}} antidopaminergic and cholinesterase inhibitory actions. Previous studies suggested that <b>itopride</b> improves heartburn in functional dyspepsia, and decreases esophageal acid exposure in GERD. It is unclear whether this effect is due to effects of <b>itopride</b> on the LES. Aims: To {{study the effects of}} <b>itopride</b> on fasting and postprandial LES function in healthy subjects. Materials and methods: twelve healthy volunteers (5 males; 32. 6 Â± 2. 0 years) underwent three esophageal sleeve manometry studies after 3 days premedication with <b>itopride</b> 50 mg, <b>itopride</b> 100 mg or placebo t. i. d. Drug was administered after 30 minutes and a standardized meal was administered after 90 minutes, with measurements continuing to 120 minutes postprandially. Throughout the study, 10 wet swallows were administered at 30 -minute intervals, and gastrointestinal symptoms were scored on 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS) at 15 -minute intervals. Results: LES resting pressures, swallow-induced relaxations and the amplitude or duration of peristaltic contractions were not altered by both doses of <b>itopride,</b> at all time points. <b>Itopride</b> pretreatment inhibited the meal-induced rise of transient LES relaxations (TLESRs).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Itopride</b> {{is a new}} prokinetic {{agent that}} {{combines}} antidopaminergic and cholinesterase inhibitory actions. Previous studies suggested that <b>itopride</b> improves heartburn in functional dyspepsia, and decreases oesophageal acid exposure in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It remains unclear whether this effect is due to effects of <b>itopride</b> on the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES). AIMS: To {{study the effects of}} <b>itopride</b> on fasting and postprandial LES function in healthy subjects. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (five men; 32. 6 Â± 2. 0 years) underwent three oesophageal sleeve manometry studies after 3 days premedication with <b>itopride</b> 50 mg, <b>itopride</b> 100 mg or placebo t. d. s.

The effect of food on the bioavailability of <b>itopride</b> ER was also assessed. Methods: A single-center, open-label, randomized, multiple-dose, three-treatment, three-sequence, crossover study was performed in 24 healthy male subjects, aged 22 â 48 years, who randomly received one of the following treatments for 4 days in each period: <b>itopride</b> 150 mg ER once daily under fasting or fed conditions, or <b>itopride</b> 50 mg IR three times daily in the fasting state. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>itopride,</b> including peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over 24 hours after dosing (AUC 0 â 24 h), were determined by noncompartmental analysis. The geometric mean ratio of the pharmacokinetic parameters was derived using an analysis of variance model. Results: A total of 24 healthy Korean subjects participated, 23 of whom completed the study. The geometric mean ratio and its 90 % confidence interval of once-daily ER <b>itopride</b> versus IR <b>itopride</b> three times a day for AUC 0 â 24 h were contained within the conventional bioequivalence range of 0. 80 â 1. 25 (0. 94 [0. 88 â 1. 01]), although Cmax was reached more slowly and was lower for <b>itopride</b> ER than for the IR formulation. Food delayed the time taken to reach Cmax for <b>itopride</b> ER, but AUC 0 â 24 h was not affected. There were no serious adverse events and both formulations were generally well tolerated. Conclusion: At steady state, once-daily <b>itopride</b> ER at 150 mg has a bioavailability comparable with that of <b>itopride</b> IR at 50 mg given three times a day under fasting conditions. Food delayed the absorption of <b>itopride</b> ER, with no marked change in its oral bioavailability.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of <b>itopride</b> on gastric accommodation, gastric {{emptying}} and drinking capacity in functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: Randomized controlled trial was conducted to check {{the effect of}} <b>itopride</b> on gastric accommodation, gastric emptying, capacity of tolerating nutrient liquid and symptoms of FD. We recruited a total of 31 patients having FD {{on the basis of}} ROME III criteria. After randomization, <b>itopride</b> was received by 15 patients while 16 patients received placebo. Gastric accommodation was determined using Gastric Scintigraphy. 13 C labeled octanoic breadth test was performed to assess gastric emptying. Capacity of tolerating nutrient liquid drink was checked using satiety drinking capacity test. The intervention group comprised of 150 mg <b>itopride.</b> Patients in both arms were followed for 4 wk. RESULTS: Mean age of the recruited participant 33 years (SD = 7. 6) and most of the recruited individuals, i. e., 21 (67. 7 %) were males. We found that there was no effect of <b>itopride</b> on gastric accommodation as measured at different in volumes in the <b>itopride</b> and control group with the empty stomach (P = 0. 14), at 20 min (P = 0. 38), 30 min (P = 0. 30), 40 min (P = 0. 43), 50 min (P = 0. 50), 60 min (P = 0. 81), 90 min (P = 0. 25) and 120 min (P = 0. 67).

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects of <b>itopride</b> vs other drugs (placebo, domperidone, mosapride) for functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>itopride</b> for FD were retrieved from databases. Relevant information was extracted and analyzed, using {{the relative risk}} (RR) and weighted mean deviation, as appropriate. A random or fixed effect model was used, based on the heterogeneity of the included articles, and visual inspection of funnel plots {{was used to evaluate}} publication bias. RESULTS: Nine RCTs enrolling 2620 FD cases were included; 1372 cases received <b>itopride</b> treatment and 1248 cases received placebo or other drugs (control groups). Compared with control groups, <b>itopride</b> had superior RR values of 1. 11 [95 %CI: (1. 03, 1. 19), P = 0. 006], 1. 21 [95 %CI: (1. 03, 1. 44), P = 0. 02], and 1. 24 [95 %CI: (1. 01, 1. 53), P = 0. 04] for global patient assessment, postprandial fullness, and early satiety, respectively.
