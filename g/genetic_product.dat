40|$|Gene {{therapy has}} {{developed}} {{as a method of}} approach to the treatment of human diseases based on the transfer of genetic material to the cells of an individual. Normally, the aim of this transfer of genetic material is to re-establish a cellular function that has been abolished or is defective, to introduce a new function or to interfere with an existing function. Thus, the different gene therapy strategies are based on the combination of three key elements: the genetic material to be transferred, the method of transfer and the cellular type that will incorporate this genetic material. Attention was initially centred on the treatment of monogenic hereditary diseases, but subsequently the majority of clinical trials (over four hundred) have concerned the treatment of cancer.

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of life cycle data of smart products offers {{new opportunities for}} the product development process. Nowadays, products often consist of adaptive design variants of an existing product. Taking this into account, the new product development approach called technical inheritance is developed analogous to biological inheritance. This approach considers the intergenerational evolution of design characteristics. Enhanced smart products are developed within the Collaborate Research Center (CRC) 653 called “Gentelligent Components in Their Lifecycle”. These features the capabilities to sense, collect and transfer life cycle data inherently by using <b>genetic</b> <b>product</b> properties and artificial intelligence. By using technical inheritance optimization strategies are currently investigated and the design of gentelligent components is researched. During the technical inheritance various monitoring concepts are applied to realize a targeted algorithmic feedback of lifecycle information from smart products. For a targeted algorithmic feedback of product life cycle information methods of data mining are applied. These include the objectives of data beneficiation {{as well as information}} detection. The boundaries of the investigations are determined through the gentelligent components. Therefore highly mechanical loaded systems are in focus. It follows that the physical aspects and specific life cycle incidents are major objects for the monitoring concept of the product life cycle. The approach aims at the integration of an evolutionary algorithm to identify the component specific critical loads as well as the optimal allocation of loads cases.

We compare binding of natural hisactophilin exhibiting a myristic acid chain membrane anchor at the N-terminus (DIC-HIS) and a fatty acid-deficient <b>genetic</b> <b>product</b> expressed in Escherichia coli (EC-HIS). It is demonstrated that only the natural hisactophilin DIC-HIS is capable of mediating the strong binding of monomeric actin to the monolayer, where it forms a layer of about 40 A thickness corresponding to the average diameter of actin monomers. Monolayers composed of pure dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine with fully deuterated hydrocarbon tails and headgroup (DMPC-d 67) and 1 : 1 mixtures of this lipid with chain deuterated dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG-d 54) are studied on subphases consisting either of fully deuterated buffer (D 2 O) or of a 9 : 1 H 2 O/D 2 O buffer that matches the scattering length density of air (CMA buffer). The reflectivity data are analyzed in terms of layer models, consisting of one to three layers, depending on the contrast of the buffer and the system. We show that both protein species bind tightly to negatively charged 1 : 1 DMPC-d 67 /DMPG-d 54 monolayers, thereby forming a thin and most probably monomolecular protein layer of 12 - 15 A thickness. We find that the natural protein (DIC-HIS) partially penetrates into the lipid monolayer, in contrast to chain-deficient species (EC-HIS), which forms only an adsorbed layer. The coverage of the monolayer with DIC-HIS strongly depends {{on the presence of}} anionic DMPG in the monolayer. At a bulk protein concentration of 1. 5 micrograms/ml, the molar ratio of bound protein to lipid is about 1 : 45 for the 1 : 1 lipid mixture but only 1 : 420 for the pure DMPC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cell-penetrating {{peptides}} (CPPs) {{can cross}} cellular membranes in a non-toxic fashion, improving the intracellular delivery of various molecular cargos such as nanoparticles, small molecules and plasmid DNA. Because CPPs provide a safe, efficient, and non-invasive {{mode of transport}} for various cargos into cells, they have been developed as vectors for the delivery of <b>genetic</b> and biologic <b>products</b> in recent years. Most common CPPs are positively charged peptides. While delivering negatively charged molecules (e. g., nucleic acids) to target cells, the internalization efficiency of CPPs is reduced and inhibited because the cationic charges on the CPPs are neutralized through the covering of CPPs by cargos on the structure. Even under these circumstances, the CPPs can still be non-covalently complexed with the negatively charged molecules. To address this issue, combination strategies of CPPs with other typical carriers provide a promising and novel delivery system. This review summarizes the latest research work in using CPPs combined with molecular cargos including liposomes, polymers, cationic peptides, nanoparticles, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and calcium for the delivery of <b>genetic</b> <b>products,</b> especially for small interfering RNA (siRNA).

The {{purpose of the present}} review is to give an overview of the available information obtained in studies of genes or <b>genetic</b> <b>products</b> versus erectile function or dysfunction. Recent findings The association of, for example, systemic vascular disease with diminished erectile function has brought attention to investigations of the distribution, in men with erectile dysfunction, of some genotype variants proposed to be involved in cardiovascular disease. Altered expression or activities of some smooth muscle regulatory components of the ischaemic, diabetic, or ageing penis have been reported. Summary Although penile erection can be considered a polygenic trait, some key effectors for normal erectile function within, for example, the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway may be identified. Findings in future population-based studies may disclose the presence of a particular mutation of a gene or gene variants that may predispose to the development of erectile dysfunction. The exact molecular pathogenesis of erectile dysfunction is not known, and may vary between different forms of erectile dysfunction.

General metagenomic analyses have revolved around a taxonomic survey, but the field is beginning to incorporate more functional analyses of the specific genes and <b>genetic</b> <b>products</b> that the microbes express. However, current gene annotation projects tend to be community-size biased and normally concentrated upon single genome curation; furthermore, no public resource is currently available that successfully and efficiently allows for a query concerning specific gene functionality that also spans across a variety of different genomes.

It is expected that a wide range of disease modifying substrates such as enzymes, hormones, antibodies, vaccines, and other <b>genetic</b> <b>products</b> will be used successfully and will impact upon health care substantially. However, a major limitation in the use of these bacterial cells is the complexity of delivering them to the correct target tissues. Oral delivery of live cells, lyophilized cells, and immobilized cells has been attempted but with limited success. Primarily, this is because bacterial cells are incapable of surviving passage through the gastrointestinal tract. In many occasions, when given orally, these cells have been found to provoke immunogenic responses that are undesirable. Recent studies show that these problems can be overcome by delivering live bacterial cells, such as genetically engineered cells, using artificial cell microcapsules. This review summarizes recent advances in the therapeutic use of live bacterial cells for therapy, discusses the principles of using artificial cells for the oral delivery of bacterial cells, outlines methods for preparing suitable artificial cells for this purpose, addresses potentials and limitations for their application in therapy, and provides insight for the future direction of this emergent and highly prospective technology. </p...|$|R

The bibliographic study of abstracts and full text articles retrieved from major databases (PsycInfo, PubMed, EBSCO, SAgE) {{indicates that the}} role of psychology in the establishment and functioning of biobanks is not well articulated. Two promising directions of biobank-based studies are concerned with studies of risk factors for various disorders and with genetic and epigenetic mecha- nisms of psychological and behavioral trait development, and are closely tied to a devel- oping model of a new “personalized” medicine. It is important to carefully select the psy- chological variables and measurements, with consideration of their suitability for genetic studies, possibilities for networking and sharing of results, economic limitations, and biobank purposes. Of special importance is a systemic foundation of mental functions that requires not only the assessment of efficacy, but also the search for simple, natural, and objectively observable components. Applied tasks of professional psychologists in the field of biobanking can be defined, such as donor selection and management of ethi- cal issues.

An important assumption of the Bayesian integration is independence of the input data (features). Our study shows that the conditional dependency cannot be ignored when combining gene interaction databases that rely on partially overlapping input data. In addition, we show how the correlation structure between the databases can be detected and we propose a linear model to correct for this bias. Benchmarking the results against two independent reference data sets shows that the integrated model outperforms the individual datasets.

This rock {{is exposed to}} chemical weathering in tropical conditions and through the leaching reactions leave a friable mantle of in situ regolithic materials. It is envisaged that the serpentine was derived from a pyroxene-rich peridotite. The < 2 μm clay fraction of four regolithic materials obtained from this rockmass in Camp 7,Minglanilla were examined by means of x-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX). Results of analyses showcase the polymineralic and heterogeneous nature of the weathered specimens with serpentine predominating, and could be differentiated possibly into two distinct assemblages. The first assemblage consists principally of serpentine-talc-chlorite-smectite and the second assemblage consists of serpentine-chlorite-smectite. Kaolinite is present in trace amounts in both suites. It is strongly perceived that these secondary minerals are <b>genetic</b> <b>products</b> from cadence of chemical alterations of primary ferromagnesian minerals particularly orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes.
