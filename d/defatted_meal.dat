30|$|<b>Defatted</b> copra <b>meal</b> {{can be used}} as a {{substrate}} for mannanase {{production and}} mannooligosaccharide preparation. The purified M 1 from B. circulans NT 6.7 was a dimeric protein and the pH and temperature optimum were 6.0 and 60  °C, respectively. The purified M 1 was specified to mannan substrates; konjac mannan, locust bean gum, ivory nut, guar gum and <b>defatted</b> copra <b>meal.</b> The M 1 was activated by Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Cu 2 + and inhibited by EDTA. The purified M 1 hydrolyzed konjac mannan, locust bean gum and <b>defatted</b> copra <b>meal</b> into mannooligosaccharides. The ratio of mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, mannopentaose, mannohexaose (M 2 –M 6) was dependent on the substrates and tended to hydrolyze galactomannan (locust bean gum and <b>defatted</b> copra <b>meal)</b> into mannooligosaccharides rather than glucomannan (konjac). Therefore, purified M 1 could be galacto-mannanase, which is suitable for mannooligosaccharide preparation from copra <b>meal.</b> The <b>defatted</b> copra <b>meal</b> hydrolysate could effectively promote the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibit pathogenic bacteria more than commercial mannooligosaccharides, prepared from yeast cell wall.

Results showed that {{the length of time}} between initial feeding and fish sacrifice did not significantly affect digestibility. Gelatin was the most digestible (90 â€“ 98 %) protein, regardless of size. Casein, <b>defatted</b> soybean <b>meal</b> and fish meal were moderately digestible (50 â€“ 90 %) and digestibility coefficients tended to increase as a function of fish size. L. leucocephala was the least digestible (âˆ’ 10 â€“ 40 %). The digestibility of most of these feedstuffs was less in the anterior than in the posterior intestine, and tended to be lower in seawater than in freshwater. Rate of food movement was similar in both size groups, but was significantly faster when milkfish were in seawater rather than in freshwater. The effect of salinity on digestibility may in part be due to food motility changes necessitated by alterations in osmoregulatory processes when fish are in seawater...|$|R
