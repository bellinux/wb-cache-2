The SLS-based SMT solver uses the SLS solver {{to explore the}} set of assignments {{in order to find}} an optimal truth assignment for the Boolean abstraction of the input formula. Then it invokes the T-solver to find conflicts which are used for guiding the SLS search process.

40|$|Cryptographic {{algorithms}} implemented inside {{embedded systems}} {{have been designed to}} guarantee the security of data transition, but these electronic devices can be vulnerable to different class of attacks, mostly side channel attacks. Over the last decade, many attacks have been done successfully on different cryptographic algorithms, but these attacks mostly benefit from different ideal assumption and laboratory conditions. In this paper we propose a novel approach of side channel information analysis, based on fuzzy logic, that can efficiently conjecture the secret bits of a cryptosystem especially in realtime condition in which inputs are usually imprecise, noisy or missing. The validation and <b>effictiveness</b> of the proposed fuzzy approach is shown through a case study and accuracy comparison between electromagnetic, power and fuzzy analysis methods. Our experimental results confirmed that the fuzzy analysis produce comparable results, respectively better in the presence of noise. 5 page(s...|$|E

Misoprostof, a synthetic methyl ester analogue of prostaglandin {{is both a}} powerful inhibitor of gastric secretion {{and is able to}} protect the gastroduodenal mucosa from damage. Misoprostol and other prostaglandine derivatives can be alternative drug of peptic ulcer relapse because the metyl ester of prostaglandin exert an antisecretion and protective effects on peptic mucus. The clinical effectiveness of misoprostol is comparable to cimethidin in short term treatment of peptic and duodenum ulcer as well as reducing duodenal ulcer relapse. Misoprostol may prevent gastrointestinal and peptic ulcer in long term treatment of Non Steroid Anti Jnflamation Drug.  The side effect of misoprostol is cervix maturation and uterotonic.

In a previous work we characterized accurately {{the dynamics of the}} particles undergoing dispersion under the action of the shear layer vortices (SLV) which form in the jet shear layer. In this article, we prol) ose a strate, y to control and possibly optimize the dispersion of species injected in the cross stream. This strategy is based on injecting particle packets (or puffs) synchronized with the time of formation of the shear layer vortices. The possibility to increase or decrease particle dissersion by synchronized, pulsed injection is explored by identifying the relevant parameters of the particle/flow, system; the <b>effictiveness</b> of this strategy is verified by exploring a representative sample of the parameter range...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Listless SPECK (LSPECK) {{is a low}} {{complexity}} {{image coding}} algorithm compared to SPECK. The problem of LSPECK is that, it encode each insignificant subband by a zero. Therefore, these block based coders codes as many zeros {{as the number of}} insignificant subbands. This gives rise to many zeros at the encoder output on early bit plane passes. By looking at the statistics of transformed images, the number of significant coefficients at some of the higher bitplanes are likely to be very few. We propose a variant of LSPECK algorithm, called as Improved LSPECK (ILSPECK), that code a single zero to several insignificant subbands. This reduces the length of the output bit string as well as encoding/decoding time. Further, ILSPECK algorithm is coupled with discrete tchebichef transform (DTT). The propose new coder called as Hierarchical Listless DTT (HLDTT), preserves most of the properties of wavelet coders.

This reaction is an essential step in the biocatalytic production of the food supplement vitamin C from D-glucose or D-gluconic acid. As 2, 5 -DKG reductase is usually produced recombinantly, it is of interest to establish an efficient process for 2, 5 -DKG reductase production that also satisfies food safety requirements. In the present study, three recently described food grade variants of the Lactobacillales based expression systems pSIP (Lactobacillus plantarum) and NICE (Lactococcus lactis) were evaluated {{with regard to their}} <b>effictiveness</b> to produce 2, 5 -DKG reductase from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Our results indicate that both systems are suitable for 2, 5 -DKG reductase expression. Maximum production yields were obtained with Lb. plantarum/pSIP 609 by pH control at 6.5. With 262 U per litre of broth, this represents the highest heterologous expression level so far reported for 2, 5 -DKG reductase from C. glutamicum. Accordingly, Lb. plantarum/ pSIP 609 might be an interesting alternative to Escherichia coli expression systems for industrial 2, 5 -DKG reductase production.|$|E
