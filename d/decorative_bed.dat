50|$|The {{artificial}} {{creation of}} the land is why it is very flat and level - it was intended from the start to be primarily a facility for active events augmenting the other public parks; Western Park 1876 and Albert Park 1884 which were for more genteel passive enjoyment. For this reason the park was not laid out in a picturesque manner, neither has it ever had <b>decorative</b> flower <b>beds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Burdett-Coutts {{fountain}} (named after Angela Burdett-Coutts the Victorian philanthropist) had {{a partial}} restoration of its intricate granite carvings and sculptures. In {{recent years the}} fountain had been fenced off due to graffiti and vandalism, but along with the restoration the fences were removed, and four symmetrical mirror pools were placed around the fountain along with <b>decorative</b> flower <b>beds.</b> The area is now a public space, with many benches offering an attractive place to sit.|$|R
50|$|Penny rugs are not actual rugs for the floor, but <b>decorative</b> {{coverings}} for <b>beds,</b> {{tables and}} dressers and mantles. Sometimes {{they are used}} as wall hangings or pillows.

50|$|Bedding, {{also known}} as bedclothes or bed linen, is the {{materials}} laid above the mattress of a bed for hygiene, warmth, protection of the mattress, and <b>decorative</b> effect. <b>Bedding</b> is the removable and washable portion of a human sleeping environment. Multiple sets of bedding for each bed will often be washed in rotation and/or changed seasonally to improve sleep comfort at varying room temperatures. In American English, the word bedding generally {{does not include the}} mattress, bed frame, or bed base (such as box-spring), while in British English it does. In Australian and New Zealand English, bedding is often called manchester.|$|R
50|$|The gardens {{originally}} contained <b>decorative</b> flower <b>beds</b> {{but with}} the decline in fortunes of the Pump Rooms themselves these have been grassed over. Bands still play in the bandstand, although very infrequently but the gardens host the annunal Leamington Peace Festival, a fun fair once a year and farmers markets once a month. It is also a popular place for young people, especially those from the nearby Warwick University to sunbathe and play football. As it lies {{so close to the}} river {{it is part of the}} town that is most frequently flooded. The last two times such floods occurred were at Easter 1998 and in the summer of 2007.|$|R
50|$|Decorative pillows serve a dual purpose. They {{often have}} fancy cover {{material}} which serves {{to decorate the}} room where they are found. Since decorative textiles are commonly 54 inches in width, many decorative pillows finish about 17x17 inches. (54/3 = 18 less seam allowance) When used to decorate a fully made up <b>bed,</b> <b>decorative</b> pillows are likely thrown aside at bedtime, since they are not covered with a washable pillow case, thus, while found on the bed, they are primarily there for decoration, hence they fall under this category. These pillows may be custom made, as well as made by freelancers.|$|R

50|$|During 1950 to 1959, Harry Oakman, Parks Superintendent for Brisbane City Council, {{prepared}} {{a plan for}} additional works in Bowen Park, including the addition of paths and drinking fountains, and the redesign of garden beds. His intention was to present colourful patterned displays on the lawns to passing traffic and tram passengers and to patients and staff in the Royal Brisbane Hospital (across Bowen Bridge Road). He retained {{most of the major}} trees planted during 1914-1917 and those remaining from the QAS period including fig trees (Ficus benjamina) in the centre, bunya (Araucaria bidwilli), hoop (Araucaria cunninghamii) and Cook (Araucaria columnaris) pines, phoenix palm (Phoenix sp), an English oak (Quercus robus), a rubber tree (Ficus elastica), frangipanis (Plumeria obtusa) and poincianas (Delonix regia). He replaced the circular flower beds on the southern sloping lawn with <b>decorative</b> shaped colourful <b>beds.</b> On the cleared northern terrace he planted a large circular arrangement of flower beds surrounded by a hedge. He added paths and modified the Bowen Bridge Road edge to include extensive flower beds. A drinking fountain was included at the south entrance off Bowen Bridge Road. His plant vocabulary included acalyhpas, crotons, plumbago, belerperone and ginger - plants used in many of his Brisbane park designs.|$|R
