40|$|Despite an {{explosion}} {{of research in the}} affective sciences during the last few decades, interdisciplinary theories of human emotions are lacking. Here we present a neurobiological theory of emotions that includes emotions which are uniquely human (such as complex moral emotions), considers the role of language for emotions, advances the understanding of neural correlates of attachment-related emotions, and integrates emotion theories from different disciplines. We propose that four classes of emotions originate from four neuroanatomically distinct cerebral systems. These emotional core systems constitute a quartet of affect systems: the brainstem-, diencephalon-, hippocampus-, and orbitofrontal-centred affect systems. The affect systems were increasingly differentiated during the course of evolution, and each of these systems generates a specific class of affects (e. g., ascending activation, pain/pleasure, attachment-related affects, and moral affects). The affect systems interact with each other, and activity of the affect systems has effects on – and interacts with – biological systems denoted here as emotional <b>effector</b> <b>systems.</b> These <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> include motor systems (which produce actions, action tendencies, and motoric expression of emotion), peripheral physiological arousal, as well as attentional and memory systems. Activity of affect <b>systems</b> and <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> is synthesized into an emotion percept (pre-verbal subjective feeling), which can be transformed (or reconfigured) into a symbolic code such as language. Moreover, conscious cognitive appraisal (involving rational thought, logic, and usually language) can regulate, modulate, and partly initiate, activity of affect <b>systems</b> and <b>effector</b> <b>systems.</b> Our emotion theory integrates psychological, neurobiological, sociological, anthropological, and psycholinguistic perspectives on emotions in an interdisciplinary manner, aiming to advance the understanding of human emotions and their neural correlates...|$|R

40|$|Viral infections can {{strongly}} stimulate both NK {{cell and}} allospecific CD 8 T cell responses, and these same effector cells can lyse allogeneic cell lines in vitro. However, {{the impact of}} viral infections on the <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> mediating rejection of allogeneic tissues in vivo has not been fully explored. Using in vivo cytotoxicity assays, we evaluated the <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> mediating the rejection of CFSE-labeled allogeneic splenocytes after an infection of C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Naive B 6 mice predominantly used a NK cell-effector mechanism to reject allogeneic splenocytes because they rejected BALB/C (H 2 (d)) splenocytes but not CBA (H 2 (k)) splenocytes, and the rejection was prevented by immunodepletion of NK 1. 1 (+) or Ly 49 D(+) NK cells. This rapid and efficient in vivo cytotoxicity assay recapitulated the specificity of NK cell-mediated rejection seen in longer duration in vivo assays. However, as early as 1 day after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, a CD 8 T cell-dependent mechanism participated in the rejection process and {{a broader range of}} tissue haplotypes (e. g., H 2 (k)) was susceptible. The CD 8 T cell-mediated in vivo rejection process was vigorous at a time postinfection (day 3) when NK cell effector functions are peaking, indicating that the <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> used in vivo differed from those observed with in vitro assays measuring the killing of allogeneic cells. This rapid generation of allospecific CTL activity during a viral infection preceded the peak of viral epitope-specific T cell responses, as detected by in vivo or in vitro cytotoxicity assays...|$|R

40|$|Antibodies link antigen and {{immunological}} <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> {{through the}} use of highly flexible linkers that connect the hypervariable antigen binding sites (Fabs) to the effector domain (Fc). The extensive flexibility of the antibody molecule permits antibodies to adapt to a vast array of antigen shapes and sizes while retaining a covalent link between the Fab domains and the conserved Fc region that interacts with a limited number of <b>effector</b> <b>systems,</b> such as Fc receptor and complement (Burton, 1985; Burton, 1990). However, this inherent molecular flexibility of intact antibodies has hindered their crystallization. Although over 200 structures of antibody fragments, mainly Fab and Fab’ fragments, have been determined, entire structures of IgGs with full length hinges have only been reported three times: two structures of murine mAbs (Harris et al., 1995; Harris et al., 1997) and now the structure of human IgG 1 bl 2, directed against HIV- 1 gp 120 (Saphire et al., 2001 a; Saphire et al., 2001 b).

50|$|The <b>effector</b> <b>system</b> {{generating}} whisking comprises {{a set of}} “extrinsic” muscles controlling {{movements of}} the mystacial pad {{and a group of}} “intrinsic” (follicular) muscles, producing vibrissa protraction. The extrinsic muscles in the mystacial pad move many or all of the macrovibrissae together. However, the individual follicles of some groups of facial vibrissae in some species are also motile. A small muscle 'sling' is attached to each macrovibrissa and can move it more-or-less independently of the others. Vibrissa retraction is thought to be a passive process produced by rebound of stretched follicular muscle. Whisking movements are amongst the fastest produced by mammals. In animals that are capable of whisking at high frequencies, the whisking musculature contains a high proportion of type 2B muscle fibers that can support faster contractions than normal skeletal muscles.|$|E
50|$|Comparatively recently, a peptide was {{isolated}} from the cockroach Diploptera punctata that showed no similarity to any known insect peptide but did show some similarity to vertebrate calcitonin (Furuya et al., 2000).

Dippu-DH31 {{was isolated}} using a cyclic AMP assay at the same time as a CRF-related peptide from the same insect. Ct-like peptides and CRF-related peptides both stimulate cAMP production by isolated tubules, but it is suspected that CT-like peptides target a different cAMP-dependent <b>effector</b> <b>system</b> or activate a different second messenger pathway. CT-like peptides have since been identified in other orders - Diptera, Lepidoptera, and one has been partially sequenced from Hymenoptera. Unpublished studies show immunologically-related peptides in Tenebrio molitor (Coast et al., 2002).|$|E

His method allows images of feedback that can produce effects on the voluntary control of motor responses, it involves two central systems: an effector mechanism and feedback loops.

40|$|Research on {{multitasking}} harkens back to {{the beginnings}} of cognitive psychology. The central question has always been how we manage to perform multiple actions at the same time. Here, we highlight the role of specific input- and output-modalities involved in coordinating multiple action demands (i. e., crossmodal action). For a long time, modality- and content-blind models of multitasking have dominated theory, but a variety of recent findings indicate that modalities and content substantially determine performance. Typically, the term “input modality ” refers to sensory channels (e. g., visual input is treated differently from auditory input), and the term “output modality ” is closely associated with <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g., hand vs. foot movements). However, this definition may be too narrow. The term “input modality ” sometimes refers to a dimension within a sensory channel (e. g., shape/color in vision). Furthermore, the linkage between output-modalities and <b>effector</b> <b>systems</b> may not be specific enough to illuminate some notorious twilight zones (e. g., to distinguish between hand and wrist movements). As a consequence, we will use “modality ” as an umbrella term here to capture various sources of stimulus variability used to differentiate task-relevant information and sources of motor variability used to differentiate responses...|$|R

For over 20 years now, recombinant interferon alpha has been used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The molecular mechanisms responsible for non-response to interferon are still not completely understood, but systematic analysis of liver biopsies revealed that the spontaneous activation of the endogenous interferon system in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C prevented response to interferon-based therapies. Moreover, recent genomewide association studies found a highly significant and strong association between genetic variants near the IFNlambda 3 gene, designated the IL 28 B genotype, with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus as well as with response to treatment of chronic hepatitis C with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin.
