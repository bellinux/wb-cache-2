40|$|RNA {{replication}} of Cymbidium ringspot virus (CymRSV) normally occurs in plant and yeast cells {{in association with}} membranes derived from peroxisomes. However, in yeast strains devoid of these organelles CymRSV RNA replication takes place on the perinuclear membrane and cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) strands. The association of the CymRSV RNA replication complex to ER is mediated by the ORF 1 -encoded protein p 33. To analyze which part of this protein contains the information leading to localization to ER, a deletion analysis was carried out. The behaviour of deletion mutants was studied by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and membrane <b>floatation</b> <b>gradient</b> analysis. It was shown that the signal targeting p 33 to ER membranes largely coincides with the peroxisomal targeting signal, but contains additional elements in the first 87 amino acids.

40|$|The 6 -kDa early {{secreted}} antigenic target ESAT- 6 and the 1 O-kDa culture filtrate protein CFP- 1 O of Mycobacterium tubercuThsis are secreted by the ESX- 1 {{system into}} the host cell and thereby contribute to pathogenicity. Although different studies {{performed at the}} organismal and cellular levels have helped to explain ESX- 1 -associated phenomena, not much is known about how ESAT- 6 and CFP- 1 O contribute to pathogenesis at the molecular level. In this study we describe the interaction of both proteins with lipid bilayers, using biologically relevant liposomal preparations containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol. Using <b>floatation</b> <b>gradient</b> centrifugation, we demonstrate that ESAT- 6 showed strong association with liposomes, and in particular with preparations containing DMPC and cholesterol, whereas the interaction of CFP- 1 O with membranes appeared to be weaker and less specific. Most importantly, binding to the biomembranes no longer occurred when the proteins were present as a 1 : 1 ESAT- 6 · CFP- 1 O complex. However, lowering of the pH resulted in dissociation of the protein complex and subsequent protein-liposome interaction. Finally, cryoelectron microscopy revealed that ESAT- 6 destabilized and lysed liposomes, whereas CFP- 1 O did not. In conclusion, we propose {{that one of the}} main features of ESAT- 6 in the infection process of M. tuberculosis is the interaction with biomembranes that occurs after dissociation from its putative chaperone CFP- 1 O under acidic conditions typically encountered in the phagosome.

40|$|Rinderpest {{virus is}} an enveloped Nonsegmented Negative Stranded RNA Virus (NNSV) {{belonging}} to the genus Morbillivirus in the Family Paramyxoviridae and the causative organism for “cattle plague”. The virion has a transport component and a replication component. The transport component consists of a lipid membrane with two external membrane-anchored glycoproteins, namely Hemagglutinin (H) and Fusion (F) proteins that are necessary for cell entry and release of newly formed virus particles. The replication component consists of viral genomic RNA encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) and a RNA polymerase complex (Large subunit L and phosphoprotein P). These two components are linked together by the matrix protein (M) that is believed to {{play a crucial role}} in the assembly and maturation of the virion particle by bringing the two major viral components together at the budding site in the host cell. To perform this function, M protein should be able to interact with the host cellular membrane, especially the plasma membrane in the case of Rinderpest virus, should be able to interact with itself to form multimers as well as with the nucleocapsid core. The function might include the interaction of M protein with the cytoplasmic tail of the other two envelope proteins namely F and H. To understand the role of matrix protein in Rinderpest virus life cycle, the following functions were characterized – 1) Matrix protein association with the host cell membrane. 2) Matrix protein association with nucleocapsid protein. Matrix protein association cellular membranes in rinderpest virus infected cells could be a result of its interaction with the cytoplasmic tails of the viral glycoproteins. Hence, this association was characterized in the absence of other viral proteins. In transiently transfected cells, M protein existed in two isoforms namely the soluble cytosolic form and membrane-bound form. The membrane-bound M protein associated stably with the membranes, most likely by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which is inhibited at high salt or high pH, but not completely. Confocal microscopy analysis showed the presence of M protein in plasma membrane protrusions. When GFP was tagged with this protein, GFP was absent from nucleus and was present predominantly in the cytosol and the plasma membrane protrusions. However, M protein expression did not result in the release of membrane vesicles (Virus-like particles) into the culture supernatant implicating the requirement of other viral proteins in envelope acquisition. Matrix protein of RPV has been shown to co-sediment with nucleocapsid during mild preparation of RNP from virus-infected cells. This association was further investigated by virus solubilization. The matrix protein could be solubilised completely from virion only in the presence of detergent and high salt. This is in agreement with the previous observation from the laboratory that the purified matrix protein remained soluble in the presence of detergent and 1 M NaCl. This suggested that M protein could oligomerise or associate with nucleocapsid. The purified M protein when visualized by Electron microscopy showed the presence of globular structures, which may be due to self association of M protein, which may be due to self-aggregation of M protein. The presence of GFPM in filamentous structures in transfected cells, as visualized by confocal microscopy could also be due to self-assembly of M protein. Interaction of matrix protein RPV nucleocapsid was confirmed using co- sedimentation and <b>floatation</b> <b>gradient</b> analysis. Results obtained from M-N binding assay using C-terminal deletions of nucleocapsid protein suggested that the matrix protein interacted with the conserved N-terminal core of nucleocapsid and non- conserved C-terminus 20 % is dispensable. This is in agreement with the report that RPV M protein could be replaced with that of Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus(a closely related morbillivirus). The observation that the nucleocapsid protein interacts with both soluble and membrane-bound form suggests that the matrix protein can possibly interact itself to facilitate the assembly of replication component at the site of budding where the transport component is already assembled. Viral proteins of many RNA viruses interact with detergent-resistant host components that facilitate their transport inside the cell to the sits of assembly or replication. Rinderpest viral proteins acquire detergent resistance in infected cells. This acquisition is mediated by viral N protein. The relevance of this interaction in virus life cycle was studied using small molecule drugs that disrupt host cytoskeleton and lipid raft. The results obtained suggested that the host cytoskeleton, especially actin-filaments facilitate virus release from the plasma membrane. RPV matrix protein acquired detergent resistance in infected cells as well as in transfected cells. The pattern of detergent resistance suggested an association with the cytoskeleton or cytoskeleton associated proteins. However, results obtained from co-localisation studies in the presence of actin inhibitor and cold-ionic detergents are not consistent with the above observation. This property could be due to self-association of matrix protein...|$|E
40|$|During peroxisomal {{matrix protein}} import, the peroxisomal {{targeting}} signal receptors recognize cargo in the cytosol {{and interact with}} docking and translocation subcomplexes on the peroxisomal membrane. Using immunoprecipitations of multiple protein components, we show that in Pichia pastoris the docking subcomplex consists of the unique peroxins Pex 13 p, Pex 14 p and Pex 17 p, whereas the putative translocation subcomplex has all three RING-finger peroxins, Pex 2 p, Pex 10 p and Pex 12 p, as unique constituents. We identify Pex 3 p as a shared component of both subcomplexes. In pex 3 D cells, the unique constituents of the docking subcomplex interact {{as they do in}} wild-type cells, but the assembly of the translocation subcomplex is impaired and its components are present at reduced levels. Furthermore, several interactions detected in wild-type cells between translocation and docking subcomplex components are undetectable in pex 3 D cells. Contrary to previous reports, pex 3 D cells have peroxisome remnants that pellet during high-speed centrifugation, associate with membranes on <b>floatation</b> <b>gradients</b> and can be visualized by deconvolution microscopy using antibodies to several peroxins which were not available earlier.

In this work, and by studying animal models of multiple sclero-sis, we asked whether {{this is also the}} case for myelin basic protein (MBP) in the late and neurodegenerative phases of demyelinating diseases. Methods: To this effect, we tested whether MBP, an essential myelin component, present prion-like properties in animal models of MS, as is the case for Cuprizone-induced chronic demyelination or chronic phases of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results: We show here that while total levels of MBP were not reduced following extensive demyelination, part of these molecules accumulated thereafter as aggregates inside oligodendrocytes or around neuro-nal cells. In chronic EAE, MBP precipitated concomitantly with Tau, a marker of diverse neurodegenerative conditions, including MS. Most important, analy-sis of fractions from Triton X- 100 <b>floatation</b> <b>gradients</b> suggest that the lipid composition of brain membranes in chronic EAE differs significantly from that of na€ıve mice, an effect which may relate to oxidative insults and subsequently prevent the appropriate insertion and compaction of new MBP in the myelin sheath, thereby causing its misfolding and aggregation. Interpretation: Prion-like aggregation of MBP following chronic demyelination may result from an aberrant lipid composition accompanying this pathological status. Such aggre-gation of MBP may contribute to neuronal damage that occurs in the progres-sive phase of MS...|$|R

40|$|Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored {{proteins}} {{are unique}} in that they penetrate only the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane but are still able to mediate intracellular signalling events following antibody-induced ligation. Detergent solubilisation studies suggest that microdomains exist at the cell surface within which are sequestered GPI-linked proteins. Here we report the construction and expression of a fluorescent GPI anchor {{on the surface of}} CHO, EL 4, and U 937 cells by fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the GPI-attachment site of CD 59. The resultant GFP–GPI has properties comparable to that of endogenously expressed GPI-anchored molecules as shown by Triton X- 114 partitioning. However, sucrose <b>gradient</b> <b>floatation</b> showed that GFP–GPI was only partially resistant to detergent solubilisation. Furthermore confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed a homogeneous distribution of GFP–GPI at the cell surface, which only became clustered following cross-linking of the GPI anchor via an anti-GFP antibody.

In the following, membrane association of FtsY, the prokaryal signal recognition particle receptor, and SRP 54, a central component of the signal recognition par-ticle, was addressed in the halophilic archaea Haloferax volcanii. Purified H. volcanii FtsY, the FtsY C-terminal GTP-binding domain (NG domain) or SRP 54, were com-bined separately or in different combinations with H. vol-canii inverted membrane vesicles and examined by <b>gradient</b> <b>floatation</b> to differentiate between soluble and membrane-bound protein. Such studies revealed that bothFtsY and the FtsY NG domain bound toH. volcanii vesicles in a manner unaffected by proteolytic pretreatment of the membranes, implying that in Archaea, FtsY association is mediated through the membrane lipids. Indeed, membrane associ-ation of FtsY was also detected in intact H. volcanii cells. The contribution of the NG domain to FtsY binding in halophilic archaea may be considerable, given the low number of basic charges found {{at the start of}} theN-terminal acidic domain of haloarchaeal FtsY proteins (the region of the protein thought to mediate FtsY–membrane association in Bacteria).

Both E 1 and E 1 *, a soluble ectodomain form of E 1, interact with membranes in a reaction dependent on low pH, cholesterol, and sphingolipid and form highly stable homotrimers.

In some respects they side with cyanobacteria whereas other features are clearly shared with chloroplasts. The Sec translocase, {{an example for}} "conservative sorting" {{in the course of}} evolution, is found in the plasma membrane of all prokaryotes, in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and in both these membrane types of cyanobacteria. Results In this paper we present evidence for a dual location of the Sec translocon in the thylakoid as well as inner envelope membranes of the cyanelles from Cyanophora paradoxa, i. e. conservative sorting sensu stricto. The prerequisite was the generation of specific antisera directed against cyanelle SecY that allowed immunodetection of the protein on SDS gels from both membrane types separated by sucrose density <b>gradient</b> <b>floatation</b> centrifugation. Immunoblotting of blue-native gels yielded positive but differential results for both the thylakoid and envelope Sec complexes, respectively. In addition, heterologous antisera directed against components of the Toc/Tic translocons and binding of a labeled precursor protein were used to discriminate between inner and outer envelope membranes. Conclusion The envelope translocase can be envisaged as a prokaryotic feature missing in higher plant chloroplasts but retained in cyanelles, likely for protein transport to the periplasm. Candidate passengers are cytochrome c 6 and enzymes of peptidoglycan metabolism. The minimal set of subunits of the Toc/Tic translocase of a primitive plastid is proposed. </p...|$|R

Preparations having {{properties}} resembling {{those of}} synaptosomes have been isolated from whole fly homogenates of Drosophila melanogaster using ficoll <b>gradient</b> <b>floatation</b> technique.

An uptake system for neurotransmitter, ã-Aminobutyric acid has been demonstrated in these preparations. A high affinity uptake system for L-glutamate has also been studied in these subcellular fractions. This uptake of glutamate is transport into an osmotically sensitive compartment and not due to binding of glutamate to membrane components. The transport of glutamate has an obligatory requirements for either sodium or potassium ions. Kinetic experiments show that two transport systems, with Km values 0 · 33 × 10 – 6 Μ and 2 · 0 × 10 – 6 Μ, respectively, function in the accumulation of glutamate. ATP stimulates lower affinity transport of glutamate. Inhibition of glutamate uptake by L-aspartate but not by phenylalanine and tyrosine indicates that a common carrier mediates the transport of both glutamate and aspartate. β-N-oxalyl-L-β β-diamino propionic acid and kainic acid, both inhibitors of glutamate transport in mammalian brain preparations, strongly inhibited transport of glutamate in Drosophila preparations Comparison with uptake of ã-aminobutyric acid and glutamate in isolated larval brain is presented {{to show that the}} synaptosome-like preparations we have isolated are rich in central nervous system derived structures, and presynaptic endings from neuromuscular junctions...|$|R

To further analyze these EV and to elucidate their function it is important that native populations of EV can be recovered from (stored) breast milk samples in a reproducible fashion. However, the impact of isolation and storage procedures on recovery of breast milk EV has remained underexposed. Here, we aimed to define parameters important for EV recovery from fresh and stored breast milk. To compare various protocols across different donors, breast milk was spiked with a well-defined murine EV population. We found that centrifugation of EV down into density gradients largely improved density-based separation and isolation of EV, compared to <b>floatation</b> up into <b>gradients</b> after high-force pelleting of EV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identified different subpopulations of human breast milk EV and a not previously described population of lipid tubules. Additionally, the impact of cold storage on breast milk EV was investigated. We determined that storing unprocessed breast milk at − 80 °C or 4 °C caused death of cells present in breast milk, leading to contamination of the breast milk EV population with storage-induced EV. Here, an alternative method is proposed to store breast milk samples for EV analysis at later time points. The proposed adaptations to the breast milk storage and EV isolation procedures can be applied for EV-based biomarker profiling of breast milk and functional analysis of the role of breast milk EV in the development of the neonatal immune system...|$|R

Phagocytic vacuoles were separated from cell homogenates by <b>floatation</b> on sucrose <b>gradients</b> and assayed for contained lactoferrin, myeloperoxidase, and acid hydrolases. The conclusions drawn from the biochemical and morphological studies were in agreement and indicated: particle uptake and vacuole closure can be completed within 20 s; both the specific and azurophil granules fuse with the phagocytic vacuole much earlier than is generally appreciated, with half-saturation times of 39 s (99 % confidence limits, 15 - 72); oxygen consumption has kinetics {{similar to those of}} the fusion of these granules with the phagosome; degranulation of the acid hydrolases beta- glucuronidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (biochemical assays), and acid phosphatase (biochemical assay and electron microscopic cytochemistry) have kinetics of degranulation that are similar to each other but totally different from and much slower than that of myeloperoxidase with half-saturation times of between 354 and 682 s (99 % confidence limits, 246 - 883).

Furthermore, both the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain of HA facilitated binding of M 1 to detergent-resistant membranes. Analysis of the membrane association of M 1 in the early and late phases of the influenza virus infectious cycle revealed that the interaction of M 1 with mature glycoproteins which associated with the detergent-resistant lipid rafts was responsible for the detergent resistance of membrane-bound M 1. Immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy also demonstrated that, in influenza virus-infected cells, a fraction of M 1 protein colocalized with HA and associated with the HA in transit to the plasma membrane via the exocytic pathway. Similar results for colocalization were obtained when M 1 and HA were coexpressed and HA transport was blocked by monensin treatment.

The current best and most widely used protocol for beads-free flow cytometry of exosomes uses ultracentrifugation (UC) coupled with <b>floatation</b> in sucrose <b>gradient</b> for their isolation, labeling with lipophilic dye PKH 67 and antibodies, and an optimized version of commercial high-end cytometer for analysis. However, this approach requires an experienced flow cytometer operator capable of manual hardware adjustments and calibration of the cytometer. Here, we provide a novel and fast approach for quantification and characterization of both exosomes and microvesicles isolated from cell culture media as well as from more complex human samples (ascites of ovarian cancer patients) suitable for multiuser labs by using a flow cytometer especially designed for small particles, which can be used without adjustments prior to data acquisition. EVs can be fluorescently labeled with protein-(Carboxyfluoresceinsuccinimidyl ester, CFSE) and/or lipid- (FM) specific dyes, without the necessity of removing the unbound fluorescent dye by UC, which further facilitates and speeds up the characterization of microvesicles and exosomes using flow cytometry. In addition, double labeling with protein- and lipid-specific dyes enables separation of EVs from common contaminants of EV preparations, such as protein aggregates or micelles formed by unbound lipophilic styryl dyes, thus not leading to overestimation of EV numbers. Moreover, our protocol is compatible with antibody labeling using fluorescently conjugated primary antibodies. The presented methodology opens the possibility for routine quantification and characterization of EVs from various sources.

As statin therapy is widely used to reduce serum cholesterol levels, it was hypothesised that statins can exert anti-inflammatory effects by down regulation expression and/or function of the C 5 aR.

Furthermore CCAAT and NFAT motifs are important for the transcriptional control of the human C 5 aR, however the transcription factors which bind to these sites could not be identified. A model system to measure C 5 aR expression and function was set up using two pro-monocytic U 937 sub-cell lines, which demonstrated that dibutyryl-cyclic-AMP was the best inducer of the C 5 aR, but only in one of the cell lines. Induction of the C 5 aR made these cells more responsive to C 5 a induced intracellular calcium-release and IL- 8 and MMP- 9 secretion. Investigating possible effects of cholesterol and modulation of cholesterol on C 5 aR expression and function showed that statins did not affect expression and function of basal levels of C 5 aR in monocytes or U 937 cells, but reduced induced C 5 aR expression. Concomitantly C 5 a induced release of intracellular calcium and secretion of IL- 8 reduced, however C 5 a induced MMP- 9 secretion increased.
