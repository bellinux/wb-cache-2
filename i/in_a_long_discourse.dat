40|$|Paper {{presented}} {{during the}} Annual Conference of the Philosophical Society of Southern Africa, 16 - 18 January 2008. Hosted by the Department of Philosophy, University of Pretoria. ABSTRACT: The mid- 1990 s in Germany had seen <b>a</b> climax <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> lasting <b>discourse</b> about the so-called New Ethics, {{especially with regard}} to the domain of technology. This paper provides an interpretation of some of the German sources to the South African reader of today, such that he may be enabled to compare South-Africa’s present discource with the German discourse of about a decade ago. Such a comparison (which is, however, not attempted in this paper) would not only be of philosophical but also of socio-political interest, given the fact that South-Africa is still a technologically semi-developed society with widespread techno-optimism whereas Germany is a highly developed society with widespread techno-skepticism. The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus knowledge-transfer (for the sake of discourse), whereby I do not claim originality as far as my reports and interpretations of the German sources are concerned...|$|R
40|$|John 6 {{and holy}} Communion. It is often {{observed}} that the Gospel of John, in its account of the passion week, does not give attention to the Lord's Supper. John definitely does recount a final, special, climactic supper of Jesus with his disciples (John 13 : 21 ff). But what he fails to mention is {{the institution of the}} bread and cup which relate to the body and blood of Christ. Already in chapter 6 John had presented what clearly seems to be an interpretation of the bread and the cup in connection with the Lord’s Supper. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> interpretative <b>discourse</b> Jesus speaks about eating his flesh and drinking his blood. The heart of that interpretative discourse is that the believer is to eat and drink Jesus Himself. This is stated quite crassly in materialistic terms. The metaphor of eating his flesh and drinking his blood is however used by Jesus to explain the mystery of a continuing communion with Him as the crucified and resurrected Lord...|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{introductory}} <b>discourse,</b> {{the author}} defended and explained her ambitious design to illustrate {{each of the}} deepest and strongest passions of the human mind. The plays, the author explained, {{were part of a}} larger design and were a completely original concept. They arose from a particular view of human nature in which sympathetic curiosity and observation of the movement of feeling in others were paramount. Real passion, ‘genuine and true to nature’, was to be the subject; each play was to focus on the growth of one master passion. This unusually analytic and arguably artificial approach generated much discussion and controversy, and in [...] "a week or two Plays on the Passions was the main topic of discussion in the best literary circles" [...] (Carswell 273). The entirety of London was excitedly {{trying to figure out who}} the author could be. The authorship was attributed to a male author until someone pointed out that all of the protagonists were middle-aged women, rarely the muses of male authors (Carswell 274). Baillie finally revealed herself as the author in 1800 in the title-page of the third edition.|$|R
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> {{the other}} parts of the book, in this part {{culturally}} entrenched boundaries and demarcations are also critically re-examined in light of the arrival of the Anthropocene as a new geological era. Here the focus is on rethinking the received distinction between humans and non-human animals. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> series of <b>discourses</b> making up our cultural heritage, we humans have persistently tried to define the essence of our own humanity and to distinguish ourselves from other animals by laying claim to supposedly unique capacities and achievements like reason, language, morality, religion, technology, law and politics. By now, however, human exceptionalism in its cruder forms has definitely gone out of fashion. None of the contributors to this part of the book subscribes to such versions, but each has different views on how far the critique of human supremacy should be pursued and where the new boundaries should be redrawn, if at all. The issues raised in these contributions are of central importance for the reorientation of animal ethics and environmental ethics in the Age of the Anthropocene...|$|R

50|$|The third {{volume is}} entirely devoted to dogmatic theology. Therefore, this volume is methodologically {{completely}} different. In this part, for example, questions pertaining to revelation are discussed and whether God still addresses human beings.

Inevitably {{the next question}} was, whether the prophethood {{had come to an}} end with Muhammad, whom the Qur'an had addressed as the last of the prophets (khatam al-nabiyyin). The author thinks that Islam was the culmination of divine law and Muhammad was the last law-giving prophet, after whom there was no place for a new prophet and a new divine law.|$|R
