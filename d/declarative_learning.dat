Participants were given two tasks to assess motor skill learning and another to assess <b>declarative</b> <b>learning.</b> The participants learned a motor sequence and list of word pairs during either the morning or evening. Memory tests were given to the participants twice, at twelve and twenty-four hours after training. This gap allowed for a period of sleep, a recall test, a period of normal wake, and a recall test. The study results showed that motor skills were not dependent on sleep. However, <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> tasks and recall increased when the participants slept before the recall test. The study also showed that a change in sleep patterns and networks activated during sleep may contribute to age related decline in motor sequences but does not affect <b>declarative</b> <b>learning.</b> This study shows that even though the role of sleep may change throughout age it is still very important to <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> regardless of age.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{research}} is seeing the importance of <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> in both implicit and explicit learning tasks. In {{a study conducted by}} Matthew Kirkhart [...] undergraduate participants underwent implicit and explicit artificial-grammar learning tasks to see how <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> functioned in each. For the Implicit task participants where told that they would see a series of letter strings, a group of letters that appear in a word, and had to judge if the string were well formed or not well formed. For the Explicit task participants were told they had to reproduce letter strings according to a set of rules, which they had to determine and would be tested on later. The participants where then shown a series of letter strings and asked if they followed the rules or not. The results showed that <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> was not required for implicit learning but was related to the consistency in performance. It was seen, however, that <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> is required for explicit learning and consistency of performance. This shows that adults are using <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> when undergoing explicit tasks, such as memorizing formulas for statistics class. This research provides more evidence of the importance of <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> in education for not just children but for adults as well.|$|E

Recent experimental findings have also begun to unravel the implication of the cerebellum in high-level functions such as spatial cognition.

5000|$|Research {{focusing}} on children has {{also looked at}} different ways of utilizing <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> {{when it comes to}} memorizing tasks. Backhaus, Hoeckesfeld, Born, Hohagen, and Junghanns [...] conducted a study to see if sleeping after a task enhances <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> in children. Children between the ages of nine and twelve were given a word association task consisting of forty related word pairs. The lists of words were repeated continuously until the child participating could recall at least twenty words out of the forty given. The child was allowed to go to sleep for the night and was tested for recall right after they had woken up. The child was then asked to go about their day and was tested for recall later during the day. The study showed that <b>declarative</b> <b>learning,</b> memory and retention significantly increased only after an interval of sleep that immediately followed learning. This research provides evidence of sleep in the role of <b>declarative</b> <b>learning,</b> sleep consolidation, as well as stresses the importance of sleep for <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> during childhood.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Declarative</b> <b>learning</b> is {{not solely}} {{affected}} by sleeping {{but can also}} be affected by levels of stress as well as hormones. In {{a study conducted by}} Espin et al. stress, hormones and menstrual cycle phases in women, were tested for their effect on <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> in young adults. Participants were asked to participate in a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) where they were asked to give a speech to a simulated committee about why they deserved the position for their dream job. If the participant did not finish their speech in five minutes the committee would then ask standardized questions the researchers had provided. After the speech the participant was asked to complete a five-minute arithmetic task. The TSST was set up to induce stress in the participants before they proceeded to the <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> task. For the <b>Declarative</b> <b>Learning</b> task {{the participants were asked to}} complete a Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), which has the participants look over a set of words and then asks them to recall as many as they can. The study showed that if women were not exposed to the TSST task before the RAVLT there was an increase of <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> and recall when compared to the men. However, when the participants were exposed to the TSST task before the RAVLT then <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> and recall were equal for both men and women. Women during the study that were menstruating and exposed to the TSST task showed lower levels of stress than women not menstruating, they also had an increase of <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> and recall when compared to men and women not menstruating [...] The study not only shows that sex hormones could reduce stress in women but also that stress can have a negative effect on <b>declarative</b> <b>learning.</b> This could affect the capability of students learning and passing their classes and also the ability to be able to complete tasks in the work place.|$|E
5000|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and learning have continually been linked together. The common {{belief is that}} sleep deprivation can affect children when they are learning at school or in any daily task. However, different types of learning are processed differently and have different outcomes {{when a child is}} sleep deprived. A study conducted by Csabi, Benedk, Janacesk, Katona and Nemeth looked at the impairment of declarative and nondeclarative learning when a child is sleep deprived. Nondeclarative learning was measured by having children perform an Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task. This task had a dog's head appear in four empty circles. Every time the dog's head appeared the child had to press the corresponding letter as quickly and correctly as possible. <b>Declarative</b> <b>learning</b> was measured by [...] "The War of the Ghosts" [...] test, which is a recall test where the children were told a short story consisting of thirty-six sentences and had to then recall it immediately after hearing it. The study showed that nondeclarative learning was preserved and not affected when sleep deprived children took the ASRT task. However, <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> greatly declined in the face of sleep-deprivation. <b>Declarative</b> <b>Learning</b> can be associated with tasks that require a greater amount of attention, such as learning in school. Therefore, the lack of sleep a child obtains can affect <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> and can affect how well a child learns during school overall.|$|E

50|$|Brain areas {{involved}} in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, or the mammillary bodies {{are thought to be}} involved in specific types of memory.

Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, learning, as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are usually attributed to changes in neuronal synapses, thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

50|$|Karl S. Lashley's {{search for}} the engram found {{that it could not}} exist in any {{specific}} part of the rat's brain, but that memory was widely distributed throughout the cortex. One possible explanation for Lashley's failure to locate the engram is that many types of memory (e.g. visual-spatial, smell, etc.) are used in the processing of complex tasks, such as rats running mazes. The consensus view in neuroscience is that the sorts of memory involved in complex tasks are likely to be distributed among a variety of neural systems, yet certain types of knowledge may be processed and contained in specific regions of the brain. Overall, the mechanisms of memory are poorly understood. Such brain parts as the cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are thought {{to play an important role}} in memory.

40|$|Amnesic {{patients}} (n = 8), {{who have}} severely impaired <b>declarative</b> memory, <b>learned</b> a probabilistic classification task {{at the same}} rate as normal subjects (n = 16) but subsequently were impaired on transfer tests that required flexible use of their task knowledge.

The amnesic patients tended to be impaired on the same items that were rated as requiring indirect or flexible use of knowledge. Thus, control subjects acquired declarative knowledge about the task that could be applied flexibly to the transfer tests. The nondeclarative memory available to amnesic patients was relatively inflexible and available only in conditions that reinstantiated the conditions of training.

We argue that these different types of declarative ML complement each other as they address different users (data scientists and end users). This paper makes an attempt to create a taxonomy for declarative ML, including a definition of essential basic properties and types of declarative ML.

As a consequence, there is considerable interest in drugs targeting this receptor to help enhance amygdala- and hippocampus-dependent learning.

Accumulating clinical evidence indicates the efficacy of DCS in the facilitation of amygdala-dependent fear extinction learning in patients with phobic, social anxiety, panic, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An important unresolved question though is whether the use of DCS can also facilitate hippocampus-dependent <b>declarative</b> <b>learning</b> in healthy people {{as opposed to being}} restricted to the fear memory domain.

At weekly intervals, 13 young male volunteers spent three 24 h sessions in the laboratory under carefully controlled homeostatic and circadian conditions. At approximately midday, subjects performed either one of two word-pair learning tasks or a matched nonlearning control task, in a counterbalanced order. The two learning lists differed {{in the level of}} concreteness of the words used, resulting in an easier and a more difficult associative encoding condition, as confirmed by performance at immediate cued recall. Subjects were then allowed to sleep for 4 h; afterward, delayed cued recall was tested. Compared with the control condition, sleep EEG spectral activity in the low spindle frequency range and the density of low-frequency sleep spindles (11. 25 - 13. 75 Hz) were both significantly increased in the left frontal cortex after the difficult but not after the easy encoding condition.

This incremental, long-life view of machine learning goes beyond most of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that learn throw-away models. In this paper we present a long-life knowledge acquisition, evaluation and consolidation framework that is designed to work with any rule-based machine learning or inductive inference engine and integrate it into a long-life learner. In order to do that we create graph of rules for working memory and introduce several topological metrics over it that summarise the usefulness, validity and compactness of the rules. From these metrics we derive an oblivion criterion to drop useless rules from working memory and a consolidation process to promote the rules to the knowledge base. We evaluate the framework on a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain and show how the knowledge topology evolves under the framework.
