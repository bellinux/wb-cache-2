40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the types of <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> {{strategies}} and <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times on customer satisfaction. An analysis of the pilot test data and expert reviews provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the scales. Empirical descriptive statistics and regression analysis indicated the most influential effect of different service strategies and <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times on customer satisfaction. Three <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> strategies and two <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times were examined in this study. Firm <b>service</b> <b>recovery,</b> customer <b>service</b> <b>recovery,</b> and joint <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> each took place within thirty minutes as customers’ expected <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> timeframe and within two hours as over customers’ expected <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> timeframe after a service failure. The results showed that all six <b>service</b> <b>recoveries</b> (3 by 2) have significant positive effects on customer satisfaction levels. However, the findings indicated that joint <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> in thirty minutes had the greatest positive effect on hotel guests’ customer satisfaction levels. If the resolution is efficient, customer satisfaction increases. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future study were also discussed. ...|$|R
