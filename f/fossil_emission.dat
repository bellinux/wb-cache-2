40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the timing of}} the use of biological carbon sequestration and its capacity to alleviate the carbon constraint on the energy sector. We constructed a stochastic optimal control model balancing the costs of <b>fossil</b> <b>emission</b> abatement, the opportunity costs of lands allocated to afforestation, and the costs of uncertain climate damages. We show that a minor part of the sequestration potential should start immediately as a "brake" slowing down both the rate of growth of concentrations and the rate of abatement in the energy sector, thus increasing the option value of the emission trajectories. But, most of the potential is put in reserve {{to be used as a}} "safety valve" after the resolution of uncertainty, if a higher and faster decarbonization is required: sequestration cuts off the peaks of costs of fossil abatement and postpones the pivoting of the energy system by up to two decades.

40|$|The Pulp and Paper Industry (PPI), {{like other}} {{energy-intensive}} industry branches, {{is suitable for}} implementation of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) since they have large on-site emissions of CO 2 and usually also excess heat available which can be utilised in the capture process. Further, since a large share of the CO 2 emissions associated with the European PPI originates from biomass, if CCS is implemented the levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere can be further reduced in com- parison to implementing CCS only on <b>fossil</b> <b>emission</b> sources, i. e. provided the biomass is grown in a sustainable way. This fact makes CCS within the European PPI an interesting alternative. 1 This chapter assumes that world governments adopt policy measures that stimulate significant CO 2 reductions and the purpose of this chapter is to discuss CCS as an option for the PPI to significantly reduce its CO 2 emissions. The chapter gives an introduction to CCS in general and CCS in the PPI in particular. Some main opportunities and challenges are presented and discussed and an example of the potential for CCS in the European PPI is presented. The chapter ends with a list of main conclusions...|$|E
40|$|National audienceWe adapted an {{integrated}} model, RESPONSE, {{to assess the}} cost-optimized timing of oceanic, geological, and biological carbon sequestration versus <b>fossil</b> <b>emission</b> reduction to mitigate climate change {{in a context of}} uncertainty and learning about the magnitude of climate sensitivity to greenhouse-gas forcing. We find that the replacement of abatement measures in the energy sector by various sequestration measures can cut total mitigation policy costs by up to 35 % for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (WMO and UNEP) A 1 B and A 2 emissions scenarios. Biological carbon sequestration and carbon capture and geological or oceanic storage (CCS) contribute to relaxing carbon constraints on the energy sector while adapting to the level of climatic uncertainties. Afforestation, the most flexible option, is helpful in the short run to prevent excessively fast warming, while CCS in geologic or oceanic reservoirs is useful primarily in the longer run to mitigate against overshooting a desired temperature ceiling. In cases of leaky storage, CCS may be less appropriate than emission reduction to stabilize climate, especially if high reference emissions and/or high climate sensitivity are expected. Worst-case scenarios of high emissions and climate sensitivity might preclude to a certain extent the use of carbon sequestration as a substitute for fossil energy reductions. Therefore, the design of optimal sequestration policies depends critically on the anticipation of (1) long-term emission trends and (2) the effective value of the climate sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} large-scale, {{top-down}} constraints on regional <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> provided by observations of atmospheric total column CO 2, X CO 2. Using an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) with underlying <b>fossil</b> <b>emissions,</b> we {{determine the influence}} of regional <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> on global X CO 2 fields. We quantify the regional contrasts between source and upwind regions and probe the sensitivity of atmospheric X CO 2 to changes in <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions.</b> Regional <b>fossil</b> fuel X CO 2 contrasts can exceed 0. 7 ppm based on 2007 emission estimates, but have large seasonal variations due to biospheric fluxes. Contamination by clouds reduces the discernible fossil signatures. Nevertheless, our simulations show that atmospheric fossil X CO 2 can be tied to its source region and that changes in the regional X CO 2 contrasts scale linearly with emissions. We test the GCM results against X CO 2 data from the GOSAT satellite. Regional X CO 2 contrasts in GOSAT data generally scale with the predictions from the GCM, but the comparison is limited by the moderate precision of and relatively few observations from the satellite. We discuss how this approach may be useful as a policy tool to verify national <b>fossil</b> <b>emissions,</b> as it provides an independent, observational constraint...|$|R

40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} requires gigaton-scale {{carbon dioxide}} removal technologies, yet few examples exist beyond niche markets. This dissertation informs large-scale implementation of bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), a carbon-negative energy technology. It builds on existing literature {{with a novel}} focus on deployment, design, commercialization, and communication of BECCS. BECCS, combined with aggressive renewable deployment and <b>fossil</b> <b>emission</b> reductions, can enable a carbon-negative power system in Western North America by 2050, with up to 145 % emissions reduction from 1990 levels. BECCS complements other sources of renewable energy, and can be deployed {{in a manner consistent}} with regional policies and design considerations. The amount of biomass resource available limits the level of fossil CO 2 emissions that can still satisfy carbon emissions caps. Offsets produced by BECCS are more valuable to the power system than the electricity it provides. Implied costs of carbon for BECCS are relatively low (~$ 75 /ton CO 2 at scale) for a capital-intensive technology. Optimal scales for BECCS are an order of magnitude larger than proposed scales found in existing literature. Deviations from optimal scaled size have little effect on overall systems costs – suggesting that other factors, including regulatory, political, or logistical considerations, may ultimately have a greater influence on plant size than the techno-economic factors considered. The flexibility of thermochemical conversion enables a viable transition pathway for firms, utilities and governments to achieve net-negative CO 2 emissions in production of electricity and fuels given increasingly stringent climate policy. Primary research, development (R&D), and deployment needs are in large-scale biomass logistics, gasification, gas cleaning, and geological CO 2 storage. R&D programs, subsidies, and policy that recognize co-conversion processes can support this pathway to commercialization. Here, firms can embrace a gradual transition pathway to deep decarbonization, limiting economic dislocation and increasing transfer of knowledge between the fossil and renewable sectors. Global cumulative capital investment needs for BECCS through 2050 are over $ 1. 9 trillion (2015 $, 4 % real interest rate) for scenarios likely to limit global warming to 2 °C. This scenario envisions deployment of as much as 24 GW/yr of BECCS by 2040 in the electricity sector. To achieve theses rates of deployment within 15 - 20 years, governments and firms must commit to research, development, and deployment on an unprecedented scale. Three primary issues complicate emissions accounting for BECCS: cross-sector CO 2 accounting, regrowth, and timing. Switchgrass integration decreases lifecycle greenhouse gas impacts of co-conversion systems with CCS, across a wide range of land-use change scenarios. Risks at commercial scale include adverse effects on food security, land conservation, social equity, and biodiversity, as well as competition for water resources. This dissertation argues for an iterative risk management approach to BECCS sustainability, with standards being updated as more knowledge is gained through deployment. Sustainability impacts and public opposition to BECCS may be reduced with transparent measurement and communication. Commercial-scale deployment is dependent on the coordination of a wide range of actors, many with different incentives and worldviews. Despite this problem, this dissertation challenges governments, industry incumbents, and emerging players to research, support, and deploy BECCS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Because 90 % of the CO 2 from {{fossil fuel}} {{combustion}} is emitted in the Northern Hemisphere, annual mean atmospheric CO 2 mixing ratios are higher at {{middle and high}} northern latitudes than in the Southern Hemisphere. The observed CO 2 latitude gradient varies inter-annually and has generally increased as fossil fuel CO 2 emissions have increased. Back extrapolation of the measured CO 2 latitude gradient to zero <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> gives a latitude gradient with the Northern Hemisphere lower than the Southern. A linear regression of Mauna Loa minus South Pole annual mean differences versus <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> for 1958 through 1996 gives a slope of 0. 5 gmol mo 1 - 1 (abbreviated as ppm CO 2) (Gt C) - 1 ((• = 0. 03) and an intercept (at zero <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions)</b> of- 0. 8 ppm (• = 0. 2). Shorter data records yield similar results with larger uncertainties. We argue that this extrapolated gradient does not represent preindustrial conditions but is more correctly viewed as a decadal average gradient due to natural sources and sinks that underlie the anthropogenic perturbation. We interpret the extrapolated gradient as evidence for a contemporary Northern Hemisphere sink that has been proposed {{on the basis of}} other measurement and model approaches. The slopes (ppm CO 2 per gigaton of C from fossil fuel burning) calculated from sufficiently long records tend to agree with model calculations based on <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions,</b> suggesting that any trend in the Northern Hemi-sphere sink, during the period of the measurements, has been small relative to the trend in <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|North America is {{currently}} a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, contributing to the global buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and associated changes in the earth’s climate. In 2003, North America emitted nearly two billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. North America’s <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> in 2003 (1856 million metric tons of carbon ± 10 % with 95 % certainty) were 27 % of global emissions. Approximately 85 % of those emissions were from the United States, 9 % from Canada and 6 % from Mexico. The conversion of fossil fuels to energy (primarily electricity) is the single largest contributor, accounting for approximately 42 % of North American <b>fossil</b> <b>emissions</b> in 2003. Transportation is the second largest, accounting for 31 % of total emissions. There are also globally important carbon sinks in North America.

40|$|Using a coupled climate-carbon cycle model, {{fossil fuel}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions}} are derived through a reverse approach of prescribing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations according to observations and future projections, respectively. In {{the second half}} of the twentieth century, the implied <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions,</b> and also the carbon uptake by land and ocean, are within the range of observational estimates. Larger discrepancies exist in the earlier period (1860 - 1960), with small <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> and uncertain emissions from anthropogenic land cover change. In the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario, the simulated <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> more than double until 2050 (17 GtC/year) and then decrease to 12 GtC/year by 2100. In addition to A 1 B, an aggressive mitigation scenario was employed, developed within the European ENSEMBLES project, that peaks at 530 ppm CO 2 (equiv) around 2050 and then decreases to approach 450 ppm during the twenty-second century. Consistent with the prescribed pathway of atmospheric CO 2 in E 1, the implied <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> increase from currently 8 GtC/year to about 10 by 2015 and decrease thereafter. In the 2050 s (2090 s) the emissions decrease to 3. 4 (0. 5) GtC/year, respectively. As in previous studies, our model simulates a positive climate-carbon cycle feedback which tends to reduce the implied emissions by roughly 1 GtC/year per degree global warming. Further, our results suggest that the 450 ppm stabilization scenario may not be sufficient to fulfill the European Union climate policy goal of limiting the global temperature increase to a maximum of 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels...|$|R

40|$|The 14 C/C {{abundance}} in CO 2 (Δ 14 CO 2) promises to provide useful constraints on regional <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> and atmospheric transport through the large gradients introduced by anthropogenic activity. The currently sparse atmospheric Δ 14 CO 2 monitoring network can potentially be augmented by using plant biomass as an integrated {{sample of the}} atmospheric Δ 14 CO 2. But the interpretation of such an integrated sample requires knowledge about the day‒to‒day CO 2 uptake of the sampled plants. We investigate here the required detail in daily plant growth variations needed to accurately interpret regional <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> from annual plant samples. We use a crop growth model driven by daily meteorology to reproduce daily fixation of Δ 14 CO 2 in maize and wheat plants in the Netherlands in 2008. When comparing the integrated Δ 14 CO 2 simulated with this detailed model to the values obtained when using simpler proxies for daily plant growth (such as radiation and temperature), we find differences that can exceed the reported measurement precision of Δ 14 CO 2 (∼ 2 ‰). Furthermore, we show {{that even in the}} absence of any spatial differences in <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions,</b> differences in regional weather can induce plant growth variations that result in spatial gradients of up to 3. 5 ‰ in plant samples. These gradients are even larger when interpreting separate plant organs (leaves, stems, roots, or fruits), as they each develop during different time periods. Not accounting for these growth‒induced differences in Δ 14 CO 2 in plant samples would introduce a substantial bias (1. 5 – 2 [*]ppm) when estimating the fraction of atmospheric CO 2 variations resulting from nearby <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions...</b>|$|R

Non-CO 2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), which {{are an important part of}} emissions from deforestation in low-latitude regions, also pose complications for comparisons between fossil fuel and LUCF, since the mechanism generally used to compare these gases (global warming potentials) assumes simultaneous emissions.

40|$|There is {{scope for}} land-use changes to {{increase}} or decrease CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere over the next century.

Historical land-use changes (mostly deforestation) and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions</b> have caused an increase in atmospheric concentration of CO 2 of 90 ppm between the pre-industrial era and year 2000. The projected range of CO 2 concentrations in 2100, under a range of emissions scenarios developed for the IPCC, is 170 - 600 ppm above 2000 levels. This range is mostly due to different assumptions regarding <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>emissions.</b> If all of the carbon so far released by land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, atmospheric CO 2 concentration {{at the end of}} the century would be about 40 - 70 ppm less than it would be if no such intervention had occurred. Conversely, complete global deforestation over the same time frame would increase atmospheric concentrations by about 130 - 290 ppm.
