50|$|The Mura Statistical Region (Pomurska statistična regija) is a {{statistical}} region in northeast Slovenia. It is predominantly agricultural with field crops representing over {{three-quarters of the}} total agricultural area (twice {{as much as the}} Slovene average). Climate and soil combined have made it the region with the highest crop production, but its geographical position and inferior infrastructure put it at a disadvantage and it is the region of Slovenia with the lowest <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita</b> (<b>EUR</b> 12,267) and the highest rate of registered unemployment.|$|R
50|$|Economy in the Region was {{and still}} is based {{primarily}} on capitalisation of input raw materials and semifinished products. In 2012, the total GDP reached 7,538 million EUR. The region’s <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita</b> was <b>EUR</b> 12,813 (88% of the national average), ranking seventh among the regions of the Czech Republic. Industrial potential of the Region lies in manufacturing enterprises that represent 16% of total registered entities. They are mainly comprised by metalworking and wood-processing industries. However, they suffer from low level of modernisation of production compared {{to the rest of the}} Czech Republic. As of end 2012, the Zlín Region had 138,269 legal and physical entities out of which 14,379 had employees. 1,382 enterprises had 25 or more employees. The registered unemployment rate was 10.4%. Within the Region, the highest unemployment rate was reported from the Vsetín District (almost 15%), while the lowest from the Zlín District (8.8%).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse {{regional}} difference yield in terms of Human Development (HD) in Poland. During transition, western Polish regions grew more than eastern regions, and differences in terms of <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita</b> are evident. Nevertheless, higher <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita</b> in the West did not produce a higher level of non-income dimension indicators (i. e., Education and Life expectancy). On the contrary eastern regions, although they have a lower level of <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita,</b> have a higher level of non-income dimension indicators. This contradicts a neoclassical argument of considering HD as a proxy of <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita.</b> <b>GDP</b> growth is not a sufficient condition for HD.

Indeed, the specification illustrated in column (5) replaces the <b>GDP</b> per <b>capita</b> with country-specific dummies, which deliver an expected improvement in the overall fit of the model.
