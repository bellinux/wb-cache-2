5|$|The neck had at {{each side}} {{two rows of}} large scutes. The osteoderms of the lower neck row were very large, flat and plate-like. The first osteoderms of the top neck rows formed a pair of unique three-pointed scutes {{directly}} behind the head. These points {{seem to have been}} connected by tendons to the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses, of the axis vertebra. In general the scutes were larger {{at the front of the}} torso, the osteoderms diminishing towards the rear, especially on the surface of the thighs. The smallest flat round scutes might have <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> between the larger osteoderm rows. Perhaps a row of vertical osteoderms was present on the upper arms. Compared to the later Ankylosauria, Scelidosaurus was lightly armoured, without continuous plating, spikes or pelvic shield. Rough areas on the skull and lower jaws indicate the presence of skin ossifications.|$|E
25|$|Unbeknown to Hardy, however, his {{correspondence}} with Lord French had been intercepted by Collins's operatives, who compiled a large file on Hardy's life. Hardy and Parker left for Ireland in September 1920 {{and stayed in}} the Phoenix Park Hotel in Dublin, close to the British Military General Headquarters. Through Collins, a meeting between Hardy and Arthur Griffith, the Sinn Féin leader, was arranged. Hardy attempted to gain information about Collins and Robert Brennan {{with the intention of}} luring the former to his capture or death. Griffith, however, had <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with journalists from respected English, Spanish, Italian, Irish, French and U.S. newspapers who, on Griffith's instructions, posed as the inner circle of Sinn Féin in an attempt to force Hardy's self-exposure. The Irish journalists present were permitted to ask questions (as their accents would not betray the facade). Hardy gave a detailed, if largely fictitious, account of his life.|$|E
500|$|Haynes {{ordered a}} one-horsepower marine upright, two-cycle engine from Sintz Gas Engine Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan for $225. Although {{the engine was}} {{intended}} for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The [...] engine arrived {{in the fall of}} 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he started the engine that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before he could stop the engine it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with smoke.|$|E
60|$|The ticking of {{the little}} clock was <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> thing seemed to have become alive--to be {{threatening}} to burst its heart. But the thin, delicate indicator moved on.|$|R
2500|$|... [...] "global {{information}} tracker": you're {{in a good}} mood, and {{it actually}} works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R

500|$|The [...] "Yurovsky Note" [...] further {{reported}} {{that once the}} thick smoke that had <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, {{it was discovered that}} the executioners' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family's crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors. The corsets thus served as a form of [...] "armor" [...] against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, {{one or more of the}} girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky.|$|E
2500|$|As artist Peter Malick {{states in}} the liner notes, [...] "I started looking for a singer who could record [...] for me. [...] On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer {{announced}} the last song of the set. [...] The Dinah Washington classic [...] "Since I fell for You" [...] <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and I was struck breathless. [...] Here, {{in the tradition of}} Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. [...] This was my first contact with Norah Jones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foster cites his {{interest}} in bass guitar as coming from hearing Duane Eddy's song [...] "Rebel Rouser" [...] for the first time. [...] "A school friend played the 78 on his parents' big radiogram and it just <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with this powerful sound. It {{was one of those}} rare moments when your soul is touched and I realised that the deep sound behind Eddy's guitar came from something called a bass guitar, though I didn't see one until I watched Jet Harris on TV. So I bought an acoustic guitar for £2 and figured that I'd get that bass sound if I just tuned the strings down an octave, but of course it just made a pointless, flapping noise." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{hung up the}} receiver. Lenora was <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with her shrieks. He {{took her by the}} {{shoulder}} and pushed her back into a chair.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{ask what}} this means?" [...] {{repeated}} Lady Belamour, advancing, and seeming to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with her majestic figure, in full brocaded dress, with feathers waving in her hair.|$|R
60|$|Such a roar <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as might}} have been heard in the street outside.|$|E
60|$|The melancholy {{cleared away}} from the massive face of the big seaman, and his deep {{laughter}} <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Dick <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and shook}} the air with wild, glad, {{stallion}} nickering; and then, with mane-tossing and foot-pawing, chanted: ...|$|E

50|$|The third Baron Braybrooke, who {{inherited}} {{house and}} title in 1825, installed {{most of the}} house's huge picture collection, <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> with furnishings, and reinstated something of the original Jacobean feel to <b>the</b> state <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A {{fireplace}} <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room's</b> {{one side}} [...] With half a cord o' wood in,-- [...] 10 [...] There warn't no stoves till comfort died, [...] To bake ye to a puddin'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very nice, thank you," [...] {{answered}} a prim little {{voice from the}} dusk below, for only {{the glow of the}} fire <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> just then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Mr. Wilding?" [...] {{he asked}} suddenly, his voice {{dominating}} {{the din of}} talk that <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Do we hold the explanation of his absence?" ...|$|E
60|$|The ring of noisy, {{flushed and}} laughter-intoxicated young people <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{nearly to the}} wall, and round and round the ring flew Bettie, pursued by Joe Yohe.|$|E
50|$|Supposedly, {{the ghost}} {{appeared}} {{first as a}} bright light, gradually taking form and <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with a chill. She {{is said to have}} visited Mrs. Heaster over the course of four nights.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{very short}} delay. The two men {{had no time to}} {{exchange}} a word. They heard the rustling of a woman's gown, and immediately afterward the perfume of violets seemed to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot at the Musikhalle, Hamburg, 4 February 1992, before a live {{audience}} nearly <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to capacity. It includes scenes from such films as Alain Resnais's Night and Fog and Alexander Dovzhenko's Earth.|$|R
60|$|The sound, which <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{with its}} hurry of short syllables, its sudden pauses, and its sudden attacks, might be {{compared}} to some animal hubbub, frantic and inarticulate.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} silence; and the sunset {{breaking}} {{more and more}} from the sundering clouds, <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with soft fire and painted the dull walls with ruby and gold.|$|E
60|$|To speak so lightly of kissing Gertie! He {{stared at}} the smooth {{rounding}} of her left cheek below the cheek-bone till it took a separate identity, and its white softness <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
50|$|A bomb {{falls on}} the local pumping station, where Walker and Godfrey are on patrol. Efforts at freeing them result {{in the rest of}} the platoon {{becoming}} trapped with them, and a pipe bursting, <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> rapidly with water...|$|R
60|$|A most {{distressing}} clutter developed. The carpenters {{attacked the}} house like savage animals, chipping and chiseling till they opened a huge gap from window to window, <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with mortar, dust and flies. Zulime was especially appalled by the flies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can say to}} you," [...] went on {{the voice}} of the little figure, that seemed so to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with its grey presence, [...] "what I could not bring myself to say to others; for you are not hard-hearted." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, as I stood aghast and alarmed, {{wondering}} {{who might have}} overheard the thunder of his fall, the fool sat up amidst the ruins, and <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with his shrieks of drunken laughter.|$|E
60|$|The {{sunlight}} streaming into my mother's chamber lay like a fairy carpet on the floor, {{waiting for}} the dancing feet of her grandchildren. Her spirit <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> calling to me, consoling me, convincing me.|$|E

60|$|The {{thunder of}} the {{incoming}} waves seemed to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Even while they stood there a little shower of pebbles and spray were dashed against the windows. Andrew looked anxiously across the estuary and tapped the barometer by his side.|$|R
40|$|Interior view of {{the coffee}} shop at the Claypool Hotel. Tables and chairs <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> {{straight}} back chairs have cloth covers.

50|$|As Vinero eagerly {{attempts}} {{to pull a}} golden ornament off the wall, the ceiling releases enough gold dust to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and smother Vinero, {{at the same time}} as Tarzan fights and defeats Vinero's hulking Oddjob-type henchman, Mr. Train (Don Megowan).|$|R
