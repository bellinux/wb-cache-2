5000|$|The {{primary means}} of {{establishing}} the heading in most small aircraft is the magnetic compass, which, however, suffers from several types of errors, including that created by the [...] "dip" [...] or downward slope of the Earth's magnetic field. Dip error causes the magnetic compass to read incorrectly whenever the aircraft is in a bank, or during acceleration or deceleration, {{making it difficult to}} use in any flight condition other than unaccelerated, perfectly straight and level. To remedy this, the pilot will typically manoeuvre the airplane with reference to the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator,</b> as the gyroscopic <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> is unaffected by dip and acceleration errors. The pilot will periodically reset the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> to the <b>heading</b> shown on the magnetic compass.|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the sustainability of agricultural systems is multidimensional in nature and requires holistic measures using indicators with different measurements and units reflecting social, economic, and environmental aspects. To simplify the assessment process, various indicators have different units, and measurements are grouped under broad <b>indicator</b> <b>heads,</b> and normalization and/or transformation processes are carried out in order to aggregate them. In this study, a total of 50 indicators from agricultural sustainability categories of productivity, stability, efficiency, durability, compatibility, and equity are employed to investigate which normalization technique is the most suitable for further mathematical analysis for developing a final composite indicator. To understand the consistency and quality of normalization measurement techniques and compare the benefits and drawbacks of the various selected normalization processes, the indicators of agricultural sustainability are considered. Each of the different techniques for normalization has advantages and drawbacks. This study shows that the proportionate normalization and hybrid aggregation rules of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are appropriate for the selected data set, and that this technique has a wider applicability for developing composite indicators for agricultural sustainability assessment...|$|R
5000|$|The {{horizontal}} situation indicator (commonly {{called the}} HSI) is an aircraft flight instrument normally mounted below the artificial horizon {{in place of a}} conventional <b>heading</b> <b>indicator.</b> It combines a <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> with a VHF omnidirectional range-instrument landing system (VOR-ILS) display. This reduces pilot workload by lessening the number of elements in the pilot's instrument scan to the six basic flight instruments. Among other advantages, the HSI offers freedom from the confusion of reverse sensing on an instrument landing system localizer back course approach. As long as the needle is set to the localizer front course, the instrument will indicate whether to fly left or right, in either direction of travel.|$|R

5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed <b>indicator,</b> a <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|R

40|$|The study {{analyzed}} {{income inequality}} and poverty dynamics among rural farm households in Abia State, Nigeria. Beyond the broad objective, the study sought specifically {{to estimate the}} income distribution and determine the poverty line, gap and incidence of the rural farm households. A total of 240 households were selected across the agricultural zones using multistage sampling technique from which data and information were elicited. Data collection was between 2010 and 2011. Analytically, the study employed Gini coefficient in the estimation of income distribution while poverty indicators (Mean household income, headcount ratio and poverty gap index) were used to measure poverty line, poverty incidence and gap. Income distribution showed high level of inequality (Gini index = 0. 987) with per capita income falling below the operational national minimum wage. The poverty gap and incidence gave a scary picture of worsening poverty situation, judging from the poverty <b>indicators</b> (<b>head</b> count index = 0. 567; poverty gap = 0. 568). To reverse the trend, {{it is important that}} concerted efforts are made by way of policy direction to ensure that the rural economy which is largely agrarian is improved.
