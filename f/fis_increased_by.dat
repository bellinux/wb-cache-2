50|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{sequences}} from 32 to 94 nucleotides upstream of the fis AUG are responsible for <b>increasing</b> <b>fis</b> lacZ translation reporter activities over 100 fold. Within this region, an AU sequence element centered 35 nucleotides upstream of the <b>fis</b> AUG <b>increases</b> <b>fis</b> translation <b>by</b> as much as 15 fold. Formation of a supposed RNA secondary structure element beginning 50 nucleotids upstream of the AUG also positively affects fis translation by up to 10 fold. The fis gene is cotranscribed with the upstream dusB gene encoding a tRNA-modifying enzyme. DusB protein levels are very low even under conditions when there is high transcription of the operon and high levels of Fis protein.|$|R

Dodge argues that FIS used studies {{which do not}} {{comprise}} a scientific proof. He states that {{it is well known}} that if one tips the ski 7° more the 35 m ski will have the same turning radius as the 28 m ski. He states as well that knee injuries are decreasing since the 1990s, when carving skis started to be used.|$|R
