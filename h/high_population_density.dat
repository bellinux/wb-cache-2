5|$|Tornadoes kill {{an average}} of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, {{the most in the}} world. Reasons for this include the region's <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density,</b> poor {{construction}} quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge. Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite, and zinc. Despite this, poor management, <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density,</b> and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped. Geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power.|$|E
5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density,</b> and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E

5|$|The Outer Hebrides have {{historically}} been a very strong Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) speaking area. Both the 1901 and 1921 census reported that all parishes were over 75% Gaelic speaking, including areas of <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density</b> such as Stornoway. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 mandated English-only education, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Nonetheless, by 1971 most areas were still more than 75% Gaelic speaking – {{with the exception of}} Stornoway, Benbecula and South Uist at 50-74%.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density</b> of Varanasi and the {{increasing}} number of tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that there are some other costs with breeding in an environment with <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density,</b> an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E

5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density</b> and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E

25|$|Since 1990 {{the economy}} of Gravesham has changed from one based on heavy {{industry}} to being service-based.

25|$|After Chichén Itzá elite {{activities}} ceased, {{the city}} {{may not have}} been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if Maya were living in Chichen Itza or nearby. The relatively <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density</b> in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there. According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the Cenote Sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{spoken in}} a {{relatively}} small territory, the rugged features of the Basque countryside and the historically <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density</b> resulted in a heavy dialectal fragmentation throughout history, which increased the value of both Spanish and French respectively as lingua francas. In this regard, the current Standard form of Basque was only introduced in the late 1960s, which helped Basque move away from being perceived – even by its own speakers – as a language unfit for educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Roman era saw an {{increase}} in the population of northern Syria that accelerated under the Byzantines well into the 5th century. In Late Antiquity, Beroea was the second largest Syrian city after Antioch, the capital of Syria and the third largest city in the Roman world. Archaeological evidence indicates a <b>high</b> <b>population</b> <b>density</b> for settlements between Antioch and Beroea right up to the 6th century.
