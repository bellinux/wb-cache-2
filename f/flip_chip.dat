40|$|In the {{flip-chip}} assembly process, no-flow underfill materials {{have a particular}} advantage over traditional underfill: the application and curing of the former can be undertaken {{before and during the}} reflow process. This advantage can be exploited to increase the flip-chip manufacturing throughput. However, adopting a no-flow underfill process may introduce reliability issues such as underfill entrapment, delamination at interfaces between underfill and other materials, and lower solder joint fatigue life. This paper presents an analysis on the assembly and the reliability of flip-chips with no-flow underfill. The methodology adopted in the work is a combination of experimental and computer-modeling methods. Two types of no-flow underfill materials have been used for the <b>flip</b> <b>chips.</b> The samples have been inspected with X-ray and scanning acoustic microscope inspection systems to find voids and other defects. Eleven samples for each type of underfill material have been subjected to thermal shock test and the number of cycles to failure for these <b>flip</b> <b>chips</b> have been found. In the computer modeling part of the work, a comprehensive parametric study has provided details on the relationship between the material properties and reliability, and on how underfill entrapment may affect the thermal–mechanical fatigue life of <b>flip</b> <b>chips</b> with no-flow underfill...|$|R

50|$|<b>Flip</b> <b>chips</b> {{have several}} disadvantages. The {{lack of a}} carrier means they are not {{suitable}} for easy replacement, or manual installation. They also require very flat surfaces to mount to, which {{is not always easy}} to arrange, or sometimes difficult to maintain as the boards heat and cool. Also, the short connections are very stiff, so the thermal expansion of the chip must be matched to the supporting board or the connections can crack. The underfill material acts as an intermediate between the difference in CTE of the chip and board.|$|R
40|$|Although <b>flip</b> <b>chips</b> have {{received}} wide acceptance as an integrated circuit package, significant manufacturing problems exist with {{the integrity of}} the connection between the package and the printed circuit board (PCB). Conventional x-ray, ultrasonic and electronic testing systems have been used to assess the integrity of this connection, however, none of these have proven suitable for detecting open solder bumps between the chip and the board. The inability to detect open solder bumps with traditional methods merits the investigation of new, nondestructive methods for detecting defects in a manufacturing environment. This work assesses the feasibility of monitoring the vibration characteristics of <b>flip</b> <b>chips</b> to detect open solder joints. Test vehicles with open solder joints were created, and a nondestructive laser ultrasonic system was used to measure the free vibration response of the chips attached to the printed circuit board. The algorithm of mode isolation (AMI) was applied to the vibration response data in order to extract the modal parameters of the chip. The statistical differences between the modal parameters of sets of damaged and undamaged chips were assessed, revealing the ability of the method to determine the location and severity of these defects in the presence of experimental scatter and manufacturing variation. The parameters of the first mode of vibration, especially its mode shape, were found to be much more sensitive to damage than those of a higher frequency mode. ...|$|R

Parameters for lifetime modeling are obtained from non-linear and temperature-dependent finite element analysis and lifetime experiments.

40|$|Solder bump {{technology}} {{is being used}} increasingly {{as a method of}} interconnection of chips or packages to the substrate. Underfill is used to encapsulate the solder joints commonly in <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips</b> and is starting to be used between BGA packages and the boards. The condition of the underfill layer is critical to the operation of the device as this layer serves to redistribute the mechanical stresses in the sample and thereby reduce the stresses on the solder interconnections[1]. Voids and delaminations in the underfill can compromise the reliability of the device and seriously reduce its lifetime. For reliability assessment of the underfill...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a stacked RF front-end (RFE) package for wideband receiver applications. While having a power consumption of 18 mW, the <b>flipped</b> CMOS <b>chip</b> {{consisting of a}} low-noise amplifier and a quadrature down-conversionmixer stacks on a glass integrated passive device (GIPD) substrate, subsequently achieving a noise figure of 2. 2 – 2. 8 dB and a conversion gain of 23 – 25 dB over 1 – 6 GHz. Moreover, the RFE package uses a GIPD balun with a high common-mode rejection ratio and a post-distor-tion linearizer in the CMOS mixer, subsequently resulting in an of 57 – 68 dBm and an of 5. 2 – 3. 5 dBm over the en-tire operating band. This paper also elucidates how coupling be-tween the <b>flipped</b> CMOS <b>chip</b> and GIPD balun affects the RFE linearity.

40|$|A chip-to-substrate {{interconnect}} {{technology is}} introduced which uses flexible structures {{to accommodate the}} CTE mismatch between the chip and PCB substrate and consequently should be reliable without underfill. Increased flexibility, i e. purely elastic response, of the bumps can {{lead to an increase}} in the reliability of large <b>Flip</b> <b>Chips.</b> To achieve a high flexibility, the lead-free bump is located on a flexible lead. The flexible lead consists of a copper line embedded in a polymer-bridge which is located over an air gap.
