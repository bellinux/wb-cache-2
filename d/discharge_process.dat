25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, while others are not. Even for simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. Glow discharge is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically reactive species, which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The electric <b>discharge</b> <b>process</b> for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E

The structure and operating principle of the innovational vane extruder are completely different with conventional screw extruders.

Investigator conducted experiments to investigate the performance of a CTS during charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>processes.</b> The rectangular 1. 65 m 3 CTS enclosed 1080 plastic balls, with each having a diameter of 11 cm and Vi full of water. All balls were immersed totally in a 40 % ethylene glycol solution. The solution circulated through the store during charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>processes</b> at a speed of 0. 417 kg/sec by entering the store at the top and leaving at the bottom. A chiller was used to charge the store with cool energy and an electric heater was used to discharge it. Temperatures of selected balls at different locations and temperatures of entering and leaving solution were recorded. A sharp drop in temperature of balls was observed generally during the first four hours of every charging process, followed by a gradual but slow decrease in temperature. Temperature inside some balls reached- 6 to- 8 °C. It increased to 3 °C after one and half-hours of a <b>discharging</b> <b>process.</b> Ball temperatures generally remained constant at around 3. 5 "C during most of a <b>discharging</b> <b>process.</b> Experiments reveal that CTS has a potential of handling a cooling load...|$|R

This is a cross-sectional study of a set of interventions which were gradually implemented between April and December 2008. Mainly, they were focused on standardizing the admission and <b>discharge</b> <b>processes</b> to improve patient flow. Primary administrative data was obtained from the 2007 and 2009 Hospital Database. Main outcome measures were median length of stay, percentage of planned discharges, number of surgery cancellations and median number of delayed emergency admissions at 8 : 00 [*]am. For statistical bivariate analysis, we used a Chi-squared for linear trend for qualitative variables and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test and a Mann–Whitney test for non-normal continuous variables.

Because the filament must be very hot before it can operate, it is heated for approximately 20 seconds before use.

5000|$|During the {{discharge}} phase, molten elemental sodium {{at the core}} serves as the anode, meaning that the Na donates electrons to the external circuit. The sodium is separated by a beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) cylinder from the container of molten sulfur, which is fabricated from an inert metal serving as the cathode. The sulfur is absorbed in a carbon sponge. BASE is a good conductor of sodium ions, but a poor conductor of electrons, and thus avoids self-discharge. When sodium gives off an electron, the Na+ ion migrates to the sulfur container. The electron drives an electric current through the molten sodium to the contact, through the electrical load {{and back to the}} sulfur container.
