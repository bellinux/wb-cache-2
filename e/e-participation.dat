The e-planning research is also limited to needs of current participatory planning. The original investigations used tools like online questionnaires, surveys, and polls to consultant citizens. The feedback from participating citizens is then used or not used by experts and professionals. Before e-planning, citizens could provide only their opinion via direct confrontation, snail mail, phone calls, or e-mails.

In our previous work we established a comprehensive Integrative Framework combining existing models. In this paper we move further and conceptualize the elements strictly related to socio-technical aspects of <b>e-Participation</b> by constructing a formal ontology for <b>e-Participation.</b> The innovative model proposed addresses the duality of <b>e-Participation</b> by considering simultaneous government-led, top-down <b>e-Participation,</b> together with citizen-led, social media based <b>e-Participation.</b> Following the Thalheim’s Construction Workflow we develop a semantic model to support citizens-led, social media-based <b>e-Participation...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} a first step to assess the status of <b>e-participation</b> within the {{political}} system in Austria. It takes a top-down perspective focusing on the policy framework related to citizens´ rights in the digital environment, the role of public participation and public policies on <b>e-participation</b> in Austria. The analysis of the development of <b>e-participation</b> in Austria as well as of social and political trends regarding civic participation in general and its electronic embedding, show a remarkable recent increase of <b>e-participation</b> projects and related initiatives. The paper identifies main institutional actors actively dealing with or promoting <b>e-participation</b> and reviews government initiatives as well as relevant policy documents specifically addressing and relating to <b>e-participation</b> or e-democracy. Finally, it {{takes a look at the}} state of the evaluation of <b>e-participation.</b> A major conclusion is that <b>e-participation</b> has become a subject of public policies in Austria; however, the recent upswing of supportive initiatives for public participation and <b>e-participation</b> goes together with ambivalent attitudes among politicians and administration towards <b>e-participation.</b> <b>e-participation,</b> e-democracy, citizens´ rights, institutional actors, public policies, government initiatives, evaluation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{highlight}} the prevalent role of electronic participation (<b>e-participation)</b> {{in the implementation of}} e-government (EG) and possible approaches in enhancing the application of e-government through the insertion of <b>e-participation</b> module. Previous case studies on <b>e-participation</b> cover definitions and technique of <b>e-participation,</b> applicable strategies to implement <b>e-participation,</b> and the quality of <b>e-participation</b> for top management decision making. Several literature in EG supports the statement that <b>e-participation</b> could improve the quality sector governance process. As a result, most developed countries implemented EG projects to enable involvement of citizens in the political decision making process through <b>e-participation.</b> However, {{this is not the case}} in most of the developing countries which focus more on improving public sector services rather than <b>e-participation.</b> Among others, there are arguments which focus on the issues of lack of citizen participation in the political process through the Internet. This is particularly true in the context of EG implementation in developing countries whereby the focus is more on e-services rather than <b>e-participation.</b> Malaysian government has implemented EG, since 1997 under one of the MSC flagships, to deliver information and services in an integrated manner. Malaysian Government Portal or myGovernment performs as a single platform providing information and services related to the government agencies. Despite this effort, myGovernment, as evident in other developing nations, also does not place emphasis on <b>e-participation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Theoretical FoundationsInternational audienceE-participation {{projects}} are complex socio-technical constructs integrating different {{concepts such as}} participation techniques, stakeholders, objectives, information artefacts, and technical facilities. To conceptualise comprehensive solutions of <b>e-participation</b> projects in a holistic way – i. e. comprehensively integrating the different concepts forming an <b>e-participation</b> project–, enterprise architecture frameworks are increasingly studied. Effective use of enterprise architecture frameworks demands a comprehensive conceptualisation of <b>e-participation</b> projects, which should embark on a common metamodel. In this paper, we study existing conceptual models structuring the <b>e-participation</b> domain and metamodels of enterprise architecture frameworks. From the insights of the comparative analysis, the <b>e-participation</b> metamodel is developed using design science research. The metamodel provides the conceptualisation and taxonomy for an <b>e-participation</b> reference framework to develop comprehensive architectures in <b>e-participation</b> projects. It is presented in a UML 2. 0 diagram and involves six viewpoints: Participation Scope, Participant Viewpoint, Participation Viewpoint, Data & Information Viewpoint, <b>E-participation</b> Viewpoint, and Implementation & Governance Viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>e-Participation</b> is {{important}} for both citizens and decision makers. From the citizen's perspective, <b>e-Participation</b> provides the opportunity to achieve and satisfy {{the need to be}} heard by politicians and participate in the decision-making and policy formulation processes through the use of ICT. On the other side, politicians are also able to promote and encourage public participation through communication channels with citizens and act in line with public opinion. During the past years, the <b>e-Participation</b> landscape has been growing and developed. Currently, there are many applied forms and areas of <b>e-Participation.</b> At the same time, there are a growing variety of tools and technologies that are available to enhance <b>e-Participation.</b> In this paper, the authors present a complete overview of the <b>e-Participation</b> landscape, through the state-of-theart review of these tools, technologies and areas of <b>e-Participation.</b> This overview is of value to researchers and practitioners who want to have a knowledge base for further research and practical implementation in the wider field of <b>e-Participation.</b> Copyright © 2011, IGI Global...|$|E
40|$|A {{proliferation}} of <b>e-participation</b> research {{in recent years}} has produced fragmented contributions in the area of <b>e-participation</b> models.

The Integrative Framework enables mapping of models to 12 different facets constructed from a combination of three related perspectives and four canonical aspects of <b>e-participation.</b> While our genealogical analysis of the models showed in general weak relationships among models, our Framework enabled logical groupings of these models as a basis for consolidation, alignment or complementarity analyses.

These mechanisms organically integrate the system’s functions of voice, replies and handling. Citizens on this system do {{take full advantage of}} the flexibility and anonymity of the Internet to enjoy a free low-risk space. Besides the immediate functions above, <b>e-participation</b> fosters policy debate, plays a supervisory role for government agencies, and creates a variety of ad hoc virtual communities focusing on specific policy-making issues.

Based on archival data from 187 countries, our results showed that ICT infrastructure, human capital and <b>e-participation</b> had a direct relationship with e-government maturity. Of the three dimensions of <b>e-participation,</b> e-information sharing and e-decision-making were positively associated with e-government maturity, and e-consultation was negatively related. Further, all three dimensions of <b>e-participation</b> partially mediated the influence of ICT infrastructure and human capital on e-government maturity. Results also indicated that governance in a country did not significantly contribute to its e-government maturity, and their relationship was not mediated by <b>e-participation.</b> Our findings contribute to the theoretical discourse on e-government by identifying the contextual factors affecting e-government maturity, and provide indications to practice on enhancing government’s willingness in implementing relevant <b>e-participation</b> initiatives...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Theoretical FoundationsInternational audienceAs a {{consequence}} of the interdisciplinary nature of Electronic Participation (<b>e-Participation),</b> current research on the field is fragmented and scattered. The exciting blurry boundaries and the immature identity of the field are making difficult the understanding of the main domain themes being investigated, in particular for “neophytes” researchers. In practice, several <b>e-Participation</b> initiatives often attract a wide audience but face serious limitations regarding involvement of those who attract. Recently, the potential of using social media to address citizens’ involvement deficit has been subject of academic debate. By consulting 44 <b>e-Participation</b> papers, considered highly relevant to the aforementioned challenges, this paper produces a general overview of <b>e-Participation</b> research, particularly through social media. The findings show that the <b>e-Participation</b> field still faces the challenge of identity and strive for gaining wider recognition as an independent research area. Concerning <b>e-Participation</b> through social media which seems to be partly overlooked in the field research, the politicians-citizen’s interaction has dominated scholars’ attention and the adoption of such initiatives sponsored and driven by governments are rarely examine. Based on the findings, several research suggestions, which could play a significant contribution to advance future <b>e-Participation</b> research, are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Conference paperWhat {{remains unclear}} {{after a decade}} of <b>e-Participation</b> {{research}} and practice {{is the extent to which}} the social web and informal channels have empowered citizens in government-citizen interactions where government determines what, where and how to discuss. Lately, attention has shifted to how these informal channels could be better harnessed as part of a holistic <b>e-Participation</b> solution. However, this implicit notion of duality of <b>e-Participation</b> is yet to be explored or conceptualized. This paper provides a first step towards understanding the duality of Government-led and Citizen-led <b>e-Participation</b> based on structuration and dynamic capabilities theories. We employ structuration theory to understand how dynamics of power between government and citizen in deciding what is important for the society and the solutions to adopt could tilt towards the side of citizens through citizen-led deliberations. Through the dynamic capabilities theory, we determine additional capabilities required by governments to meaningfully exploit and sustain citizen-led <b>e-participation</b> as a part or a holistic <b>e-participation</b> framework.
