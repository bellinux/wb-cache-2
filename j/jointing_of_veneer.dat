40|$|Plywood {{manufacture}} {{includes two}} fundamental stages. The {{first is to}} peel or separate logs into <b>veneer</b> sheets <b>of</b> different thicknesses. The second is to assemble veneer sheets into finished plywood products. At the first stage a decision must be made as to the number <b>of</b> different <b>veneer</b> thicknesses to be peeled and what these thicknesses should be. At the second stage, choices must be made as to how these veneers will be assembled into final products to meet certain constraints while minimizing wood loss. These decisions present a fundamental management dilemma. Costs of peeling, drying, storage, handling, etc. can be reduced by decreasing the number <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> thicknesses peeled. However, a reduced set of thickness options may make it infeasible to produce the variety of products demanded by the market or increase wood loss by requiring less efficient selection of thicknesses for assembly. In this paper the <b>joint</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> choice and plywood construction is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. A relatively simple optimal solution procedure is developed that exploits special problem structure. This procedure is examined on data from a British Columbia plywood mill. Restricted to the existing set <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> thicknesses and plywood designs used by that mill, the procedure generated a solution that reduced wood loss by 79 percent, thereby increasing net revenue by 6. 86 percent. Additional experiments were performed that examined the consequences of changing the number <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> thicknesses used. Extensions are discussed that permit the consideration {{of more than one}} wood species. production/scheduling: cutting stock, industries: lumber/wood, programming: nonlinear integer program, enumeration...|$|R

The potential for new plywood plants was investigated regarding the supply potential with spruce and beech timber from forests in North and South Germany and new processing technologies like e. g. defect clipping and <b>jointing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>veneer</b> ribbon. During peeling tests in two German plywood mills with 170 peel rolls from selected locations complete veneer ribbon surfaces were scanned and digitized. Defects (knots, splits etc.) were detected and statistically evaluated. A software was developed which is capable to simulate several processing methods: E. g. clipping between defects and <b>jointing</b> <b>of</b> clear areas vs. clipping of strips with a fixed width and post-sorting of the strips according to their individual defect frequency. Preliminary results show that simulated yield statistics reflect the visual grade of the logs. Moreover, processing parameters like defect tolerance, minimum clear area between defects and grade specifications can be changed to predict and optimize the yield for each peel roll...|$|R

40|$|Laminated <b>veneer</b> {{products}} consist <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> {{bonded together}} with adhesive into a predetermined shape. Since wood is a hygroscopic material and also anisotropic by nature, laminated veneer products are especially shape-sensitive {{to changes in}} moisture content. A deviation from the intended shape {{is a problem for}} both the manufacturers and users of the final products and annually such deviations cause great economic losses in the manufacturing industry.   To illustrate the influence of moisture on distortion and shape stability, studies have been performed in industrial conditions and in a laboratory environment. <b>Veneers</b> <b>of</b> beech and birch and a seat shell moulded from these veneers were used in the study. Distortion, i. e. spring-back, position and twist, has been determined directly after moulding and during subsequent moisture and drying cycles.   The distortion follows more or less slavishly the changes in relative humidity around the product. The distortion is generally small directly after moulding but, after the laminates have been exposed to a variation in relative humidity, the distortion increases. Some of the problems of poor shape stability that may arise later in the bending process can be reduced if attention is paid to moisture content and fibre orientation already in the production <b>of</b> the <b>veneer.</b>   To achieve good shape stability <b>of</b> laminated <b>veneer</b> products in practice, the following should be followed by the manufacture industry: develop      cooperation with suppliers <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> and set requirements <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> with regard      to deviation of the fibre orientation, and require that the veneer be dried      and conditioned to a moisture content consistent with production, control      incoming veneers with respect to fibre orientation and moisture content, plan warehousing      <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> and ensure adequate conditioning, and consider      the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>veneers</b> and the species...|$|R

40|$|A {{shortcoming}} of the {{laminated bending}} process {{is that the}} products may become distorted after moulding and during use.

Ninety cross-laminated shells, consisting <b>of</b> 7 <b>veneers</b> <b>of</b> Birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) with a total thickness of 3. 6 mm, were studied.

40|$|International audiencePhenol {{formaldehyde}} (PF) resin containing {{low molecular}} weight hydroxymethyl phenol species and a water soluble hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) was synthesized and used to treat wood veneers. Treated veneers were exposed to natural weathering for 25, 35 and 50 days {{and the effectiveness of}} the modified PF resins as photoprotective treatments for wood was assessed. We hypothesized that the photostability <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> would be positively correlated with concentration of PF resin (10, 20 and 30 % w/v) and HALS (1 or 2 % w/w) in solutions used to treat veneers. There was an inverse relationship between resin concentration in treatment solutions and tensile strength losses <b>of</b> treated <b>veneers</b> exposed to natural weathering. Mass losses <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> treated with solutions containing 20 or 30 % PF resin were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> treated with 10 % PF resin. The addition of 2 % HALS to solutions containing 30 % PF resin had a significant (p < 0. 05) effect at restricting mass and tensile strength losses <b>of</b> treated <b>veneers</b> exposed to the weather for 50 days. A PF resin treatment containing 30 % resin and 2 % HALS was as effective as chromic acid (a noted photostabilizer for wood) at restricting mass and tensile strength losses <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> during natural weathering. Treated veneer in a plywood-type composite became darker and redder when exposed outdoors, but the addition of HALS to the resin restricted color changes <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> treated with 10 % PF resin. A 30 % PF resin treatment on its own or containing 2 % HALS protected wood's cellular structure from destruction during accelerated weathering and restricted, but did not prevent delignification of wood. We conclude that the effectiveness of {{low molecular weight}} PF resin as a photoprotective treatment for wood can be improved by increasing the concentration of PF resin and by combining it with a water soluble HALS.
