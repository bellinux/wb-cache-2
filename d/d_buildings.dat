In this paper, we design a generic yet effective approach for simplifying 3 <b>D</b> <b>buildings.</b> Instead of relying on both semantic information and geometric information, our approach is based solely on geometric information as many 3 <b>D</b> <b>buildings</b> still do not include semantic information. In addition, it provides an integrated means to treat 3 <b>D</b> <b>buildings</b> with either sloped or flat roofs.

In urban areas, {{it has been}} long a challenge topic to automatically extract urban objects from images due to the high object density and scene complexity. In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic 3 <b>d</b> <b>building</b> reconstruction from IKONOS stereo images. Our approach is based on extraction and characterisation of objects from the scene imagery. Objects are characterised by their contours and Texture. The matching process is object oriented and combines objects geometrical features and textural characteristics.

Gothenburg continues to develop the use of 3 D maps in municipal operations and is demanding a way to create building elements (walls), which generates in 3 <b>D</b> <b>buildings,</b> from roof constructions that are mapped from the primary map. A method has been investigated in the present study. The results are then presented as a 3 D model of buildings, along with a terrain map that will facilitate the localization of the area. The created 3 <b>D</b> <b>buildings</b> are then compared with roof-data from the primary map to see how well they harmonize with each other. Then also the handling and storage of three-dimensional data with the information model CityGML is investigated. A specification of the requirements and characteristics that the customer, the City Planning in Gothenburg, looks are essential for building modeling in 3 D has also been established. The final result shows of 4 % increase in the plane of 3 <b>D</b> <b>buildings</b> compared to primary map. The increase would be slightly greater if the comparison is made on the volume instead. The results also revealed that the increase in plan is something that has occurred during the creation of the roof constructions, which was something that I couldn’t have affected during the work.

For many applications it is useful to be able to transform the object representation automatically in order to generalize the geometry. For this task a structurally rich description of the object is needed. We presented a reconstruction procedure which models the structure of facades. This method is based on a facade grammar and a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo process. For the stochastic process we need prior knowledge about facades. The distribution of facade elements can influence the proposal of rules. Until now we made general assumptions about these distributions.

Therefore, a data fusion of given 3 d models and recorded IR image sequences is performed. A relative orientation of {{the images of the}} sequence is generated using Nistér’s fivepoint algorithm and image triplets.

The relative oriented image scene is then matched in two steps first to the recoded GPS camera path and then to the given building with least squares minimum distance. Textures are extracted for every image and its according camera position from all visible surfaces. Because one image does not show complete building facades, the extracted textures of the images are combined to create complete textures for the model surfaces. These textures can be used for feature extraction and object recognition for analyzing buildings and assigned 3 d coordinates to found features and objects. I...|$|R
