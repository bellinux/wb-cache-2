Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial.

Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in {{appearance}} and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E

The domain of law in Malaysia and the Malaysian courtroom, for instance, is one site that is influenced and shaped by such variables. To participate meaningfully in such a domain thus requires participants to be aware of literacy practices, which in turn, involve the acquisition and learning of the relevant and existing complex roles, identities, codes, registers and social artifacts. While officers of the court (judges and counsels for instance), are trained participants, witnesses who are called to court to give evidence are not.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Onychomycosis or nail fungal {{infection}} {{is the most}} common nail disease. Despite the wide range of studies on this condition, it remains difficult to establish the correct diagnosis and effective treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of classical laboratory methods for the diagnosis of onychomycosis, and the in vitro susceptibility of the its main etiological agent to antifungals used in routine. METHODS: Nail samples of 100 patients with clinically suspected feet onychomycosis were collected to confirm the diagnosis by <b>direct</b> mycological <b>examination</b> and fungal culture. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing was performed against strains of the main dermatophyte isolated by microdilution, according to the standardized protocol (M 38 -A 2 - CLSI) RESULTS: Clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed by laboratory analysis in 59 % of patients. Of these, 54. 2 % were positive only in <b>direct</b> mycological <b>examination,</b> 44. 1 % in <b>direct</b> mycological <b>examination</b> and culture, and one case (1. 7 %) was positive only in culture, resulting in weak agreement between these tests (Kappa = 0. 385; p < 0. 001) High minimum inhibitory concentration values of fluconazole and itraconazole were observed in 66. 7 % and 25. 0 % of isolates of T. rubrum tested. Additionally, high MIC values of terbinafine and ciclopirox was detected in only one isolate, and {{this was one of the}} strains in which in vitro activity of itraconazole and fluconazole has not been proven. CONCLUSIONS: Poor agreement was observed between <b>direct</b> mycological <b>examination</b> and culture for the diagnosis of onychomycosis, with <b>direct</b> mycological <b>examination</b> being significantly more sensitive.

In this study we used the direct staining and an improved technique after treating the smears with N -acetyl-L-cysteine, NaOH and sodium citrate and concentration of bacteria by centrifugation. Specimens were stained using the auramine-rhodamine technique. The gold standard was defined as a positive Löwenstein-Jensen culture, or a positive AFB smear of material obtained from a negative culture after 60 days. Fifty two specimens were positive according to the gold standard definition.

2500|$|Generally, if, {{during an}} {{uncontrollable}} flailing {{caused by a}} sudden paroxysmal episode, such as that produced by an epileptic seizure, a person strikes another, that person will not be criminally liable for the injuries sustained by the other person. However, if prior to the assault on another, the seized individual was engaging in conduct that he knew to be dangerous given a previous history of seizures, then he is culpable for any injuries resulting from the seizure. For example, in People v. Decina, 2 N.Y.2d 133 (1956), the defendant, Emil Decina, appealed a conviction under § 1053-a of the New York Penal Law. On March 14, 1955, Decina suffered a serious seizure while operating a motor vehicle. He swerved wildly through the streets and struck a group of school girls, killing four of them. On <b>direct</b> <b>examination,</b> Decina's physician testified that Decina informed him that prior to the accident [...] "he noticed a jerking of his right hand" [...] and recounted his extensive history of seizures, a consequence of brain damage from an automobile accident at age seven. Decina argued, inter alia, {{that he had not}} engaged in criminal conduct because he did not voluntarily strike the school girls. The New York Court of Appeals disagreed and held that since the defendant knew he was susceptible to a seizure at any time without warning and decided to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway anyway, he was guilty of the offense. [...] "To hold otherwise," [...] wrote Froessel, J, [...] "would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution" ...|$|E

40|$|Three {{isolates}} of zygomycetes {{belonging to}} three different genera (Rhizopus microsporus, Absidia corymbifera, and Apophysomyces elegans) {{were used to}} produce a disseminated infection in nonimmunocompromised mice. The therapeutic efficacy of amphotericin B, given intraperitoneally at doses ranging from 0. 5 to 4. 5 mg/kg of body weight/day, oral itraconazole at 100 mg/kg/day, and oral terbinafine at 150 mg/kg/day was evaluated in this model. The markers of antifungal efficacy were the median survival time, the mortality rate, {{and the percentage of}} infected organs. Organ culture was performed along with microscopic <b>direct</b> <b>examinations</b> of tissues to assess the presence of an active infection. An acute and lethal infection was obtained in untreated mice challenged with each of the three strains. The data obtained for <b>direct</b> <b>examinations</b> and qualitative cultures indicate that, due to the nonseptate nature of the hyphae, each technique gives different information and should be used together with the others. Against all three strains, amphotericin B yielded a 90 to 100 % survival rate. Itraconazole was inactive against R. microsporus but significantly reduced mortality in mice infected with A. corymbifera or A. elegans. Terbinafine had no beneficial effects against R. microsporus and A. corymbifera despite documented absorption of the drug. Overall, only limited correlations were observed between MICs determined in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the drugs. The efficacy of itraconazole in these models of zygomycosis suggests that this drug, as well as the new azole compounds presently under development, warrants close evaluation...|$|R

The broad spectrum of potential pathogens is reduced when the host's condition and the events around the pneumonia episode are taken in account.

Microbiological diagnosis relies on <b>direct</b> sputum <b>examination</b> and culture (for bacterial agents) and on serology (for nonbacterial agents). In a compromised host, the spectrum of etiological agents is broader; sputum examination often is unrewarding and invasive investigations are necessary.
