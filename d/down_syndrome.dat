5|$|Advocacy {{groups for}} {{individuals}} with <b>Down</b> <b>syndrome</b> began to be formed after the Second World War. These were organizations advocating {{for the inclusion of}} people with <b>Down</b> <b>syndrome</b> into the general school system and for a greater understanding of the condition among the general population, as well as groups providing support for families with children living with <b>Down</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Before this individuals with <b>Down</b> <b>syndrome</b> were often placed in mental hospitals or asylums. Organizations included the Royal Society for Handicapped Children and Adults founded in the UK in 1946 by Judy Fryd, Kobato Kai founded in Japan in 1964, the National <b>Down</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Congress founded in the United States in 1973 by Kathryn McGee and others, and the National <b>Down</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Society founded in 1979 in the United States.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundReports {{conflict}} on optimal postoperative analgesic {{treatment in}} children with intellectual disability. We retrospectively compared postoperative analgesics consumption between neonates with and without <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> in relation to anaesthesia requirements and pain scores. MethodsWe analysed hypnotic and analgesic drug administration, pain scores [COMFORT-Behaviour (COMFORT-B) scale], and duration of mechanical ventilation during the first 48 h after surgical repair of congenital duodenal obstruction in neonates, between 1999 and 2011. Data of 15 children with <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> were compared with data of 30 children without <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome.</b> ResultsGeneral anaesthesia requirements did not differ. The median (inter-quartile range) maintenance dose of morphine during the first 24 h after operation was 9. 5 (7. 810. 1) g kg - 1 h - 1 in the <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> group vs 7. 7 (5. 010. 0) g kg - 1 h - 1 {{in the control group}} (P 0. 46). Morphine doses at postoperative day 2 and COMFORT-B scores at day 1 did not significantly differ between the two groups. COMFORT-B scores at day two were lower {{in children with}} <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P 0. 04). The duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation did not statistically differ between the two groups (P 0. 89). ConclusionsIn this study, neonates with and without <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> received adequate postoperative analgesia, as judged from comparable analgesic consumption and pain scores. We recommend prospective studies in children of different age groups with <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> and in other groups of intellectually disabled children to provide further investigation of the hypothesis that intellectual disability predisposes to different analgesic requirements...|$|R

Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with <b>Down</b> <b>syndrome</b> are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{ultrasound}} technology in pregnancy in conjunction with de-creasing numbers of babies born with defects, such as <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> These days technology {{makes it possible to}} explore more and more about unborn children. As a result, in Denmark only 20 babies were born with <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> in 2011. It seems the more influence technology has in pregnancy, the more likely people with <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> eventually will become extinct {{as a result of our}} extensive knowledge regarding how to look for defects in unborn children. In this question, it is interesting to look into society’s view on people who are different from the norm, and what society’s stigmatization means when expecting a child with <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and dealing with the choice of abortion. Our conclusion is that several parents, who have a child with <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome</b> would have chosen an abortion if they had known they were expecting a child with <b>Downs</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We found this issue very important to research and discuss, and we wanted to investigate what drives this process of growing dependence of technology in pregnancy, and why technology has become such an important tool in society. To explore this subject we interviewed midwife, Hanne Rye Jørgensen, from Herlev Hospital and midwife Eva Reiter, who has just finished her ph. D-assignment. We learned a lot about the technical side of ultrasound when we interviewed Rye Jørgensen, however she was probably influenced by her position in the healthcare department, so we worry that we didn’t get her honest opinion on the questions. Like Rye Jørgensen, Reiter was also influenced by her (former) job. We also included literature about ultrasound technology and how to use technology to diagnose unborn children. Furthermore we have made an analysis upon the TV series “Undskyld vi er her”, that involves 3 women, who has <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> The TV series focus on their daily lives and let the women express their opinion on many subjects. To discuss the issue of avoiding conditions such as <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> in fetuses, we have includ-ed discussions about pathologization in modern society. We learned that pathologization in soci-ety creates new issues because human features is sickened which means that almost everyone can be diagnosed. We also included discussions about determinism in technology innovations in context to the role of ultrasound technology in modern pregnancies. In discussion whether it’s a social or technical determinism, we concluded it was both...|$|R

5000|$|The BBC {{responded by}} saying, [...] "EastEnders has {{undertaken}} {{a great deal}} of research to script the storyline of Billy and Honey giving birth to their baby daughter. EastEnders takes enormous care with its research and takes advice from experts in the given field. In addition, for this particular storyline EastEnders talked to numerous families with children who have <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Some of their experiences were depicted in these early episodes. Also closely involved was a senior midwife from a large UK general hospital who saw all scripts. In relation to some particular points raised, Honey was not denied an epidural — she made the choice to put herself out of reach of communicating effectively with the midwife by locking herself in the bathroom. When the news was broken to Honey and Billy that their baby had <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> EastEnders has in fact drawn directly from one particular true-life story — and while this may indeed not be best practice it is worth saying that good drama does not necessarily come from best practice." [...] Despite the BBCs [...] "extensive search" [...] to cast a real Downs baby for the birth episodes, they were unable to do so, resulting in the shots of the newborn baby being less authentic and limited. The BBC added, [...] "In the coming weeks Honey and Billys child will be played by a baby with <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> It is worth noting that EastEnders has received incredibly positive feedback from the <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Association following the first few episodes, whom we are continuing to work with very closely." [...] Carol Boys, chief executive of the <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Association, has confirmed that 40% of parents whose babies were diagnosed after birth were given no written or practical information about the condition, and 11% were told, as Honey was, by a midwife rather than a paediatrician: [...] "The way in which Billy and Honey have learnt of their babys disability, and their subsequent support from their health professionals, is not a best-practice model. However, neither is it an unrealistic situation. BBC researchers and scriptwriters have based the scenes on conversations with families who have children with <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> and the scenes have struck a chord with thousands of our parent members across the country. Some health professionals hold outdated or prejudiced views about people with <b>Downs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> that prevent them from giving parents a balanced picture of what the future will hold for them." ...|$|R
