25|$|Through {{a friend}} Hill {{got a job}} in Los Angeles researching {{historical}} documentaries made by a company that was associated with Encyclopædia Britannica. He began seeing more and more scripts, writing scripts and developed the urge to direct. Hill:Seeing so many of the European films, Japanese films, I was part of this isolated community in east Hollywood. I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Sink or swim... I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack started being {{composed}} before production {{had even}} begun, {{and is a}} notable departure from the band's previous works, as Daft Punk put more emphasis on orchestral elements rather than relying solely on synthesizers. [...] "Synths are a very low level of artificial intelligence," [...] explained member Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, [...] "whereas you have a Stradivarius that will live for a thousand years. We knew {{from the start that}} there was no way that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> film score with two synthesizers and a drum machine." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2017, Our Revolution activists {{worked in}} local {{elections}} in California to advance Sanders' populist agenda. Executive director Shannon Jackson said, [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> around the states." ...|$|R
6000|$|March sighed. [...] "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>this</b> money?" [...] He {{glanced at}} the heap of bills he had flung on the table between them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But me no buts, or I won't stir {{a finger}} towards helping you. What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>this</b> money if I procure it for you?' ...|$|R
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different. I was like, [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> I'm {{going to do}} that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And I was like [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E
500|$|Tom Araya {{said that}} [...] "when we did Divine Intervention, {{this was the}} last conference we ever had with a record label where they sat us down and sold us the idea of how they wanted to do [...] "Divine", and how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> with the cover... and all these {{different}} ideas for the album. Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up {{and that was the last}} time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's better," [...] said Grandfather Frog gruffly. [...] "Always {{tell the}} truth. The fact is I am tired. I am so tired that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep for the winter, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>this</b> very day." ...|$|R
500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{has denied}} involvement, {{saying that his}} staff acted without his {{knowledge}} regarding to the planning for the lane closures. He said at an April 2014 town hall meeting: [...] "if anybody {{told me they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> I would have stopped it".|$|E
2500|$|During 48 Hours Gross said {{he thought}} that Hill had {{received}} [...] "a bum rap on the woman question" [...] over the years. [...] "People think that he doesn't like women and he knows that's not true. I think that's going to be demonstrated even more clearly in his next films. He told me he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> new thing: he's {{going to put a}} female character right in the centre of the narrative." ...|$|E
6000|$|She entered panting and alarmed. [...] "Oh, {{what is your}} honour <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> honest gentleman?" [...] said she. [...] "In {{the name}} of Heaven, let him go! His time is precious--he has {{important}} business--business of life and death." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{looked out}} across the sea, and he {{repeated}} her question to himself. What was he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in <b>this</b> great, strange land, whose ways were not his ways, and whose sympathies lay so far apart from his? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't yer <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>this</b> time?" [...] {{she demanded}} with a falling face. [...] "You done it last time. I {{tell her you}} <b>done</b> it"--she pointed <b>to</b> her friend who was looking wistfully at me--"ain't you to let her see you doing of it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{television}} series was animated by Gainax {{and directed by}} Hiroyuki Imaishi. The series' animation is done in a distinct style resembling and paying homage to American cartoons, along with the Yoshinori Kanada techniques normally associated with Hiroyuki Imaishi's work. The series has many sexual themes in every episode. The theme of the anime is [...] "vulgar and indecent jokes", with Imaishi saying, [...] "If we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> we will try it thoroughly." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 31 August: a RUC officer (Martin Vance) {{was shot}} dead by the IRA outside his home, Rocks Chapel Road, Crossgar, County Down. Sinn Féin objected to the {{decision}} of Down's district council to adjourn during the man's funeral as a mark of respect. In a statement the Sinn Féin councillors said: [...] "We feel if the council is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing then they should do it {{for all those who}} have lost their lives due to British occupation, and not just a select few." ...|$|E
2500|$|... did {{something}} very smart. When {{he was with}} President Obama recently, he explained it. He actually told the American government that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> deal to try and prove to those within Pakistan, and in Pakistan's state apparatus, who think that these guys can be negotiated with — I will negotiate with them only {{to prove that you}} can't negotiate with them, because they will break the deal. And as soon as they broke the deal, the army is back in, the fighting is going on, {{and you can see the}} results." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It didn't pay much," [...] replied Kelley, cautiously. [...] "You see, we {{had some}} new {{machinery}} to put in and some roads to grade and one thing or another--I reckon it paid about"--he hesitated--"about three hundred a month. But it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better <b>this</b> year." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I know. We saw {{you breathe}} that smoke again as priestess when you uttered the prophecy as Oracle of the Child at the Feast of the First-fruits. But {{what are you}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>this</b> stuff, Lady Ragnall? I think you have had enough of visions just at present." ...|$|R
2500|$|Actor Fenella Fielding, {{who worked}} with him on Follow a Star, commented “Not a very {{pleasant}} man. Always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning. Not exactly a lovely way to start a day’s filming.” while Lynda Bellingham said with reference to A Little Bit of Wisdom [...] "I did a comedy series where Norman Wisdom, bless his little cotton socks, said, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> scene now where I drop a pencil down the front of your dress and I look for it." [...] "Oh, I see, is that funny?" [...] "Oh, it'll be hysterical." [...] So for ten minutes I stood there while he basically touched me up and you couldn't say anything because he was the master of comedy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E
2500|$|Fox ordered {{thirteen}} episodes. Immediately after, however, Fox {{feared the}} themes of the show were not suitable for the network and Groening and Fox executives argued over whether the network would have any creative input into the show. With The Simpsons, the network has no input. Fox was particularly disturbed by the concept of suicide booths, Doctor Zoidberg, and Bender's anti-social behavior. Groening explains, [...] "When they tried to give me notes on Futurama, I just said: 'No, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> just {{the way we did}} Simpsons.' And they said, 'Well, we don't do business that way anymore.' And I said, 'Oh, well, that's the only way I do business.'" [...] The episode [...] "I, Roommate" [...] was produced to address Fox's concerns, with the script written to their specifications. Fox strongly disliked the episode, but after negotiations, Groening received the same independence with Futurama.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with {{yourself}} <b>this</b> morning?" [...] she asked, {{as she walked}} up the rocky path, with no arm to lean upon.|$|R
5000|$|Later Kim Yesenin is {{a secret}} witness to a {{farewell}} conversation of Sasha with her lover, nicknamed as [...] "The Hirsute" [...] (Stanislav Lyubshin). The Hirsute is a frustrated scientist and writer, planning to emigrate to the United States (in the scene of parting with The Hirsute, Sasha shouts: [...] "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in <b>this</b> America?!").|$|R
60|$|Thus much is needful {{to give an}} idea of the controversy. It is {{not here}} our purpose to go more at length into the {{evidence}} cited on either side. We simply wish to show that the question may be settled deductively. Before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> however, let us briefly notice two collateral points.|$|R
2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told {{the true nature of}} the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we have got to get it off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'" [...] Records demonstrated that in one test which took place in 1983 only five soil samples were collected to represent a [...] area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organizers}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation took several steps to ensure {{the validity of the}} participants. [...] Each veteran's authenticity was checked before the hearings by the investigation event organizers, and subsequently by reporters and Pentagon officials. In addition, they also gave specific details about their units and the locations where the events had occurred. [...] Those who wanted to testify were carefully screened by the officers of VVAW, and care was taken to verify the service records and testimony of the veterans. After the severe criticism of the accuracy of Mark Lane's book about atrocities a month before the event, the {{organizers of}} the Winter Soldier Investigation made the credibility of the participants a top priority. [...] As noted by one VVAW leader, [...] "The lesson is that we'd better do our work right. We'd better talk to these vets and weed out the bullshitters so that we can't get set up, because we're going to come under attack. [...] We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> right." [...] All veterans participating in Winter Soldier were required to bring their discharge papers (DD-214's) and IDs.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Snowden {{said his}} [...] "breaking point" [...] was [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, {{directly}} lie under oath to Congress." [...] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, and {{nine months after}} the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads {{during the summer of}} 2012—in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who {{need to be able to}} trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> The public had a right to know about these programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in and pray!" [...] he repeated. [...] "Not he! Not Mr. Wembley! He's safe tucked {{up in his}} bed, {{shivering}} with fear, I'll bet you. He's {{not getting}} his feet wet to save a body or lend a hand here. Souls are his job. You let the preacher alone, mother, {{and tell us what}} we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>this</b> gentleman." ...|$|R
5000|$|There were no {{separate}} stages. Abramović and {{the visitors}} {{stood in the}} same space, {{making it clear that}} the latter were part of the work. The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: [...] "What is the public about and what are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in <b>this</b> kind of situation?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is a very}} {{remarkable}} circumstance that, {{from the}} commencement of the serious study of fossil remains, in fact from the time when Cuvier began his brilliant researches upon {{those found in the}} quarries of Montmartre, palæontology has shown what she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in <b>this</b> matter, and what kind of evidence it lay in her power to produce.|$|R
