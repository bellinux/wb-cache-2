500|$|In 1939, Rockwell {{moved to}} Arlington, Vermont, {{which was an}} artist-friendly {{community}} that had hosted Robert Frost, Rockwell Kent, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Of the move from New Rochelle, New York, Rockwell said [...] "I was restless... The town [...] seemed tinged with everything that happened to me". In New Rochelle, he had both endured a divorce and run with a fast crowd. Artists John Atherton, Mead Schaeffer and George Hughes established residences in Arlington soon after Rockwell. The resident artists, Rockwell included, were mutually supportive and hired local citizens as their amateur models. Using photography and Arlington residents as models, Rockwell was able to capture what he referred to as [...] "human-looking humans", who were generally working-class people, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> so rather than hire professional models for the entire day. Rockwell paid his models modestly. Rose Hoyt, who was engaged {{for a total of}} three photographic sessions for Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Worship, earned $15 ($ in [...] dollars) for her sittings.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} incorporated aerodynamic control principles {{covered by}} patents issued to Fred Weick, an early aeronautical engineer {{who went on}} to design and market the Ercoupe. [...] Since it had no rudders (or rudder pedals), it was simpler to fly (it had a single control wheel, which controlled the ailerons and elevator), and was considered spin-proof. [...] The aircraft was certified in 1941 with a placard that stated that the aircraft was characteristically incapable of spinning. The company also made a comment to Popular Science in a [...] that an [...] "average" [...] person could learn to fly the Skyfarer ...<b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> so...|$|E

2500|$|... "Jaywalking": A pre-taped segment, [...] "Jaywalking" [...] is {{a play on}} the host's {{name and}} the illegal {{practice}} of jaywalking. Leno asks people questions about current news and other topics in public areas around Los Angeles (usually Hollywood Boulevard, Melrose Avenue or Universal Studios). Most responses are outrageously incorrect; for example, one person believed that Abraham Lincoln was the first president, and another could not identify a picture of Hillary Clinton. Sometimes the questions are of the [...] "What color is the White House?" [...] level, such as asking in what country the Panama Canal is located. Up to 15 people are interviewed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> less for each segment, with about nine interviews used on the air. [...] A similar format {{was used for the}} game show Street Smarts.|$|E
