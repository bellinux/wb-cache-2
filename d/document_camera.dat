50|$|Lighting is an {{essential}} part of a <b>document</b> <b>camera.</b> To ensure good colour rendition, the lighting system used to illuminate the image capture area should be as uniform as possible. The greater the light intensity, the more independent the <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> is from ambient light sources. Using powerful lighting systems enables smaller apertures to be used, and this in turn provides a significant increase in the depth of field that can be achieved by the <b>document</b> <b>camera.</b> Also the higher the quality of the light source, the more light that will reach the camera sensor, and this results in less noticeable noise, and therefore the quality of image is not degraded.|$|E

50|$|The first {{attempts}} and prototypes {{were mostly}} simple video cameras on a copy stand. During the mid-1970s these were assembled and equipped with additional lighting {{to ensure that}} they were able to operate in darkened rooms, and also to provide a consistent quality of projected image. The technology of video cameras during this time, was a key factor in the development of <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> systems. Document cameras have also frequently benefited from developments in other industries, which also facilitated significant advances in the field of <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> technology. A good example of this is the technology used in photographic equipment, which has contributed much to the development of the <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> as a high quality presentation tool.|$|E

The document is scanned directly {{in the context of the}} customer, in which it is to be placed or used. Reaction time is an advantage in these situations. <b>Document</b> <b>cameras</b> usually also require a small amount of space and are often portable.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper is}} to {{introduce}} a <b>camera</b> <b>document</b> recognition using hierarchical classifier. Generally, {{it is very difficult}} to recognize <b>camera</b> <b>document</b> image because of inconsistent input condition and camera problem itself. Therefore, Implementation of hierarchical classifier is needed to guarantee recognition performance of <b>camera</b> <b>document</b> image. The <b>camera</b> <b>document</b> goes through four processes such as preprocessing, segmentation and recognition modules. Input document image is evaluated by image enhancement algorithm and local threshold method. Characters are segmented using merging and split method, which is based on structural information of characters. Combined feature extractor and hierarchical MLPs have used to recognize a segmented character. We obtained an encouraging recognition result for <b>camera</b> <b>document</b> by combining image patches. We have experimented with ETRI document database and an encouraging recognition result 94. 6 % has obtained. Key-Words:- <b>Camera</b> <b>document</b> recognition; Structural features; Hierarchical classifier...|$|R

50|$|The {{widespread}} use of computers, projectors, and popular presentation programs such as Microsoft Powerpoint in meeting rooms, meant that overhead projectors became less frequently used. <b>Document</b> <b>cameras</b> continue to provide a convenient and flexible way of allowing documents, books or slides to be spontaneously displayed during presentations as required.|$|R
50|$|Document cameras, {{also known}} as visual presenters, visualisers (in the United Kingdom), digital overheads, or docucams, are {{real-time}} image capture devices for displaying an object to a large audience. Like an opaque projector, a <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> is able to magnify and project the images of actual, three-dimensional objects, as well as transparencies. They are, in essence, high resolution web cams, mounted on arms so as to facilitate their placement over a page. This allows a teacher, lecturer or presenter to write {{on a sheet of}} paper or to display a two or three-dimensional object while the audience watches. Theoretically, all objects can be displayed by a <b>document</b> <b>camera.</b> Most objects are simply placed under the camera. The camera takes the picture which in turn produces a live picture using a projector or monitor. Different types of document camera/visualizer allow great flexibility in terms of placement of objects. Larger objects, for example, can simply be placed {{in front of the camera}} and the camera rotated as necessary,or a ceiling mounted <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> can also be used to allow a larger working area to be used.|$|E
50|$|All {{students}} have {{a better view of}} the information that the presenter is sharing with the class. Its use brings an end to the days of children pushing and shoving to gain a better view of a teacher-demonstrated science experiment. Furthermore, a <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> is a great classroom management tool. For example, the teacher can use the <b>document</b> <b>camera</b> to display a kitchen timer while the class is working in groups or independently. A picture schedule can also be displayed to help English Language Learners understand directions. By allowing all students to view an item simultaneously, document cameras also have the ability to streamline show-and-tell. The presenter does not have to walk slowly around the room to show everyone his or her treasure.|$|E

50|$|<b>Document</b> <b>cameras</b> have a {{wide variety}} of {{sophisticated}} automated systems that are designed to make the user experience as easy as possible. Permanent autofocus detection, for example, automatically adjusts the focus settings when a new object is displayed, with no need for user intervention. Other important features include automatic auto iris, auto exposure, auto white balance and automatic gain control.|$|R
