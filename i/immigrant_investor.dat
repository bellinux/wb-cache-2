40|$|It {{is part of}} {{the paper}} session: Housing as Social Experiment: Rethinking the Legacy of Modernist Planning Outside Europe, 1900 - 1950 The paper traces how ideas of modernist {{planning}} were adapted in real estate practices in Hong Kong between 1912 and 1925, a period in which the British colony experienced consecutive land booms that coincided with a housing crisis ushered by large influx of <b>immigrants.</b> While <b>investors</b> accumulated large profits from speculative housing practices, rising rent and property prices led to widespread discontent amongst the less wealthy, prompting various groups to agitate for their "rights to the city" and petitioned the government to exert control over the land and housing market. These demands led to protracted public debates over Hong Kong's longstanding commitment to laissez-faire capitalism and the need to help the disadvantaged in order to prevent social instability. The opening up of New Kowloon after 1911 provided new hopes for many that the housing shortage would eventually be alleviated. While planners and social reformers envisioned New Kowloon to be a well-planned suburb that would act as a corrective to the earlier haphazard development, developers put forward ambitious housing schemes targeting the well-to-do. These include the emerging middle class Chinese, who wanted to live in modernist environments no less superior to those of their European counterparts. By tracing the competing visions of these projects, this paper will provide a historical perspective on the advent of modernist planning in Hong Kong and its intrinsic relationship with speculative housing practices. It will also illustrate how contingent forms of social consensus were enabled in a colonial city underscored by prosperity and profound inequalities...|$|R

40|$|A major {{driver of}} {{tropical}} deforestation is rural frontier migration. In this paper an attempt {{is made to}} formally describe the human-environment interactions that are manifested in a forested system experiencing a large influx of rural migrants. The Guraferda district in South-West Ethiopia was selected as an exemplary case-study. On {{the basis of an}} extensive field surveys in several villages, the relation different social groups in the area were identified: the native population, recent <b>immigrants</b> and <b>investors.</b> For each of these groups their livelihood and their relation with the forest resources was analyzed on the basis of interviews and mapped via remote sensing. To formalize the identified human-environment interactions, an agent-based model was developed. The model simulates the decision-making process concerning deforestation of the identified agent types. The native population consists of shifting cultivators, while the new immigrants are technologically more advanced and are sedentary farmers. For each grid cell of the landscape, utilities for the agent types are calculated. High potential yields increase utility, while proneness to diseases, high population density and the presence of forest decrease utility. Learning behavior is implemented, allowing native agents to learn from migrants and vice versa, thus increasing productivity. Agricultural investors are added to the model as a passive agent type that can grab land from the previous two groups. Results show that inmigration started with the forced resettlements in 1985, after which voluntary migrants followed in great number thereby pushing the native population to new frontiers. Ongoing land grabbing by external investors is accelerating this process. A comparison with observations shows that the model is able to reproduce spatial patterns of deforestation in land systems under pressure of different groups of land users at is therefore a valuable tool for exploratory research in land change science...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2008, the Philippines passed China as Canada's leading {{source of}} immigrants. [...] In 2010, when Mainland China became {{the second largest}} {{economy in the world}} after the United States, its {{economic}} growth sparked even greater immigration opportunities to mainland Chinese. A 2011 survey shown that 60% of Chinese millionaires plan to immigrate, where 37% of the respondents wanted to immigrate to Canada. Many foreign countries such as Canada hold very large attraction for rich Chinese, because of their better social welfare system, higher quality of education and a greater opportunity for investment. The main reasons Chinese businesspeople want to move abroad was for some educational opportunities for their children, advanced medical treatment, worsening pollution back home (especially urban air quality) and food safety concerns. The Canadian Federal <b>Investor</b> <b>Immigrant</b> Program (FIIP) as a cash-for-visa scheme allows many powerful Chinese to seek for a Canadian citizenship, and recent reports show that 697 of the 700 (99.6%) of the applicants to this visa in 2011 were mainland Chinese.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire affected the local Chinatown and Chinese immigration as a whole. It focuses on communities from the Pearl River Delta of southern China, their motivations for emigration, the industries they found employment in, and the racially charged legislation {{they had to}} contend with. By 1902 the Chinese Exclusion Act forbid Chinese immigration indefinitely, but the fire of 1906 destroyed the local City Hall which housed all of the city’s immigration records. Chinese immigrants exploited the opportunity, applying for more documentation than they needed and distributing the extras to those who wanted admission to the country. Consequently, Chinese populations in the United States grew after 1906. Anti-Chinese sentiment in California was strong prior to this point due to racial prejudice; concerns over the sharp population increase, labor, organized crime, disease, opium dens, gambling houses, and brothels led many Americans to {{the assumption that the}} Chinese immigrants were a financial burden they were forced to support. Because of this, the residents of San Francisco initially forbid Chinese peoples from rebuilding after the fire. However, Chinese <b>immigrants,</b> merchants, <b>investors,</b> and diplomats all proved to be a financial boon to the reconstruction, and several organizations took the opportunity to create better relations between Chinese and American communities. In spite of the deep racial tensions literally months before, Chinatown ended up being rebuilt in 1907 in the same location as before. Many “exotic” aspects of Chinatown were exaggerated to make it more appealing as a tourist attraction and the organized city planning meant there was far more infrastructure, communication, and transparency than previously possible. Moreover, the increasing number of Chinese immigrants resulted in a more diverse population ratio and less crime. By examining legislation, newspapers, and individual accounts, I argue the financial success of the San Francisco Chinatown resulted in greater racial tolerance and acceptance of Chinese communities. Moreover, the San Francisco Chinatown was used as an archetype around the world, meaning many of the same aesthetics and ideas associated with them had an impact on Chinese immigration well beyond a single city in California...|$|R
