The U.S. manga market took an upturn with mid-1990s anime and manga versions of Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell (translated by Frederik L. Schodt and Toren Smith) becoming very popular among fans. An extremely successful manga and anime translated and dubbed in English in the mid-1990s was Sailor Moon. By 1995–1998, the Sailor Moon manga had been exported to over 23 countries, including China, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, North America and most of Europe. In 1997, Mixx Entertainment began publishing Sailor Moon, along with CLAMP's Magic Knight Rayearth, Hitoshi Iwaaki's Parasyte and Tsutomu Takahashi's <b>Ice</b> <b>Blade</b> in the monthly manga magazine MixxZine. Two years later, MixxZine was renamed to Tokyopop before discontinuing in 2011. Mixx Entertainment, later renamed Tokyopop, also published manga in trade paperbacks and, like Viz, began aggressive marketing of manga to both young male and young female demographics.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} ice {{accretion}} on the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic coefficients in a cascade of stator blades were experimentally investigated. Experiments were conducted on stage 67 A type stator Controlled-Diffusion blades, which represent the mid-span of {{the first stage of}} the stator for a high-bypass turbofan engine. The measurements were carried out over a range of cascade angle of attack from 20 ° to 45 ° at Reynolds number of 500000. Experimental blade surface pressure coefficient distribution, lift and drag force coefficients, and momentum coefficients for clean blades were compared with those of the <b>iced</b> <b>blades</b> and the effects of ice accretion on these parameters were discussed. It is observed that the ice accretion on the blades causes the formation of flow bubble on the pressure side, downstream of the leading edge. By increasing the angle of attack from 20 ° to 35 °, the bubble length decreases and the pressure coefficient increases inside the bubble region, constantly. In addition, for the <b>iced</b> <b>blades</b> the diffusion points at the suction side come closer to the trailing edge. In addition, it is found that by increasing the angle of attack up to 35 °, the ice accretion has no significant effect on the lift coefficient but the drag coefficient increases comparing with the clean blades. More over at 40 ° and 45 °, by increasing the flow interference effects between the <b>blades,</b> the <b>iced</b> <b>blades</b> experience higher lift and lower drag in comparison with the clean ones...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{installed in}} cold climate sites accumulate ice on their structures. Icing of the rotor blades reduces turbine power output and increases loads, vibrations, noise, and safety risks {{due to the}} potential ice throw. Ice accumulation increases the mass distribution of the blade, while changes in the aerofoil shapes affect its aerodynamic behavior. Thus, the structural and aerodynamic changes due to icing affect the modal behavior of wind turbine blades. In this study, aeroelastic equations of the wind turbine blade vibrations are derived to analyze modal behavior of the Tjaereborg 2 MW wind turbine <b>blade</b> with <b>ice.</b> Structural vibrations of the blade are coupled with a Beddoes-Leishman unsteady attached flow aerodynamics model and the resulting aeroelastic equations are analyzed using the finite element method (FEM). A linearly increasing ice mass distribution is considered from the blade root to half-length and thereafter constant ice mass distribution to the blade tip, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL) for the certification of wind turbines. Both structural and aerodynamic properties of the <b>iced</b> <b>blades</b> are evaluated and used to determine their influence on aeroelastic natural frequencies and damping factors. Blade natural frequencies reduce with ice mass {{and the amount of}} reduction in frequencies depends on how the ice mass is distributed along the blade length; but the reduction in damping factors depends on the ice shape. The variations in the natural frequencies of the <b>iced</b> <b>blades</b> with wind velocities are negligible; however, the damping factors change with wind velocity and become negative at some wind velocities. This study shows that the aerodynamic changes in the <b>iced</b> <b>blade</b> can cause violent vibrations within the operating wind velocity range of this turbine.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} often {{operate under}} cold weather conditions where icing may occur. <b>Icing</b> causes the <b>blade</b> sections to stall prematurely reducing the power production {{at a given}} wind speed. The unsteady aerodynamic loads associated with <b>icing</b> can accelerate <b>blade</b> structural fatigue and creates safety concerns. In this work, the combined blade element-momentum theory is used to compute the air loads on the baseline rotor <b>blades,</b> prior to <b>icing.</b> At each <b>blade</b> section, a Lagrangian particle trajectory model is used to model the water droplet trajectories {{and their impact on}} the blade surface. An extended Messinger model is next used to solve the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy equations in the boundary layer over the surface, and to determine ice accretion rate. Finally, the aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>iced</b> <b>blade</b> sections are estimated using XFOIL, which initiate the next iteration step for the computation of air loads via combined blade element theory. The procedure repeats until a desired exposure time is achieved. The performance degradation is then predicted, based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the final <b>iced</b> <b>blades.</b> The 2 -D ice shapes obtained are compared against experimental data at several representative atmospheric conditions with acceptable agreement. The performance of a generic experimental wind turbine rotor exposed to icing climate is simulated to obtain the power loss and identify the critical locations on the blade. The results suggest the outboard of the blade is more prone to ice accumulation causing considerable loss of lift at these sections. Also, the blades operating at a higher pitch are expected to accumulate more ice. The loss in power ranges from 10 % to 50 % of the rated power for different pitch settings under the same operating conditions. M. S...|$|R

5000|$|Wheels are {{nowadays}} {{almost universally}} made of polyurethane (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or {{have too much}} rolling resistance.In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity. Wheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see Durometer) and usually ranges between 72A-93A (higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but {{tend to be more}} durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. In the 1990s, wheel rolling resistance (CRR - coefficient of rolling resistance) tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A durometer range, with rolling resistance dramatically increasing below 75A durometer and above 85A durometer. In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest rolling resistance in the 82A-84A durometer range. Wheel profiles and thicknesses again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an <b>ice</b> <b>blade.</b> More rounded profiles provided lower rolling resistance due to the greater [...] "belly" [...] or tire that increased resilience (or [...] "rebound"); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an <b>ice</b> <b>blade),</b> but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased amount rubber on the tire. To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels. [...] This advantage of more wheels having less rolling resistance has been largely negated by the 100-110mm diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks.|$|E
