5|$|Resources such as <b>food</b> <b>are</b> {{limited and}} are {{relatively}} {{stable over time}} (fact).|$|E
5|$|Birds {{that employ}} many {{strategies}} to obtain food or feed {{on a variety}} of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain <b>food</b> <b>are</b> considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and <b>food</b> <b>are</b> provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5000|$|Also in {{the cave}} live two bats, a mother named Maya (Shinobu (...) in the Japanese version) and her child Mario (Morio (...) in the Japanese version). Maya suffers from alcoholism; her {{favorite}} <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> seasonal while her least favorite <b>food</b> <b>is</b> alcohol. Mario's favorite <b>food</b> <b>is</b> Japanese-style tomato spaghetti, while his least favorite <b>food</b> <b>is</b> shiitake mushrooms.|$|R
5000|$|Finger <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>food</b> {{meant to}} <b>be</b> eaten {{directly}} using the hands, {{in contrast to}} food eaten with a knife and fork, spoon, chopsticks, or other utensils. [...] In some cultures, <b>food</b> <b>is</b> almost always eaten with the hands; for example, Ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in injera bread. In the South Asian subcontinent, <b>food</b> <b>is</b> traditionally always eaten with hands. Foods considered street <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> frequently, though not exclusively, finger foods.|$|R
50|$|Thrifty <b>Foods</b> <b>is</b> {{the largest}} private {{employer}} on Vancouver Island. In 1999, Thrifty <b>Foods</b> <b>was</b> voted among the Ten Best Companies to Work For in British Columbia. In 2007, Thrifty <b>Foods</b> <b>was</b> {{recognized as one of}} Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies.|$|R
5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide <b>food</b> <b>are</b> key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Ten bags of Meow Mix cat <b>food</b> <b>are</b> {{placed on}} the stage; the bags contain symbols with only one pair {{containing}} matching symbols. The owner and cat each choose a bag. If the two bags chosen have the same symbol, the owner wins $1,000,000, and in addition, earns an extra $100,000 to donate to the animal shelter of their choice. Otherwise, the contestant leaves with the $25,000 won earlier in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{particles}} are sorted by yet {{another group of}} cilia, which send the smaller particles, mainly minerals, to the prostyle so eventually they are excreted, while the larger ones, mainly <b>food,</b> <b>are</b> sent to the stomach's cecum (a pouch with no other exit) to be digested. The sorting process {{is by no means}} perfect.|$|E
50|$|Vomiting {{and severe}} {{discomfort}} if <b>food</b> <b>is</b> not properly chewed or if <b>food</b> <b>is</b> eaten too quickly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>food</b> <b>is</b> {{made from}} sticky rice {{sprinkled}} with sugar, but this <b>food</b> <b>is</b> getting hard to find.|$|R
50|$|In South Africa, boerewors {{and other}} braai <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} in the street. In townships, ethnic <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|R
5|$|Vendors {{of street}} <b>food</b> <b>are</b> {{numerous}} throughout the centre, often selling from small trailers on permanent locations formally known as Pølsevogne (lit. sausage wagons), traditionally serving a Danish variety of hot dogs, sausages and other fast food. There are increasingly more outlets inspired by other cultural flavours such as sushi, kebab and currywurst.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a <b>food</b> <b>are</b> cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of <b>food</b> <b>are</b> suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
50|$|The Muslims {{follow the}} Islamic law that lists foods and drinks that are Halal and {{permissible}} to consume. Halal <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that Muslims <b>are</b> allowed {{to eat and}} drink under Islamic dietary guidelines. The criteria specify both what <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> allowed, and how the <b>food</b> must <b>be</b> prepared. The <b>foods</b> addressed <b>are</b> mostly types of meat/animal tissue.|$|R
50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>is</b> {{treated as}} a commodity, though there <b>are</b> some differences. <b>Food</b> comes in many {{different}} types, some with different sources. Most <b>food</b> can <b>be</b> produced on farms, but other <b>food</b> can <b>be</b> obtained through hunting and fishing. In most cases, <b>food</b> <b>is</b> stored at granaries instead of warehouses.|$|R
50|$|Islamic dietary {{laws are}} {{prevalent}} across Bangladesh. Halal <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> <b>food</b> items that Muslims {{are allowed to}} eat and drink under Islamic dietary guidelines. The criteria specifies both what <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> allowed, and how the <b>food</b> must <b>be</b> prepared. The <b>foods</b> addressed <b>are</b> mostly types of meat allowed in Islam.|$|R
5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the mushroom <b>food,</b> <b>are</b> more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for <b>food</b> <b>are</b> reduced.|$|E
5|$|The clay-rich Willamette Valley {{soils are}} {{hard in the}} dry season, and the gopher's protuberant incisors are well adapted to these conditions. Adequate soil {{drainage}} and suitable plant <b>food</b> <b>are</b> essential components of the gopher's ideal habitat. Not typically found in wetland areas (where its tunnels would flood), the species is found in seral communities of grasses and shrubs. They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley, including fields of alfalfa, wheat and oats. The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features.|$|E
50|$|<b>Food</b> {{manufacturing}} <b>is</b> {{the process}} by which <b>food</b> <b>is</b> manufactured.|$|R
50|$|In-flight <b>food</b> <b>is</b> {{prepared}} in the flight kitchen {{which is a}} completely HACCP certified facility where <b>food</b> <b>is</b> made in sterile and controlled environments. The packed <b>food</b> <b>is</b> then placed in trollies and wheeled into the Catering truck at the flight kitchen, which can be located within a 5 km radius of the airport.|$|R
50|$|In {{the era of}} {{foraging}} for food, hunter-gatherers rarely {{knew where}} their next meal would come from. As a result, filling their stomachs up with lots of <b>food</b> <b>was</b> advantageous since <b>food</b> <b>was</b> scarce. Intense consumption of high-energy <b>foods</b> <b>was</b> selected for when the availability of <b>food</b> <b>was</b> low and it was more difficult to find. Now, <b>food</b> <b>is</b> readily available, and the neurological system that once helped people recognize the survival advantages of essential eating has now become disadvantageous as it promotes overeating. This has become especially dangerous after the rise of processed foods, as the popularity of foods that have unnaturally high levels of sugar and fat has significantly increased.|$|R
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured <b>food,</b> <b>are</b> present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in <b>food</b> <b>are</b> more than enough.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and <b>food</b> <b>are</b> scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} artist-run restaurant in SoHo, New York. <b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> founded by artists Carol Goodden, Tina Girouard and Gordon Matta-Clark. <b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> {{considered one of}} the first important restaurants in SoHo. Other individuals who <b>were</b> involved with <b>FOOD</b> included Suzanne Harris and Rachel Lew. <b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> a place where artists in SoHo, especially those who were later involved in Avalanche magazine and the Anarchitecture group, could meet and enjoy <b>food</b> together. <b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> considered to be both a business and an artistic [...] "intervention in an urban setting." [...] It has also been called a [...] "landmark that still resonates in the history and mythology of SoHo in the 1970s." ...|$|R
50|$|Bird <b>food</b> <b>is</b> <b>food</b> (often {{varieties}} of seeds, nuts, or dried fruits) eaten by birds. While most bird <b>food</b> <b>is</b> fed to commercial fowl, people also use bird food to feed pet birds or wild birds.|$|R
5000|$|<b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> {{noted for}} using fresh and {{seasonal}} <b>foods,</b> which <b>was</b> a [...] "vaguely countercultural" [...] {{idea for the}} time. <b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the first}} New York restaurants to serve sushi which had been suggested by Takahashi. Another unusual feature of <b>FOOD</b> <b>was</b> {{that it was one of}} the first places to serve vegetarian meals. FOOD also [...] "championed" [...] the use of the open kitchen which is seen in many modern restaurants.|$|R
5|$|Once the Imps are working, {{the player}} must then {{set up a}} basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as <b>food,</b> <b>are</b> bred), and a Treasury. After {{connecting}} the dungeon to a 'Portal', minions will arrive. Minions include dragons, warlocks, and the horned reaper, as well as undead creatures such as vampires and skeletons. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms and spells. Rooms can only be built on tiles belonging to the player. The player is red and the tiles are coloured accordingly. Other keepers have different colours, and the heroes are white. Unaligned creatures and rooms are multicoloured. The player can build traps and doors, created in the workshop. Traps include lightning and boulder traps, the latter instantly killing creatures it comes into contact with. As with rooms, they can only be built on tiles that belong to the player. Traps are not built instantly; Imps need to place them on the blueprint. The Temple is a room where creatures are made happy, and the player can sacrifice creatures to the dark gods. The gods may reward or punish the player, or be indifferent depending on the sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray is not aggressive, but its sting is {{sheathed in}} toxic mucus and {{is capable of}} piercing bone. Across its range, this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines, {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnets and fish traps. It is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch; a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud, becoming almost impossible to lift, or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater. The meat and the cartilage are used; large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale. Adults that are not used for <b>food</b> <b>are</b> often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless. In the Mae Klong and Bang Pakong Rivers, the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums. These trends pose conservation concerns; the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown, the latter because this species does not survive well in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Halal and {{vegetarian}} <b>food</b> <b>are</b> also easily available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>is</b> any {{substance}} consumed {{to provide}} nutritional {{support for the}} body. Most food has its origin in renewable resources. <b>Food</b> <b>is</b> obtained directly from plants and animals.|$|R
50|$|Coconut {{milk and}} coconut cream {{are used to}} flavor many dishes. Most <b>food</b> <b>is</b> cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; very little <b>food</b> <b>is</b> fried.|$|R
50|$|Regenerists {{call for}} the {{creation}} of demand on agricultural systems to produce regenerative <b>foods.</b> This <b>is</b> often compared {{to the creation of the}} demand for organic food. Organic foods have a relation to regenerative foods in that regenerative <b>food</b> <b>is</b> all organic, but not all organic <b>food</b> <b>is</b> regenerative. Organic <b>food</b> <b>is</b> not regenerative if the byproduct of the <b>food</b> crop <b>is</b> not a resource for the next seasons crops and if other inputs for the crop did not come from other resources within the farm which it is grown in.|$|R
