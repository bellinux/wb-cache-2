At the critical Ihantala sector of the battle, the Finnish defenders managed to concentrate their fire to the extent of smashing the advancing Soviet spearhead. The clever fire control system enabled as many as 21 batteries, totaling some 250 guns, to fire at the same target simultaneously in the battle; the fire controller {{did not need to be}} aware of the location of individual batteries to guide their fire, which made quick <b>fire</b> <b>concentration</b> and target switching possible. The Finnish artillery fired altogether over 122,000 rounds of ordnance. This concentration was considered a world record at the time.

Finally, we analyzed the spatio-temporal association between the ignitions hotspots and the remotely-sensed fuel phenology patterns by means of a correspondence analysis and a selectivity ratio. We found that wildfires hotspots are strictly related to anthropogenic pressure and to the spatio-temporal variation of fuel conditions in terms of both load and moisture: areas with less <b>fires</b> <b>concentration</b> proved to be mainly associated to coarse fuels with low seasonal NDVI variability; to the contrary, the fire hotspots resulted strictly correlated to fine fuels with high seasonal NDVI variability.

Significantly higher (t test, P < 0. 01) EFs (mu g kg(- 1) dry fuel, gas + particle-associated) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sigma(13) PAHs) were determined from the subtropical forest fire (7, 000 +/- 170) compared to the tropical savannah fires (1, 600 +/- 110), due to the approximately 60 -fold higher EFs for 3 -ring PAHs from the former. EF data for many PAHs from the eucalypt forest fire were comparable with those previously reported from pine and fir forest combustion events. EFs for other SVOCs including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), polychlorinated naphthalene (PCN), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners as well as some pesticides (e. g., permethrin) were determined from the subtropical eucalypt forest fire. The highest concentrations of total suspended particles, PAHs, PCBs, PCNs, and PBDEs, were typically observed in the flaming phase of combustion.

Water soluble organic and inorganic compounds in bulk (High Volume and Stacked Filter Unit sampler) and size-resolved (Micro Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor ?

It was found that low molecular weight polar organic acids account for a significant fraction of the water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in biomass burning aerosols (C 2 -C 6 dicarboxylic acids reached up to 3. 7 % and one-ring aromatic acids reached up to 2 % of fine fraction WSOC during burning period). Short dicarboxylic (C 2 -C 6) acids are dominated by oxalic acid followed by malonic and succinic acids. The largest ionic species is ammonium sulfate (60 ? 70 % of ionic mass).

40|$|An {{ensemble}} {{approach is}} {{used to examine the}} sensitivity of smoke loading and smoke direct radiative effect in the atmosphere to uncertainties in smoke emission estimates. Seven different fire emission inventories are applied independently to WRF-Chem model (v 3. 5) with the same model configuration (excluding dust and other emission sources) over the northern sub-Saharan African (NSSA) biomass-burning region. Results for November and February 2010 are analyzed, respectively representing the start and end of the biomass burning season in the study region. For February 2010, estimates of total smoke emission vary by a factor of 12, but only differences by factors of 7 or less are found in the simulated regional (15 degrees W- 42 degrees E, 13 degrees S- 17 degrees N) and monthly averages of column PM 2. 5 loading, surface PM 2. 5 concentration, aerosol optical depth (AOD), smoke radiative forcing at the top-of-atmosphere and at the surface, and air temperature at 2 m and at 700 hPa. The smaller differences in these simulated variables may reflect the atmospheric diffusion and deposition effects to dampen the large difference in smoke emissions that are highly concentrated in areas much smaller than the regional domain of the study. Indeed, at the local scale, large differences (up to a factor of 33) persist in simulated smoke-related variables and radiative effects including semi-direct effect. Similar results are also found for November 2010, despite differences in meteorology and fire activity. Hence, biomass burning emission uncertainties have a large influence on the reliability of model simulations of atmospheric aerosol loading, transport, and radiative impacts, and this influence is largest at local and hourly-to-daily scales.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the Environmental Incident Service of the RIVM has {{measured}} the levels of hazardous airborne compounds and deposited particles at more than fifty major fires. These data have been systematically classified {{with the aim of}} determining the types and levels of hazardous compounds released in fires of specific materials, such as plastics, wood and chemical waste. Literature data from incineration experiments and field measurements carried out near fires were also used. The results of this study are summarized in a concise and practical table that gives the types and amounts of substances, both gaseous and particle bound, released in fires of certain materials. The table can be used by fire brigades and environmental measuring services to determine the appropriate measuring strategy for fires and to make a risk assessment of people exposed to the smoke. The study shows that all fires generate substantial amounts of the common combustion products, including carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and fine particles. Other components are only released from the combustion of specific materials - for example, hydrogen chloride and dioxins from the combustion of polyvinyl chloride. Ambient air concentrations of emitted compounds are always increased downwind of the fire, even up to a few hundred meters from the source. This does not, however, imply by definition that those people exposed run enhanced health risks. At distances of 1 km or more from the <b>fire</b> <b>concentrations</b> are at a normal level, or only slightly elevated. The deposition of particles emitting from fires - with the exception of very large fires or special fires - barely results in any environmental contamination.

Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring {{is critical for}} public and environmental health protection; however, ground-level measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) – a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and in-house fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM 2. 5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide time-resolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via Short Message Service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided {{in the selection of}} battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum. Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed <b>fire.</b> Aerosol mass <b>concentrations</b> were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>fire.</b> Strong <b>concentration</b> gradients were observed (spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e. g. mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP 2 Y 1023 AU 0 F) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision...|$|R
