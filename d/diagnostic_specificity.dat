2500|$|The {{issue of}} modality-specificity {{has led to}} {{considerable}} debate among experts in this field. [...] Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should {{be defined as a}} modality-specific perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss. They criticise more inclusive conceptualizations of APD as lacking <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity.</b> A requirement for modality-specificity could potentially avoid including children whose poor auditory performance is due to general factors such as poor attention or memory. Others, however, have argued that a modality-specific approach is too narrow, and that it would miss children who had genuine perceptual problems affecting both visual and auditory processing. It is also impractical, as audiologists {{do not have access to}} standardized tests that are visual analogs of auditory tests. The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail auditory tests for reasons other than poor auditory processing. Although modality-specific testing has been advocated for well over a decade, to date no tests have been published which would allow audiologists to perform a modality-specific evaluation (i.e., no clinical versions of visual analogs to auditory processing tests exist).|$|E

50|$|Biomarker {{specificity}} {{is another}} consideration with saliva testing, {{much as it}} is with blood or urine testing. Many biomarkers are nonspecific (for example, CRP is a nonspecific inflammatory marker), and thus they can not be used alone to diagnose any particular disease. This issue is currently being addressed through identification of multiple biomarkers that are correlative of a disease; these can then be screened concomitantly to create a comprehensive panel of tests that significantly increases <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity.</b> Of note, certain types of saliva testing are {{considered by many to be}} more specific than blood testing; this is particularly true for steroid hormones. Since salivary hormone tests measure only those hormones that are not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or albumin, they are regarded as reflecting only the bioactive (“free”) fraction. With continued research into the field of salivary testing, accuracy parameters such as sensitivity and specificity will continue to improve.|$|E
5000|$|A {{urogenital}} pelvic malignancy is {{a regional}} {{lymph node involvement}} in urogenital malignancies (category N in the TNM classification system) is a significant radiologic finding, with important implications for treatment and prognosis. Male urogenital pelvic cancers commonly spread to iliopelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes by following pathways of normal lymphatic drainage from the pelvic organs. The most likely pathway of nodal spread (superficial inguinal, pelvic, or paraaortic) depends on the tumour location in the prostate, penis, testes, or bladder and whether surgery or other therapy has disrupted normal lymphatic drainage from the tumour site; knowledge of both factors is needed for accurate disease staging. At present, lymph node status is most often assessed with standard anatomic imaging techniques such as multidetector computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the detection of nodal disease with these techniques is reliant on lymph node size and morphological characteristics, criteria that provide limited <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity.</b> Functional imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI performed {{with or without a}} lymphotropic contrast agent and positron emission tomography, may allow a more accurate nodal assessment based on molecular or physiologic activity [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of autoantibodies {{is a primary}} diagnostic marker for the diagnosis of some autoimmune diseases. The sera of patients with connective tissue diseases commonly contain autoantibodies that target nuclear antigens. As such these antibodies are called antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). Furthermore, the clinical {{identification of}} ANAs in patient sera to specific nuclear antigens is a primary tool for the diagnosis of connective tissue diseases. For this purpose specific extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) are used. The most commonly employed laboratory technique {{for the detection of}} ENA antibodies is the enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). ELISA is a simple technique that can be automated and provides high diagnostic sensitivity for the detection of ENA antibodies comparatively to a counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) assay. However, compared to CIE ELISA lacks <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity.</b> Therefore there is a demand for an assay with high <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity</b> as a secondary diagnostic test for the detection of ENA antibodies. The central aim of this project was to develop and validate a novel CIE assay that used fluorescently labelled ENAs to detect ENA antibodies in patient serum. Development of the assay began with comparative testing of fluorescently labelled and unlabelled antigens to confirm that the immunochemical properties of the antigen remained intact. The CIE assay conditions were optimised for the detection of four ANAs SSA, SSB, RNP/Sm, and Sm using their corresponding ENAs. Assay conditions optimised were flurophore type, gel composition, buffer composition, antigen concentration, the running time, and analytical specificity. Evaluation of 281 clinical sera samples known to have previously tested positive test by ANA indirect immunofluorescence were performed using the optimised CIE assay and ELISA. The inter-rater agreement between the CIE assay and ELISA results was determined. Clinical details were used to retrospectively classify the clinical sera samples into clinical categories and case groups. This data was used for the diagnostic comparison of the CIE assay and ELISA results. There was strong inter-rater agreement between the SSA CIE assay and ELISA results. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity</b> and positive likelihood ratio values of the SSA CIE assay were superior to those of the ELISA, while diagnostic sensitivity and the negative likelihood ratio values were approximately the same. There was strong inter-rater agreement between the RNP/Sm CIE assay and ELISA. However, it was observed that the statistical measures of assay accuracy (<b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity</b> and sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio) for the RNP/Sm ELISA were superior to those of CIE assay. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>specificity</b> of the SSB and Sm CIE assays were higher than that of their respective ELISAs. This was also true for the positive likelihood ratio values of the SSB and Sm CIE assays when compared to their respect ELISAs. The SSA CIE assay results suggest that this assay maybe a suitable replacement for ELISA as a diagnostic tool for the identification of anti-SSA antibodies and Sjogren’s syndrome. The SSB and Sm CIE assay results suggest that these assays would be suitable as secondary confirmatory diagnostic assays for the identification of their respective ENA antibodies. However, further performance evaluation of the assays within a routine diagnostic laboratory is required...|$|E

Study Design and Setting: A prospective {{study was conducted in}} which 300 consecutive patients with cough of at least 2 -weeks duration were evaluated at a tertiary healthcare facility. We compared the estimates of TB prevalence and the di-agnostic accuracy of fever, haemoptysis, sputum smear microscopy, radiological signs, and HIV infection as generated by a latent class analysis (LCA) with those given by culture and by a composite reference standard (CRS), which relied on bacteriological confirmation and/or cavities. Results: LCA estimated the prevalence of TB at 44 %. The most sensitive characteristics were fever (90 %) and HIV infec-tion (86 %), but both lacked specificity. The most specific characteristics were microscopy (99 %), X-Ray cavities (97 %) and apical infiltrates (93 %). When culture was taken as a reference standard, the prevalence was 38 %; for the CRS, it was 45 %. For both, the <b>diagnostic</b> sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> were comparable to those obtained with LCA.
