5|$|A {{data packet}} {{consists}} of the PID followed by 0–1,024bytes of <b>data</b> <b>payload</b> (up to 1,024bytes for high-speed devices, up to 64bytes for full-speed devices, and at most eightbytes for low-speed devices), and a 16-bit CRC.|$|E
25|$|Video payload (as well as {{ancillary}} <b>data</b> <b>payload)</b> may use any 10-bit word in {{the range}} 4 to 1,019 (004 to 3FB) inclusive; the values 0–3 and 1,020–1,023 (3FC–3FF) are reserved and may not appear anywhere in the payload. These reserved words have two purposes; they are used both for Synchronization packets and for Ancillary data headers.|$|E
25|$|Uncompressed digital {{component}} signals are transmitted. Data is encoded in NRZI format, and a linear feedback shift register {{is used to}} scramble the data to reduce the likelihood that long strings of zeroes or ones will be present on the interface. The interface is self-synchronizing and self-clocking. Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of ten ones followed by twenty zeroes (twenty ones followed by forty zeroes in HD); this bit pattern is not legal anywhere else within the <b>data</b> <b>payload.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} SMPTE 349M: Transport of Alternate Source Image Formats through SMPTE 292M, specifies a {{means to}} encapsulate non-standard and lower-bitrate video formats within an HD-SDI interface. This standard allows, for example, several independent standard definition video signals to be multiplexed onto an HD-SDI interface, and transmitted down one wire. This standard doesn't merely adjust EAV and SAV timing {{to meet the requirements}} of the lower-bitrate formats; instead, it provides a means by which an entire SDI format (including synchronization words, ancillary data, and video payload) can be encapsulated and transmitted as ordinary <b>data</b> <b>payload</b> within a 292M stream.|$|E
25|$|Like SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M {{supports}} the SMPTE 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; {{it is used}} for things such as embedded audio, closed captions, timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary <b>data</b> <b>payload.</b>|$|E

SSC clock and 300ppm precision is used. Packet headers are protected with CRC-16, while <b>data</b> <b>payload</b> is protected with CRC-32. Power up to 3.6W may be used.

50|$|A {{little more}} {{is known about}} the new {{navigation}} message, which is called MNAV. Similar to the new CNAV, this new MNAV is packeted instead of framed, allowing for very flexible <b>data</b> <b>payloads.</b> Also like CNAV it can utilize Forward Error Correction (FEC) and advanced error detection (such as a CRC).|$|R

50|$|This encoder {{implementation}} sends three sub-blocks of bits. The first sub-block is the m-bit {{block of}} <b>payload</b> <b>data.</b> The second sub-block is n/2 parity bits for the <b>payload</b> <b>data,</b> computed using a recursive systematic convolutional code (RSC code). The third sub-block is n/2 parity bits for a known permutation of the <b>payload</b> <b>data,</b> again computed using an RSC code. Thus, two redundant but different sub-blocks of parity bits are sent with the payload. The complete block has m + n bits of data with a code rate of m/(m + n).

High <b>data</b> <b>payloads</b> were also achieved. The simulation results obtained were in total agreement with the requirements set by IFPI for audio watermarking, thus proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.|$|R
