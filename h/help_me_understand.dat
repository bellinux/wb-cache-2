[...] Garrett on Michael's anger towards Carly. With the announcement of Garrett's casting, many questioned how the character would return to the canvas. Michael finally wakes up on May 18, 2009, with cousin Lulu Spencer (Julie Marie Berman) at his bedside. The now 17-year-old Michael must battle significant health complications before becoming a [...] "normal" [...] teenager. After a risky surgery to keep Michael from slipping into a persistent vegetative state, Michael wakes up. Garrett explained that while Michael healed physically, his mental and emotional health would cause drama. Because Michael and his adoptive half-sister Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth) have very little contact growing up, the writers considered developing a romance between the two. Garrett believed that if either of them were to develop feelings, it would be Kristina, as Michael is too preoccupied with his recovery. Michael is immediately angry with Carly for not being present when he opens his eyes, and believes she is trying to replace him by having another child. The storyline also allows for further development of Michael's relationship with Jason, who also suffered from a brain injury when he was a little older than Michael. Jason becomes Michael's confidant. The story also featured a guest appearance on the June 29, 2009 episode from then Arizona Diamondbacks Outfielder, Connor Jackson, as Michael's physical therapist.|$|E
