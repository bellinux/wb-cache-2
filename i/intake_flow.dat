50|$|On 18 November 2015, Autoblog {{reported}} that a VW fix for the affected 1.6 diesel engine is under review by the KBA. On 25 November 2015, VW said the fix involves a minor hardware modification to the car's air intake system, alongside a software update. This low-cost solution contradicted earlier speculation regarding the possible fitting of new injection nozzles and catalytic converters. VW also said that its affected 1.2 liter and 2.0 liter diesel engines only need a software update. The fixes have {{been approved by the}} KBA, with the first recalls likely to begin in January 2016. According to VW, the measures aim to achieve legal EU emissions compliance without impairing engine output, fuel consumption, or performance. The simple fixes with inexpensive parts and software are now possible but were not available when the engines were developed, because engine technology understanding and <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> simulation capabilities have matured in the interim time, allowing for a better understanding and options for addressing the burning of Diesel and air mixtures via <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> shaping.|$|E
50|$|Also, the splayed valve angle {{causes the}} valve seat plane to be tilted, giving a straighter flow path for the {{intake and exhaust}} to/from the port exiting the {{cylinder}} head. Engineers have learned that while increasing the valve size with straighter port is beneficial for increasing the maximum power at high rpm, it slows the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> speed, not providing the best combustion event for emissions, efficiency, or power in the normal rpm range.|$|E
50|$|This stratified-charge {{approach}} to lean-burn combustion {{means that the}} air-fuel ratio isn't equal throughout the cylinder. Instead, precise control over fuel injection and <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> dynamics allows a greater concentration of fuel closer to the spark plug tip (richer), which is required for successful ignition and flame spread for complete combustion. The remainder of the cylinders' intake charge is progressively leaner with an overall average air:fuel ratio falling into the lean-burn category of up to 22:1.|$|E

40|$|Turbulent {{flows in}} a {{powerhouse}} intake are investigated using computational fluid dynamics. Some intakes present severe hydraulic conditions, with strong spatial variations {{in both the}} mean flow and the turbulence. Such conditions can make determining an appropriate sampling strategy difficult for any instrument measuring <b>intake</b> <b>flows.</b> It can also, in some cases, cause systematic errors in Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM) velocity measurements. Successful numerical modelling of the <b>flow</b> in the <b>intake</b> {{can be used to}} plan a measurement program. The numerical model {{can also be used to}} estimate bias, which may occur in ASFM measurements as a result of such difficult conditions.

50|$|Air {{entered the}} engine through a {{conventional}} air <b>intake,</b> <b>flow</b> splitting {{after the initial}} guide vanes to the compressor inside and the ducted fan outside, with a by-pass ratio of approximately 2.45:1. The compressor consisted of seventeen stages of blading, eight carried on the inner drum, rotating at full engine speed, and nine on the outer drum which rotated {{in the opposite direction}} at 0.5:1 engine speed. Although extremely complicated mechanically, a compressor efficiency of 80% was expected with a very credible pressure ratio of 8:1. For comparison, typical engines of the era offered pressure ratios on the order of 3.5:1.|$|E

50|$|Some other {{supersonic}} aircraft (Eurofighter Typhoon) use a variable lower cowl lip for high {{angle of attack}} operation and a bleed system (porous wall) incorporated on the intake ramp to facilitate stabilization of the shock system at supersonic Mach numbers. For {{the improvement of the}} <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> (reduced distortion), air is dumped via an intake bleed slot on the ramp side downstream of the intake. The ramp, which is separated from the fuselage by a diverter, produces an oblique shock in order to decelerate the flow. The leading edge of the splitter plate separating the two intakes is located downstream of this oblique shock.|$|E
50|$|In typical {{combustion}} engines found in vehicles, the torque is low at idling speed, reaches a maximal value between 1,500 and 6,500 RPM, and then falls {{more or less}} sharply toward the redline. Below the RPM of maximal torque, the compression is not ideal. Above this speed several factors start to limit the torque, such as growing friction, the required time for closing the valves and combustion, and insufficient <b>intake</b> <b>flow.</b> Due to increasing vibration and heat, an external RPM limitation may also be installed. Power {{is the product of}} torque multiplied by speed of rotation (analogous to force times speed), so peak power is produced in the upper speed range where there's both high torque and high RPM.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{too small}} to swim against the current or make it past the louvers are guided and {{collected}} in four steps. In the first step, the fish follow the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> from Clifton Court Forebay where a floating trash boom and trash rack divert larger fish and trash away from the intake channel. The second step utilizes large metal louvers to cause rippling in the water, which creates a turbulence that the smaller fish avoid and swim away into bypass pipes. In the third step, the bypass pipe takes the fish through series of secondary louvers and screens which lead to a secondary channel which separates the fish into a manageable amount of water. By the fourth and final step, the fish are placed into seven 20-foot diameter concrete tanks that each hold 10 to 12 feet of water. Once the fish are in the tanks, they are identified, counted, and measured before being transported back upstream via trucks.|$|E

50|$|Some devices {{claim to}} improve {{efficiency}} {{by changing the}} way that liquid fuel is converted to vapor. These include fuel heaters and devices to increase or decrease turbulence in the intake manifold.

50|$|A RCC {{cylindrical}} intake well of 5 m {{diameter and}} 4m height has been installed nearly 600 m {{from the shore}} {{at a depth of}} 9 m. A stainless steel screen sits atop the well. The sea water intake pipeline enters the well at the bottom. The HDPE pipeline is 1,600 mm in diameter. It was welded using butt fusion welding machines on the shore before being floated out to the sea and being sunk along the required alignment. The pipeline empties the water into a sea water intake sump on the shore where 3 vertical turbine pumps of variable discharge up to a maximum of 4,000 cum/hr each are used to pump water into the plant. The average <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> is 9,000 to 10,000 cum/hr, and the average product water output of the plant is about 4,000 cum/hr. The system is designed to work as a self-priming suction for sea water intake.|$|E
50|$|The {{permeate}} is {{a concentrated}} mixture {{that must be}} diluted with additional air prior to entering the nitrox compressor. It exits the membrane at ambient to slightly negative pressure and travels into the mixing tube, where it mixes homogeneously with filtered outside air. The amount of dilution, and thus the final percentage of O2, is obtained by adjusting the Input Pressure Regulator. As pressure is increased, permeate flow increases, air flow decreases, and {{a higher percentage of}} O2 nitrox is produced. As pressure is decreased, permeate flow decreases, air flow increases, and a lower percentage of O2 nitrox is produced. This relationship between permeate flow and air flow exists because the total of these two flow rates will always equal the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> rate demanded by the nitrox compressor. The resulting nitrox mixture is analyzed for its approximate percentage of O2 before entering the nitrox compressor and again prior to usage to determine the precise percentage of O2.|$|E
5000|$|In some engines {{the intake}} runners are {{straight}} for minimal resistance. In most engines, however, the runners have curves...and some very convoluted to achieve desired runner length.

In an engine with at least six cylinders the averaged <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> is nearly constant and the plenum volume can be smaller. To avoid standing waves within the plenum it is made as compact as possible. The intake runners each use a smaller part of the plenum surface than the inlet, which supplies air to the plenum, for aerodynamic reasons. Each runner is placed to have nearly the same distance to the main inlet. Runners whose cylinders fire close after each other, are not placed as neighbors.|$|E
40|$|In this {{investigation}} the hydrodynamic and the thermal fields {{due to a}} single impinging jet in cross-flow have been investigated numerically, using a 2 -D axisymmetric model in order to predict the ground vortex characteristics. The parameters investigated include the effective velocity ratio, the nozzle height, the nozzle pressure ratio, the intake location, the <b>intake</b> mass <b>flow</b> rate and the jet temperature ratio. It {{is interesting to note}} that even with the 2 -D modeling limitations it was possible to capture most of the thermal and fluid field characteristics of the ground vortex. It was found that the temperature distribution in the flow field is greatly affected by the effective velocity, and the maximum penetration point of the ground vortex is equal to the hot gas penetration. The ground vortex strength increases slightly with increasing the <b>intake</b> mass <b>flow</b> rate but has a minor effect on the ground vortex geometry and on the penetration of the hot gases. The intake location has a significant effect on the ground vortex strength when it is located upstream of the ground vortex core.
