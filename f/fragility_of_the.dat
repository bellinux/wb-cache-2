5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to the <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E
5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, the Dutch {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies <b>the</b> {{time-dependent}} seismic <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> {{reinforced concrete}} bridges with chloride induced corrosion under spatially varying ground motions. <b>The</b> time-varying characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chloride corrosion current density and the uncertainties {{related to the}} structural, material and corrosion parameters are both considered in the probabilistic finite element modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> example RC bridge at different time steps during its life-cycle.

Seismic <b>fragility</b> curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corroded RC bridge at different time steps are generated using the probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) method.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Fragility</b> {{fractures}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip (FFH) {{constitute the}} most serious complication of osteoporosis carrying a mortality rate of up to 20 – 30 % {{in the first year}} after injury and are associated with post injury decay in patient's level of activity in more than 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases. It is also a predictor of future osteoporosis related fractures. Surgical fixation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip fracture within 48 of admission, multimodal pain management, deep vein thrombo-prophylaxis, early physical therapy, appropriate assessment and management of osteoporosis and frailty in a multidisciplinary approach are <b>the</b> standard <b>of</b> care for FFH to keep the mortality and morbidity rate as low as possible and prevent future fragility fractures. Aim: To assess <b>the</b> standard <b>of</b> care of FFH at our institution and determine areas of care which need more attention and improvement. Methods: Retrospective review of clinical and radiographic records of all patients admitted at our level 1 trauma unit for <b>fragility</b> fracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip from 1 st January 2014 to 31 st December 2014. The waiting time from admission to surgical fixation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip fracture, pain control and thrombo-prophylaxis strategies, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> geriatric referrals and <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> osteoporosis management were assessed. Results: We admitted 113 <b>fragility</b> fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip from 1 st January to 31 st December 2014. Ninety- eight clinical records and 98 pelvis radiographs were included in the study. The other 15 clinical records were incomplete and were therefore excluded. The average waiting time from admission to surgery was 49 hours (range 9 - 120). Low dose morphine, paracetamol and tramadol were the only perioperative pain control medication used for all patients. All patients had low molecular weight heparin and compression stockings prescribed for thrombo-prophylaxis. Only 2 (2, 04 %) of patients had some osteoporosis investigations ordered. There were no geriatric referrals made and no formal osteoporosis management in all reviewed records. Conclusion: While the waiting time from admission to surgery was largely within the recommended time frame, there were no signs of a multidisciplinary approach to <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip at our institution leaving osteoporosis and frailty largely untreated...|$|R

25|$|An {{iridescent}} opal-like play {{of color}} {{is shown in}} fine specimens, mostly in shades of green and red; all the spectral colors are possible, however. The iridescence {{is due to the}} microstructure of the aragonite: unlike most other gems, whose colors come from light absorption, the iridescent color of ammolite comes from interference with the light that rebounds from stacked layers of thin platelets that make up the aragonite. The thicker the layers, the more reds and greens are produced; the thinner the layers, the more blues and violets predominate. Reds and greens are the most commonly seen colors, owing to the greater <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finer layers responsible for the blues. When freshly quarried, these colors are not especially dramatic; the material requires polishing and possibly other treatments in order to reveal the colors' full potential.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

30|$|The {{obtained}} fragilities {{indicate that}} the fragility curves for the unrepaired scenario almost overlaps the repaired cases under the slight damage state, where <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> damage is somewhat negligible (i.e., the damage state is cosmetic and repairable, and <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> bar buckling did not occur). All <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> curves irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repair jacket material, intensity of seismic sequences (i.e., severe MS-severe AS or severe MS-moderate AS) and earthquake type (i.e., far-fault and near-fault) indicate <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> difference (shift) between <b>fragilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unrepaired and repaired bridge as the damage state progresses. While Fig.  13 a, e (similarly, Fig.  14 a, e) clearly {{indicate that the}} fragility curves for the unrepaired bridge almost overlaps the repaired bridge under the minor damage state, the unrepaired bridge’s vulnerability is significantly larger than the repaired bridge for the extensive and collapse damage states (Figs.  13 c, d, g, h, 14 c, d, g, h). For instance, given <b>the</b> same probability <b>of</b> damage under <b>the</b> collapse damage state, <b>the</b> associated Sa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unrepaired bridge is significantly less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repaired bridge, irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repair jacket material.
