As a result, we got correlation coefficients and we made clear what factors influence the demand and supply of welfare services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> So we could understand <b>the</b> situation <b>in</b> municipalities where <b>the</b> welfare service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> is demanded, and supplied.

The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E

The cost of basic obstetric care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and <b>in</b> a facility was very similar, although care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> was cheaper. Deliveries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> took more time but this was offset by the capital costs associated with facility-based care. As use-rates increase, deliveries in a facility will become cheaper. Antenatal and postnatal care was much cheaper to provide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> facility than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Facility-based delivery care {{is likely to be}} a cheaper and more feasible method for the care provider as demand rises.

One solution is to implement video surveillance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of this phenomenological, retrospective and prospective study was to describe the perceptions and experiences of caregivers that affect stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> care setting and to describe participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about the impact of video surveillance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> environment on caregiver stress and elder abuse. Using a lens of critical ecological framework and privacy theory, the research questions inquired about the specific experiences of stress and the perceptions of <b>the</b> use of <b>home</b> surveillance of caregivers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> A sample of 9 older adult home caregivers were recruited from the United Jewish Council of <b>the</b> East Side <b>Home</b> Attendant Service Corp. Findings revealed that increased family, community, and agency involvement and support may offset the feelings of isolation of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> care environment and ensure the caregiver is given opportunities to engage in strategies designed to help cope with the inherent stressors of <b>the</b> job. <b>In</b> addition, video camera surveillance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> care setting may provide social support through observation of <b>the</b> situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> supporting both social control on the behavior of the caregiver and direct evidence of quality of care for the caregiver.

The staff time required for home administration was calculated from actual <b>home</b> visits. <b>The</b> cost of tablet computers and mobile Internet charges for double-checks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> was based on an assumed useful life of 3 years for the equipment. The cost of outsourcing the preparation of medications was calculated from the actual cost of doing so during a four month period. Patient outcome was assumed to be <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> all three scenarios. The mean costs of a medication episode (i. e. one occasion of medication administration) was $ 129. 91 in scenario A, $ 312. 00 in scenario B and $ 355. 91 in scenario C. Nurse preparation and administration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> would save <b>the</b> oncology health service $ 124, 899 per annum compared to outsourcing medication preparation.
