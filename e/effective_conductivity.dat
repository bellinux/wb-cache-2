40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{is one of}} the key {{material properties}} to understand the effective thermo-mechanical behavior of advanced composites. Experimental studies show that when highly conductive inclusions are embedded in a less thermally conductive matrix, the <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of the composite changes drastically with the increase of volume fraction (Vf) of the inclusions. This study presents a theoretical model to predict the <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of two-phase particulate composites containing highly conductive inclusions in a polymeric matrix. The probabilistic approach presented by Tsao (1961) has been modified and extended for predicting the <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of two-phase composites. The expression for the <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of a unit cube of two-phase composite is derived implicitly in terms of distribution function, Vf and thermal conductivity of the constituents.

40|$|In situ {{planetary}} <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> {{measurements are}} typically made using a long needle-like probe, which measures <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> in the probe‟s radial (horizontal) direction. The desired <b>effective</b> vertical thermal <b>conductivity</b> for heat flow calculations {{is assumed to}} be the same as the measured <b>effective</b> horizontal thermal <b>conductivity.</b> However, it is known that <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> increases with increasing compressive pressure on granular beds and horizontal stress in a granular bed under gravity is related to the vertical stress through Jaky‟s at-rest earth pressure coefficient. No research has been performed previously on determining the anisotropic <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of dry granular beds under compressive uniaxial pressure. The objectives of this study were to examine the validity of the isotropic property assumption and to develop a fundamental understanding of the <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of a dry, noncohesive granular bed under uniaxial compression. Two experiments were developed to simultaneously measure the effective vertical and horizontal thermal conductivities of particle beds. One measured <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivities</b> in an atmosphere of air. The second measured <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivities</b> in a vacuum environment. Measurements were made as compressive vertical pressure was increased to show the relationship between increasing pressure and effective vertical and horizontal thermal conductivity. The results of this experiment show quantitatively the conductivity anisotropy for different materials. Based on the <b>effective</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> models in the literature and results of the two experiments, a simple model was derived to predict the increase in effective vertical and horizontal thermal conductivity with increasing compressive vertical applied pressure of a granular bed immersed in a static fluid. In order to gain a greater understanding of the anisotropic phenomenon, finite element simulations were performed for a vacuum environment. Based on the results of the finite element simulations, the simple derived model was modified to better approximate a vacuum environment. The experimental results from the two experiments performed in this study were used to validate both the initial simple model and the modified model.

50|$|Hard line {{is used in}} {{broadcasting}} {{as well as many}} other forms of radio communication. It is a coaxial cable constructed using round copper, silver or gold tubing or a combination of such metals as a shield. Some lower-quality hard line may use aluminum shielding, aluminum however is easily oxidized and unlike silver oxide, aluminum oxide drastically loses <b>effective</b> <b>conductivity.</b> Therefore, all connections must be air and water tight. The center conductor may consist of solid copper, or copper-plated aluminum. Since skin effect is an issue with RF, copper plating provides sufficient surface for an effective conductor. Most varieties of hardline used for external chassis or when exposed to the elements have a PVC jacket; however, some internal applications may omit the insulation jacket. Hard line can be very thick, typically at least a half inch or 13 mm and up to several times that, and has low loss even at high power. These large-scale hard lines are almost always used in the connection between a transmitter on the ground and the antenna or aerial on a tower. Hard line may also be known by trademarked names such as Heliax (CommScope), or Cablewave (RFS/Cablewave). Larger varieties of hardline may have a center conductor that is constructed from either rigid or corrugated copper tubing. The dielectric in hard line may consist of polyethylene foam, air, or a pressurized gas such as nitrogen or desiccated air (dried air). In gas-charged lines, hard plastics such as nylon are used as spacers to separate the inner and outer conductors. The addition of these gases into the dielectric space reduces moisture contamination, provides a stable dielectric constant, and provides a reduced risk of internal arcing. Gas-filled hardlines are usually used on high-power RF transmitters such as television or radio broadcasting, military transmitters, and high-power amateur radio applications but may also be used on some critical lower-power applications such as those in the microwave bands. However, in the microwave region, waveguide is more often used than hard line for transmitter-to-antenna, or antenna-to-receiver applications. The various shields used in hardline also differ; some forms use rigid tubing, or pipe, others may use a corrugated tubing, which makes bending easier, as well as reduces kinking when the cable is bent to conform. Smaller varieties of hard line may be used internally in some high-frequency applications, in particular in equipment within the microwave range, to reduce interference between stages of the device.|$|E
