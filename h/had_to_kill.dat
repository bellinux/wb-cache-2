5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
25|$|Today the Komondor is {{a fairly}} common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories {{say that this is}} because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.|$|E

He wore thick black rimmed glasses, making people believe he couldn't see without them, when in truth he could see everything {{that was going on}} and would take mental notes on how people operated.|$|E

25|$|The main deity in the Mexica {{religion}} was the sun god and war god, Huitzilopochtli. He directed the Mexicas {{to found a}} city on the site where they would see an eagle, devouring (not all chronicles agree on what the eagle was devouring, one {{says it was a}} precious bird, and though Father Duran says it was a snake, this is not mentioned in any pre-Hispanic source) perched on a fruit bearing nopal cactus. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> his nephew, Cópil, and throw his heart on the lake. But, since Cópil was his relative, Huitzilopochtli decided to honor him, and caused cactus to grow over Cópil's heart which became a sacred place.|$|E
25|$|Henry and the trappers bivouacked {{across the}} Continental Divide at a {{temporary}} trading {{post on the}} north fork of the Snake River, now known as Henry's Fork in present-day Idaho. When hunting at the new post did not yield enough food, the trappers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> their horses and subsist primarily on horse flesh. In the spring of 1811, the group dissolved when some members headed south toward Spanish territory and others (such as Andrew Henry) headed east toward the Missouri River valley and St. Louis. The first trade and trapping expedition of the Missouri Fur Company failed to supply the company with furs and resulted in their abandonment of Fort Lisa on the Yellowstone River.|$|E
25|$|The Gesta Danorum also {{agrees with}} Beowulf in {{presenting}} Hrothgar (Ro) and Halga (Helgo) as brothers and {{the sons of}} Healfdene (Haldanus). Moroever, like the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, it presents Hroðulf (Roluo) {{as the son of}} Halga and his own daughter. A striking difference is that the Swedish king Eadgils (Athisl) is pushed forward a generation, and instead Saxo introduces Hrothgar's killer Hothbrodd as the father of Eadgils, a place that other sources give to Ohthere. A similar piece of information is also found in the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, where Halga <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> a man named Hodbrod to win all of Denmark. However, Saxo also adds the god Höðr as the brother of Eadgils in order to present a euhemerized version of the Baldr myth, later.|$|E

25|$|Although the Goons {{elevated}} Milligan {{to international}} stardom, {{the demands of}} writing and performing the series took a heavy toll. During Series 3 he suffered {{the first of several}} serious mental breakdowns, which also marked the onset of a decades-long cycle of manic-depressive illness. In late 1952, possibly exacerbated by suppressed tensions between the Goons' stars, Milligan apparently became irrationally convinced that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Sellers but when he attempted to gain entry to Sellers's neighbouring flat, armed with a potato knife, he accidentally walked straight through the plate-glass front door. He was hospitalised, heavily sedated for two weeks and spent almost two months recuperating; fortunately for the show, a backlog of scripts meant that his illness had little effect on production. Milligan later blamed the pressure of writing and performing The Goon Show, for both his breakdown and the failure of his first marriage.|$|E
25|$|However, {{early in}} Deathly Hallows, Tonks announces {{that she has}} {{recently}} married Remus Lupin. Tonks accompanies twelve Order members to take Harry from the Dursleys' home to The Burrow. She flies with Ron, who impersonates Harry using Polyjuice Potion to throw the Death Eaters off the real Harry's trail. During the aerial battle, Tonks fights Bellatrix again, and injures Bellatrix's husband, Rodolphus. Later in the book, Remus reveals Tonks is pregnant. He leaves her for a brief period, believing that he, through their marriage, has caused her to become an outcast and their unborn child {{would be better off}} without him, but changes his mind and returns to her side after a heated argument with Harry. In April of the seventh book, Tonks gives birth to Teddy Remus Lupin, named after her father and husband. Towards the end of the book, Tonks and Lupin join the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Tonks is killed by Bellatrix, and Lupin is killed by Antonin Dolohov, leaving Teddy an orphan to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Andromeda. In an interview shortly after the release of Deathly Hallows, Rowling confessed that she had originally intended for Tonks and Lupin to survive the series ending, but felt that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them after she spared Arthur Weasley in Order of the Phoenix. Tonks' killer, Bellatrix is in turn killed by Molly.|$|E

[...] Although Dylan becomes a murderer {{at the beginning of the}} story, Brubaker hopes the character's plight is sympathetic enough that readers will root for him. Dylan's arrangement with the demon has been interpreted as commentary on the War on Terror and the racially motivated violence publicised in the US in the two years prior to the book's publication.|$|E

With Gaara's sand adding to his inability to control Shukaku, the boy became feared to the point his father decided to have him assassinated. Gaara has the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, and that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> others in order to confirm the value of his own existence.

However, she felt that the drama seemed artificial and that the writers forced a situation where Worf <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> one of the Klingons as if [...] "justifying the brutality as necessary for the good of Starfleet". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] also thought that the drama with Worf deciding whether or not to join the Klingons was problematic. He thought {{it was hard to believe}} that the crew seemed to know Worf as little as they did at this point in the series, but praised it for being the starting point for all future Klingon-based stories in the franchise.

500|$|Stocked with {{provisions}} that included two guns, [...] of tobacco, [...] of flour, salt and pepper, biscuits and tea, the party travelled by mules and canoe {{for the first}} two weeks until they reached Buller River. They then followed the path of the river down to the coast. The journey was difficult; the party was constantly bothered by sandflies and rain and they had to ford the river several times. They settled into a routine of trekking for a week then camping for the same period to restock their provisions, living off freshwater fish and cabbage- and fern-tree roots. By May 1847, they were at the final reaches of the Buller but food was becoming so scarce to find, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Brunner's dog.

Other influences which helped to define Kain's character arc included The Wheel of Time, Necroscope, and cover art from The Pillars of the Earth. In comparison to Count Dracula, Dyack commented {{in an interview that he}} believed Kain would [...] "kick his ass" [...] in a fight. He and writer Ken McCulloch considered Simon Templeman's voiceover for the character superlative, despite initial apprehensions that the actors they had hired might not be able to convey the game's complicated dialogue.|$|E
