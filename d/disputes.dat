5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial <b>disputes</b> and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm <b>disputes</b> is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial <b>disputes</b> with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

The mechanism under GATT 1947 had many weaknesses which resulted to the need of reform. The procedure under GATT 1947 was not contradictory and {{all members of the}} <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Body (DSB) were entitled to use the veto right when adopting the reports. The contracting parties were conscious of such weaknesses and they have agreed on a new <b>dispute</b> settlement system during the Uruguay round. The <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Understanding (DSU) is part of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The new system remains inter-state mechanism and as a consequence, available only to the Member States, excluding individuals and business operators. The <b>dispute</b> settlement under WTO has become compulsory while leaving each member the choice between this standard procedure and other <b>dispute</b> modes, such as Good Offices, Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. The <b>dispute</b> settlement system has been unified and has become more judicial. It excludes national jurisdictions and means strengthening the multilateralism. The <b>dispute</b> settlement is administrated by the <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Body, [...] ...|$|R
