40|$|The {{complement}} {{system is a}} part of the innate immunity and is essential in the defence against microorganisms. Hereditary C 2 deficiency (C 2 D) is one of the most common complement deficiency states with an estimated prevalence of 1 : 20, 000 in persons of Western descent. In the present investigation, the identification of more than 40 C 2 <b>D</b> <b>persons</b> at a single centre combined with long observation periods provided a unique basis for assessment of C 2 D-associated manifestations and diseases. The predominant clinical manifestation was severe bacterial infections. The infections were mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Repeated infections occurred primarily during infancy and childhood. On the other hand, about 25 - 30 % of the C 2 <b>D</b> <b>persons</b> remained healthy during the observation period. Immunological factors as IgG subclass levels, GM allotypes, complement proteins, and Fc receptors were assessed to explain this difference. Homozygosity for the G 2 M*n allele was strongly associated with protection against severe infections (p< 0. 001). This indicated that an efficient antibody response to polysaccharide antigens is of great importance in C 2 D. Mannan-binding lectin deficiency also contributed to the susceptibility to infection. The association between C 2 D and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was confirmed, but notably the severity of SLE in patients with C 2 D was similar to that of other SLE patients. Another novel finding was a high occurrence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and antibodies to the collagen-like region of C 1 q. Both autoantibodies have a pro-atherosclerotic effect that might explain the high occurrence of cardiovascular disease found in the cohort. Interestingly, anti-phospholipid syndrome was not observed despite the high occurrence of aCL. Vaccination in 25 C 2 <b>D</b> <b>persons</b> resulted in antibody responses which show that C 2 <b>D</b> <b>persons</b> benefit from vaccination against infections caused by encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococci...|$|R

40|$|Real-time 3 <b>D</b> <b>person,</b> {{head and}} face {{tracking}} are critically important for natural interactions among humans in an intelligent environment. Trackers based on multiple networked cameras estimate human positions and heights more accurately and robustly than single camera or binocular trackers. The {{goal of this}} paper is to first present a comparative evaluation of two types of 3 D tracking systems, namely Omnidirectionaland Rectilinear- Video Array Trackers (VAT), then apply 3 D tracking to head and face tracking. The O-VAT uses N-ocular stereo algorithm to estimate the planar location of a person, and height is estimated using camera optical and geometrical properties. The networked omnicamera system then uses the 3 <b>D</b> <b>person</b> tracks to perform head and face tracking. The R-VAT uses a calibrated rectilinear camera network to estimate human location and height, and keeps track of human path by a Kalman filter. Extensive sets of experimental studies involving multiple people in a fully functional intelligent room are conducted. This allows comparative evaluation of the two different types of multicamera trackers operating in a common testbed. Performance of the two VATs is compared on accuracy, speed, computational complexity, robustness to environment, repeatability, calibration efficiency, and system reconfigurability. We also develop the necessary perspective transforms and active camera control algorithms for capturing and tracking faces of people who are walking or sitting in an intelligent room. An experimental evaluation study is presented to demonstrate the fully integrated person, head and face tracking system...|$|R

In this work, an occlusion robust method is presented based on two features: human centroid height relative to the ground and body velocity. Indeed, the first feature is an efficient solution to detect falls as the vast majority of falls ends on the ground or near the ground. However, this method can fail if the end of the fall is completely occluded behind furniture.

Here we {{show that}} HELQ participates in a pathway of resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Genetic disruption of HELQ in human cells enhances cellular sensitivity and chromosome radial formation by the ICL-inducing agent mitomycin C (MMC). A significant fraction of MMC sensitivity is independent of the Fanconi anaemia pathway. Sister chromatid exchange frequency and sensitivity to UV radiation or topoisomerase inhibitors is unaltered. Proteomic analysis reveals that HELQ {{is associated with the}} RAD 51 paralogs RAD 51 B/C/D and XRCC 2, and with the DNA damage-responsive kinase ATR. After treatment with MMC, reduced phosphorylation of the ATR substrate CHK 1 occurs in HELQ-knockout cells, and accumulation of G 2 /M cells is reduced. The results indicate that HELQ operates in an arm of DNA repair and signalling in response to ICL. Further, the association with RAD 51 paralogs suggests HELQ as a candidate ovarian cancer gene...|$|R

40|$|We {{pose the}} problem of 3 D human {{tracking}} as one of inference in a graphical model. Unlike traditional kinematic tree representations, our model {{of the body is}} a collection of loosely-connected limbs. Conditional probabilities relating the 3 D pose of connected limbs are learned from motioncaptured training data. Similarly, we learn probabilistic models for the temporal evolution of each limb (forward and backward in time). Human pose and motion estimation is then solved with non-parametric belief propagation using a variation of particle filtering that can be applied over a general loopy graph. The loose-limbed model and decentralized graph structure facilitate the use of low-level visual cues. We adopt simple limb and head detectors to provide "bottom-up" information that is incorporated into the inference process at every time-step; these detectors permit automatic initialization and aid recovery from transient tracking failures. We illustrate the method by automatically tracking a walking person in video imagery using four calibrated cameras. Our experimental apparatus includes a marker-based motion capture system aligned with the coordinate frame of the calibrated cameras with which we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our 3 <b>D</b> <b>person</b> tracker...|$|R
