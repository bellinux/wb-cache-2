25|$|A trigger pad could contain {{up to four}} {{independent}} sensors, each of them {{capable of}} sending information describing the timing and dynamic intensity of a stroke to the drum module/brain. A circular <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> may have only one sensor for triggering, but a 2016-era cymbal-shaped rubber pad/cymbal will often contain two; one for the body {{and one for the}} bell at the centre of the cymbal, and perhaps a cymbal choke trigger, to allow drummers to produce this effect.|$|E
25|$|An {{electronic}} drum, {{also known}} as electric drums, digital drums, or electronic percussion, is a modern electronic musical instrument, a special type of synthesizer or sampler, primarily designed {{to serve as an}} alternative to an acoustic drum kit or other percussion instruments. An electronic drum consists of an electronic or digital sound module which produces the synthesized or sampled percussion sounds and one or more electric sensors to trigger the sounds. Like regular drums, the sensors are struck by drum sticks or by the hands (depending on the type of <b>drum</b> <b>pad)</b> and they are played in a similar manner as an acoustic drum kit.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the {{instrument}} peripherals for World Tour were mixed. [...] The new touchpad on the guitar controller {{was found to be}} imprecise to make it difficult to use during difficult song sections and would sometimes fail to register taps or slides; some of these issues were attributed to initial manufacturing problems. [...] The drum kit has been praised for ease of set up, the <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> layout, and the response of the drums, though the lack of a means to fix the location of bass drum pedal was seen as a drawback when compared to the Rock Band drum kit.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero World Tour {{introduced}} {{drums and}} vocal tracks {{in addition to}} lead and bass guitar. [...] Drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks; the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line. [...] Certain note gems, when using a drum controller that is velocity-sensitive, are [...] "armored", requiring the player to hit the indicated <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> harder to score more points. [...] Vocal tracks are played similar to games such as Karaoke Revolution where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points. Guitar Hero 5 allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica, {{like other}} {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, allows players to {{simulate}} the playing of rock music using special instrument controllers. [...] The game {{is based on the}} band approach presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, and features parts of lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. To successfully complete songs and score, players must use the instruments to play notes that scroll on-screen in time with the music. For lead and bass guitar players, this is done by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar neck while striking a strum bar; for the drum players, this requires the player to strike the appropriate <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> or kick with the bass drum pedal; for vocals, the player must attempt to match the pitch of the notes through a microphone. Players earn scoring multipliers for playing several consecutive notes or phrases correctly, and by correctly completing marked phrases, players can earn Star Power which can be released for a higher scoring multiplier. If players miss too many notes, they will eventually fail the song and will have to retry it.|$|E
500|$|World Tour {{features}} a wireless six-piece drum kit, with a bass drum pedal and five velocity-sensitive drum pads, which Activision has stated provide the [...] "most realistic drum experience ever {{in a video}} game". Generally, the pads represent the snare drum (red), the tom-tom drum (blue), the floor tom (green), the hi-hat cymbal (yellow), and the crash cymbal (orange), however, {{they can be used}} for other percussion instruments depending on the song. The bass drum is represented by a purple, horizontal line on the highway, which players must the drum pedal to hit. The drum kit was designed with help from John Devacka, the developer of [...] MTV Drumscape, and developed key patents used for most modern music games that are now owned by Activision. [...] Special note gems on the drum track, representing accent notes, are [...] "armored", requiring the player to strike the corresponding drum head harder in order to break the armor and score more points. [...] During song creation, the velocity sensitivity feature of the <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> allows players to alter the sounds made by the drums. The drum set also has a MIDI input port in the back, allowing users to connect a compatible MIDI drum kit to play in the game. The Wii version of the drum controller includes a slot for the Wii Remote to fit into, enabling it to become wireless, much like the guitar controller introduced for the Wii version of Guitar Hero III.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first major}} update {{released}} on December 8, 2015 includes addition of [...] "variable breakneck speed" [...] which allows players {{to change the}} rate of scrolling notes on screen, and an auto bass-kick option that will remove the need for drum players to hit the bass pedal and focus only on the <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> notes. [...] "Brutal mode" [...] is a challenge mode where, as the player continues doing well on a song, the notes on the scrolling highway will disappear some time after they appear on it, but will {{still need to be}} played on time; the speed at which they disappear is based on how well the player is playing, and by clearing the song with what would normally be gold stars, the player earns [...] "Crimson Stars" [...] instead. A new [...] "Score Challenge" [...] gameplay mode will allow players to track what their friends are playing and then asynchronously challenge their scores on the same song, include light-hearted taunts should they win.|$|E

25|$|Electronic <b>drum</b> <b>pads</b> are {{the second}} most widely used type of MIDI {{performance}} controllers, after electronic music keyboards. Drum controllers may be built into drum machines, they may be standalone control surfaces (e.g., rubber <b>drum</b> <b>pads),</b> or they may emulate {{the look and feel}} of acoustic percussion instruments. The <b>pads</b> built into <b>drum</b> machines are typically too small and fragile to be played with sticks, and they are usually played with fingers. Dedicated <b>drum</b> <b>pads</b> such as the Roland Octapad or the DrumKAT are playable with the hands or with sticks, and are often built to resemble the general form of a drum kit. There are also percussion controllers such as the vibraphone-style MalletKAT, and Don Buchla's Marimba Lumina.|$|R

50|$|Many musicians {{have adapted}} drum and bass to live performances, which feature {{instruments}} such as drums (acoustic or electronic), samplers, synthesizers, turntables, bass (either upright or electric) and guitars (acoustic or electric).

50|$|While the band's {{earlier work}} varied between new wave and tongue-in-cheek garage rock, Harris and Henderson focused their sound {{during this period}} on imagery-filled {{psychedelic}} pop, and began to incorporate appropriate effects and instruments such as the Theremin into their sound.

5000|$|The {{first product}} {{to come out}} of KMI Labs is the BopPad, an {{expressive}} MIDI <b>drum</b> <b>pad</b> controller for percussionists, and producers that is the world's most responsive smart <b>drum</b> <b>pad.</b> The Kickstarter campaign for the BopPad reached its funding goal in three days. It advances accurate hit detection via velocity, continuous radius, and pressure sensitivity with an extremely quick playing surface. BopPad's advanced architecture allows for an annovative instrument that [...] "sees" [...] every gesture, hit or tap and responds to the nuances of any percussive performance, perfectly measuring strike velocity from the softest hand-drumming actions to the strongest percussive assault. The BopPad software, which will be available as a desktop download and iOS app—allows four independently programmable zones (or quadrants) to be assigned to play up to six simultaneous notes with six expressive timbre maps. At the heart of the BopPad is the world's largest smart fabric sensor. The smart fabric is the same as that used in products from Keith McMillen Instruments and McMillen's BeBop Sensors.|$|E
