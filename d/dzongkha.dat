25|$|The Bhutanese Standard for a <b>Dzongkha</b> {{keyboard}} layout standardizes the layout for typing <b>Dzongkha,</b> and other languages using the Tibetan script, in Bhutan. This standard layout was formulated by the <b>Dzongkha</b> Development Commission and Department of Information Technology in Bhutan. The <b>Dzongkha</b> {{keyboard layout}} {{is very easy}} to learn as the key sequence essentially follows the order of letters in the <b>Dzongkha</b> and Tibetan alphabet. The layout has been available in Linux since 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} language, <b>Dzongkha,</b> is {{a symbol}} of the state of Bhutan and is its legally designated lingua franca among the many languages of Bhutan. Like the driglam namzha and Bhutanese monarchy, <b>Dzongkha</b> is also a salient feature of Ngalop culture in particular. The name of the language hearkens to the distinctive dzong fortresses, now used as government centers.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{symbols of}} Bhutanese culture and {{national}} identity are the distinctive Bhutanese dress, the Bhutanese monarchy, and <b>Dzongkha,</b> the national language.|$|E
25|$|Nepali is the {{lingua franca}} of Sikkim, while Sikkimese (Bhutia) and Lepcha are spoken in certain areas. English is also spoken and {{understood}} {{in most of}} Sikkim. Other languages include <b>Dzongkha,</b> Groma, Gurung, Limbu, Magar, Majhi, Majhwar, Nepal Bhasa, Rai, Sherpa, Sunuwar, Tamang, Thulung, Tibetan, and Yakha.|$|E
25|$|Kuensel {{was first}} started in Thimphu as a {{government}} bulletin in 1965, and then became a national weekly in 1986 and was the only newspaper in Bhutan until 2006 when two other news papers namely, the Bhutan Times and Bhutan Observer, were introduced. Kuensel, which was initially government owned, became an autonomous corporation incorporating the Royal Government Press, in 1992. It publishes the newspaper Kuensel in English, Nepali and <b>Dzongkha</b> (Bhutanese) languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} {{symbols of}} Bhutan include the national flag, national emblem, national anthem, and the mythical druk thunder featured in all three. Other distinctive symbols of Bhutan and its dominant Ngalop culture include <b>Dzongkha,</b> the national language; the Bhutanese monarchy; and the driglam namzha, a seventeenth-century code on dress, etiquette, and dzong architecture. Natural symbols of Bhutan are its national flower, the Himalayan blue poppy; its national tree, the Himalayan cypress; its national bird, the raven; and its national animal, the takin.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no central}} {{government}} during this period. Instead, small independent monarchies {{began to develop}} by the early 9th century. Each was ruled by a deb (king), some of whom claimed divine origins. The kingdom of Bumthang was the most prominent among these small entities. At the same time, Tibetan Buddhist monks (lam in <b>Dzongkha,</b> Bhutan's official national language) had firmly rooted their religion and culture in Bhutan, and members of joint Tibetan-Mongol military expeditions settled in fertile valleys. By the 11th century, all of Bhutan was occupied by Tibetan-Mongol military forces.|$|E
25|$|Although spoken Tibetan varies {{according}} to the region, the written language, based on Classical Tibetan, is consistent throughout. This is {{probably due to the}} long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from northern Pakistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east, and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and <b>Dzongkha,</b> and which is derived from the ancient Indian Brāhmī script.|$|E
25|$|This {{university}} {{includes several}} colleges including the Institute for Language and Culture Studies (ILCS) which provides training to undergraduate students in national language, culture {{and traditions of}} Bhutan at Simtokha Dzong. Students who graduate from this school primarily become <b>Dzongkha</b> teachers. Also included is the Royal Institute of Health Sciences (RIHS), which provides training to nurses and technicians, and the Royal Institute of Management (RIM) which provides training in administrative and financial management to mid-level manager. Aside from the government run colleges, private schools and colleges have also been set up in Thimphu and {{other regions of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} laws {{regarding}} the national symbols of Bhutan are enumerated {{in the national}} constitution of 2008. The Constitution represents the only democratically enacted legislation regarding Bhutan's national symbols. Foremost, the Constitution confirmed the status of <b>Dzongkha</b> as the national language and set December 17 – {{the day of the}} founding of the monarchy – as the National Day. It also confirms the Drukpa Kagyu school of Mahayana Buddhism as the state religion. The First Schedule of the Constitution sets forth the latest legal description of the national flag and emblem, while its Second Schedule reproduces the lyrics of the Bhutanese national anthem.|$|E
25|$|The Bhotiya {{people are}} closely related to several other groups and ethnic {{boundaries}} are porous. One group is the Bhutia, the main ethnolinguistic group of {{the northern part of the}} Indian state of Sikkim. A second is the Uttarakhand Bhotiya of the upper Himalayan valleys of the Kumaon and the Garhwal divisions of Uttarakhand. These include the Shauka tribe of Kumaon, the Tolchhas and the Marchhas of Garhwal, Gyagar Khampa of Khimling, Bhidang. A third related group are the <b>Dzongkha</b> speaking Ngalop people, the main ethnolinguistic group of Bhutan. The Bhotiya are also related to several dispersed groups in Nepal and the adjacent areas of India including the Tibetans and Sherpas.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} has numerous regional dialects which {{are generally not}} mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and Bhutan and is also spoken in parts of Nepal and northern India, such as Sikkim. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham, Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly <b>Dzongkha,</b> Sikkimese, Sherpa, and Ladakhi, are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages {{are included in the}} calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} in the 1960s that roads were built in Bhutan and Thimphu when the Third King of Bhutan took the {{initiative}} after receiving education in it. Prior to that, education was limited to monastic teachings in monasteries, except for a few privileged people who went to Darjeeling to receive western-type education. <b>Dzongkha</b> is compulsory in all schools. Schools are co-educational and education is not compulsory but school education is virtually free. Now, education has spread to all parts of the country. Thimphu has several educational institutions from schooling level to the college level in several disciplines. There are more private schools in Thimphu than in any other place in Bhutan, which are all {{under the control of the}} Department of Education. The National Training Authority administers three technical institutes.|$|E
25|$|When the Chinese communists {{took over}} Tibet in 1951, Bhutan closed its {{frontier}} with Tibet and sided with its powerful {{neighbor to the}} south. To offset the chance of Chinese encroachment, Bhutan began a modernization program. Land reform was accompanied by {{the abolition of slavery}} and serfdom and the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch of government. Mostly funded by India after China's invasion of Tibet in 1959, the modernization program also included the construction of roads linking the Indian plains with central Bhutan. An all-weather road was completed in 1962 between Thimphu and Phuntsholing, the overland gateway town on the southwest border with India. <b>Dzongkha</b> was made the national language during Jigme Dorji's reign. Additionally, development projects included establishing such institutions as a national museum in Paro and a national library, national archives, and national stadium, as well as buildings to house the National Assembly, the High Court (Thrimkhang Gongma), and other government entities in Thimphu. The position of gongzim, held since 1907 by the Dorji family, was upgraded in 1958 to lonchen (prime minister) and was still {{in the hands of the}} Dorji. Jigme Dorji Wangchuck's reforms, however, although lessening the authority of the absolute monarchy, also curbed the traditional decentralizatio of political authority among regional leaders and strengthened the role of the central government in economic and social programs.|$|E
500|$|According to the 2001 census, the Darjeeling urban agglomeration, with {{an area of}} , had a {{population}} of 109,163, while the municipal area had {{a population}} of 107,530. The population density of the municipal area was 10,173 per km2. The sex ratio was 1,017 females per 1,000 males, which was {{higher than the national}} average of 933 females per 1000 males. [...] Gorkhas, speaking Nepali as native language, form the majority which includes indigenous ethnic groups such as the Lepcha, Limbu, Rai, Chhetri, Magar, Tamang, Gurung, Newars, Bhutia, Sherpa, Yolmo, Rajbanshi, along with several other denominations under the Indo-Aryan Khas and the Mongoloid Kirats. Other communities that inhabit Darjeeling include the Tibetans, Marwaris, Anglo-Indians, Chinese, Biharis, and Bengalis. The common lingua franca is Nepali. However, most people also speak English and Hindi with varying degrees of fluency with fewer enjoying a fluency in Bengali. <b>Dzongkha</b> is spoken by the Bhutias and the Tibetans.|$|E
2500|$|Simtokha Dzong, {{known as}} Sangak Zabdhon Phodrang (Palace of the Profound Meaning of Secret Mantras), {{is said to}} be the oldest {{surviving}} fortress cum monastery established in 1629 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, who unified Bhutan. It was attacked several times in the 17th century but survived and was refurbished repeatedly.

5000|$|Chocangacakha is a [...] "sister {{language}}" [...] to <b>Dzongkha.</b> Curiously, {{the most}} closely related language to <b>Dzongkha</b> {{in the kingdom}} is spoken in {{the east of the}} country along the Kurichu and represents an ancient 'Ngalong [...] in the east. ... Cho-ca-nga-ca-kha is more conservative in its pronunciation of many words than <b>Dzongkha</b> .... Most verbal suffixes are cognate to their <b>Dzongkha</b> counterparts, but Cho-ca-nga-ca-kha has adopted the Bumthang infinitival ending -mala. [...] Under pressure to assimilate into the mainstream Dzongkha-speaking Ngalop culture, this proximity has resulted in significant loss of its particularly distinctive Kurichu linguistic substrate.Nicholas Tournadre writes: Among the eighteen Tibeto-Burman languages (henceforth TB) found in Bhutan, seven belong to the Tibetic group ... which was earlier called “Central Bodish” (see Tournadre, 2014). These languages include <b>Dzongkha</b> རྫོང་ཁ, Chochangachakha ཁྱོ་ཅ་ང་ཅ་ཁ་, Lakha ལ་ཁ་, and Merak-Saktengkha མེ་རག་སག་ང་ཁ་, Layakha ལ་ཡ་ཁ, Durkha ȭར་ཁ་ and Trashigang Kham བཀྲ་ཤིས་Ȉང་ཁམས་ǰད་. Lakha, Merak-Saktengkha, Layakha and Durkha are remnants of yak-herding pastoralist communities, while <b>Dzongkha</b> and Chocha-ngachakha were traditionally cultivator communities. These seven languages are all derived from a form of Old Tibetan (hence OT) and are closely related to Classical Tibetan (hence CT) or CHOS SKAD (ཆོས་སྐད), as it is often referred to in <b>Dzongkha.</b> This proximity to CT makes it easy to transcribe most words using the Classical orthography. Despite their close genetic relationship, however, these languages do not allow for good mutual intelligibility.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dzongkha</b> bears a close {{linguistic}} {{relationship to}} J'umowa, which is spoken in the Chumbi Valley of Southern Tibet. It {{has a much}} more distant relationship to Standard Tibetan. Although spoken <b>Dzongkha</b> and Tibetan are largely mutually unintelligible, the literary forms of both are both highly influenced by the liturgical (clerical) Classical Tibetan language, known in Bhutan as Chöke, which {{has been used for}} centuries by Buddhist monks. Chöke was used as the language of education in Bhutan until the early 1960s when it was replaced by <b>Dzongkha</b> in public schools.|$|E
