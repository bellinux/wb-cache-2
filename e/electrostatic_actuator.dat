Theoretically, transverse displacement of electrostatic comb drive depends on supplied voltage, pull-in voltage, and length of spring suspension. In this study, two types of spring suspension (single beams and double-folded beams) are studied for different behaviors of linear <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuators.</b> Normally, the folded-beam are implemented with the guilded-axis along at the center. There are still contradictions about the deflection of the single beam suspension and the folded-beam. Engineers and scientists predicted the deformations for their own designs.

Calculations of stiffness and allowable transverse displacement are also compared to the simulation results among different types. The calculations are used for designing the performances of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuators</b> with a fit-curve for different parameters. Then, the experimental results indicate characteristics of linear <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuators</b> for different suspension designs and different parameters.

Among {{different kinds of}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuators,</b> the comb drive type {{is one of the}} most popular because it has a relatively large range of displacement.

Accurate calculation of the electrostatic forces that occur on the structural boundaries during optimization is important for developing actuators that operate with prescribed driving forces. In the conventional level set-based shape optimization methods, inaccuracies in the calculation of these electrostatic forces occur because the structural boundaries are seldom aligned with the finite element method (FEM) nodes. To precisely calculate the electrostatic forces, we developed a mesh adaptation scheme by which the finite element nodes are brought into alignment with the structural boundaries at every iteration of the optimization procedure. In the following, we explain the details of the proposed level set-based shape optimization method, in which a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to achieve a prescribed driving force profile.

These factors make PDMS receive a great intention in many areas of MEMS application. In literature, PDMS as a MEMS actuator have been realized using several actuation methods.

The rapid expansion of the set of materials available to MEMS designers motivates the need for a systematic and rational approach toward the selection of materials for <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuators.</b> We apply the Ashby methodology to accomplish such a selection.

40|$|Abstract—Controlling the charge, {{rather than}} the voltage, on a parallel-plate, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuator</b> {{theoretically}} permits stable operation for all deflections. Practically, we show that, using charge control, the maximum stable deflection is limited by 1) charge pull-in, in which the actuator snaps due {{to the presence of}} parasitic capacitance and 2) tip-in, in which the rotation mode becomes unstable. This work presents a circuit that controls the amount of charge on a parallel-plate, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>actuator.</b> This circuit reduces the sensitivity to parasitic capacitance, so that tip-in is the limiting instability. A small-signal model of the actuator is developed and used to determine the circuit bandwidth and gain requirements for stable deflections. Four different parallel-plate actuators have been designed and tested to verify the charge control technique as well as to verify charge pull-in, tip-in, and the bandwidth requirements. One design travels 83 % of the gap before tip-in. Another design can only travel 20 % of the gap before tip-in, regardless of whether voltage control or charge control is used.
