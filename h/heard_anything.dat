Perhaps, {{since you}} have not <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> about them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that {{something}} bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E

25|$|Based on the note, {{the absence}} of a struggle, no sign of a forced entry, and the {{presence}} of alcohol, police judged the case a straightforward suicide. After inspecting the scene, they found four more razor blades in their envelopes in a small package. Police interviews further revealed that no one had seen nor <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> suspicious. The Martinsburg police contacted authorities in Fairfax, Virginia, who said they would notify Casolaro's family.|$|E

25|$|One {{major source}} of {{controversy}} {{in the realm of}} sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula. LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to homosexuality. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that {{they were more likely to}} hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.|$|E

500|$|Willie Reed {{said that}} while walking home, he heard the beating and crying from the barn. He told a {{neighbor}} and they both walked back up {{the road to a}} water well near the barn, where they were approached by Milam. Milam asked if they <b>heard</b> <b>anything.</b> Reed responded [...] "No". Others passed by the shed and heard yelling. A local neighbor also spotted Leroy [...] "Too Tight" [...] Collins {{at the back of the}} barn washing blood off the truck and noticed Till's boot. Milam explained he had killed a deer and that the boot belonged to him.|$|E
500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft.

Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> and then my phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting.

500|$|Eddie Condon, Hoagy Carmichael, and Mezz Mezzrow, {{all of whom}} hyperbolically {{raved about}} his playing, also saw Beiderbecke play live or {{performed}} alongside him. Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] But I had never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Karl Willetts of {{the death}} metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an {{inspiration}} for the band: [...] "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out I had never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like that before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica. So we took the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together." [...] Chuck Schuldiner of the band Death said the record was [...] "life changing at the time" [...] asserting, [...] "That was {{some of the early}} stuff that gave me that push." ...|$|E
500|$|William Hurt was {{initially}} offered {{the role of}} Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script. Harrison Ford was also offered the role of Grant. Sam Neill was ultimately cast as Grant {{three or four weeks}} before filming began. Neill said that [...] "it all happened real quick. I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> about it, and {{in a matter of weeks}} I'm working with Spielberg." [...] Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt that Jeff Goldblum would be the right choice to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel. Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role. According to Hirshenson, Carrey [...] "was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of Dunham's {{co-workers}} {{for over}} 40 years said he [...] "never <b>heard</b> her say <b>anything</b> like that. I never <b>heard</b> her say <b>anything</b> negative about anything". Hawaiian State Senator Sam Slom, {{who worked with}} her at the Bank of Hawaii, said [...] "I never <b>heard</b> Madelyn say <b>anything</b> disparaging about people of African ancestry or Asian ancestry or anybody's ancestry". Her brother, Charlie Payne, told the Associated Press that his sister's reaction to being made a campaign issue was [...] "no more than just sort of raised eyebrows".|$|R

500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there was something about it. I've never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E
500|$|Approximately {{two minutes}} after departing for the chart room, Captain Brown reemerged {{on the open}} bridge and reassumed the conn of the battleship. He summoned Lieutenants Hatfield and Arnold, Missouris morning and forenoon {{officers}} of the watch, respectively, and informed them of the planned run through the acoustical range. As with Commander Peckham, {{this was the first}} time that either of these two men had <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> about the planned acoustical test run. When Captain Brown noted their confused looks, he promptly informed the men to [...] "Go get yourselves informed", at which point both officers reported to the chart room on level eight. There they learned of the impending run through the acoustical range by looking at the chart with the buoys marking the range; despite this, both remained confused over aspects of the planned run.|$|E
500|$|Plimpton relates that Dyer {{made the}} journey of several days from Lincolnshire to Cumbria, and stayed at Swarthmoor as a guest of the Fells. [...] It is here that Dyer almost {{certainly}} met George Fox, and learned about his beliefs {{and the role of}} women as preachers in his faith. [...] Though documentary evidence of an actual meeting of Dyer and Fox is lacking, it is certain that Dyer was known to Margaret Fell, based on a letter written to Margaret by two Quakers in Barbadoes. [...] The two men, John Rous and Henry Fell (no close relation to Thomas and Margaret Fell) [...] wrote on 24 May 1657 that [...] "We are still waiting here to get a passage for New England.

500|$|Hanneman {{said that}} the album was his {{personal}} favorite, reasoning it was [...] "so short and quick and to the point". Araya has remarked that Slayer's 2006 album Christ Illusion [...] "comes close", but that [...] "nothing can surpass Reign in Blood for intensity and impact. No one had <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it before. In the twenty years since then, people have got more desensitized. What was over the top then might not be now." [...] Drummer Paul Bostaph who was a Slayer member from 1992 to 2001 (and 2013–present) first heard the record {{when he was a}} member of Forbidden. During a party Bostaph walked towards music he heard from another room, and approached Forbidden guitarist Craig Locicero. When asked what music was playing, Locicero shouted [...] "the new Slayer record". After listening closely to the record, he looked at Locicero, and concluded that his band was [...] "fucked".|$|E
500|$|Aaron Ashmore plays Jimmy Olsen, Chloe's {{photographer}} boyfriend {{who works}} at the Daily Planet. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: [...] "I auditioned for [...] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>anything,</b> and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore's character was killed off. Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the [...] "real" [...] Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic rated New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light {{four stars}} {{out of five}} with {{reviewer}} Fred Thomas commenting that [...] "Stetson explores scorched landscapes and heavenly scenes alike with his stylized playing."

Larson lauded Stetson's album as [...] "his strongest and most cohesive collection in his career" [...] and suggested that [...] "you’ve never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it", giving a mark of four-and-a-half stars out of five.
