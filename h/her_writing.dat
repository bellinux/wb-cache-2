5|$|Heyer {{has been}} criticised for anti-semitism, in {{particular}} {{a scene in}} The Grand Sophy (published in 1950). Her biographers confirm she held prejudiced opinions. This was not a regular theme of <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> however.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of <b>her</b> <b>writing,</b> {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} material for a second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton {{went on to}} build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year {{in addition to her}} prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. <b>Her</b> <b>writing</b> was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.|$|E
5|$|Frank began <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> career after World War II, under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's young writer's {{training}} program, {{where she}} {{first met her}} future husband.

5|$|In 1928, Heyer {{followed}} {{her husband to}} Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts.

5|$|Janice Dickinson's friend {{make-up artist}} Way Bandy {{recommended}} she use {{the writing process}} to help heal from her past experiences.

By the time Dickinson began to compile <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> into book format she had become established in her career and resided in Los Angeles, California with her two children. She started formally putting her notes together into a book after successfully gaining sobriety.|$|E

5|$|Rice's {{books have}} sold nearly 100 million copies, placing her {{among the most}} popular authors in recent American history. While {{reaction}} to her early works was initially mixed, she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s. <b>Her</b> <b>writing</b> style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators. She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years, from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60. She and Stan had two children, Michele, who died of leukemia at age five, and Christopher, who is also an author.|$|E
5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and <b>her</b> <b>writing</b> is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson {{was the only other}} lesbian author they could recall.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which {{encompassed}} several unconventional personal relationships, received {{more attention than}} <b>her</b> <b>writing.</b> After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft {{died at the age}} of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.|$|E
