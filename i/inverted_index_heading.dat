The delineation enables Asynchronous system processing, which partially circumvents the <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> update [...] The forward index is sorted to transform it to an <b>inverted</b> <b>index.</b> The forward index is essentially a list of pairs consisting of a document and a word, collated by the document.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 43 - 46. Compression of <b>inverted</b> <b>indexes</b> received great {{attention in}} recent years. An <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> consists of lists of document identifiers, also referred as posting lists, for each term. Compressing an <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> reduces {{the size of}} the index, which also improves the query performance due to the reduction on disk access times. In recent studies, it is shown that reassigning document identifiers has great effect in compression of an <b>inverted</b> <b>index.</b> In this work, we propose a novel technique that reassigns both term and document identifiers of an <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> by transforming the matrix representation of the index into a block-diagonal form, which improves the compression ratio dramatically.

40|$|The n-gram <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> has {{two major}} advantages: language-neutral and error-tolerant. Due to these advantages, {{it has been}} widely used in {{information}} retrieval or in similar sequence matching for DNA and protein databases. Nevertheless, the n-gram <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> also has drawbacks: the size tends to be very large, {{and the performance of}} queries tends to be bad. In this paper, we propose the two-level n-gram <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> (simply, the n-gram/ 2 L index) that significantly reduces the size and improves the query performance while preserving the advantages of the n-gram <b>inverted</b> <b>index.</b> The proposed index eliminates the redundancy of the position information that exists in the n-gram <b>inverted</b> <b>index.</b> The proposed index is constructed in two steps: 1) extracting subsequences of length m from documents and 2) extracting n-grams from those subsequences. We formally prove that this two-step construction is identical to the relational normalization process that removes the redundancy caused by a non-trivial multivalued dependency. The n-gram/ 2 L index has excellent properties: 1) it significantly reduces the size and improves the performance compared with the n-gram <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> with these improvements becoming more marked as the database size gets larger; 2) the query processing time increases only very slightly as the query length gets longer...|$|R

The second table contained sentiment scores for each indexed position [e.g. (index, SentimentScores)]. Thus, sentiment scores could be quickly found based on indexed words of the first table, and indexes of the second table instead of iterating each word in SentiWordNet (1 st version of algorithm).

40|$|Abstract — Keyword {{search is}} {{the easiest way to}} access the data in the face of {{information}} explosion. Inverted lists are used to index documents to access those documents according to a set of keywords efficiently. These inverted lists are large in size. So, many compression techniques have been proposed to reduce the storage space and disk I/O time. This paper presents a convenient index structure, which is an extension of the Generalized <b>Inverted</b> <b>Index</b> (GINIX). Ginix merges the consecutive IDs in inverted lists into interval lists and it reduces the size of the <b>inverted</b> <b>index.</b> The new index structure is called Extended <b>Inverted</b> <b>Index</b> (XINIX) which extends the structure of Ginix. The primary objective of Xinix is to minimize the storage cost.

In this paper, we introduce {{a new class of}} compression techniques for <b>inverted</b> <b>indexes,</b> the Adaptive Frame of Reference, that provides fast query response time, good compression ratio and also fast indexing time. We compare our approach against a number of state-of-the-art compression techniques for <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> based on three factors: compression ratio, indexing and query processing performance. We show that significant performance improvements can be achieved. ...|$|R

By treating local visual features as terms, training images as documents and input images as queries, we formulate the problem of object recognition into that of text retrieval.

In this paper, we propose to improve the efficiency of articulated object recognition by an Okapi-Chamfer matching algorithm. The algorithm {{is based on the}} <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> technique. The <b>inverted</b> <b>index</b> is a widely used way to effectively organize a collection of text documents.

To evaluate the matching scores in the subset, we combined the modified Okapi weighting formula with the Chamfer distance.
