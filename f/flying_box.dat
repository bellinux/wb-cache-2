I {{received}} your package the day I left for my new field here at Keesler so it did a little more traveling only in our stomachs because it was all eaten before we were many hour on the road. Well yours truly is not further south fooling around with some of those little crater called B- 24 ’s Liberator Bombers. We call them <b>flying</b> <b>box</b> cars. No matter what they are called of what they look like they have a job and they are doing a swell job. That is one plane I would depend upon at any time. Last January when I was home on a convalescent furlough I dropped in to the college and saw a few familiar faces. I guess all my classmates are busy at work or fighting this war. I heard about Pasco Senerchia and think it pretty tough but that is the way things go. I had my flying buddy killed last month. I[n] this game you never know who will be next. I hope the Mr. Appleby is back with you now because he was in Florida when I was home. I suppose the next time I get back to visit I’ll see only girls on the campus because most of the fellows will be pretty busy else where. Keep up the good work because I know I like to hear from the college and am sure other fellows like to also. Just [...] Bob- [Transcription ends...|$|E
5000|$|Georg Klusemann {{belongs to}} a group of artists such as Werner Gilles, Eduard Bargheer or Gerhard Hoehme, whose work {{reflects}} their adoption of Italian culture. He studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf under Teo Otto, from 1962 to 1968, with Katharina Sieverding and Jörg Immendorff. After extensive travels to Spain, the Orient and Latin America, his work gained a clear original profile (Hans M. Schmidt). Impulses from contemporary European Art can be traced to Joan Miró, Victor Vasarely, Giorgio Morandi or Domenico Gnoli, to Surrealism or OpArt. But the impulses are transformed and integrated into a unique concept that cannot be associated to any known current in Art. Critics have called him [...] "Baroque" [...] (Joachim Burmeister), [...] "Indefatigable and fantastic" [...] (Vittorio Sgarbi), [...] "Arcimboldesque" [...] (Heiner Stachelhaus), [...] "an oscillator between abstraction and realism, narrative and representation, elusiveness and application" [...] (Dieter Ronte), or a [...] "legitimator of computer art" [...] (Giampiero Pavanati). Patrick Waldberg, the major biographer of surrealism, wrote of Klusemann's work that it is [...] "full of waving drapes, <b>flying</b> <b>boxes,</b> objects coming up in the air, swelling balloons, windows bursting open, instruments coming to life and all this according to a harmony beyond logic". Georg's biographer Hans M. Schmidt called him an [...] "individualist and a loner of unusual capacities." [...] "The things recognized become uncertain, the apparent truth becomes deception," [...] Hannes Hardering writes of Klusemann's paintings. Klaus Honnef wrote about looking at his works: [...] "The viewer is forced to question his viewpoint, to change it. To decipher the intricacies of these images one must learn to accept ones judgement as always temporary and never ultimate." ...|$|R

Although Fiona escapes with Mother Superior, Gideon is stopped by Gold as Gold places Cuffs on Gideon, vowing to get his heart back. As everyone begins searching for the wand, Gold tells Belle and Gideon that he has a better idea.

40|$|Spatial {{variation}} of some parameters measured on two aircraft <b>flying</b> 100 -km <b>box</b> and 200 -km triangular patterns at low {{levels in the}} atmospheric boundary layer during the Joint Air Sea Interaction Experiment in the North Atlantic was studied. The variation should be representative of summer conditions in mid-latitude oceans. The variance density of remotely sensed sea surface temperature, corrected for sky reflection, is found {{to depend on the}} one-dimensional wave number raised to the power of approximately - 5 / 3. Nonuniform clouds add low-frequency variance to observations of a downward looking radiometer and result in steeper slope of the spectra of uncorrected sea surface temperature. Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, and moisture were determined with the bulk formulae from the parameters (wind speed, temperature, specific humidity, and sea surface temperature) measured from the aircraft. The averages of these fluxes over each flight leg were compared with the fluxes determined from the parameters averaged over the same leg. The difference is negligible, showing that spatially averaged observations, such as those from spaceborne sensors, can be used in the bulk formulae to evaluate the fluxes...|$|R

The gunships conducted nighttime armed reconnaissance in specific strike zones known as Shadow <b>boxes,</b> <b>flying</b> a TACAN radial to a location in the box, then dropping position markers and locating targets. Between 1 April and 22 May, the 17 SOS provided nighttime cover for the besieged CIDG camps at Dak Seang and Dak Pek. With the assistance of AC-119K Stingers from the 18th Special Operations Squadron, the Shadows flew one to two sorties a night. During the siege of the camps, the squadrons flew 147 sorties and expended 2,380,161 7.62mm rounds and 21,796 20mm rounds. They also illuminated drop zones for C-7A Caribous resupplying the camps. From 3 April to 31 May, the AC-119Gs based at Tan Son Nhut tested a portable UHF receiver for signals transmitted by ground sensors. On 18 April, Shadow 77 picked up signals in a sensor field, firing nearly 6,000 7.62mm rounds that night and 28,500 rounds on the next night after again detecting movement, as well as assisting an airstrike in the area. 150 enemy bodies were discovered and 17 prisoners captured along with nine crew-served weapons and 67 individual weapons in a subsequent ground sweep. After {{the conclusion of the}} testing period, the final assessment recommended that the receivers be permanently placed in the AC-119.|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{games are}} usually {{considered}} as games with strategies defined {{not by the}} standard Kolmogorovian probabilistic measure but by the probability amplitude used in quantum physics. The reason {{for the use of}} the probability amplitude or ”quantum probabilistic measure ” is the nondistributive lattice occurring in physical situations with quantum microparticles. In our paper we give examples of getting nondistributive orthomodular lattices in some special macroscopic situations without use of quantum microparticles. Mathematical structure of these examples is the same as that for the spin one half quantum microparticle with two non-commuting observables being measured. So we consider the so called Stern-Gerlach quantum games. In quantum physics it corresponds to the situation when two partners called Alice and Bob do experiments with two beams of particles independently measuring the spin projections of particles on two different directions In case of coincidences defined by the payoff matrix Bob pays Alice some sum of money. Alice and Bob can prepare particles in the beam in certain independent states defined by the probability amplitude so that probabilities of different outcomes are known. Nash equilibrium for such a game can be defined and it is called the quantum Nash equilibrium. The same lattice occurs in the example of the firefly <b>flying</b> in a <b>box</b> observed through two windows one at the bottom another at the right hand side of the box with a line in the middle of each window. This means that two such boxes with fireflies inside them imitate two beams in the Stern-Gerlach quantum game. However there is a difference due to the fact that in microscopic case Alice and Bob freely choose the representation of the lattice in terms of non-commuting projectors in some Hilbert space. In our macroscopic imitation there is a problem of the choice of this representation(of th...|$|R
