5|$|The <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> {{resulting}} fire {{claimed the}} lives of 50people (42French nationals, sevenIrish nationals, and oneBritish national). Only 27bodies were recovered. A further fatality occurred during the salvage operation with the loss of a Dutch diver.|$|E
5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, {{so it would be}} better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> fire.|$|E

5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has been formed.

5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} <b>explosion,</b> <b>and</b> in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse. Syntax would have {{played a key role in}} this process and its full adoption could have been a crucial element of the symbolic behavioral package in the MSA.|$|E

5|$|Neighbors {{reported}} to the press that they had smelled a gas leak several hours before the <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> had called Litoral Gas. Company director José María González said {{that the company had}} received no such calls, and thought that callers might have dialed the 911 emergency number instead. Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E

In addition, he obtained information via Freedom of Information Act requests to the Navy. Furthermore, Thompson accessed depositions taken from Navy leaders and investigators during {{a lawsuit against the}} Navy by Hartwig's family.|$|E

5|$|After their modernization, both ships {{participated in}} the normal {{activities}} of the fleet, including fleet problem exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after {{the beginning of the}} Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor sank Arizona in a tremendous <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> slightly damaged Pennsylvania, which was in dry dock at the time. Arizonas wreck was later partly salvaged and is now a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|Among {{other events}} in the United States that {{have been linked to}} the {{conspiracy}} is the Black Tom explosion when, on the night of 30 July 1916, saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition at the Black Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort. Although blamed solely on German agents at the time, later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> Franz von Papen, the Irish movement, the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E

However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the <b>explosion,</b> <b>and</b> may be dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, {{and may even}} be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Billy and Kathy {{attend a}} pool party where Chuck and Froggy attempt to rape Kathy.

Government official Tony Craig arrives to investigate both the <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> the desert where Billy found the cannon. Tony informs the local sheriff {{that the town}} must be sealed off.|$|E

5|$|By the 1870s, the OSN Company, {{owned by}} the Northern Pacific Railroad, was {{operating}} seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, {{all of which were}} built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along the Snake River than wheat and grain. In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston: these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered a boiler <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> sank on the Snake below Lewiston.|$|E
5|$|Cain orders Nemesis {{to return}} to the {{helicopter}} so they can leave, but Nemesis turns on Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops.

They throw Cain from the helicopter to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled on a metal pole, killing her.|$|E
5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. His call was answered by dispatcher John Shaw, and Felt was able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the call was disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an <b>explosion</b> <b>and</b> seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E
