30|$|According to the Standards (AERA/APA/NCME 1999), {{validity}} {{refers to}} “the {{degree to which}} evidence and theory support the interpretations of the scores entailed by proposed uses of tests” (p. 9). Thus, validation is the evaluation of test score <b>interpretations</b> <b>and</b> uses by first providing proposed test score <b>interpretations</b> <b>and</b> uses and then arguing for the proposed <b>interpretations</b> <b>and</b> uses based on sound warrants. To validate test score <b>interpretations</b> <b>and</b> uses, several validity frameworks are proposed {{in the fields of}} educational measurement (Kane 2006; Messick 1995) and language testing (Bachman 2005; Chapelle 2008) and empirical studies are conducted using the frameworks (e.g., Beglar 2010; Llosa 2008; Pardo-Ballester 2010).|$|R

5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical method of <b>interpretation</b> <b>and</b> his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed {{at odds with}} his critical approach to the materials in his history.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the substantive issues in the case, there was also more general historical and theoretical issues involved. During Justice McHugh's final years on the court, he and Justice Kirby expressed differing views on constitutional <b>interpretation,</b> <b>and</b> particularly {{on the role of}} international law and principles of human rights in that process. In this case, the two judges continued that debate.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{appointed}} two U.S. Supreme Court associate justices {{during his}} term in office: Bushrod Washington, {{the nephew of}} American founding father and President George Washington, to succeed James Wilson; and Alfred Moore, who succeeded James Iredell. He also named John Marshall as the fourth Chief Justice of the United States, replacing Oliver Ellsworth, who had retired due to ill health. Marshall's long tenure represents the most lasting influence of the Federalists, as he infused the Constitution with a judicious and carefully reasoned nationalistic <b>interpretation</b> <b>and</b> established the Judicial Branch as the equal of the Executive and Legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, older {{historical}} {{analyses were}} challenged by {{a range of}} neo-positivist, Marxist and econometric approaches, supported by a widening body of documentary, archaeological and scientific evidence. Marxist and Neo-Marxist analyses continued to be popular in the post-war years, producing seminal works on economic issues and social protests. Post-modern analysis became influential in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on identity, gender, <b>interpretation</b> <b>and</b> culture. Many studies focused on particular regions or groups, drawing on new records and new scientific approaches, including landscape and environmental archaeology. Fresh archaeological finds, such as the Staffordshire Hoard, continue to challenge previous interpretations, and historical studies of England in the Middle Ages have never been so diverse as in the early 21st century.|$|E

The books also include first-hand accounts of schizophrenic patients and relatives tending to them, giving an insight into jumbled thoughts, the disorder's primary symptom. Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and progression of the disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting {{in concert with the}} environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving much room for <b>interpretation,</b> <b>and</b> they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{failed to}} breach the Lacedaimonian defences and when night fell, he withdrew {{back to his}} camp. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus {{received}} an omen during the night. As he slept, he dreamt of Sparta being smitten and set alight by thunderbolts coming from his own hand. While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this <b>interpretation</b> <b>and</b> buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E

5|$|Scalia {{served on}} the Court for nearly thirty years, during which time he espoused a {{conservative}} jurisprudence and ideology, advocating textualism in statutory <b>interpretation</b> <b>and</b> originalism in constitutional interpretation.

He supported the death penalty and opposed abortion, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, as well as most policies that afforded equal or special status to minority groups, earning {{a reputation as one of}} the most conservative justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court's majority using scathing language.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory <b>interpretation,</b> <b>and</b> includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and promulgation {{from the office of}} pope who, as Supreme Pontiff, possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code, principles of legal <b>interpretation</b> <b>and</b> coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion.|$|E
