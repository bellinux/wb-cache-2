40|$|The Closer Economic Relationship with Australia {{agreement}} (CER) {{was brought}} Into effect on 1 January 1983. The CER {{provided for the}} liberalisation of trade between New Zealand and Australia. This liberalisation is to be effected through the gradual elimination of barriers to trade following an established formula. Some departures from the formula are provided for where specific products would be treated in an inappropriate manner if the formula were followed. The objective of the liberalisation procedure is complete removal of barriers to trade by 1995. The granting {{of access to the}} New Zealand market for Australian tomatoes is included in the agreement. The level of access provided caused New Zealand growers of hothouse tomatoes to express concern over the possible impact of imports on the New Zealand industry. This Discussion Paper provides a report on an investigation of the likely impact of Australian tomato supplies on the New Zealand market. It is established that the most probable source of exports to New Zealand is Queensland. A review of Queensland tomato production costs indicates that a price of $A 5. 00 / 10 kg carton would be required by Queensland growers to cover their variable production costs. Additional costs involved in exporting to New Zealand result in a New Zealand market price of $NZ 17. 00 / 10 kg carton ($NZ 1. 70 /kg) being required by Queensland growers. This price can be achieved on the New Zealand market between June and November. Exporting to New Zealand would therefore only be attractive to Queensland growers during that period. The New Zealand hothouse tomato growing industry supplies approximately two thirds of the tomatoes for the freshmarket. These supplies are predominantly during autumn, winter and spring when higher prices are available. During summer, prices are lower as outdoor grown- tomatoes become available. The hothouse tomato growing industry considers that the high winter prices are essential to their profitability. It is probable that some price reductions will occur as a result of imports from Australia being available during winter. However, the quality of the Australian product is likely to be inferior to that available in New Zealand and therefore the price impact will be less. In addition, up to 1988 the quantity of tomatoes able to be imported from Australia is limited to a level equivalent to between 0. 57 per cent and 1. 01 per cent of average New Zealand annual <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>production.</b> The average variation in New Zealand <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> from year to year (over 1975 to 1981) exceeded the total allowable Australian supply by between 14 and 25 times. Therefore the impact of New Zealand supply variations on the market price is likely to be greater than the impact of supplies from Australia. Over the longer term, increased supplies from Australia can be expected to have a greater impact on the New Zealand market. The establishment of appropriate premiums for higher quality New Zealand tomatoes through the use of an effective marketing system would reduce this price lowering effect of imports from Australia. Some reduction in New Zealand <b>hothouse</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> could be expected as less efficient growers fail to achieve adequate returns. There is likely to be increased total demand for tomatoes during the winter period when lower priced Australian tomatoes are available. Increased outdoor tomato production during the summer months could also be expected to offset reduced hothouse tomato supplies during summer. Overall, prices are likely to be reduced (with premiums available for high quality product) and tomato consumption could be expected to increase...|$|E

The face-to-face questionnaire method {{was used to}} collect the data from 75 and 35 farmers for wheat and tomato, respectively. The results showed that total energy input for wheat and <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> was to 46108 and 115894 MJha- 1, respectively. Among all inputs involved, fertilizer had the highest energy value per hectare for wheat; furthermore, diesel fuel had the highest share of total energy consumption for <b>tomato</b> <b>production.</b> The value of energy ratio for cultivating wheat and <b>tomato</b> <b>productions</b> were calculated at 0. 95 and 0. 75, respectively. The ratio of renewable energy within the total energy in all productions is very low. The share of non-renewable energy for wheat and <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> was 80 % and 85 %, respectively.

40|$|<b>Tomato</b> <b>production</b> was an {{important}} economic activity in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. A clear tomato yield gap existed between South Africa and the other countries in Southern Africa. Understanding the reasons behind tomato crop failures and successes in South Africa could increase <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> in the fast-growing tomato markets of Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, thereby improving food and nutrition security for smallholders and the population in general. In this study, the i) economics of <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> in South Africa was investigated and compared to similar production systems in the USA, Turkey and India, ii) the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors that limited tomato yield and quality within three climatically distinct planting windows in the Limpopo Province of South Africa were examined, and iii) the correlations between three commercially available soil health metrics (i. e., a microscope-based method for estimating the biomass of soil bacteria, fungi and protozoans; nematode community profiling based on counts and trophic group classifications and related indices; polyphasic soil health testing based on soil biological, physical and chemical variables) and tomato yield were assessed. Meta-analysis was used to explore yield variation in open field production systems in the international context. The main yield-limiting factors were identified as planting times, planting density, soil-water relations, and synthetic/organic nitrogen fertilization. The focus of the study shifted to commercial <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. Since 2003, these tomato producers practiced intensive open field <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> {{using a combination of}} synthetic and organic soil, crop and pest management technologies. A review of <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> economics revealed that within a period of six years, South African <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> cost per hectare more than doubled but the profit margin halved. The importance of tomato quality as an economic factor was demonstrated. Economic pressures forced these tomato producers to intensify production, which underscored the need for the continued development of sustainable <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> systems. To achieve this strategic goal, the primary biotic and abiotic factors that limited <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> were identified. The results indicated that complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors explained yield and quality variation. Climate variation dominated crop productivity, especially in unsuitable planting windows. Soil and crop management variables, notably synthetic fertilizer and pesticide usage, ensured high quality yield. Soil biology management was {{an important}} aspect of sustainable agriculture and the use of appropriate soil biology metrics facilitated soil biology management at field scale. All three soil biology metrics were sensitive to distinguish between three types of disturbed soils commonly encountered in the open field <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> context: natural, disturbed and cultivated soils. The microscope-based method used for quantifying bacterial, fungal and protozoan biomass and numbers was unsuitable for explaining yield variation. Nematode community profiling, in conjunction with polyphasic soil health testing, was very useful for explaining yield variation. In particular, soil pH, boron, aggregate stability, Paratrichodorus spp. and the balance among soil cations (especially exchangeable K and Mg) explained yield variation. In conclusion, sustainable open field <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> depends on the integrated use of synthetic and organic crop nutrition and protection technologies, optimum planting times, disease-resistant genetic material, and cultivation on healthy soils. The findings of this study will benefit policy development in support of sustainable vegetable production in the rural areas of Southern Africa.

This thesis uses emergy analysis to adress issues of resource flows, environmental stress and sustainability of conventional and organic <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> systems. An analysis of the Swedish economy was also performed. Since this larger economic system provides purchased inputs for the crop producing nurseries, this analysis on the national level is necessary to visualise resource flows of the subsystems.

Seven experiments were done to parameterise the model for these VOCs. Based on model predictions, the B. cinerea-induced increase in concentration of methyl salicylate is detectable in a large-scale <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> greenhouse when: (a) windows are fully opened, and (b) the increase continues for at least 1 h, and (c) 5 % of the plants are infected. The B. cinerea-induced increase in concentration of methyl salicylate is also detectable when: (a) windows are closed, and (b) the increase continues for at least 6 h, and (c) 5 % of the plants are infected. The B. cinerea-induced increase in concentration of (Z) - 3 -hexenol is detectable under all conditions studied. However, it is expected that besides infected plants, many additional sources of (Z) - 3 -hexenol exist including plant debris and nearby field crops especially upon harvest or stress. The B. cinerea-induced increases in concentration of a-pinene, a-terpinene and ß-caryophyllene are probably undetectable in a large-scale <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> greenhouse.

40|$|<b>Tomato</b> (Lycopersicon esculentum) <b>production</b> is {{handicapped}} by damage due to {{pests and}} pathogens. Farmers' {{fields in the}} western highlands of Cameroon were surveyed during 1993 to 1996 to identify biological constraints in production. Diseases and insect pests {{are the most important}} biological limitations in <b>tomato</b> <b>production.</b> Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans and early blight caused by Alternaria solani are the most severe diseases, while the melon fruitfly (Dacus cucurbitae) is the most prevalent insect pest. Yield losses due to pest damage are high and reach 100 % when the crop is not treated in the wet season. Pest-resistant varieties are not available to farmers. Consequently, growers practise intensive pesticidal spray programmes to limit losses caused by pests and diseases. Results indicate the necessity for the adoption of integrated pest management strategies in <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> in Cameroon...|$|R
40|$|Nicaraguan {{farmers have}} {{for a long time}} {{struggled}} with <b>tomato</b> <b>production.</b> The primary problem has been Begomovirus infection, which devastated the <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> in the country in the 1990 ’s. In the battle against the Begomovirus other problems in the native <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> have been neglected. The overall goal with these projects was to identify common tomato diseases and to evaluate their effect on yield and quality of the tomato fruits at different nitrogen levels. This report contains two separate theses (chapter 2 and 3). The results of the studies are based on the same field experiments. To increase the understanding about local farming conditions (chapter 1), interviews were made at two locations. During the interviews the farmers were asked questions about the farms, their production and pesticide use. Today, the farmers overuse chemical products to control different pests. The Nicaraguan farmers in general have a strong belief that pesticides are the solution of all their agricultural problems. The thesis in chapter 2 deals with the effect of nitrogen on some diseases of tomato. The symptoms that appeared in the field experiment indicated that the plants were no...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare open field and greenhouse <b>tomato</b> <b>production</b> systems in terms of energy efficiency, energy intensiveness, energy productivity, benefit to cost ratio and amount of renewable and non-renewable energy uses. Data were collected from 128 and 16 open field and greenhouse tomato growers, respectively, by using a face-to-face questionnaire in 2010. The results showed that the total energy requirement under open field and greenhouse systems were 47647. 12 and 2102678. 73 MJ ha- 1, respectively. The share of direct, indirect, renewable and non-renewable energies from total energy input which average in open field and greenhouse production systems were 74 %, 26 %, 17 % and 83 %, respectively. Energy use efficiency was achieved 1. 42 and 0. 18 in open field and greenhouse, respectively. The benefit to cost ratios of 2. 33 in open field and 3. 06 in greenhouse was recorded.

The aim of this paper was to present the regulations on support for tomatoes processing and to analyse the changes in <b>tomatoes</b> <b>production</b> in Poland after the accession to EU. There was analysed the cultivation area and the <b>production</b> volume of <b>tomatoes</b> cultivated in family farms in Poland, on the background of the support received and the possibility od receiving it. The support for <b>tomatoes</b> <b>production,</b> available till the end of 2007, stimulated the <b>tomatoes</b> <b>production</b> – the cultivation area and the volume of tomatoes harvested – increased. The tomatoes’ producers in Poland did not {{make the most of the}} available limits of support in 2004 and 2006. The positive eff ect of this regulation could be increasing the number of producers groups and organizations. After the reform of CMO for fruits and vegetables in 2008, the payments for tomatoes’ producers historical payments and the support was not connected with the current production. The cultivation area of tomatoes decreased and the production did not increase.  ...|$|R
