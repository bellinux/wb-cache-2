30|$|For sample CV- 2, it {{has been}} shown that two microstructures, kink bands and {{mechanical}} e-twins, are developed in calcite grains. The kink bands were developed by the compression parallel to the long axis of fibrous calcite grains (i.e., buckling, Ramsay, [1967]), and hence, it is perpendicular to the vein wall. The fact that fluid inclusions are concentrated in some parts of the kinked bands elongated parallel to the fiber long axis suggests that dilation occurred normal to the fiber long axis, thereby providing evidence that these microstructures that are correlated with <b>dilation</b> <b>veins</b> in a kink band (Ramsay, [1967]) are in fact caused by kinking. Further, brittle fractures were formed along the axial plane of kink folds (Figure  2 d), which indicates that the formation of kink bands (or folds) was accommodated by brittle fractures under very low temperatures. Therefore, the possibility that the apparently curved fiber veins were formed by a change in the opening direction of the veins (e.g., Passchier and Trouw, [2005]; Bons et al. [2012]) can be completely rejected.|$|R
40|$|Phase {{equilibrium}} considerations {{derived from}} studies of progressively metamorphosed serpentinites combined with a theoretical analysis of the system MgO-SiOs-H 2 O by Evans el al. (1976) indicate that antigorite is the stable phase in olivine-serpentine reactions. Corre-sponding serpentine-olivine quilibria in which chrysotile is the serpentine phase are meta-stable relative to the antigorite analogs. I suggest that this conclusion can also be applied to reactions involving lizardite and olivine. Metastable serpentine-olivine quilibria are inferred {{to be the result}} of combinations of crystallographic, energetic, and kinetic factors that vary for different reactions. The contrast-ing crystal structures of the serpentine minerals probably play an important role in determin-ing reaction paths where kinetics are unfavorable to the attainment of stable equilibrium; e. g., low temperature hydration or static dehydration. The role of crystal structure is manifested in the relative ease of nucleation of the various phases. Antigorite nucleation is hampered by its complex structure whereas lizardite-olivine reactions are favored by a topotactic relationship.

We report a case of ROP in which {{we were able to}} measure the ocular circulation before and after photocoagulation therapy, using a laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) system that is modified for neonates. Case Report: A female infant was born at 25 weeks’ gestation with a birth weight of 808 g. We performed photocoagulation in both eyes at age 15 weeks, and we measured the ocular circulation with the “LSFG-baby” system before and at 12 weeks after the photocoagulation treatment. We also measured the mean blur rate (MBR) in the optic nerve head (ONH) and the relative flow volume (RFV) in the retinal vessels, and we examined the change rates from before to after treatment. The changing rate of the MBR-A (the mean of all values) in the ONH in the right and left eyes was 76. 5 and 98. 5 %, respectively. The vascular RFV in the severe dilation and tortuosity quadrant also tended to decrease. Conclusions: Photocoagulation improved the <b>dilation</b> of <b>veins</b> and tortuosity of arteries and reduced the ocular blood flow in this neonate with ROP.

40|$|Dating of brittle {{deformation}} {{has remained}} a major challenge. This challenge arises {{from a lack of}} information on the timing and formation mechanism of newly grown (authigenic) syn-tectonic minerals within the fault zone. Seismological studies have shown that earthquake-mobilised fluids are common processes in the seismic cycle and that such fluids are commonly associated with the formation of syn-tectonic calcite minerals in co-seismic veins and fissures. Calcite precipitation may also occur by karst processes within opening-mode fractures during periods in which fault is inactive. Thus, constraining the timing and formation mechanism of fault-related calcite precipitates can provide valuable information on the seismic and inter-seismic fault activity, with important implications for various tectonic studies. The first aim of the thesis is to demonstrate and discus the formation mechanism of the different types of calcite precipitates within fault zones and to identify post-formation deformation and recrystallisation processes. The second aim of the thesis is to constrain the timing of calcite precipitation by applying U-Th age dating to various types of fault-related calcite precipitates, and to implement their ages {{in the context of the}} local and regional deformation evolution. The study involves structural, isotopic, geochemical and geochronological investigations. The structural geology component consists of field observations, microstructural analyses on oriented thin-sections and cathodoluminescence. This was complemented by isotopic investigations including δ 13 C, δ 18 O and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and trace and major element geochemical analyses. Geochronological constraints were obtained by the U-Th dating technique. These methods have been applied to five different types of fault-related calcite precipitates: calcite-filled <b>dilation</b> <b>veins,</b> calcite coating fault planes, calcite injection <b>veins,</b> calcite filling <b>dilation</b> breccias and calcite fault striae. Samples have been taken from different segments along the East Anatolian (SE Turkey) and Dead Sea (Israel) fault zones. A large research component was done on one particular site in northern Israel, the Kefar Giladi quarry, where an ~E-W striking calcite-filled vein system is emplaced orthogonal to major ~N-S trending vertical fault planes, offering an ideal opportunity to study faulting and veining processes both spatially and temporally. The results show major differences in the nature of calcite precipitates and precipitation mechanisms within the different segments along the East Anatolian and Dead Sea fault zones. Calcite within hydraulic fractures, injection vein structures, and within syn-tectonic veins and tension gashes structures precipitated either co-seismically or syn-tectonically during the faulting events. In contrast, calcite-filled <b>dilation</b> <b>veins,</b> and calcite coating precipitated by karst processes following the formation of opening-mode structures. The ages obtained for these samples are at the limit of U-Th dating method. However the results indicate that active tectonics in both strike-slip systems occurred between 550 and 405 ka. The study of calcite-filled <b>dilation</b> <b>veins</b> in the Kefar Giladi quarry indicates a prolonged history (> 500 ka) of vein growth. It is shown that brecciation and initial fracturing were followed by calcite precipitation in an opening-mode fracture by karst processes. A minimum age of ~ 500 ka marks the timing of vein initiation and increasing plate convergence along this sector of the Dead Sea Fault Zone. An additional high-resolution study on selected veins reveals that vein development was episodic and sealing-hiatuses during vein growth were followed by additional opening events. Once opened, the veins-fractures acted as rainwater flow paths, functionally similar to those developed by karst processes. When combined with high-resolution stable isotope analyses, these calcite precipitates may provide a reliable palaeoenvironmental proxy. The study of calcite cement and calcite striae in the Kefar Giladi quarry indicates precipitation by host-rock buffered fluids, and involving dissolution-recrystallisation processes during deformation. U-series systematics within these calcite precipitates indicates an increase in the magnitude of fracturing and enhanced fluid-rock interactions with time due to accumulating deformation in the fault zone. Fault activity is constrained to be dominant in the period between 220 and 60 ka. The combined time constraint on periods of faulting and veining in the Kefar Giladi quarry indicates that deformation style switched from a dominant N-S dextral strike-slip style to a dominant N-S extensional deformation style a few times during the deformation history. The results offer a unique approach towards the understanding of calcite precipitation mechanisms and fluid-rock interaction in brittle deformation zones. It demonstrates that geochemical and structural analyses, combined with U-Th geochronology, can shed light on co-seismic and inter-seismic fault activity, and can provide constraints on the timing, the style, and the extent of brittle deformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{superior}} vena cava {{is formed}} by the union of {{the right and left}} brachiocephalic veins.

Although several reports show the mechanisms by which the varicocele exerts its infertility impact, the exact pathophysiology for varicocele-induced inflammation and its relationship with testicular endocrine disruption remain largely unknown. This review article will update previous findings by discussing the pathophysiology of long term-induced varicocele in rats. Testicular endocrine disruption in experimentally-induced varicocele, new findings related to biochemical alterations in germinal epithelium, and sperm cells apoptosis are highlighted. Recent observations show that varicocele down-regulates first and second maturation divisions, results in Leydig and Sertoli cell inflammation, and increases immune cell infiltration in the testes of the rat as an animal model. Ultimately, previous findings of our laboratory have revealed that varicocele decreased sperm motility, viability and severe DNA damage. Damage in sperm significantly lowers the animal’s fertility potential. Varicocele not only exerts its pathologic impact by lowering the testicular antioxidant capacity but it also down-regulates first and second maturation divisions by exerting biochemical alterations such as reducing the intracytoplasmic carbohydrate ratio in germinal epithelium...|$|R

40|$|In many {{different}} liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, {{degradation of the}} microcirculation, including obliteration of small portal or hepatic veins contributes to disease-associated portal hypertension. The present study demonstrates the importance of angiogenesis {{in the establishment of}} arteriovenous shunts and the accompanying changes to the venous bed. One aspect of angiogenesis involves the branching of new vessels from pre-existing ones, and the molecular mechanisms controlling it are complex and involve a coordinated effort between specific endothelial growth factors and their receptors, including the angiopoietins. We modulated the hepatic vasculature in mice by conditionally expressing angiopoietin- 1 in hepatocytes. In mice exposed to angiopoietin- 1 during development, arterial sprouting, enlarged arteries, marked loss of portal vein radicles, hepatic <b>vein</b> <b>dilation,</b> and suggestion of arteriovenous shunting were observed. Most importantly, these phenotypic changeswere completely reversed within 14 days of turning off transgene expression. Expression of excess angiopoietin- 1 beginning in adulthood did not fully recapitulate the phenotype, but did result in enlarged vessels. Our findings suggest that controlling excessive angiogenesis during liver disease may promote the restoration of the portal vein circuit and aid in the resolution of disease-associated portal hypertension...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundVaricose veins are {{a common}} {{disorder}} of extensive venous dilation and remodeling with an as-yet unclear mechanism. Studies have shown increased plasma and tissue levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human varicose veins and animal models of venous hypertension. Although the effects of MMPs are generally attributed to extracellular matrix degradation, their effects on the mechanisms of venous contraction/relaxation are unclear. Our preliminary experiments have demonstrated that MMP- 2 causes inhibition of phenylephrine-induced venous contraction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether MMP-induced inhibition of venous contraction involves an endothelium-dependent and/or -independent pathway. MethodsCircular segments of the inferior vena cava (IVC) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and suspended between two wire hooks in a tissue bath, and the effects of MMP- 2 on phenylephrine- and KCl-induced contraction were measured. To study the role of endothelium-derived vasodilators, experiments were performed in the presence and absence of endothelium; NG-l-nitro-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis; indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostacyclin synthesis; cromakalim, an activator of adenosine triphosphate–sensitive K+ channels (KATP); and iberiotoxin, a blocker of large-conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels (BKCa) and smooth muscle hyperpolarization. ResultsIn endothelium-intact IVC segments, phenylephrine (10 − 5 mol/L) caused significant contraction that slowly declined to 82. 0 % in 30 minutes. The addition of MMP- 2 (1 μg/mL) caused a gradual decrease of phenylephrine contraction to 39. 5 % at 30 minutes. In endothelium-denuded IVC, MMP- 2 induced a greater reduction of phenylephrine contraction, to 7. 6 %. In the presence of l-NAME (10 − 4 mol/L), MMP- 2 caused a marked decrease in phenylephrine contraction, to 4. 4 %. Large MMP- 2 –induced inhibition of phenylephrine contraction was also observed in IVC treated with l-NAME plus indomethacin. MMP- 2 caused relaxation of phenylephrine contraction in IVC pretreated with cromakalim (10 − 7 mol/L), an activator of KATP channels. MMP- 2 –induced inhibition of phenylephrine contraction was abrogated in the presence of iberiotoxin (10 − 8 mol/L), a blocker of BKCa. MMP- 2 did not inhibit venous contraction during membrane depolarization by 96 mmol/L KCl, a condition that prevents outward K+ conductance and cell hyperpolarization. ConclusionsMMP- 2 causes significant IVC relaxation that is potentiated in the absence of endothelium or during blockade of endothelium-mediated nitric oxide and prostacyclin synthesis. The lack of effects of MMP- 2 on KCl contraction and in iberiotoxin-treated veins suggests MMP- 2 –induced smooth muscle hyperpolarization and activation of BKCa channels—a novel effect of MMP that may play a role in the early stages of venous <b>dilation</b> and varicose <b>vein</b> formation. Clinical RelevanceThe pathogenesis of varicose vein formation is unclear. Studies in humans suggest a possible role of MMPs in varicose vein formation and venous insufficiency. Also, studies in animal models of venous hypertension have demonstrated increased MMP levels in vein tissue and valve remodeling. However, there is no evidence of a causal relationship between venous MMP levels and varicose veins. Also, the implication of MMPs is based on an observed increase in their expression antecedent to or in association with the venous dilation, valve dysfunction, and tortuosity seen during varicose vein formation. Furthermore, a mechanistic model to study the role of MMPs in varicose vein formation is lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that MMP- 2 causes relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted IVC segments by a mechanism involving hyperpolarization and likely activation of BKCa. In chronic conditions of venous hypertension, protracted MMP- 2 –induced venous relaxation could lead to progressive venous <b>dilation,</b> varicose <b>vein</b> formation, and chronic venous insufficiency...|$|R
