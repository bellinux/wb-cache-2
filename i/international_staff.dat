40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper explores some definitional {{and strategic}} staffing issues {{arising from the}} emergence and practice of International Human Resource Management (IHRM). It firstly draws attention to theoretical problems and questions of interpretation arising from key debates on <b>international</b> <b>staffing</b> in MNCs and the global economy. The problem of reconciling demands for global integration with localisation is highlighted as having strategic importance for <b>international</b> <b>staffing</b> policy. The paper then questions the analytical usefulness of prescriptive expatriate staffing stereotypes, especially the ‘best practice’ ethnocentric model, and calls for a more informed and strategic approach to understanding differing <b>international</b> <b>staffing</b> contexts. It is argued that external structural and contextual factors (eg. global firm ownership, pricing behaviour labour market conditions, and legal/employment institutions) can and do impose significant constraints on internal management <b>staffing</b> decisions in <b>international</b> businesses...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>staffing</b> is {{relatively}} unexplored for service firms {{as much of}} the literature focuses on manufacturing firms. We draw on the knowledge-based perspective to analyze three key issues related to venture capital firms' international staffing: composition of the <b>international</b> <b>staffing</b> pool; reasons for the deployment of expatriates; and the process through which <b>staff</b> co-ordinate <b>international</b> decision-making, respectively. These research questions are investigated in an exploratory study combining a survey and qualitative interviews. The results suggest that the recruitment of local executives is significantly more important than the deployment of expatriates, and expatriation is significantly more important for transferring knowledge than for other motives suggested in the literature. In VC firms, investment committees {{play a key role in}} international decision-making, which allows them to manage challenges that otherwise would require deployment of expatriates. Implications of these results for future IHRM research and for the management of venture capital firms are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The ICRC is {{headquartered}} in the Swiss city of Geneva and has external offices called Delegations in about eighty countries. Each delegation {{is under the}} responsibility of a Head of delegation who is the official representative of the ICRC in the country. Of its 2,000 professional employees, roughly 800 work in its Geneva headquarters and 1,200 expatriates work in the field. About half of the field workers serve as delegates managing ICRC operations in the different countries, while the other half are specialists like doctors, agronomists, engineers, or interpreters. In the delegations, the <b>international</b> <b>staff</b> are assisted by some 13,000 national employees, bringing the total staff {{under the authority of}} the ICRC to roughly 15,000. Delegations also often work closely with the National Red Cross Societies of the countries where they are based, and thus can call on the volunteers of the National Red Cross to assist in some of the ICRC operations.|$|E
25|$|As the ICRC {{has grown}} {{and become more}} {{directly}} involved in conflicts, it has seen an increase in professional staff rather than volunteers over the years. The ICRC had only twelve employees in 1914 and 1,900 in the Second World War complemented its 1,800 volunteers. The number of paid staff dropped off after both wars, but has increased {{once again in the}} last few decades, averaging 500 field staff in the 1980s and over a thousand in the 1990s. Beginning in the 1970s, the ICRC became more systematic in training to develop a more professional staff. The ICRC is an attractive career for university graduates especially in Switzerland, but the workload as an ICRC employee is demanding. 15% of the staff leaves each year and 75% of employees stay less than three years. The ICRC staff is multi-national and averaged about 50% non-Swiss citizens in 2004. The ICRC's <b>international</b> <b>staff</b> are assisted in their work by some 13,000 national employees hired in the countries where the delegations are based.|$|E
25|$|On April 27, 1996, the {{faction of}} the United Somali Congress/Somali National Army (USC/SNA) which {{supported}} Atto decided on a programme to enforce sharia (Islamic court and laws) in southern Mogadishu, where Atto's forces were trying to impose control. A committee was nominated to prepare the installation of Islamic courts and an appeal was issued to Islamic leaders {{to decide on the}} religious personalities most suited to head these courts. Islamic courts were already in place {{in the northern part of}} Mogadishu controlled by Ali Mahdi Mohammed, Atto's new ally. The U.S. Department of State asserted, in its Country Report for Somalia for the year 2000, that the killing of Yusuf Tallan, a former general under the Barre regime, was connected to Atto. The report did not provide specific corroboration for the assertion. According to the UNHCR, Atto was responsible for an attack on 26 July 2000 in which about fifty militiamen in heavily armed vehicles attacked the Mogadishu compound of the NGO Action Internationale contre la Faim (ACF), in which two <b>international</b> <b>staff</b> members (French administrator Francoise Deutsch, and British logistician Jonathan Ward) were taken hostage.
