40|$|A {{test method}} has been devised that initiates and propagates {{a crack in}} polymer {{materials}} that avoids the need of an impact device. This is {{to take advantage of}} the good thermal insulation properties of polymers and similar materials and their tendency to be embrittled when cooled to low temperatures. Crack initiation in an embrittled part of the specimen is a simple process and it can be arranged for the crack to then propagate into the main part of the specimen which can have a variety of different shapes and include bonded joints and other features. Also, the stress loading for the main part of the specimen can be varied to relate to the different conditions in which a material may be employed. With <b>impact</b> <b>testers,</b> that also apply dynamically a three-point bend or other test condition then a problem can be in determining how much the crack initiation and propagation is due to the impact transient forces relative to the three-point bending or other loading of the specimen. Although impact testing is a very useful and realistic test, it can be difficult to determine precisely the threshold of crack initiation and propagation and other key factors that the proposed test method achieves.

40|$|Two {{non-destructive}} {{dynamic test}} methods, low-mass impact and acoustic response, were tested and compared with destructive compression and penetration tests to evaluate avocado (“Fuerte” cultivar) firmness. The {{purpose of the}} study was to analyse the performance of the impact test methods for non-destructive firmness evaluation. A bench top low-mass <b>impact</b> firmness <b>tester</b> pro-duced by Sinclair International (SIQ-FT) was used to perform the impact tests, and a piezoelectric-film transducer was applied in the acoustic tests.

The non-destructive tests were followed by parallel-plate compression and cone penetration tests. The SIQ-FT can capably detect the ripening stages of avocados.

40|$|Metallurgical {{coatings}} {{have been}} widely used in the automotive industry from component machining, engine daily running to body decoration due to their high hardness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance and low friction coefficient. With high demands in energy saving, weight reduction and limiting environmental impact, the use of new materials such as light Aluminum/magnesium alloys with high strength-weight ratio for engine block and advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) with better performance in crash energy management for die stamping, are increasing. However, challenges are emerging when these new materials are applied such as the wear of the relative soft light alloys and machining tools for hard AHSS. The protective metallurgical coatings are the best option to profit from these new materials 2 ̆ 7 advantages without altering largely in mass production equipments, machinery, tools and human labor. In this dissertation, a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coating processing on aluminum alloys was introduced in engine cylinder bores to resist wear and corrosion. The tribological behavior of the PEO coatings under boundary and starve lubrication conditions was studied experimentally and numerically for the first time. Experimental results of the PEO coating demonstrated prominent wear resistance and low friction, taking into account the extreme working conditions. The numerical elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) and asperity contact based tribological study also showed a promising approach on designing low friction and high wear resistant PEO coatings. Other than the fabrication of the new coatings, a novel coating evaluation methodology, namely, inclined <b>impact</b> sliding <b>tester</b> was presented {{in the second part of}} this dissertation.

40|$|Case {{carburized}} bearing cones {{were subjected}} to impact loadings using an experimental <b>impact</b> drop <b>tester.</b> The cones were manufactured from AISI-SAE 4320 steel by hot ring rolling, or machining from seamless tube. The microstructure consisted of retained austenite and tempered martensite. Some samples also contained fine dispersed carbides. ^ The cones were impacted with energies {{in the range from}} 3 to 30 J. The acceleration of the impacter was measured in-situ. Post impact analysis included indentation surface profiling and cross section sampling for hardness, retained austenite and crack morphology. ^ In general, results indicated that material response to impact loading was dominated by core thickness, microstructural constituents, and service history. ^ Impacts on lubricated contact surfaces were more elastic, thereby limiting deformation. The critical or transition impact energy which caused case fracture was determined. The mode of case fracture depended on the retained austenite profile and load history: (1) Increased retained austenite levels beyond 40 %, greatly reduced case fracture. (2) Increased load cycles moved the transition zone to lower impact energies. With increasing core thickness, the microstructure absorbed more energy. For high energy impacts which caused case fracture, the dependency on core thickness was enhanced. ^ Resulting impact damage depended on the amount and condition of retained austenite. As the retained austenite content increased, more energy was absorbed through work hardening and transformation to martensite. This reduced the depth of the damaged microstructure, as well as the indentation size. Instantaneous case fracture was prevented and cracking of the case structure was largely reduced. During service life, the microstructure continually lost the capability to respond elastically to impact loading. As a result, the absorbed energy increased, damage appeared deeper below the surface and the transition zone beyond which case fracture occurred, moved to lower impact energies. ^ The presence of carbides in the microstructure was beneficial only for very low impact loads, which limited deformation. As load increased, the carbides acted as stress concentration sites, which promoted crack initiation. The mode of deformation changed from displacement and transformation of retained austenite to a combination of displacement and case fracture, which absorbed minimum energy. As a result, the impact damage was far more severe, and extended deeper into the material. ...|$|R
