50|$|Swelling {{is usually}} {{associated}} with facial hematomas (bruises), and is traditionally reduced by applying firm pressure with a chilled enswell or an <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> {{on top of the}} area of trauma. The cutman presses the enswell against a fighter's skin to cool and reduce swelling from injuries, especially in areas around the eyes where swelling can impair vision. Since the time between rounds is very short, cutmen try to apply the enswell right away and hold it as long as they can, but a common mistake is using the enswell to push directly on the swollen area in an attempt to disperse it or move it into a safer place such as away from the eye. Such treatment will not move the hematoma, and may disrupt the microscopic blood vessels under the skin, thus causing an increase in bleeding and enlargement of the swelled area.|$|E

Despite being knocked down in the eighth round, Douglas bounced back and knocked Tyson out in the tenth round to claim the title in what was called by Jim Lampley, broadcasting the fight for HBO, as [...] "the single biggest upset in the history of heavyweight championship fights." [...] The fight was not without controversy, however, as Tyson's promoter Don King, claimed that referee Octavio Meyran had not properly counted the knockdown on Douglas from the eighth round (saying that Douglas was down for ten seconds and not the eight count he received), and that the result should be reversed and Tyson should instead be declared the winner. The WBA and WBC initially agreed with King and announced that they would not recognize Douglas as champion until they reviewed the allegations, though the IBF accepted the result as valid. After much public backlash, King rescinded his protest and both organizations officially recognized Douglas as champion. Though Tyson and his camp had hoped for a rematch Douglas ultimately decided to defend his title against the top contender and signed a fight with Holyfield. Prior to the fight, it was announced that Douglas and Holyfield would split a then-record $32,100,000 purse with Douglas guaranteed $24,075,000, the largest purse ever paid to a single fighter at the time.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} body weight on the induction of mild hypothermia in a rabbit model of asphyxia cardiac arrest. Methods Twenty-four rabbits were randomized into two groups: the <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> group and the intravenous 4 ℃ saline group. Cardiac arrest was induced and after 3 minutes of cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun. Simultaneously, mild hypothermia was induced by putting an <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> over the abdomen or infusion of 4 ℃ saline via an ear vein. A 2 ℃ decrease of rectal temperature was considered as the completion of hypothermia induction. Induction times were recorded, compared, and analyzed with respect to body weight. Results All rabbits had restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and ROSC lasted during the experiment. Induction time in the <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> group was significantly shorter than that in the intravenous 4 ℃ saline group (22. 8 ± 4. 7 min VS 42. 5 ± 4. 0 min, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Though cold pack {{is often}} {{made use of}} at home {{as well as at}} {{hospitals}} to reduce fever, {{it can be said that}} evidence showing that it is effective has not been reported. The purpose of this paper is to argue for the usefulness of cold pack in nursing and explore its effective application, presenting empirical data about how cold pack changes body temperature and affects sensation of coldness. Cooperated by healthy females, two types of cold pack treatments, that is, application of the ice pillow to the back part of the head and application of the <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> to the bilateral axillary[?], were performed. In this experiment, the skin and deep temperatures of all subjects were measured and they were also asked to tell us how cold they felt. The result was that whereas both of the methods made the skin temperature go down alike, they showed a meaningful difference in effect of changing of the deep temperature, indicating that application of the <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> to the bilateral axillary was more effective in falling the deep temerature. It was also shown that the use of the <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> made subjects feel colder.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare numbness, cold discomfort, and skin temperature in uninjured ankles using <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> and cold water immersion therapies. Design and Settings: A 2 x 6 repeated measures design guided this laboratory study. Independent variables were cryotherapy mode (20 minute 1 °Cold water immersion & 20 minute, 1 kg, <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> application) and time (1 min pre-treatment & 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min post-treatment). Dependent variables were cold discomfort (visual analog scale), skin temperature (OC), and sensation of pressure (Monofilaments, grams of pressure). Subjects: Twenty, healthy college students (M: 6 F: 14, age: 20. 6 yrs, ht: 162 cm, wt: 63. 2 kg) volunteered. Subject exclusion criteria included: allergies to cold (including Raynaud's phenomenon), cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, abnormal sensation in their extremities, or lower extremity injury in the last 6 months. Measurements: We measured discomfort with a 10 em visual analog scale; skin, room and water temperatures with Copperconstant thermocouples connected to an Iso-Thermex unit; and sensation of pressure with Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilaments. Measurements were taken 1 min pre-, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min post-treatment. Subjects were treated with a 20 minute <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> application or ice water immersion (1 °C) on 2 days separated by a minimum of 24 hours. Treatment order was randomized. Group means and standard deviations were calculated for each time. A repeated measures ANOV A determined differences and Tukey-Kramer comparisons located those differences. Our P-level was. 05. Results: For both treatments, sensation was reduced at 2 min post-treatment (5. 7 ± 4. 3 g) compared to 1 min pre-, 4, 6, 8, & 10 min-post (3. 6 ± 2. 1 g; 3. 7 ± 2. 1 g; 3. 2 ± 1. 8 g; 3. 3 ± 1. 7 g; 3. 0 ± 1. 9 g respectfully) (FS, 9 S= 13. 94, P<. OOOOI; Tukey-Kramer <. 05). For both conditions, skin temperature was lowest at 2 and 4 min post-immersion (11. 2 ± 1. 5 °C, 12. 6 ± 3. 1 °C, respectfully) (FS. 9 S= 6. 38, P=. 00004; Tukey-Kramer, p<. 05). There was more discomfort at 2 min post-immersion (17. 5 ± 23. 5 mm) than all other pre-and post-ice bag and immersion measurements, except for 4 min post-immersion (12. 7 ± 19. 1 mm) (Fs. 9 s= 5. 93, p=. 00008).

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with repeated measure. SETTING: Laboratory experiment. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve healthy male subjects (mean +/- standard deviation, 22. 9 +/- 1. 8 y). INTERVENTIONS: <b>Ice</b> <b>bag</b> and hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy were randomly applied on {{the skin of the}} nondominant hand. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Skin temperature of the cooled (dorsal and palmar sides) and contralateral (dorsal side) hands were continuously measured with thermistor surface-contact probes before, during, and after (30 min) cooling. RESULTS: Hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy projection induced a large decrease (P<. 05) of the dorsal skin temperature of the cooled hand (from 32. 5 degrees +/- 0. 5 degrees C to 7. 3 degrees +/- 0. 8 degrees C) and a significant decrease of the skin temperature of the palmar side and of the contralateral hand. The skin temperature of the dorsal side of the cooled hand was decreased with an <b>ice</b> <b>bag</b> (from 32. 5 degrees +/- 0. 6 degrees C to 13. 9 degrees +/- 0. 7 degrees C, P<. 05). However, the lowest temperature was significantly higher than during hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy, and no significant changes in the other skin temperatures were observed. Rewarming was equal after the 2 modalities, highlighting a more rapid increase of the skin temperature after hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy projection decreased the skin temperature of the cooled and contralateral hand, suggesting a systemic skin vasoconstriction response.
