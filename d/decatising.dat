50|$|There {{are several}} quite {{different}} types of wool decatizing machines including batch decatizing machines, continuous decatizing machines, wet <b>decatising</b> machines and dry decatizing machines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Decatising</b> or decatizing, {{also known}} as crabbing, blowing, and decating, {{is the process of}} making {{permanent}} a textile finish on a cloth, so that it does not shrink during garment making. The word comes from the French , which means to remove the [...] or finish of the wool. Though used mainly for wool, the term is also applied to processes performed on fabrics of other fibers, such as cotton, linen or polyester. Crabbing and blowing are minor variations on the general process for wool, which is to roll the cloth onto a roller and blow steam through it.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that tension applied to fabric {{which is then}} {{permanently}} set by steaming under pressure {{for a short time}} has a significant effect on fabric dimensional properties. Increasing levels of stretch applied to fabric before pressure steaming resulted in decreases in fabric hygral expansion and relaxation shrinkage and also lowered fabric shrinkage that resulted from permanent setting. The setting conditions resembled those used in conventional pressure <b>decatising,</b> and it is suggested that in batch <b>decatising,</b> precise control of the length and width of fabric as it is batched up with the wrapper before steaming under pressure could enable predictable changes in fabric dimensions, relaxation shrinkage and hygral expansion to be obtained. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between wearer-assessed comfort and objectively measured comfort and handle parameters were investigated using 19 pure wool single jersey garments made of single ply yarns. Wearer trials {{were used to}} determine prickle discomfort, and whether wearers “liked” the garments. Fabrics then were objectively evaluated using the Wool HandleMeter, which measures seven primary handle attributes; and the Wool ComfortMeter (WCM), to predict a wearer 2 ̆ 7 s perception of fabric-evoked prickle. Wearer responses and the relationships within and between objective measurements and the effect of fibre, yarn and fabrics attributes were analysed by general linear modelling. Mean fibre diameter, fibre diameter coefficient of variation, yarn count, fabric thickness, fabric density, fabric mass per unit area and <b>decatising</b> affected one or more handle parameters. The best model for predicting wearer prickle discomfort accounted for 90. 9...|$|E
