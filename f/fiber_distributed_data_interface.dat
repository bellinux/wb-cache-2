However, after 5 years of continued development and refinement, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X 3 T 9. 5 committee has nearly completed acceptance and final approval of the <b>Fiber</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Distributed</b> <b>Interface</b> (FDDI) specifications.

In realizing this distributed MPP network, we developed specialized communication channels, cut-through switches, host interfaces, and software. To our knowledge, Myrinet demonstrates the highest performance per unit cost of any current LAN. yrinet is {{a new type of}} {{local area network}} based on the technology used for packet communication and switching within massively parallel processors. Think of it as an MPP net-work spanning campus-wide dimensions, rather than as a wide-area telecommunications network operating in close quarters.

We also developed self-initializing, low-latency, cut-through switches. Nlyrinet’s host interfaces map the network, select routes? translate network addresses to routes, and control packet traffic.

In addition, it will soon be possible to digitize the RF signal(s) with high-speed flash-video analog-to-digital converters and transfer the data over these same links. This coupled with the improvements in fiber-optic L. E. D. and laser transmitters/ receivers and the constantly decreasing cost of fiber-optic cable, will allow for the eventual elimination of copper cabling for these interfaces. This will net a cost savings for the end user, provide for easier installations and increase the reliability of the overall system. This paper gives a brief history of the development of high-speed fiber-optic interface links, then expands into current interface standards and their utilization (such as MIL-STD- 1553 B, <b>fiber</b> <b>data</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>interface</b> (FDDI), HIPPI, etc.). Finally, a glimpse into the future of telemetry systems and the possibilities to soon be realized as major manufacturers of fiber-optic interfaces push well into the gigabit region.
