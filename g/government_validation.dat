50|$|The first {{complete}} new-build F136 engine began testing 30 January 2009, {{under the}} System Development and Demonstration (SDD) {{contract with the}} US Government Joint Program Office for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. This marked the first complete engine assembled following US <b>Government</b> <b>validation</b> of the F136 design in 2008. The milestone was achieved one month ahead of schedule.|$|E
500|$|Following Rajaonarimampianina's election, the {{international}} community offered [...] "conditional recognition" [...] of the new <b>government.</b> This tentative <b>validation</b> of the results was motivated by the concern that the new president was a puppet for Rajoelina, {{as well as the}} allegations by Robinson of massive electoral fraud after losing the runoff despite a wide lead over his opponent in the first round. Rajaonarimampianina set up the MAPAR committee to organize the selection of his cabinet, a process that extended over several months. During this time, Rajoelina sought to be nominated for the position of Prime Minister of Madagascar and claimed the MAPAR had promised he would be nominated. In April 2014, Rajaonarimampianina instead announced the selection of Roger Kolo, following a consultation round which showed he had support from a majority in the parliament. [...] On 18 April, a cabinet was announced that comprised 31 members with varied political affiliations. Rajoelina qualified Rajaonarimampianina's decision to exclude him and form alliances with the political opposition, including Ravalomanana's supporters, as [...] "hypocrisy and betrayal", and has declared a refusal to seek reconciliation with Rajaonarimampianina.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} effort {{developed a}} practical decision support tool designed to assist policy makers {{in any of}} the twenty five Central and Eastern European (CEE) nations currently in transition from their former centrally controlled communist economies to fledgling market economies. The tool extends conventional strategic planning and policy processes by operationalizing contemporary concepts of global competitive advantage. This research contributes the first known operationalization of Michael E. Porter 2 Ì† 7 s diamond model for global competitive advantage as applied to economies in transition. Other innovative features of the decision support tool design include the powerful and adaptive new management science techniques of the analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy systems. ^ The practical value and utility of the tool was demonstrated to professional economic developers at the metropolitan area and state <b>government</b> levels. <b>Validation</b> findings indicated the variables are representative of those used in planning economic development and their use is consistent with professional decision making processes. ^ To be effective, extension of this research to the national level of economic development must be endorsed and directed from the highest possible level of national government. Initially, top level national policy makers should use the tool to validate national resource allocations and establish a nurturing environment for competitive advantage. Subsequent applications should progress towards optimizing the factors contributing to long-term, sustainable competitive advantage at national, district and municipal levels. ^ This research provides a departure point to assess the long term practical benefits of the use of fuzzy system decision tools for management applications. Further extensions should include longitudinal analyses of the effectiveness of the fuzzy system decision tool in successfully guiding the economies in transition to viable positions of competitive advantage in the global market. ...|$|R
