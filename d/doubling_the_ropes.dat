50|$|A figure-eight loop {{is created}} by <b>doubling</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> into a bight, then tying the {{standard}} figure-eight knot.|$|R
60|$|Harold {{took the}} iron crow, and having made <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> fast to it fixed the bar across {{the mouth of}} the aperture. Then he <b>doubled</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> tied some knots in it, and let it fall into the pit, preparatory to {{climbing}} down it.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} method draws <b>the</b> <b>doubled</b> <b>rope</b> over <b>the</b> shoulders {{instead of}} {{in front of the}} climber.|$|R
50|$|Also {{the concept}} may have {{originated}} from <b>Double</b> Dutch, <b>the</b> jump <b>rope</b> variation in which partners simultaneously participate.|$|R
60|$|Hazard {{glanced at}} Gus {{and then put}} the flask back in his pocket. But when they pulled <b>the</b> <b>doubled</b> <b>rope</b> through <b>the</b> last {{eye-bolt}} and {{set foot on the}} Saddle, he again drew out the bottle.|$|R
50|$|Classical abseils work by {{wrapping}} a <b>rope</b> around <b>the</b> body {{to create}} friction allowing the abseiler to descend {{in a controlled}} manner. Once the abseiler reaches <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>doubled</b> <b>rope</b> is retrieved by pulling down on one side allowing <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to slip around the anchor.|$|R
50|$|The P&SSR itself ordered {{improvements}} {{to its own}} line about the same time; from Stella Gill (Pelton Fell) to Fatfield (east of Vigo) was doubled; the new work was opened on 8 June 1857. Vigo had been a rope worked incline, albeit of moderate gradient, and on the completion of <b>the</b> <b>doubling</b> work <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> working was abolished, and locomotive working substituted. The level crossing of the Durham Turnpike (the Great North Road) was altered to cross the road by a bridge.|$|R
50|$|On September 20, 1905, {{in front}} of a {{substantial}} crowd of 600, at the Lyric Athletic Club in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Blackburn and Langford met in a ten-round draw. The boxing was fierce and drew blood and both boxers had the better of their opponent at times, with Langford finding a way to counter the keen left of Blackburn. In the third round Blackburn was <b>doubled</b> over <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> by Langford, and may have been out but for the bell.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} {{climbing}} situation, {{one end of}} <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is fixed to the harness of the climber, using either a Rewoven Figure Eight, bowline, or <b>double</b> bowline knot. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> then passes through climbing protection, which is fixed into the rock. Attachment to the rocks may be via bolts that are permanently fixed into the rock, or by traditional protection that the climber places and later removes without altering the rock.|$|R
50|$|Gervasutti {{died in a}} {{mountaineering}} {{accident on}} the Mont Blanc du Tacul, when he was accompanied by Gagliardone. They {{were on the way}} back, because they had to abort the ascent on the north east wall, when <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>rope</b> pinched. During <b>the</b> attempt to set it free, Gervasutti fell headlong into a gap. The spur was named after him.|$|R
50|$|The winding {{engine was}} {{replaced}} in 1869 by one with 2 horizontal cylinders 25in bore and 60in stroke. They had <b>double</b> beat valves. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> drum was 14 ft in diameter. This engine {{was still working}} in 1926 when the pit closed. A further engine was installed to haul tubs up a 900yard, 1 in 7 incline in the Accommodation seam. It had two horizontal cylinders 15in by 30in geared to a five-foot winding drum. Both were fed steam at 30 psi by three Lancashire Boilers.|$|R
60|$|Very hastily I {{withdrew the}} torch, and we {{finished}} in silence. When {{it was done}} we withdrew {{to the end of}} the passage and looked up the shaft, and I for one was glad to see the stars shining in heaven above me. Then we made a <b>double</b> loop in <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> and at a signal were hauled up till we hung over the ledge where the black mass of marble rested, the tombstone of Montezuma's treasure, and of him who sleeps among it.|$|R
50|$|Single, double, and twin <b>rope</b> are <b>the</b> {{three main}} <b>rope</b> systems used in ice climbing. <b>The</b> single <b>rope</b> system, which is suited for {{straight}} climbing routes, {{is the most}} commonly used rock climbing system in the world. Also often used in climbing is <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>rope</b> system which is a more flexible system than <b>the</b> single <b>rope</b> system. Lastly, <b>the</b> twin <b>rope</b> system, which uses two twin ropes in a single rope system, is used for longer multi-pitch routes. Double and twin rope technique is used more frequently in ice climbing because these systems are more redundant, an important consideration given the number of sharp edges the ice climber carries with him. Impact force on ice is an issue, with double ropes gaining popularity over twins.|$|R
60|$|We were {{astonished}} at {{the ease with}} which the spar was lifted. It was an improved crank windlass, and the purchase it gave was enormous. Of course, what it gave us in power we paid for in distance; as many times as it doubled my strength, that many times was <b>doubled</b> <b>the</b> length of <b>rope</b> I heaved in. The tackle dragged heavily across the rail, increasing its drag as the spar arose more and more out of the water, and the exertion on the windlass grew severe.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Double</b> <b>Rope</b> House has {{spinning}} on {{the upper}} floors and ropemaking (a ropewalk) on the ground floor. It is 346 m (1135 ft) long, and when constructed was the longest brickbuilt building in Europe capable of laying a 1000 ft rope. Over 200 men were required before 1836, to make and lay a 20in (circumference) cable. All was done by hand. Steam power {{in the form of}} a beam engine was introduced in 1836, and then electricity in the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|Some plates had two slots for <b>double</b> <b>ropes.</b> <b>The</b> slots {{could also}} be {{different}} sizes for different diameter ropes e.g. 9mm and 11mm. A wide wire spring may be attached on one side {{to help keep the}} plate away from the brake carabiner to ease feeding and taking in rope. A smaller hole is often present for accessory cord to carry the device. Sticht plates are typically forged from aluminium alloy in a round disc shape, although other shapes such as rounded rectangles were also made.|$|R
50|$|The modern Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car has a {{top station}} {{opposite}} {{the one of}} the German Eibsee Cable Car system. It has a length of 3600 metres and an elevation gain of 1725 metres. The Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car runs over three aerial lift pylons. <b>The</b> <b>double</b> track <b>ropes</b> have a diameter of 62 mm each, and <b>the</b> hauling <b>rope</b> has a diameter of 38 mm. It runs on 2 x 500 kilowatts of power, generated in the valley station. The journey normally takes less than 10 minutes at a speed of 36 km/h. The tramway's two cabins can accommodate 100 persons each and have a transport capacity of 730 persons per hour each way.|$|R
50|$|Although {{similar in}} {{finished}} appearance to <b>the</b> <b>double</b> bowline, <b>the</b> water bowline is formed with a clove hitch as the loop in the standing part of <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> This {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>double</b> bowline, which puts the running end through a round turn. The additional friction from the clove hitch increases the security of this knot.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages ({{from the}} 13th to the 18th centuries), from the British Isles to Italy, ropes were {{constructed}} in ropewalks, very long buildings where strands {{the full length}} of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> were spread out and then laid up or twisted together to form <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> <b>The</b> cable length was thus set by the length of <b>the</b> available <b>rope</b> walk. This is related to the unit of length termed cable length. This allowed for long ropes of up to 300 yards long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require splicing to make them long enough to use for sheets and halyards. The strongest form of splicing is the short splice, which <b>doubles</b> <b>the</b> cross-sectional area of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> at <b>the</b> area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight.|$|R
5000|$|During that year, he was {{the wrestling}} advisor for the {{short-lived}} sitcom Learning <b>the</b> <b>Ropes</b> and, along with [...] "Dr. Death" [...] Steve Williams, was a stunt <b>double</b> for <b>the</b> Lyle Alzado's character the Masked Maniac.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the minimum}} safe {{diameter}} is 12 mm, 1/2 inch. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> should be <b>doubled</b> to increase <b>the</b> {{area of contact}} and reduce the lifting pressure on the casualty.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rope</b> {{runs through}} <b>the</b> {{protection}} {{to a second}} person called the belayer. The belayer wears a harness that has a belay device attached. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> threads through <b>the</b> belay device. By altering {{the position of the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> belayer can vary the amount of tension on <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> In one position, <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> runs freely through the belay device. In another position, it can easily be held without moving, because the tension on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is so great. This is called 'locking off' <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Prusik-Minding-Pulley {{is common}} in <b>rope</b> rescue. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> to be pulled is passed through a pulley, and a Prusik is tied on the loaded side. When <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is pulled, <b>the</b> Prusik rides against the pulley, and <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> slides through it; but when <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is relaxed, <b>the</b> Prusik slides away from the pulley and grabs <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> {{combination}} acts as a ratchet.|$|R
50|$|The Grigri {{works by}} {{pinching}} <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{when it is}} moving quickly (like in a fall), making it an assisted braking belay device unlike traditional belay devices such as a Sticht plate or an ATC. Internally, <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> runs along a cam, which allows <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to pass if moving slowly but when <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> moves quickly <b>the</b> cam will rotate, pinching <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{is around}} <b>the</b> calf's neck, the roper signals {{the horse to}} stop suddenly. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> {{is tied to the}} saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is pulled tight and the string breaks. The {{breaking}} of the string marks the end of <b>the</b> run. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> usually has a small white flag at the end that makes <b>the</b> moment <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> breaks more easily seen by the timer. The fastest run wins.|$|R
5000|$|Wake 360 front-to-front (wrapped) - While in {{the middle}} of the wake, pull {{yourself}} towards the boat, collecting <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> in one hand. Then, wrap <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> around your back, and hold onto the handle. Let go of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> and <b>the</b> friction of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> straightening will spin you around.|$|R
50|$|The Yeoman of the Sheets was {{in charge}} of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> store. Given that the ship was rarely dry inside and <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> rotted when wet, {{preserving}} <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> was a major problem.|$|R
50|$|At the Town Square, {{teams had}} to {{convince}} eight locals to jump <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> with them. <b>The</b> game would star with one person jumping <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> then adding another one without stopping <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> until there were eight people jumping simultaneously {{for at least three}} cycles. If teams had to stop <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> they would have to start again.|$|R
5000|$|One easy {{example to}} {{understand}} standing waves is two people shaking {{either end of}} a jump rope. If they shake in sync <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> can form a regular pattern of waves oscillating up and down, with stationary points along <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> where <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is almost still (nodes) and points where the arc of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is maximum (antinodes) ...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{this thesis}} is to design <b>the</b> {{supporting}} <b>rope</b> of suspension bridge for pedestrians. The aim propose is the initial geometric shape of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> and <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> load impressed upon the desired shape. The proposal {{will be carried}} out by hand calculation, which will be compared with the calculation in computing RFEM. To illustrate the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> load {{will be carried out}}, but <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> will no longer be considered to limit states...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>rope</b> pumps used knots along <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> length {{but can be}} {{made with}} flexible or rigid valves on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> instead of knots. Alternatively they may use only rope, simply relying on the water clinging to <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> as it is quickly pulled to the surface.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first step}} is to relate the radial or normal force (Newtons/radian) at any point of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> wrapped around a capstan to the tension (Newtons) in <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> as shown in the figure.

50|$|The twine {{is first}} {{threaded}} diagonally through <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> <b>The</b> twine is then wrapped round <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> including <b>the</b> diagonally threaded end. A needle is {{then used to}} thread the two ends through <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to enclose <b>the</b> wrapping turns. Finally a reef (square) or a string of reef (square) knots is tied. Then this string of reef (square) knots is pulled through <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to bury <b>the</b> ends.|$|R
40|$|Proper winding of <b>the</b> steel <b>rope</b> around <b>the</b> {{winch drum}} is great importance, mostly for: prolonging the service life of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> {{reduction}} of deformations {{of the body}} and the sides of the drum if the winding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is multilayered, increasing of the safety factors, easier unwinding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> while lowering <b>the</b> load, even running of the drive unit, etc. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the friction which occurs in the process of winding and unwinding <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> around <b>the</b> winch drum. Friction force is in its highest intensity when <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> passes from one layer to another, if the winding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is multilayered. As the result of the research, certain mechanisms of winding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> from <b>the</b> aspects of the friction force were obtained, and the effects of the forces {{on the sides of the}} drum were analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The attacker, {{while on}} the outside, pulls back on <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> and, {{assisted}} by the rebound of <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> propels themselves into the ring and onto their victim. Variations include using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for a slingshot somersault leg drop and a slingshot springboard (where the attacker leaps onto top of <b>the</b> <b>ropes)</b> diving leg drop. Another variant is when the attacker slingshots onto the opponents neck.|$|R
5000|$|... back splice (also {{called an}} end splice) - A splice where {{the strands of}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> are spliced {{directly}} back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to keep it from fraying. The end of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> with <b>the</b> splice is about twice the thickness of the rest of <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.|$|R
