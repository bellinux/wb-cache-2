50|$|<b>Instant</b> <b>Print</b> Stations - This type of photo kiosk uses {{internal}} printers to instantly create photographic prints for a self serve paying customer. Often {{located in}} public locations (hotels, schools, airports), <b>Instant</b> <b>Print</b> Stations handle payments. Often such systems will only print 4x6 inch prints, although popular dye sublimation photo printers as of 2008 allow for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8x12. It's {{more a matter}} of resupply labor economics and chassis size.|$|E
50|$|Desktop size {{stand-alone}} dye-sub photo printers {{are also}} being applied by social photographers in event photography. The units' <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> ability allows photographers to produce and sell lab quality prints immediately during the event they are attending, with a minimal amount of hardware.|$|E
50|$|Recently {{produced}} imager models {{also include}} features {{to handle a}} variety of fluorescence and chemiluminescence with cameras cooled to -28 to -60 °C. Other advanced features include <b>instant</b> <b>printing</b> on-board the camera and Wi-Fi connectivity for control by smartphone and tablet devices.|$|R
50|$|Digital Order Stations -- This type of photo kiosk exists within retail {{locations}} and {{allows users to}} place orders for prints and photographic products. Products typically get produced in-store by a digital minilab, or at another location to be shipped directly to the consumer, or back to the store {{to be picked up}} at a later time. Digital Order Stations may or may not support <b>instant</b> <b>printing,</b> and typically do not handle payments.|$|R

50|$|Loppi (Japanese: ロッピー) is Japan's {{most popular}} {{self-service}} electronic ticket dispensing system, providing <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> tickets in venues such as museums. Tickets are typically printed {{and paid for}} at the store's counter, which also allows {{people who do not}} own credit or debit cards to purchase their tickets.|$|E
50|$|Cameras In Primary Care is {{a project}} to give hi-tech <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> cameras to general {{practitioners}} in primary care in Britain {{and ask them to}} send in a photograph with all their dermatological referrals. This enables the dermatologist to dramatically improve the referral triage process and reduces the numbers of patients who have to attend the dermatology department. The scheme was devised by consultant dermatologist, Dr Alun Evans and is taking place in the Bridgend, Neath and Port Talbot areas of South Wales.|$|E
50|$|As of December, 2015, The Impossible Project {{produces}} SX-70, 600, and Spectra {{color and}} monochrome film packs {{with a variety}} of colored borders. They also produce and sell other products which support their film production, such as a smartphone film lab - a device which takes a photo of the picture on a smartphone and produces an <b>instant</b> <b>print.</b> In 2016, the project released their first instant camera, the I-1, along with accompanying film packs that differ from traditional 600 packs in their omission of the battery (thus lowering costs).|$|E
50|$|The {{publishing}} {{section was}} established in 1948 to invigorate the organization’s publishing activities. S. S. Shleymovich {{was the first to}} head it. In 1968, as the amount of publications by the USSR AS Karelian Branch grew substantially, the publishing section was transformed into the Editorial and Publishing Department (EPD). In 1971 the EPD became authorized to publish the journal of proceedings of the Karelian Branch. In 1973 the <b>instant</b> <b>printing</b> shop was set up to publish collected volumes and monographic books without having to engage external book publishers. The number of limited circulation editions (express publication of research results, pre-prints of conference papers and abstracts, etc.) increased remarkably. In 1992 the Editorial and Publishing Department and the <b>instant</b> <b>printing</b> shop were merged into one unit to promote the efficiency of their operation. The time period from manuscript submission to final product became much shorter, the entire publishing process was optimized. A new phase in EPD development started in the 1990s with the onset of the computer era. Technical facilities of the editorial group were updated. Layout and design were computerized. Through renovation of the publishing process the quality of the printed products was notably improved, their volumes enlarged and the preparation and production cycle shortened. The EPD now implements the entire book publishing cycle. The principal concern for the EPD is to produce its editions so that they meet all modern standards.|$|R
2500|$|The {{direction}} of Carl Beam's visual style was firmly {{established by the}} late seventies. In 1979 Beam met and married his wife, Ann Beam. [...] "In developing his work over the years, Beam {{has been accompanied by}} his wife, Ann, herself an artist and a former teacher at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Often they have worked as collaborators". At this time he incorporated multiple photographic images onto a single picture plane. [...] "He disregarded the illusory deep space of Renaissance depiction, in favour of a flat tableau, where a dialogue of multiple images could take place". At this time his photographic imagery was achieved primarily via screen process, photo-etching, Polaroid <b>instant</b> <b>prints,</b> and a solvent transfer technique also used by Robert Rauschenberg.|$|R
40|$|Part of topic : Traces, notations and {{representations}} of ambiancesInternational audienceThe privileged position of vision in architecture design is increasingly criticised, {{as well as}} the use of external representation methods, which degrade the reality of architecture in a mere visual, or an ‘art of <b>instant</b> <b>printed</b> image’. However, the integration with architecture involves our entire body and all of the senses. Prior to the professional field, this {{can be traced back to}} the establishments, which educate the future architects. This article aims to study the origin of ocular centrism in architecture education, and its pathology in according to the pedagogic experiences. So then, it follows this question: how we can integrate the multisensory approach into basic courses that are defined in the freshman years (first three semesters) of architecture education in Iran...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of digital, Fong knew that online {{presentation}} of images would be best matched to an <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> delivery service. So, joining up with Pictage's online presence, Fong brought his own personal print lab into Pictage's headquarters, and installed it in the kitchen. [...] Joining the Board of Directors and Senior Management team, Pictage started with seven employees in a small office, and within years the employee count would top 150, making Pictage the largest dedicated online digital/web solution anywhere in the United States. Apax Partners invested $29 million to acquire Pictage in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|The units {{typically}} {{consist of}} an order station connected {{to one or}} more dye-sublimation printer(s) in a single unit. These stations are typically installed in a retail location such as Kodak Express stores, supermarkets and drugstores offering both <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> and behind the counter services. The kiosks allow printing digital photos from digital media (such as a CD or a digital memory card), as well as the ability to scan existing photos and perform simple edits and photo-enhancements via the touch screen interface. Some systems are set up as [...] "order stations" [...] that print to a digital minilab in addition to (or instead of) printing the pictures instantly.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{abstract}} is to document and explain an exhibition of photographic art work using the now extinct Kodak <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film. The exhibition resulted from using what were probably the last 100 unexposed pieces of Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film available in Southern California, and possibly the last available in the country. The exhibition took place April 3 - 10, 1987 in the North Art Gallery of California State University, Northridge. The imagery in this exhibition evolved from my interest in working with the immediate feedback associated with exposing and manipulating Polaroid SX- 70 and Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to use life story as a method to {{describe}} a former student’s, with her main schooling in the special school, thoughts of life during and after school, as well as the social relationships she has had and has access to. An overarching objective is to contribute to the field of knowledge from a young adult’s perspective. The study is qualitative with a life story approach. In the analysis, Bronfenbrenner’s ecological development model is used. The empirical data consists of transcriptions of conversations and <b>instant</b> <b>prints</b> from Facebook. The study is retrospective, but the study also captures the present day when the informant’s perception of life in the present day is also described. The informant perceives its later school years as more positive than earlier years. The result shows that the availability of social relationships was significantly higher during school in comparison to life as a young adult. The result also shows that the informant’s experience of the support of important adults is predominantly negative...|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{curriculum}} {{strategies can}} be used to conduct an effective photography program without the expense usually associated with _a darkroom. Three methods {{can be used}} to eliminate the need for a. darkroom facility: outside vendors, an emulsion that can be user-processed without access to a darkroom (slide or transparency film), and emulsions that self-develop outside the camera (<b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film). All three strategies emphasize the picture-taking rather than the mechanical processes of producing a viewable result. If an outside vendor is used, students need instruction on how to seek out services, how to evaluate services, and how to place orders. Advantages are a wider range of services, lower costs, better quality, and time for other aspects of photography. Disadvantages may be cost, turn-around time, nd loss of control over end result. Advantages of the user-processed emulsion are the need for some darkroom experiences, reduced time, lower costs, and control over end result. Disadvantages are processing errors, variations, and no quality controls. Advantages of <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> film are immediacy, low cost, and good results. A disadvantage is that the cameras using this film are usually automatic for exposure control and sometimes for focusing. (Resources and sources are cited.)

50|$|Instant {{books have}} gone {{in and out of}} favor over the years. By the late 1980s, the New York Times said that their high cost of {{production}} along with several failed Instant books caused publishers to back away from this process. Publishers <b>printed</b> <b>instant</b> books in mass paperback in high quantity print runs that resulted in returns to the publisher after public interest waned in the topic. But by the 1990s advances in the publishing and distribution had allowed costs to go down and some publishers built instant publishing back into their plans.|$|R
