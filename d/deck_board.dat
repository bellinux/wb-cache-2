5000|$|Richard H. Juve {{joined the}} company in June 1953 and {{introduced}} a line of stabilizing products to push sales in the rubber industry. He was followed by Harvey E. Cooper who joined in 1958 as a chemist from Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Both men acquired equal shares of The Caldwell Company making them President and Vice President of the company. [...] On September 2, 1959 the first manufacturing plant was opened on Home Ave. in Akron, OH. This {{was the beginning of}} The Caldwell Co. manufacturing its own products. With the change in business operations, The Caldwell Co. quickly changed their name to Americhem Inc. The newly named company began regularly producing their own products in 1960. With funding from issuance of bonds, Americhem was able to develop a number of new commercial products. By the end of 1964, Americhem was manufacturing color concentrates for ABS, many of which were used for the RV industry. In July 1965, Americhem Headquarters was moved to a new building in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was also an expansion with manufacturing in 1969 when a new plant was purchased in Medina, OH. Also in 1969, Americhem designed and manufactured the first masterbatches for vinyl siding. This marked the company’s first step into the building products industry. Americhem then {{became a member of the}} Vinyl Siding Institute and helped invent tests along with standards for weathering and durability that are still used today. Americhem was one of the first companies to use IBM System/3 computers and ACS Color Matching computers that were installed in 1972. Then in 1973, they opened their first out of state plant located in Elgin, Illinois. This plant eventually became the new location of the Medina, OH plant. The 1973 oil crisis devastated the automotive industry, which in turn severely affected sales at Americhem. During this time, Americhem gained business in the packaging and construction industries, which led to an upturn in profits. In 1974, partial owner Harvey Cooper retired, leaving ownership of Americhem Inc. to Richard Juve who became majority owner. [...] In 1978, Americhem reached a milestone when opening their first research department. The new laboratory led to the production of Americhem’s first color concentrates for synthetic fibers in response to the new developments of nylon and polyester dispersion technology. In 1987, Americhem received “Best Technical Paper” for the presentation “Weathering Metamerism: A Photochemical Process” and again in 1988 for “Refractive Index: A Key to Understanding Color Difference.” Around the same time, Americhem purchased Colourfast Plastics Ltd. in England to expand their international presence. Then, in order to be strategically located in the heart of the textile industry, Americhem opened a plant in Concord, North Carolina in 1989. Americhem opened a new plant on Steels Corners Road in Cuyahoga Falls, OH in 1998” In 2001, Americhem introduced a polyester solution dye product line for automotive interiors which still continues to be an excellent market that the company excels in. A plant was opened in 2002 located in the carpet capital of the world, Dalton, Georgia. Americhem continued to expand internationally with the establishment of the Luxembourg sales office in 2003, the Mexico City sales office in 2004, and the Suzhou, China plant that opened in 2006 and was expanded in 2014. [...] In the early 2000s, Americhem introduced the first variegated wood grain products for composite <b>deck</b> <b>board</b> applications in 2005, an outdoor color line for polyester fibers, and a low heat build-up technology for dark construction colors in 2006.In 2007, a new company logo and brand were introduced to the market.

40|$|The {{abundance}} and productivity of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton {{in the region}} of Jones Bank (Celtic Sea) were assessed in relation to potential physical and chemical drivers of the marine microbial community during July 2008 on RRS James Cook cruise JC 25. A major storm dominated {{the early part of the}} cruise; this influenced the microbial community with a decrease in diatom abundance being evident due to mixing of cells to sub euphotic zone depths. In the euphotic zone, phytoplankton was dominated by Phaeocystis cells which, with time, became constrained within a chlorophyll maximum that was located near the top of the nutricline. Multivariate statistical analyses found that temporal changes in diatom and dinoflagellate communities were significantly related to water temperature (diatoms) and nitrate concentration (dinoflagellates). Post storm, primary productivity was greatest in the Phaeocystis dominated 2 – 20 μm size fraction, but with no obvious topographically generated differences between on and off bank stations. Use of a mathematical model demonstrated the likely enhancement of productivity by the storm event, and also that this storm would have masked any topographic influence on productivity. The primary production:bacterial production ratio decreased significantly with time during the cruise, suggesting active competition by bacteria with phytoplankton for mineral nutrients. This was confirmed by a <b>deck</b> <b>board</b> enrichment experiment that demonstrated a rapid increase in bacterial productivity following supplementation of the euphotic zone microbial community with nutrient rich water collected below the mixed layer...|$|E
40|$|Between 40 % and 50 % of the Earth’s primary {{production}} occurs in marine environments, primarily by phytoplankton. The trace metal micronutrients iron, zinc and cobalt {{are known to}} exert a significant biological control on phytoplankton productivity by serving as essential active centres in enzymatic processes such as inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition. The distributions and biogeochemistries of iron, zinc and cobalt therefore, {{have the potential to}} impact upon the global carbon cycle and hence climate. This research involves investigations into the biogeochemical cycling of iron, zinc and cobalt in the Atlantic Ocean. Iron measurements were conducted during October and November 2009 to determine the distribution and biogeochemistry of iron in the upper water column of the Atlantic Ocean along an Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT- 19). In addition, <b>deck</b> <b>board</b> incubation experiments were performed to establish the role of iron in controlling rates of di-nitrogen (N 2) fixation in the North Atlantic. The distribution patterns and biogeochemistries of iron, zinc and cobalt in the South Atlantic at 40 ° S were determined during the UK GEOTRACES Section GA 10 cruises of October 2010 and December 2011 to January 2012. Iron distributions in North Atlantic surface waters were primarily controlled by the transport and deposition of atmospheric dust particles. In the North Atlantic, elevated surface dissolved iron concentrations (0. 50 - 1. 65 nM) were associated with wet and dry deposition of Saharan dust between 4 and 29 ° N. To the south of 4 ° N, surface dissolved iron concentrations were markedly reduced (0. 14 nM) indicating that high precipitation rates in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (4 - 10 ° N) formed a barrier to the large-scale transport of Saharan dust particles, thus iron, to the South Atlantic. Here, the low surface dissolved iron concentrations were balanced by a total dissolvable iron flux out of the surface mixed layer (3. 2 µmol m- 2 y- 1) that was comparable to atmospheric input estimates. Nitrogen fixation rates in the North Atlantic were highest (0. 3 – 1. 1 nmol L- 1 d- 1) where surface dissolved iron concentrations were elevated (1. 02 nM) and decreased with increasing latitude as iron decreased. Hence, iron variability in the North Atlantic was sufficient to influence nitrogen fixation over a large spatial scale. In the South Atlantic Ocean at 40 ° S, the vertical and horizontal distributions of dissolved zinc and cobalt showed distinct gradients associated with the water masses present. Zinc concentrations ranged from 15 pM in open ocean surface waters to 8 nM in Antarctic Bottom Waters, whilst cobalt ranged from 2 pM to 80 pM in intermediate waters and was scavenged in deeper waters. Growth limiting mixed layer zinc concentrations resulted from the lack of a direct return path for zinc to the South Atlantic pycnocline with Sub-Antarctic Mode Water. Low zinc in this return path was identified by a linear correlation between zinc and soluble reactive phosphorus that showed a kink at ~ 500 m, much deeper than that observed in other oceanographic regimes. A seasonal study in the Southeast Atlantic revealed that the depletion of zinc over spring-summer periods resulted in an increase in the nutritional importance of cobalt and a shift towards phytoplankton with a cellular preference for cobalt over zinc and/or the ability to co-substitute these two trace metals at the molecular level. These key findings demonstrate the physico-chemical and biological influences that interact to control the distributions and biogeochemistries of iron, zinc and cobalt across diverse oceanographic regimes of the Atlantic Ocean, provide the first examination of zinc and cobalt biogeochemistries along the productive 40 ° S parallel and highlight the need for additional research in this region.
