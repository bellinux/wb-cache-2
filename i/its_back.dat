5|$|A. r. rupicola was {{described}} by van Rossem in 1946. It {{is found in the}} mountains of southwestern Arizona. It is similar in appearance to A. r. scottii but is darker and grayer on <b>its</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{adventitious}} protection, {{an animal}} uses {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, or when a decorator crab decorates <b>its</b> <b>back</b> with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E

5|$|A. r. simulans was {{described}} by van Rossem in 1934, and it is found in northwestern Mexico from southeastern Sonora and southwestern Chihuahua to Nayarit and northern Jalisco. It has more rufous coloration on <b>its</b> <b>back</b> and is paler on its underbelly than A. r. scottii.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} and releasing The Great Milenko, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album {{within hours of}} its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the Billboard 200. It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church. The church claimed Disney was turning <b>its</b> <b>back</b> on family values.|$|E

40|$|A {{quantum state}} {{represents}} neither properties {{of a physical}} system nor anyone s knowledge of its properties. The important question is not what quantum states represent but how they are used as informational bridges. Knowing about some physical situations (<b>its</b> <b>backing</b> conditions), an agent may assign a quantum state to form expectations about other possible physical situations (its advice conditions). Quantum states are objective: only expectations based on correct state assignments are gen- erally reliable. If a quantum state represents anything, it is the objective probabilistic relations between <b>its</b> <b>backing</b> conditions and <b>its</b> advice con- ditions. This paper o¤ers an account of quantum states and their functio...|$|R

5|$|Blacknose {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks, and captives have been {{observed}} to perform an apparent threat display towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching <b>its</b> <b>back,</b> lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its jaws, and swimming with an exaggerated side-to-side motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E
5|$|Cave 8 is a difficult-to-reach dwelling. It {{consists}} of a veranda with a cell and a half cell in <b>its</b> <b>back</b> wall, both entered through the veranda. The cell has a broken door, a small window, benched recess and a peg hole. The half cell has an open front and a bench at the back.|$|E
5|$|Near the baptistery is a {{separate}} rectangular mortuary chapel (ermita de difuntos) built in 1859. A road from the mortuary chapel leads to the cemetery with stone fences. At {{the middle of the}} cemetery is a stone chapel and an ossuary at <b>its</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

50|$|With its pattern-based {{sequencing}} system, it {{is particularly}} suited for use as an accompaniment device. Unlike other sequencers in the QY series, however, the QY10 cannot auto-harmonize <b>its</b> <b>backing</b> tracks to chords played on an external MIDI keyboard.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Early Langmuir mercury {{diffusion}} pump (vertical column) and <b>its</b> <b>backing</b> pump (in background), about 1920. The {{diffusion pump}} was {{widely used in}} manufacturing vacuum tubes, the key technology which dominated the radio and electronics industry for 50 years.|$|R
5|$|New {{materials}} {{may make}} even better collectors. One such material {{is inspired by}} the Namib Desert beetle, which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere. It {{has been found that}} <b>its</b> <b>back</b> is coated with microscopic projections: the peaks are hydrophilic and the troughs are hydrophobic. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have emulated this capability by creating a textured surface that combines alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species with}} which the common toad could be {{confused}} include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down <b>its</b> <b>back</b> while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both <b>its</b> <b>back</b> and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on <b>its</b> <b>back.</b> Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also have armor, although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates. Other temnospondyls, such as Eryops, have been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may have provided stability for the spine, as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and Eryops, that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, Eryops, and dissorophids, these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E

5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has been treated as a generalized upright theropod, with a skull {{similar to that of}} other large theropods and a sail on <b>its</b> <b>back,</b> even having four-fingered hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated {{it might be}} an arrowhead {{that had been embedded}} in <b>its</b> <b>back.</b> An X-ray analysis showed it was a nail, probably of Romano-British date, that by chance had been in the ground immediately under the grave or was in soil disturbed when it was dug and {{had nothing to do with}} the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, slicing), which refers to its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on <b>its</b> <b>back</b> was a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during {{the dawn of the}} dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1999, Rampf {{returned}} to Sauber, where he became technical director on April 1, 2000. He remained in that position when Sauber {{was taken over by}} BMW in 2005, and when the company withdrew <b>its</b> <b>backing</b> in 2009.|$|R
