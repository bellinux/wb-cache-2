25|$|As the {{interests}} of historians <b>in</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> universities gained prominence in the association, other areas and activities tended to fall by the wayside.

Results indicated no significant relationship between level of <b>college</b> identity <b>and</b> career congruence, due to the limited variance <b>in</b> level of <b>college</b> identity development. Gender, marital status, and parental status did not influence this relationship. Support is provided for the developmental theory of Emerging Adulthood...|$|R

25|$|Along {{with sexual}} {{harassment}} policies <b>in</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> universities, brochures or informational handouts are often distributed, {{and there are}} often designated locations or personnel on campus where victims can report sexual harassment.

This is required of all schools who receive federal funding, not only in higher education.|$|E
25|$|As the new {{cards were}} being issued, the {{government}} had asked young people to start coming in for the new cards, {{and a number of}} Bahá'í youth had accordingly been stripped of paper identification cards. Once stripped of ID cards, the Bahá'í youth essentially become prisoners in their own homes, since the authorities often set up evening checkpoints to verify the identity of young men. Individuals without proper ID face detention. Likewise, young people without ID cards are denied entrance and continuing enrollment <b>in</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> universities, as well as service in the armed forces.|$|E

25|$|Between 1900 and 1924, {{approximately}} 1.75 million Jews {{migrated to}} America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted {{to less than}} 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, in the USA, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions <b>in</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> universities. The lynching of Leo Frank by a mob of prominent citizens in Marietta, Georgia in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States. The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the Ku Klux Klan which had been inactive since 1870.|$|E

He was teaching in the Jesuit college of Bruges, then in the Austrian Netherlands, when that institution was seized by the Austrian imperial government, and along with the other Jesuits was expelled. He moved to England, where he had charge of a small congregation, but after four years he sailed in 1779 for Demerara, in British Guiana. At length his health was almost ruined by the inclemency of the climate and the severity of his labors. He left there in January 1783, and during the voyage, fell into the hands of British Royal Navy warships, which being at sea were unaware that the Treaty of Paris had ended hostilities between Britain and the American colonies. He arrived in Maryland in April, associating himself with his Jesuit colleagues, among them John Carroll.|$|E

[...] "The greatest vice in American college life today is loafing", said Aigler. [...] "There is no doubt that this far overshadows the harm created by intercollegiate athletics. No one would be more pleased than I to see a Phi Beta Kappa (honorary scholarship society) man receive as much recognition by the public as do our leading athletes.
