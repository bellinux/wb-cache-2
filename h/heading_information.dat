5000|$|<b>Heading</b> <b>information</b> — The GNSS {{system can}} be used to {{determine}} <b>heading</b> <b>information,</b> even though it was not designed for this purpose. A [...] "GNSS compass" [...] uses a pair of antennas separated by about 50 cm to detect the phase difference in the carrier signal from a particular GNSS satellite. Given the positions of the satellite, the position of the antenna, and the phase difference, the orientation of the two antennas can be computed. More expensive GNSS compass systems use three antennas in a triangle to get three separate readings with respect to each satellite. A GNSS compass is not subject to magnetic declination as a magnetic compass is and {{does not need to be}} reset periodically like a gyrocompass. It is, however, subject to multipath effects.|$|E

The model combines the mainstream constitute and dependency parsing and the dataset {{we use it}} the Tsinghua Chinese Treebank, whose annotation has both constitutes and <b>head</b> <b>information.</b> We show the adaption of this annotation scheme to the normal constitute structure, dependency structure, and the integration of both.

Background Data-driven statistical natural language parsing techniques have seen great advance in the past decade. While most of the initial research were carried out on English, with several large-scale treebanks for different languages made avail-able in recent years, many recent studies have been focus-ing on the multi-linguality of the parsing systems.

50|$|The key {{difference}} between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an AHRS is the addition of an on-board processing system in an AHRS which provides attitude and <b>heading</b> <b>information</b> versus an IMU which just delivers sensor data to an additional device that computes attitude and heading.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} human metrology for the prediction of certain soft biometrics, viz. gender and weight. In particular, we consider geometric measurements from the head, and those from the remaining parts of the human body, and analyze their potential in predicting gender and weight. For gender prediction, the proposed model results in a 0. 7 % misclassification rate using both body and <b>head</b> <b>information,</b> 1. 0 % using only body information, and 12. 2 % using only <b>head</b> <b>information</b> on the CAESAR 1 D database consisting of 2, 369 subjects. For weight prediction, the proposed model gives 0. 01 mean absolute error (in the range 0 to 1) using both body and <b>head</b> <b>information,</b> 0. 01 using only body information, and 0. 07 using only measurements from the head. This leads to the observation that human body metrology contains enough information for reliable prediction of gender and weight. Furthermore, we {{investigate the}} efficacy of the model in practical applications, where metrology data may be missing or severely contaminated by various sources of noises.

50|$|By {{adjusting}} the window where the Doppler shift is calculated, {{it is possible}} to measure the relative velocity between the instrument and the bottom. This feature is referred to as bottom-track. The process has two parts; first identify the position of the bottom from the acoustic echo, then calculating the velocity from a window centered around the bottom position. When an ADCP is mounted on a moving ship, the bottom track velocity may be subtracted from the measured water velocity. The result is the net current profile. Bottom track provides the foundation for surveys of the water currents in coastal areas. In deep water where the acoustic signals cannot reach the bottom, the ship velocity is estimated from a more complex combination of velocity and <b>heading</b> <b>information</b> from GPS, gyro, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Each AIS {{transceiver}} {{consists of}} one VHF transmitter, two VHF TDMA receivers, one VHF Digital Selective Calling (DSC) receiver, {{and links to}} shipboard display and sensor systems via standard marine electronic communications (such as NMEA 0183, also known as IEC 61162). Timing {{is vital to the}} proper synchronization and slot mapping (transmission scheduling) for a Class A unit. Therefore, every unit is required to have an internal time base, synchronized to a global navigation satellite system (e.g. GPS) receiver. [...] This internal receiver may also be used for position information. However, position is typically provided by an external receiver such as GPS, LORAN-C or an inertial navigation system and the internal receiver is only used as a backup for position information. Other information broadcast by the AIS, if available, is electronically obtained from shipboard equipment through standard marine data connections. <b>Heading</b> <b>information,</b> position (latitude and longitude), [...] "speed over ground", and rate of turn are normally provided by all ships equipped with AIS.

5000|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1930s, single-beam {{sounders}} were used to make bathymetry maps. Today, multibeam echosounders (MBES) are typically used, which use hundreds of very narrow adjacent beams arranged in a fan-like swath of typically 90 to 170 degrees across. The tightly packed array of narrow individual beams provides very high angular resolution and accuracy. In general a wide swath, which is depth dependent, allows a boat to map more seafloor {{in less time than}} a single-beam echosounder by making fewer passes. The beams update many times per second (typically 0.1-50 Hz depending on water depth), allowing faster boat speed while maintaining 100% coverage of the seafloor. Attitude sensors allow for the correction of the boat's roll and pitch on the ocean surface, and a gyrocompass provides accurate <b>heading</b> <b>information</b> to correct for vessel yaw. (Most modern MBES systems use an integrated motion-sensor and position system that measures yaw {{as well as the other}} dynamics and position.) A boat-mounted Global Positioning System (GPS) (or other Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)) positions the soundings with respect to the surface of the earth. Sound speed profiles (speed of sound in water as a function of depth) of the water column correct for refraction or [...] "ray-bending" [...] of the sound waves owing to non-uniform water column characteristics such as temperature, conductivity, and pressure. A computer system processes all the data, correcting for all of the above factors as well as for the angle of each individual beam. The resulting sounding measurements are then processed either manually, semi-automatically or automatically (in limited circumstances) to produce a map of the area. [...] a number of different outputs are generated, including a sub-set of the original measurements that satisfy some conditions (e.g., most representative likely soundings, shallowest in a region, etc.) or integrated Digital Terrain Models (DTM) (e.g., a regular or irregular grid of points connected into a surface). Historically, selection of measurements was more common in hydrographic applications while DTM construction was used for engineering surveys, geology, flow modeling, etc. Since ca. 2003-2005, DTMs have become more accepted in hydrographic practice.|$|E
40|$|This paper extends an {{algorithm}} that exploits multipath propagation {{for position}} estimation of mobile receivers named Channel-SLAM. Channel-SLAM treats multipath components (MPCs) as signals from virtual transmitters (VTs) and estimates {{the positions of}} the VTs simultaneously with the mobile receiver positions. For Channel-SLAM it is essential to obtain angle of arrival (AoA) measurements for each MPC in order to estimate the VT positions. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel-SLAM implementation based on particle filtering which fuses <b>heading</b> <b>information</b> of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to omit AoA measurements and to improve the position accuracy. Interpreting all MPCs as signals originated from VTs, Channel-SLAM enables positioning also in non-line-of-sight situations. Furthermore, we propose a method to dynamically adapt the number of particles which significantly reduces the computational complexity. A posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound for Channel-SLAM is derived which incorporates the <b>heading</b> <b>information</b> of the inertial measurement unit (IMU). We evaluate the proposed algorithm based on measurements with a single fixed transmitter and a moving pedestrian carrying the receiver and the IMU. The evaluations show that accurate position estimation is possible without the knowledge of the physical transmitter position by exploiting MPCs and the <b>heading</b> <b>information</b> of an IMU...|$|E
