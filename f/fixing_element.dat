A new permutation technique based on distinct starter sets by employing circular and reversing operations.

40|$|Where {{two decades}} ago the talk was of {{rainwater}} catchment for household use and agricultural production, now it is of water harvesting. This approach blends revived or new technologies with modern materials and construction techniques and as the <b>fixing</b> <b>element</b> community participation. The expansion of rainwater harvesting in rural areas of Africa has been underway for some time, and a CTA study visit in Kenya in June 2000 allowed practitioners to exchange experiences. Having presented their national papers to launch their ten-day programme, 17 participants from Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia joined a community group in the Laikipia area north-west of Nairobi and observed, hands-on, {{the construction of a}} kitchen storage tank for domestic use. They also visited Machakos, south-east of Nairobi, to examine various water harvesting works for agricultural use. The visit ended with a pooling of lessons about the best uses of kitchen and underground tanks, terracing, retention techniques using plants and the sand-dam, a technology which is growing in interest. A key angle on each technology was its gender-specificity, looking at the role of women and, if any, of men. Among their findings: community contribution is essential and social mobilisation takes a long time. Then the real work began: participants returned home, clutching each other s pledges to apply, adapt and multiply what they had studied so closely. CTA study visit in Kenya in June 200...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The simple design concept {{approach}} {{and the simple}} technique of installation of external elbow hinge fixator are used {{for the treatment of}} proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures without open surgery. This device has never been tested on any patient yet since it was a new design. Application of elbow hinge fixator is easy and effective in reducing contractures of the PIP joint by soft tissue distraction. An external elbow hinge fixators can be applied as a neutralization device after open or pericutaneous reduction. It will act as an active reduction device using universal hinge mechanisms between fixation blocks. Beside that it will also act as an external scaffold which incorporates the placement of multi-axial <b>fixing</b> <b>element</b> with shanz pin to apply force through humeral. The concept of fixation rod and multiaxial placement of pins is introduced. External elbow hinged fixators are used to provide some combination of easy mobilization, and stability, as well as gradual rotating elbow motion. In open procedure situations, the external elbow hinged fixator maintains a concentric motion of the humeral articulation throughout a full range of active elbow motion. During the postoperative period a controlled gradual stretch is applied using the stopper pin on the device. The device is turned smoothly in 0 º till 135 º and can be stop at interval of every 15 º. The direction is alternated and the patient usually rests in extension overnight. The stopper pin mechanism can be released for active mobilization of the elbow...|$|E
40|$|The Tore Supra tokamak {{is being}} {{transformed}} in an x-point divertor fusion device {{in the frame}} of the WEST (W-for tungsten-Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) project, launched in support to the ITER tungsten divertor strategy. The WEST project aims to test W monoblock Plasma Facing Units (PFU) under long plasma discharge (up to 1000 s), with thermal loads of the same magnitude as those expected for ITER. Therefore the divertor is a key component of the WEST project, and so is its support structure, which has to handle strong mechanical loads. The WEST upper and lower divertor are made of 12 30 ° sectors, each one composed of 38 PFU that can be made of tungsten, CuCrZr or graphite. A generic 316 L stainless steel 30 ° conic support plate is used to hold the 38 PFU together, regardless of their material. The PFUs are fixed on the support plate thanks to 152 Xm 19 stainless steel fixing elements (4 per PFU), and in each of this <b>fixing</b> <b>element</b> an Aluminium-Nickel-Bronze alloy (Al-Ni-Br) pin is engaged in a slotted hole, in order to allow thermal expansion in the length direction of the PFU. The support plate is fixed on the divertor coil casing thanks to 10 M 10 screws. Mechanicals loads which act on the PFUs are transmitted to the support plate through the fixing elements. These loads are due to Vertical Displacement Event (VDE), disruptions and thermal expansion of the PFU. First the different load cases, PFU configurations and scenario are presented. Then an ANSYS plastic mechanical simulation is performed in order to validate the number of cycles of the support plate for each scenario: 30 000 cycles in steady-state and 3000 cycles in VDE. Finally reactions forces from the previous ANSYS simulation are used in order to calculate the stress in the M 10 screws...|$|E
40|$|Road {{design is}} carried out by highway {{planning}} authorities and engineering offices and is still separated into three elements: the horizontal and vertical alignment plans and the cross-section. The three-dimensional picture of the road, which enables road users to adapt their driving style, is not obtained until these 3 design elements are superimposed on each other. In order to avoid any possible geometric design errors caused by separate processing and the subsequent superimposition of the plans, basic mathematical and design factors {{have been developed to}} allow a three-dimensional geometrical design methodology. The three-dimensional axis consists of a sequence of three-dimensional <b>elements</b> (<b>fixed</b> <b>elements,</b> dialogue elements and coupling <b>elements).</b> <b>Fixed</b> <b>elements</b> should always be selected if it is unnecessary to introduce any variation to the course of the axis based on the design conditions. However, if the idea is to adjust the design of the road to match existing geometrical constraints to an even better degree at individual points, dialogue elements must be used. In contrast to the <b>fixed</b> <b>elements,</b> a dialogue element allows the course of the axis to be varied at individual points by altering the parameters without introducing any change to the constellation of <b>fixed</b> points. Coupling <b>elements</b> serve to link <b>fixed</b> and dialogue <b>elements.</b> Calculating the axis using three-dimensional geometrical design elements opens up new opportunities for further developing a design methodology for roads...|$|R
