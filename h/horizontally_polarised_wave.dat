40|$|The {{scattering}} of electromagnetic waves from underground tunnels is investigated analytically. A Green function approach is employed to formulate {{the problem for}} <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> incident <b>waves.</b> This approach results in an integral equation for the unknown interior field E(r) for the buried scatterer region. Expansion of the unknown E(r) field in terms of cylindrical wavefunctions is conjunction with the basic integral equation leads to an infinite set of linear equations. An analytical procedure is developed to decouple this system of equations when the excessive phaseshift inside the scattering region is small. This determines the inner field E(r) of the scatterer. In order to compute the scattered field for the far-field region a steepest descent integration technique is employed. Numerical results are obtained for several cases and are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{propagation}} of <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> shear <b>waves</b> due to a point source in a magnetoelastic self-reinforced layer lying over a heterogeneous self-reinforced half-space. The heterogeneity is caused by consideration of quadratic variation in rigidity. The methodology employed combines an efficient derivation for Green’s functions based on algebraic transformations with the perturbation approach. Dispersion equation has been obtained in the closed form. The dispersion curves are compared for different values of magnetoelastic coupling parameters and inhomogeneity parameters. Also, the comparative study is being made through graphs to find the effect of reinforcement over the reinforced-free case on the phase velocity. It is observed that the dispersion equation is in assertion with the classical Love-type wave equation {{in the absence of}} reinforcement, magnetic field and heterogeneity. Moreover, some important peculiarities have been observed in graphs...|$|R
40|$|While {{observations}} and modelling of seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle offers {{the possibility of}} imaging mantle flow close to the core mantle boundary, current models do not explain all observations. Here, we seek to explain a long-wavelength pattern of shear wave anisotropy observed in anisotropic tomography where vertically <b>polarised</b> shear <b>waves</b> travel faster than <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> shear <b>waves</b> in the central Pacific and under Africa but this pattern is reversed elsewhere. In particular, we test an explanation derived from experiments on analogues, which suggest that texture may be inherited during phase transitions between bridgmanite (perovskite structured MgSiO 3) and post-perovskite, and that such texture inheritance may yield the long-wavelength pattern of anisotropy. We find that models that include this effect correlate better with tomographic models than those that assume deformation due to a single phase in the lowermost mantle, supporting the idea that texture inheritance {{is an important factor}} in understanding lowermost mantle anisotropy. It is possible that anisotropy could be used to map the post-perovskite stability field in the lowermost mantle, and thus place constraints on the temperature structure above the core-mantle boundary...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis involves the absorption in the human head of microwaves in the frequency range 0. 5 to 3 GHz with the excitation positioned {{in front of the}} face. It is hypothesised that metallic spectacles can significantly affect the absorption in the head. The effects of metallic spectacles have been primarily investigated using computer modelling. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is the most common computational tool used in bioelectromagnetics. For this research an independent, specially written FDTD code has been used. The accuracy of the code was carefully validated against controls. Two anatomically accurate heads were implemented into the FDTD code. Different shapes and sizes of metallic spectacles were modelled. The materials that the spectacles were made of were also investigated. Realistic and geometric spectacles were considered. Vertically and <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> plane <b>waves</b> as well as vertically and horizontally orientated dipoles are used as sources. A genetic algorithm (GA) was employed as a search technique to optimise the spectacles for the specific absorption rates (SAR) in the eyes and the head.

This model encompasses QCM and other classes of acoustic wave devices based on a shear motion of the substrate surface and is also valid whether the coating film has a liquid or solid character. As a specific example, the transition of a coating from liquid to solid is modelled using a single relaxation time Maxwell model. The correspondence between parameters from this physical model and parameters from alternative acoustic impedance models is given explicitly.

40|$|Publicado online: Sept. 2016 (Vol. 0, Issue 0) The {{response}} of wind turbines is induced by dynamic loads such as wind, transient and cyclic loads, and also extreme loads such as earthquakes. Thus, the structural design requires an accurate {{evaluation of the}} modal parameters of the system because it is strongly required that no resonances are excited. Moreover, it has been concluded from previous research works that soil–structure interaction (SSI) should be accounted for the analysis. In the present paper, the structural dynamic {{response of}} wind turbine towers is investigated considering different soil conditions using a numerical model. This research is focused on SSI effects. Firstly, changes in the modal parameters of three different wind turbines considering the effect of three soils are evaluated. The {{results show that the}} evaluation of the natural frequency and the resulting classification of the wind turbine design type can be affected by SSI. The obtained results could be used to evaluate the decrement of the natural frequency of the wind turbine account for the soil and the foundation in relation to the frequency computed without soil interaction.

It gives a situation report {{of the state of}} the art in science and technology, placing a special emphasis on the mathematical numerical modeling of sound propagation in anisotropic materials, state of the art of practical testing, and on technical codes and their application. The current stage of progress in modeling test situations as realistically as possible is successfully demonstrated by sample experiments for the examples of the EFIT Code in the case of isotropic and AGWP Code in the case of anisotropic (transversally isotropic) materials. The study also takes up the idea of compensating sound field distortions in order to increase the signal-to-noise distance and presents first results on this. It is concluded that simulation of real test situations, especially modeling of <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> transversal <b>waves,</b> and compensation of sound field distortions by means of adaptive acoustics or adapted reconstruction algorithms represent new tools for improving ultrasound testing of austenitic welds.

40|$|The {{advent of}} body worn devices {{and the use}} of them {{for a wide range of}} applications, from {{entertainment}} to military purposes, indicate the need to investigate to the behaviour of antennas and wave propagation on the body in depth. Knowledge and understanding and of the on-body channel can lead to the design of efficient antennas and systems for wearable devices. The objective of this work is to identify the propagation mechanism on the body for different polarisation states at 2. 45 GHz. In particular, the effect of the body on the antenna performance with normal and parallel polarisation is studied and their capability in launching surface waves is evaluated. It is shown that both vertically and <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> antennas can launch a transverse magnetic (TM) Norton surface wave mode regardless of their polarisation states. However, <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> antennas do not launch the wave as strongly as vertically polarised antennas. Also, the change in the far field and near field behaviour of the antennas such as a dipole in proximity to the body is investigated and the observations lead to the design of a novel surface wave parasitic array. This new antenna is directive and can increase the path gain by almost 10 dB compared to other planar antennas. In addition, the effect of the polarization of the antenna on channel path gain is studied and channel cross polarization discrimination is quantified, using both simulation and measurement.

Here, we implement a snow layer in our emission model and investigate how snow influences L-band brightness temperatures and whether it is possible to retrieve snow thickness over thick Arctic sea ice from SMOS data. We find that the brightness temperatures above snow-covered sea ice are higher than above bare sea ice and that horizontal polarisation is more affected by the snow layer than vertical polarisation. In accordance with our theoretical investigations, the root mean square deviation between simulated and observed <b>horizontally</b> <b>polarised</b> brightness temperatures decreases from 20. 0 K to 4. 4 K, when we include the snow layer in the simulations. Under cold Arctic conditions we find brightness temperatures to increase with increasing snow thickness. Because dry snow is almost transparent in L-band, this brightness temperature's dependence on snow thickness origins from the thermal insulation of snow and its dependence on the snow layer thickness. This temperature effect allows us to retrieve snow thickness over thick sea ice.
