40|$|This article {{contains}} {{a comprehensive review of}} competition advocacy powers and interventions adopted by the Italian Competition Authority over recent years with their relative success rates. Namely, the article first describes the set of traditional advocacy tools available to the Authority in order to fight the public restrictions of competition, and notes that it has been strongly strengthened in recent years as a result of important legislative innovations. Second, it analyses and elaborates on the success rates of advocacy decisions issued over the period 2013 - 2014. In this analysis, outcomes are considered positive (or partially positive) when the public administrations or legislators, national or local, have decided to comply (fully or partly) with the advice given in the opinions. On the whole, the analysis shows levels and figures of success rates outperforming the negative responses, especially when the Authority intervenes while the decision processes - of administrative or legislative acts - is ongoing, in particular when the Authority is asked for opinions, rather than issuing guidance on its own. A consultative role in competition matters can be clearly drawn for the Authority, which can provide interesting cues for competition advocacy policies in the future. Third, the article pays special attention to the new competences introduced by the legislature in 2011 and 2012, with regard respectively to Article 21 -bis of the Law No. 287 / 90 which assigned to the Authority the power to take legal action against <b>general</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions,</b> regulations or measures of any public administration which unreasonably restrict competition; and to art. 4 of the Decree-Law n. 1 / 2012 under which the Authority can issue opinions to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers with respect to regional laws that unduly restrict competition, aimed at challenging them before the Constitutional Court. Also in this case, the success rates of the implementation of such articles show results encouraging the Authority to continue its pursuit of this goal...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Congress required the Small Business Administration (SBA) to implement a total of eight <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> to help facilitate small business lending and enhance liquidity in the secondary markets. These <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> include (1) temporarily requiring SBA to reduce or eliminate certain fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans; (2) temporarily increasing the maximum 7 (a) guarantee from 85 percent to 90 percent; and (3) implementing provisions designed specifically to facilitate secondary markets, such as extending existing guarantees in the 504 program and making loans to systemically important brokerdealers that operate in the 7 (a) secondary market. Further, ARRA established deadlines for SBA to issue regulations that implement certain <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as those pertaining to facilitating secondary market activities. Specifically, ARRA required SBA to issue regulations extending the guarantee related to the 504 program within 15 days after enactment (March 4, 2009) and for making loans to systemically important broker-dealers within 30 days after enactment (March 19, 2009). ARRA also mandates that we report within 60 days after the date of enactment, April 17, 2009, on SBA's initial efforts to comply with these provisions. In response, this report (1) summarizes key activities undertaken by the Administrator of SBA to implement the <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> including establishment of project plans with timelines for fulfilling responsibilities, and (2) analyze whether the Administrator is accomplishing the purpose of increasing liquidity in the secondary markets for SBA loans. Because SBA's efforts are still in their early stages, we agreed with the staffs of the House and Senate Committees on Small Business to focus our work on four key <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> {{for the purposes of}} this report. These four provisions are eliminating or reducing fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans, extending the existing guarantee on 7 (a) loans, and taking two specific steps to facilitate activities in the secondary markets: extending the guarantee on 504 financing and making loans to systemically important broker-dealers. However, consistent with ARRA's requirements, we are also providing information on the status of SBA's implementation of the other four <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions.</b> ...|$|R
