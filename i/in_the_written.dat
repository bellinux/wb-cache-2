5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> version.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{is one of}} the world's oldest {{prepared}} beverages, possibly {{dating back}} to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC , when cereal was first farmed, and is recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> history of ancient Iraq and ancient Egypt. Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations. Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.|$|E

Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the {{vigilant}} protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells {{of a man who}} wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him {{that he was in the}} valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> , <b>written</b> in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of Pennebaker’s Writing Technique as an adjunct to physiotherapy. Design: Forty outpatients with muscolo-skeletal pain were treated with Mézières physiotherapy for 10 sessions. Half of <b>the</b> subjects also <b>wrote</b> about difficult life experiences in 4 of these sessions. Results: Although both <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> and Non-Writing groups displayed lower pain scores after physiotherapy, the difference was greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> group. Pain scores continued to decrease 6 months after physiotherapy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> group alone. <b>The</b> postural evaluation revealed a greater improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> group than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Non-Writing group, while the TAS- 20 and SCL- 90 scores decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> Group alone. Conclusions: These results indicate that Pennebaker’s Writing Technique is an effective adjunct to physiotherapy insofar as it improves health at both the physical and psychological levels...|$|R

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic {{identity of the}} ancient Macedonians. Ernst Badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> speeches of Arrian, who lived {{at the time of}} the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E
