25|$|Many {{conservative}} Southern Democrats {{defected to}} the Republican Party, {{beginning with the}} passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the general leftward shift of the party. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, Kent Hance and Ralph Hall of Texas, and Richard Shelby of Alabama are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the Republican Party is often cited as a reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP's</b> shift further to the right during the late 20th century, as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.|$|R

25|$|When McCarthy {{became a}} {{dominant}} voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed {{thousands of dollars}} to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the Senate race of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush's campaign, {{which for}} months had {{dominated}} in polling, money and endorsements on the Republican side, suffered a blow when John McCain, {{who had been}} surging in late polls, ended up beating the governor in the Granite State by more than 18 points. The result forecast a tough two-man race <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> nomination, which would carry on until Super Tuesday in March. Al Gore helped himself with a narrow win in the Democratic primary, which somewhat assuaged his supporters' concerns about Bill Bradley's insurgent campaign.|$|E

25|$|At {{the state}} level, {{the pattern of}} split ticket voting and divided {{government}} holds. Democrats currently hold one of the state's U.S. Senate seats, as well as {{four of the five}} statewide offices (Governor, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Secretary of State and State Auditor). The lone congressional district has been Republican since 1996 and in 2014 Steve Daines won one of the state's Senate seats <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP.</b> The Legislative branch had split party control between the house and senate most years between 2004 and 2010, when the mid-term elections returned both branches to Republican control. The state Senate is, as of 2015, controlled by the Republicans 29 to 21, and the State House of Representatives at 59 to 41. Historically, Republicans are strongest in the east, while Democrats are strongest in the west.|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{experience}} in military matters {{made him a}} very popular figure with both American political parties. Many Democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many Republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Put forth as a potential Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in the 1992 U.S. presidential election or even potentially replacing Vice President Dan Quayle as the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Powell eventually declared himself a Republican and began to campaign for Republican candidates in 1995. He was touted as a possible opponent of Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. presidential election, possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in Iowa and even leading New Hampshire polls <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> nomination, but Powell declined, citing a lack of passion for politics. Powell defeated Clinton 50â€“38 in a hypothetical match-up proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on Election Day. Despite not standing in the race, Powell won the Republican New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary on write-in votes.|$|E
25|$|With Vice President Dick Cheney {{choosing}} not to {{seek the}} nomination and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ruling herself out, {{the race for the}} 2008 presidential nomination was wide open. It officially began in March 2006 when John H. Cox became the first candidate to enter the 2008 race. The Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and President Bush's unpopularity were strong issues <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> field. At the beginning of 2007, the announced Republican field was former Governor of Wisconsin and Cabinet member Tommy Thompson, former Governor of Virginia Jim Gilmore, and Senator of Kansas Sam Brownback. Former senator of Virginia George Allen was considered a top contender until his loss in the midterm elections. He announced on December 10, 2006 that he would not seek the 2008 nomination. In early January former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney announced he was forming an exploratory committee. Afterwards several others announced they were running, including U.S.Congressman Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, Rudy Giuliani of New York City, U.S. Senator John McCain, U.S. Congressman Duncan Hunter, and U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo. A poll released in early February had Giuliani leading with 32% and John McCain second with 18%. By early March, Giuliani had become the frontrunner. Alan Keyes and former Senator and actor Fred Thompson entered the race later in September.|$|E

Morton directed Ford's campaign until August 25, 1976, when he was reassigned as chairman of a steering committee and was replaced by James Baker of Houston, Texas. [...] Morton's demotion was at his own request; he said that he no longer wished to bear [...] "the responsibility and accountability of the chairmanship". However, former Nixon aide Harry S.
