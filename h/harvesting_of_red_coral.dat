[...] 14 pages, 9 figuresThe {{history of the}} {{research}} on the Mediterranean <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> (Corallium rubrum L 1758) is strictly intertwined with that <b>of</b> <b>harvesting.</b> For more than three centuries all the information on <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> habitat and all the material examined by naturalists was gathered by fishermen; moreover, the oscillating succession <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> fishing vicissitudes deeply affected the development <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> research. Up to the XVII century, <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> was considered to be a plant, and the first naturalist who stated the animal nature <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> was the Neapolitan alchemist Farinella, and only subsequently Peyssonel in 1723 confirmed this statement. A following milestone in <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> research was the beautiful book of the French scientist Lacaze-Duthiers, who, in 1864 published: History naturelle du corail. Only {{in the second half of}} the XX century the research on <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> started again and in situ researches were carried out by Laborel and Vacelet (1958, 1961) and Weinberg (1978, 1979 a, 1979 b), who described the sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> to light, sedimentation, hydrodynamics, and the <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> habitat selectivity. In the same period, a team of Italian researchers (Barletta, Marchetti, Vighi 1968) described, on the basis of data collected directly by SCUBA diving, several <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> populations living in shallow-waters (between 20 and 50 meter depth) along the Italian coasts. Moreover, they described for the fist time the reproductive cycle of this species. In 1986, Spanish researchers (Rodriquez and Massò 1986) described <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> population size structure and allometric relationships on the basis of Catalan fishing crops; moreover, they try to determine the age <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> colonies. In 1991 and 1994, after two meetings organised by FAO in Torre del Greco and Alger, and the submission of a Spanish proposal to include <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> in CITES Appendix-II, new impulse was given to <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> research by the Italian Government, who funded two preliminary research projects. These researches led to two basic books on <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> biology and ecology (Red coral in the Mediterranean Sea, Art history and Science 1993; Red Coral and other Mediterranean Octocorals: Biology and Protection 1999). It will be worth to remember that nearly all the papers already published deal with shallow-water populations which have a limited economic value. More recently <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> research was addressed towards the study of population structure and dynamics by means of demographic models (Abbiati et al. 1992; Santangelo et al. 2004, 2007; Bramanti et al. 2009). This approach, widely applied in Conservation Ecology, will supply the tools to match harvesting to population growth rate fostering both conservation and rational management of the populations of this precious species, if sound data on deep-dwelling populations will be at least gathered and enforcement will be really applied at local population levelPeer Reviewe...|$|R

[...] 6 pages, 3 figuresRecovery of coral populations {{is a slow}} process, {{especially}} in Mediterranean Sea where octocorals, characterized by slow growth rates, are dominant. Until now, restoration techniques are based on transplantation, a technique requiring high degree of manipulation leading to high colony mortality. Mediterranean <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> (Corallium rubrum, L 1758) is a long-lived, slow-growing gorgonian, endemic to Mediterranean rocky shores. Its high economic value determined over-harvesting which brought many coastal, shallow-water populations to depletion. Moreover, shallow-water populations could be extremely vulnerable to mass mortality events putatively linked to global warming. Therefore, these populations need conservation and restoration actions. Due to their fragility, transplantation of adult colonies does not give any effective result. Within this framework we set out a method suitable to foster <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> recruitment on artificial, carbonatic substrates (marble tiles), following a patented protocol. This protocol allowed <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> larvae settlement and growth on marble tiles. In {{the framework of a}} study carried out in Italy with 54 100 cm 2 marble tiles, overall, 388 settlers colonized the tiles and their densities varied between 12. 37 ± 6. 1 and 2. 75 ± 2. 4 dm- 2. Even if mortality affected these colonies (24. 35 ± 9. 12 colonies % y- 1), after 4 years the tiles still harbored a persistent population (19 ± 4. 97 dm- 2) with positive net-recruitment rates (recruitment-mortality). As permanently colonized tiles may easily be removed and fixed again in new areas by a central screw, <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> re-colonization may be fostered by transferring and re-fixing tiles in areas depleted <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> colonies. Moreover, none of the colonies settled on such tiles was affected by boring sponges, which are one of the main sources <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> mortality and also reduce their economic value.

40|$|The {{precious}} octocoral, Corallium rubrum, {{endemic to}} the Mediterranean, {{has long been}} overexploited. A demographic approach to the conservation and management of this species would therefore be highly valuable. To this end, a coastal population <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> was studied in detail. The population represents a true "genetic unit", as it is mainly "self-seeding". It is moreover gonocoric, and the sex ratio is significantly biased toward females. For this study, 4408 colonies, collected from 28, 300 -cm 2 samples, were divided into 10 size (age) classes. Recruits represent about half the population. The frequency of colonies in each class decreases exponentially with colony size. On these bases, an "ad hoc" life history table has been updated to include the mortality and reproduction coefficients actually measured in the population. The major reproductive output {{is due to the}} first 3 reproductive classes (79 %), while larger colonies, although having higher reproductive coefficients, are sparse and only account for {{a small portion of the}} population overall reproductive output.

Corallium rubrum is a long-lived gorgonian coral that has been commercially harvested since ancient times for its red axial calcitic skeleton and which, at present, {{is thought to be}} in decline because of overexploitation. The depth distribution of C. rubrum is known to range from c. 15 to 300 m. Recently, live <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> colonies have been observed in the Strait of Sicily at depths of c. 600 – 800 m. This record sheds new light on the ecology, biology, biogeography and dispersal mechanism of this species and calls for an evaluation of the genetic divergence occurring among highly fragmented populations. A genetic characterization <b>of</b> the deep-sea <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> colonies has been done to investigate biological processes affecting dispersal and population resilience, as well as to define the level of isolation ⁄ differentiation between shallow- and deep-water populations of the Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|The Mediterranean <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> (Corallium rubrum, L. 1758) is a characteristical gorgonian {{living in}} semidark {{habitats}} in the coralligenous zone of sublittoral hard bottoms. Despite being harvested commercially {{for the use}} <b>of</b> its <b>red</b> calcium carbonate skeleton in the jewelery industry, its ecology is still little understood. Thus {{the objective of this}} study was to increase knowledge on the population structure, reproduction and feeding ecology <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> and to use these data to evaluate the efficiency of current management strategies of this species. The size/age structure of a population records valuable information, summarising the effects of mortality, recruitment and growth of past years. The six studied populations at the Costa Brava (NE Spain) consisted mainly of small/young colonies, as larger colonies are commercially exploited. Average size and age were estimated at 3 cm height and 7. 5 years, whereas the species is capable of reaching 50 cm and 100 years. Furthermore, these young populations consist of colonies that have developed only few branches, offering considerably less three dimensional structure to the ecosystem than unharvested populations. One of the studied populations is located in a protected area, the Medas Islands Marine Park, and consisted of significantly larger/older colonies, thus allowing to distinguish harvesting effects from environmental ones. The reproductive output <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> was found to significantly depend on colony size, having important implications for its management. Another aspect of potential importance for optimal harvesting is mesoscale variation of reproductive output. In a comparison of eight stations, however, we did not find significant differences, indicatig a homogenous reproduction. Colonies in deep water were found to spawn slightly earlier than shallow water ones, however, this phenomenon was observed only when temperature stratification in summer was particularly pronounced. Yet depth was not found to affect reproductive output itself, again in contrast to the demographic features. The trophic ecology is one of the key aspects of the biology of an organism, helping to understand its demography and reproductive biology. The main proportion of the diet of Corallium rubrum was found to be particulate organic matter, while crustaceans such as copepods played a smaller role due to the irregular capture. Red coral appear to be able to meet their energy requirements by constant access of resuspended detritic material, while taking advantage of occasional capture of large zooplankters. Prey capture rate per polyp is higher in small colonies, and also in colonies situated in deep water. We did not find a clear seasonal pattern in <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> feeding, as observed in some gorgonians, which indicates that changes in water movement have a stronger effect on the prey capture rate than the seasonal succession of the plankton. The grazing impact <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> populations was estimated to be lower than that by other gorgonians, which is a result of its population structure being dominated by small colonies. Ecological data like those presented in this study are the base for ecosystem management, as they allow to calculate the secondary production of a population. We therefore used the demography and reproduction data to provide managment recommendations for <b>red</b> <b>coral,</b> by using the Beverton-Holt fishery management model to calculate maximum sustainable yield. The results show that the <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> fishery at the Costa Brava would reach its maximum yield only at a considerable age of first capture, whereas the colonies are harvested at a much younger age. This results in an estimated annual catch that is only a fraction of what could be harvested using an optimised management strategy. Furthermore, harvesting at this age provides a short reproductive period before capture, compared for example to the sustainable fishery of black coral in Hawaii. The comparison of calculated and declared harvests indicates considerable poaching activities and undeclared harvest. Finally, a recent rise in mortality confirms a non-sustainable level <b>of</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Concluding, the results confirm the paramount importance of data on the reproductive biology and population structure of a species for its management. In this study we investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>harvesting,</b> spacial mesoscale variability and depth on the population structure, reproduction and feeding ecology <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>coral.</b> The data show that <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> populations at the Costa Brava are very young and have a diminished reproductive potential due to overharvesting, yet show a considerable impact on the seston.

In order to determine patterns of genetic spatial structuring of deep water Corallium rubrum populations, for the first time, colonies found between 58 - 118 m depth within the Tyrrhenian Sea were collected and analyzed. Ten microsatellite loci and two regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtMSH and mtC) were used to quantify patterns of genetic diversity within populations and to define population structuring at spatial scales from tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres. Microsatellites showed heterozygote deficiencies in all populations. Significant levels of genetic differentiation were observed at all investigated spatial scales, suggesting that populations are likely to be isolated. This differentiation may by the results of biological interactions, occurring within a small spatial scale and/or abiotic factors acting at a larger scale. Mitochondrial markers revealed significant genetic structuring at spatial scales greater then 100 km showing the occurrence of a barrier to gene flow between northern and southern Tyrrhenian populations.
