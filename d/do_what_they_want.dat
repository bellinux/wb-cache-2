500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the central theme}} of Batman, director Tim Burton explained, [...] "the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It's a fight between two disturbed people", adding that [...] "The Joker {{is such a great}} character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want...</b> They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you're not bound by the laws of society".|$|E
500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> then choosing the dark path." [...] The author only started to support the direction the project was taking once Bekmambetov [...] "came in with his Eastern European madness" [...] and the intention of coming closer to the spirit of the book. Bekmambetov said that he would take liberty in adapting the comic book's world: [...] "It’s difficult for me to just follow. It’s interesting for me to create. I feel a little bit different how this world has to be executed". In July 2006, screenwriter Chris Morgan was hired to revise the third act of the Wanted script written by Haas and Brandt.|$|E

[...] a major problem [...] People at the highest levels of the military are involved in the facilitation [...] In other African countries government officials are part of the problem. In Guinea-Bissau, it is the government itself that is the problem." [...] A sentiment echoed by regional UN staff. The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre Lapaque also said: [...] "There has clearly been an increase in Guinea-Bissau in the last several months. We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country;" [...] while the EU's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez-Ducay added: [...] "As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d’état.

500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> him to do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted somebody like Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in {{the point of view of}} the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism, though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the pride}} parade, Libertatea sought to {{investigate}} {{the opinion of the}} public with regard to the event. According to its findings, the majority of those interviewed saw the parade as something [...] "perfectly normal in a democratic country". One passer-by stated, [...] "It's good that they're expressing their views. It's their business what sexual inclinations they have. As long as they don't affect me with anything, they can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> If the City Hall gave them permission to organise a meeting, why wouldn't they do it? Today, people hold meetings for everything." [...] Another interviewee remarked, [...] "Their manifestation doesn't affect me in any way. They can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> if the City Hall gave them the right. They can affirm their opinions, they can ask for their rights, since we live in a free country." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Season 6, a new {{aspect of}} Endurance called the Magic Box was introduced. This is a {{challenge}} where teams compete {{for the chance to}} gain an advantage over the other teams. Leslie Powell and Will Cuddy (the Green team) won the first Magic Box in the episode [...] "Mana Kisi". Inside, the Magic Box contained one free round at the Temple of Fate, to be used before the Temple of Fate challenge begins. In addition to winning a Magic Box, teams are allowed to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with the information given. They decided to lie about it.

[...] When\ questioned about homosexuality in another interview conducted during the 2007 GayFest, he stated, [...] "They can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want...</b> marry... I don't have anything against that". On the question of whether he would accept a gay person in the New Generation Party (Romania)New Generation Party of which he is president, Becali replied [...] "But why would I have a problem with that?

25|$|Despite Piye's {{successful}} campaign {{into the}} Delta, his authority only extended northward from Thebes {{up to the}} western desert oases and Herakleopolis where Peftjauawybast ruled as a Nubian vassal king.

It was Shabaka, Piye's successor, who later rectified this unsatisfactory situation by attacking Sais and defeating Tefnakht's successor Bakenranef there, in his second regnal year.|$|R
2500|$|The Culture {{stories are}} largely about {{problems}} and paradoxes that confront liberal societies. The Culture itself is an [...] "ideal-typical" [...] liberal society; that is, as pure an example {{as one can}} reasonably imagine. It is highly egalitarian; the liberty of the individual is its most important value; and all actions and decisions {{are expected to be}} determined according to a standard of reasonability and sociability inculcated into all people through a progressive system of education. It is a society so beyond material scarcity that for almost all practical purposes its people can have and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> If they do not like the behavior or opinions of others, they can easily move to a more congenial Culture population centre (or Culture subgroup), and hence there is little need to enforce codes of behavior.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiative}} to dramatize the novel {{was taken by}} two prop masters, Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli. They both invested half a million Norwegian krone (NOK) in the project, financed by mortgaging their homes. Neither had any experience as producers. Alveberg stated that his main motivation was him being tired of all Norwegian films being social realism. He stated that [...] "the story could have taken place, and maybe it has taken place. We all know that the Russians <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> on Svalbard." [...] Alveberg first attempted to write the screenplay himself but was not satisfied. He presented the screenplay for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; although they liked the project, they did not feel {{it was in the}} scope of the public broadcaster. Norway did not at the time have screenwriters of international standards, and Alveberg decided not to use his film as a training ground. He therefore hired the experienced British screenwriter Richard Harris.|$|E
2500|$|The Liber Iudiciorum makes several {{striking}} {{differences from}} Roman law, especially concerning {{the issue of}} inheritance. [...] According to the Liber Iudiciorum, if incest is committed, the children can still inherit, whereas in Roman law the children were disinherited and could not succeed. [...] Title II of Book IV outlines the issue of inheritance under the newly united Visigothic Code: section 1, for instance, states that sons and daughters inherit equally if their parents die instate, section 4 says that all family members should inherit if no will exists to express {{the intentions of the}} deceased, and the final section expresses a global law of Recceswinth, stating that anyone left without heirs has the power to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with their possessions. [...] This statement recalls the Roman right for a person to leave his possessions to anyone in his will, except this Visigothic law emphasizes males and females equally, whereas, in Roman law, only males (particularly the pater familias) are allowed to make a will.|$|E

[...] "Obviously, I'm very disappointed", he said. [...] " [...] year was a little bittersweet", he said.

2500|$|On May 26, 2006, Becali's {{personal}} foundation, the [...] "George Becali Christian Foundation", {{along with}} the Romanian Orthodox Church and 22 NGOs, signed a protest letter calling on {{the government and the}} courts to ban the Bucharest GayFest 2006 parade, focused that year on the theme of same-sex unions. A few days later, the Bucharest Court of Appeals ruled, however, that the parade was legal, and it was ensured significant police protection. Becali justified his opposition to the pride parade by stating that he [...] "doesn't discriminate against homosexuals" [...] but that, [...] "They abuse their rights. This is proselytism. They can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> in their homes, but not on the streets. I call on the Romanian Orthodox Church to defend the Christian faith and morals". Becali declared that he intended to pay for a referendum on same-sex marriage, which he believed 99% of people would vote against. He was also widely criticized in the media for asking, [...] "Why [...] so many homosexuals? I'll give two or five million dollars , so we can finish off all homosexuals in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|To an extent, Mahagonny is {{an opera}} that satirizes operas. Brecht said that [...] "t attacks {{the society that}} needs operas of such a sort" [...] and Weill said that it [...] "pays {{conscious}} tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and Mahagonny in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the deus ex machina tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the [...] "love" [...] is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The [...] "Mandalay Song" [...] also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In Mahagonny, operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.|$|E
