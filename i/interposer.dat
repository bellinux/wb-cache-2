25|$|When the typist {{presses a}} key, a pawl {{on the key}} lever {{depresses}} a matching metal bar (<b>interposer)</b> for that key. The <b>interposer,</b> which is oriented front to back in the machine, has one or more short projections (lugs) protruding from its bottom edge. Each <b>interposer</b> has a unique combination of lugs, corresponding to the binary code for the desired character. Each <b>interposer</b> also has a tab that slots in between loose steel balls in a race, the size of balls and race selected precisely to leave a total gap barely larger than {{the width of the}} <b>interposer</b> tab, such that only one <b>interposer</b> tab can fit in the free space and thus only one letter can be selected at a time.|$|E
25|$|After a {{character}} is struck on the paper, the mechanism is reset, including replacing all latches on their bails and moving the <b>interposer</b> back into position. If the key that was pressed is still down at this time, the <b>interposer</b> rotates the keylever pawl {{out of the}} way to prevent key repeat until the key is released and depressed again, starting the next cycle.|$|E
2500|$|The machine had {{a feature}} called [...] "Stroke Storage" [...] that {{prevented}} two keys from being depressed simultaneously. When a key was depressed, an <b>interposer,</b> beneath the keylever, was pushed {{down into a}} slotted tube full of small metal balls (called the [...] "compensator tube") and spring latched. These balls were adjusted to have enough horizontal space for only one <b>interposer</b> to enter at a time. (Mechanisms much like this were used in keyboards for teleprinters before World War II.) If a typist pressed two keys simultaneously both interposers were blocked from entering the tube. [...] Pressing two keys several milliseconds apart allows the first <b>interposer</b> to enter the tube, tripping a clutch which rotated a fluted shaft driving the <b>interposer</b> horizontally {{and out of the}} tube. The powered horizontal motion of the <b>interposer</b> selected the appropriate rotate and tilt of the printhead for character selection, but also made way for the second <b>interposer</b> to enter the tube some milliseconds later, well before the first character had been printed. While a full print cycle was 65 milliseconds this filtering and storage feature allowed the typist to depress keys in a more random fashion and still print the characters in the sequence entered.|$|E

5000|$|Lack of {{standards}}: There are few {{standards for}} TSV-based 3D IC design, manufacturing, and packaging, although {{this issue is}} being addressed.

40|$|<b>Interposers</b> with through-silicon vias (TSVs) play a {{key role}} in the {{three-dimensional}} integration and packaging of integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems. In the current practice of fabricating <b>interposers,</b> solder balls are placed next to the vias; however, this approach requires a large foot print for the input/output (I/O) connections. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the possibility of placing the solder balls directly on top of the vias, thereby enabling a smaller pitch between the solder balls and an increased density of the I/O connections. To reach this goal, inkjet printing (that is, piezo and super inkjet) was used to successfully fill and planarize hollow metal TSVs with a dielectric polymer. The under bump metallization (UBM) pads were also successfully printed with inkjet technology on top of the polymer-filled vias, using either Ag or Au inks. The reliability of the TSV <b>interposers</b> was investigated by a temperature cycling stress test (- 40 °C to + 125 °C). The stress test showed no impact on DC resistance of the TSVs; however, shrinkage and delamination of the polymer was observed, along with some micro-cracks in the UBM pads. For proof of concept, SnAgCu-based solder balls were jetted on the UBM pads. QC 20170510 </p...|$|R
2500|$|When the <b>interposer</b> is depressed, it engages a {{metal bar}} (cycle clutch latch link) {{that connects the}} clutch on the cycle shaft for one cycle, {{providing}} power to the filter shaft, whose lobes thrust the <b>interposer</b> towards the front (operator end) of the machine. When the <b>interposer</b> moves, each of its lugs engages one {{of a set of}} bars (selector bails) that run from left to right across the keyboard mechanism. In a machine with a North American keyboard, there are five [...] "negative logic" [...] selector bails (two for tilt and three for rotation), and one [...] "positive logic" [...] bail (called [...] "minus five") for accessing characters in the opposite direction of rotation.|$|E
2500|$|Interestingly, the Palomino core {{actually}} debuted {{earlier in}} the mobile market—branded as Mobile Athlon 4 with the codename [...] "Corvette". It distinctively used a ceramic <b>interposer</b> much like the Thunderbird instead of the organic pin grid array package used on all later Palomino processors.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{negative}} logic selector bail that is {{displaced by the}} <b>interposer</b> in turn pulls a latch <b>interposer</b> and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be {{pulled away from the}} latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged {{for the rest of the}} cycle, while the remaining latches take part in character selection, hence the term [...] "{{negative logic}}". The minus five selector bail pulls an <b>interposer</b> and link which causes a latch to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional [...] "low velocity" [...] selector latch is also engaged by certain keys, such as '.' and '_', which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control cam follower, which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the cam in the carrier, causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further reducing the impact.|$|E

40|$|This paper shows {{different}} approaches to use the availability of ultrathin chips for the realization of new packages with high density and improved performance. For several years technologies {{have been developed for}} the embedding of chips in circuit boards in order to achieve 3 -D-packages using conventional processes from PCB manufacturing. Ultrathin chips are suited to be integrated in rigid circuit boards as well as on and in multilayer flexible substrates.

40|$|Die {{thickness}} of common, high-volume chip stacks range between 50 - 100 m while thinning industry aims towards ultrathin chips of 10 m thickness or even below. For the first time, the required interconnect length between vertically arranged adjacent chip layers has therewith reached dimensions, {{that can be}} reasonably realized by anisotropic conductive adhesives layers (ACA). Accordingly, a three dimensional arrangement by alternate stacking of ultra thin flip chips and <b>interposers</b> using anisotropic conductive adhesive bonding technology is {{within the bounds of}} possibility, such that the conductive particles are forming the vertical interconnects between the chip-interposer layers. Based upon such assembly concept prototypes have been made within a first laboratory scale feasibility study. In combination with polyimide thin film <b>interposers,</b> ultrathin low pin count ACA bonded test chips with 4 -Point-Kelvin- and Daisy-Chainstructures have been used to build a 4 -layer flip c hip stack with a {{thickness of}} approximately 170 m without encapsulation. First electrical measurements have shown promising results. The reduction to basically one bonding technology to realize the chip-interposer- and the interposer-interposer connections {{is one of the main}} benefits with a certain low-cost potential. On the other hand, issues as limited chip/package area ratio, the demand for ultrathin chips with manifold challenges and upcoming detailed electrical characterization of such chip stacks have to be considered. Pros and cons are openly discussed. Special attraction is provided by applying and combining basically known packaging technologies to obtain an innovative but somehow simple 3 D flip chip assembly with certain future application potential...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 42 - 45) The 3 D IC integration {{technology and}} silicon <b>interposers</b> rely on through silicon vias (TSVs) for vertical interconnections. Hence, the medium carrying high frequency signals is lossy silicon (Si). Wave propagation through vertical interconnects in Si media {{has not been}} necessary before, except for the Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) planar microstriplines on RFICs. Hence, fundamental understanding of wave propagation through TSVs is lacking for successful implementation of 3 D IC integration technology {{as well as for}} the development of Si <b>interposers</b> at RF/microwave frequencies. The focus of this research is characterization and modeling of TSVs and Si to explore high speed signal propagation through the lossy Si medium. Previously, there were various opinions on the physical interpretations of the extracted RLC parameters of TSVs. The TSV capacitance, for example, is sometimes considered to be predominantly a sidewall capacitance, whereas in other works it is deemed more appropriate that the electric field lines should terminate on a ground plane below the TSV. Indeed, the capacitance changes as a function of frequency because of the slow-wave mode. To understand better the physical significance of the TSV, we will establish a framework for wave propagation through TSVs based on dielectric quasi-TEM, skin effect, and slow-wave modes similar to MIS micro-strip lines. For validation of the existence of these modes, full wave simulation results will be compared with simpler two dimensional transmission line simulators. The following topics will be discussed in this thesis: 1. Verification of the wave propagation modes in TSVs. 2. Development of equivalent circuit models for TSVs. 3. Comparative study of different TSV configuration...|$|R
