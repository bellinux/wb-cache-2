40|$|The {{apparent}} {{dielectric constant}} () of many agricultural soils, measurable with the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method, {{may be used}} to estimate soil water content () with the empirical model of Topp et al. (1980). However, organic soils and those of volcanic origin do not obey this model which has been termed “universal”. In particular, volcanic soils have singular physical properties in terms of bulk density and porosity essentially arising from the state of structural aggregation of particles of the solid mineral phase, and from the presence of <b>ferrous</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and allophanic clays with a high specific surface and high affinity with water. This led us to suppose that the retention characteristics of volcanic soils might show atypical dielectric behaviour. In this work we demonstrate that some physically-based alternative models, which include bulk density and porosity as parameters, are able to interpret the anomalous dielectric behaviour that may be observed in a volcanic-Vesuvian soil in the Campania plain (near Naples, Italy). The experimental relations -, measured in the laboratory on 16 undisturbed soil samples taken from horizons Ap/BW and 2 Ap/BW of the soil profile in question, were interpreted by using both Topp’s model as well as Maxwell’s (De Loor, 1964, 1990) and the  model of Dobson et al. (1985) which consider soil as a multi-phase system. An empirical model developed by Regalado et al. (2003) for a volcanic soil, pedologically classified as an andosol, was also taken into consideration. We found that porosity {{plays an important role in}} the dielectric response of the Vesuvian soil. Further, the andic properties of the soil examined may provide a key diagnostic criterion to estimate a priori the deviation of - relations from Topp’s model...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to report {{chemical}} and textural analyses on archaeometallurgical slags from the medieval Forlì in north Italy. Between February 2004 and August 2005 the “Cassa dei Risparmi di Forlì” Foundation successfully exploited the “Ex-Monte di Pietà” archaeological site. Twenty-two slag specimens were collected from ancient rubbish dumps that accumulated scraps from craftsmen workshops over about four centuries (Guarnieri, 2009). Slags were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive Xray spectrometry (SEM/EDS). The obtained results highlighted slags deriving from the production of both iron and copper; moreover, severely corroded iron nails was identified. In this paper, the chemical and textural characterisations of ferrous slags and nails will be discussed. Ferrous slags were glassy in aspect with quartz and charcoal fragments embedded into the matrix. The matrix was mostly formed by silicon, iron, calcium and aluminium; other elements that do not enter crystalline silicates, i. e. potassium from the charcoal and sulphur from the mineral charge were also detected. The most abundant phases in the glassy matrix were monticellite, wollastonite, fayalite, wüstite, sulphides, metals and metal alloys. The minerals probably underwent a roasting prior to smelting; moreover, melting agent {{was added to the}} mineral charge. Metallographic observations of the olivine habit and size distribution have provided information on the cooling process. In particular, olivines ranged from polyhedral-granular to acicular indicating a cooling rate of the melt lower than 60 °C/h (Ettler et al., 2009) The slag also contained large amounts of dendritic iron oxides as could be expected from the iron-rich bulk chemical compositions. Nails consisted of an iron-rich core about 0. 5 cm in diameter. The elemental composition well evidenced the structure of the core, where crystallised magnetite was admixed with a greater amount of crystalline maghemite. The core lied beneath <b>ferrous</b> oxides, <b>ferrous</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and silicates/phosphates-enriched layers probably due to fluctuations in piezometric level of the acquifer. XRD analyses enabled wustite, goethite, ferrosilite, lazulite and quartz to be distinguished (Booth et al., 1962) ...|$|R

Pers. were determined and its crude n-hexane: diethyl ether, chloroform: acetone and methanol extracts were also screened for antimicrobial activity. Results {{showed that the}} fruitbody was sessile, pileate and reflexed-effused. The pileus was applanate, concentrically zonate, with round pores and cinnamon context and the hyphal system was trimitic with oblong, yellowish colored spores. The chemical spot tests revealed that the tissue darkened with potassium hydroxide, and reacted with ferric chloride to produce brown colour. It was dextrinoid and produced characteristic colours with ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>ferrous</b> sulphate and sulphuric acid. None of the solvent extracts were active against Cladosporium herbarium. The hexane: ether and chloroform: acetone extracts were active against Pseudomonas syringae and Bacillus subtilis whereas the methanol extract {{had no effect on}} the two bacteria.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of widely used antacids (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and calcium carbonate), ferrous sulfate, and ranitidine on the absorption of a fluorinated quinolone, (-) -(S) - 9 -fluoro- 3 -methyl- 10 -(4 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) - 7 -oxo- 2, 3 -dihydro- 7 H- pyrido-[1, 2, 3,-de][1, 4]benzoxazine- 6 -carboxylic acid hemihydrate (DR- 3355), in healthy male volunteers enrolled in three separate randomized crossover studies. Study 1 used 100 -mg doses of DR- 3355 and concurrent doses of aluminum hydroxide (1 g) or magnesium oxide (500 mg), while study 2 used DR- 3355 (100 mg) and concurrent ferrous sulfate (160 mg) or calcium carbonate (1 g). Study 3 used DR- 3355 (100 mg) and concurrent ranitidine (150 mg). Each study included control doses of DR- 3355 (100 mg) alone. When aluminum <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, and magnesium oxide were coadministered with DR- 3355, the relative bioavailability of DR- 3355 was decreased to 56, 81, and 78 %, respectively, of that for DR- 3355 (100 mg) alone. Urinary excretion of DR- 3355 was also significantly decreased by coadministration of these drugs. Thus, the magnitude of the decrease in the area under the concentration-time curve for DR- 3355 varied among antacids, and the ranking of their inhibitory effects correlated with previously reported rankings of stability constants for chelate formation. DR- 3355 bioavailability was not influenced by the concurrent administration of calcium carbonate and ranitidine, indicating that changes in gastric pH do not affect DR- 3355 absorption...|$|R

30|$|However, {{the fresh}} poultry waste may contain an {{inappropriate}} C/N ratio, pathogens, an improper amount of plant nutrients, annoying odors and its application may {{slow down the}} germination of seed, lessen the growth of plant and harm the crops by rivaling for oxygen or may cause phytotoxicity to plants due to scarcity in organic matter (Chaudhry et al. 2013). Due to these concerns, the demand for humification and high cost of synthetic fertilizer, farmers prefer to adopt the organic farming techniques. Composting is a low investment technology that can transform organic waste into valuable organic matter through bio-oxidation which enhances the quality of soil for plant growth by augmenting aeration, water status, micro- and macronutrients. The compost production in Pakistan is of low quality for plants and its efficiency is also extremely poor. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to enrich the poultry waste materials for maximum nutrient availability to plants and reduce the time of humification through microbial activity. An extensive literature survey was conducted and {{it was found that}} many scientists have studied the impact of enrichment on a variety of wastes and found encouraging results during humification, nutrients’ dynamic, plant toxicity and humification/decomposition time. They used ash, lime, rock phosphate, <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, calcium <b>hydroxide</b> and peroxide (Nishanth and Biswas 2008; Himanen and Hannieen 2009; Iqbal et al. 2010, 2015, 2016; Yadav et al. 2017). Moreover, composting of poultry waste in Pakistan is currently not conducted scientifically by private contractors, where it takes 4 months to produce compost for use and their humification quality is still ambiguous. Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine the influence of aluminum sulfate and rock phosphate on poultry waste humification and uptake of compost nutrients by Abelmoschus esculentus (ladyfinger) plants in pot and incubation study.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to precipitate dissolved copper, zinc, and lead from simulated wastewater solutions as solids which could then be separated by filtration. The precipitants used were hydrated lime, as a slurry and in powdered form, aqueous ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>ferrous</b> sulphide sludge, and carbon dioxide gas. These five different chemicals, singly or in combination, were used; {{at least one of}} which was highly successful in precipitating each of the metals, removing at least 99 % of that originally present. Copper and zinc were very effectively precipitated as the hydroxides with lime, whereas lead was not. Considering lead to be the most difficult metal to remove, four other chemical conditions were attempted for lead; these were ferrous sulphide alone, lime with ferrous sulphide, lime with carbon dioxide, and lime with ozone. The precipitation of lead with ferrous sulphide alone, was only partially successful with only 95 % removal. The other three combinations of chemicals precipitated more than 99 % of the soluble lead, giving excellent results. Furthermore, because lead is usually difficult to remove from solution, it is considered that the three new chemical combinations show strong promise for the removal of other heavy metals from wastewater solutions. Experiments were also conducted to decompose the organic compounds, formaldehyde and pyridine, in simulated wastewater solutions in a mixed reactor, using ozone and UV radiation as oxidants. Although 200 ppm Total Organic Carbon content of each of those chemicals, and a mixture of both, were completely decomposed by ozone-UV oxidation, the time taken for these decompositions ranged from about three to four hours. Such prolonged reaction times are considered too long for most wastewater treating processes. However, low concentrations of organic matter might be successfully treated using ozone/UV processes...|$|R
40|$|Bioreduction of Fe(III) and {{biooxidation}} of Fe(II) {{can be used}} in wastewater engineering as {{an innovative}} biotechnology BioIronTech, which is protected for commercial applications by US patent 7393452 and Singapore patent 106658 “Compositions and methods for the treatment of wastewater and other waste”. The BioIronTech process comprises the following steps: 1) anoxic bacterial reduction of Fe(III), for example in iron ore powder; 2) surface renovation of iron ore particles due to the formation of dissolved Fe 2 + ions; 3) precipitation of insoluble ferrous salts of inorganic anions (phosphate) or organic anions (phenols and organic acids); 4) (bio) oxidation of ferrous compunds with the formation of negatively, positively, or neutrally charged ferric hydroxides, which are good adsorbents of many pollutants; 5) disposal or thermal regeration of ferric (hydr) oxide. Different organic substances can be used as electron donors in bioreduction of Fe(III). Ferrous ions and fresh <b>ferrous</b> or ferric <b>hydroxides</b> that are produced after iron bioreduction and (bio) oxidation adsorb and precipitate diferent negatively charged molecules, for example chlorinated compounds of sucralose production wastewater or other halogenated organics, as well as phenols, organic acids, phosphate, and sulphide. Reject water (return liquor) from the stage of sewage sludge dewatering on municipal wastewater treatment plants represents from 10 to 50 % of phosphorus load when being recycled to the aeration tank. BioIronTech process can remove/recover more than 90 % of phosphorous from this reject water thus replacing the conventional process of phosphate precipitation by ferric/ferrous salts, which are 20 – 100 times more expensive than iron ore, which is used in BioIronTech process. BioIronTech process can remarkably improve the aerobic and anaerobic treatments of municipal and industrial wastewaters, especially anaerobic digestion of lipid- and sulphate-containing food-processing wastewater. It can also remove the recalcitrant compounds from industrial wastewater, enhance sustainability and quality of water resources,restore eutrophicated lakes due to removal of phosphate, ammonium, and pesticides from water, and recover ammonium and phosphate from municipal and food-processing wastes...|$|R

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Low level nuclear waste arising from UK nuclear sites, research establishments, hospitals and industry is currently disposed of at the Drigg Disposal Facility in Cumbria. Waste is packed into steel canisters before being compacted and grouted into larger steel storage containers. The aqueous chemistry of wastes, especially radionuclides, {{in the presence of}} grout material is of major interest. The gout used at the Drigg site is a mixture of Ordinary Portland Cement and Pulverised Fly Ash additive, from which ingressing water will leach high levels of calcium, sodium and potassium and produce waters of a high pH. Aerobic environments are expected to dominate over the early period of the vault life, after which the combined effect of canister corrosion and microbial activity will lead to anaerobic conditions. After a much longer period (100, 000 years) anaerobic conditions may cease and yield once again an aerobic environment where migration of radionuclides may be sorption-controlled rather than on hydroxide precipitation at high pH. Work has been performed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions to study uranium solubility in the presence of complexing ligands that may be present in the waters of the nearfield of a low-level waste disposal vault. Eleven ligands have been investigated: carbonate, phosphate, chloride, sulphate, acetate, citrate, EDTA, NTA and organic matter- humic acid, fulvic acid and iso-sacchannic acid. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by two different procedures; the first used <b>ferrous</b> ions in <b>hydroxide</b> solution and the second used dithionite in hydroxide solution. Both methods produce reducing electrode potentials and high pH. Computer software has been used to model experimental results, thereby predicting uranium solubilities and speciation, and to propose new formation constants to fit the experimental results more closely. Studies have also been perforined to measure uranium sorption by grout material at high pH {{in the presence of the}} above ligands. This work makes a significant contribution to the understanding of uranium solubility and speciation in waters. at high pH and under conditions relevant to low level nuclear waste disposal...|$|R
