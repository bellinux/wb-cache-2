40|$|We study shot (counting) {{noise of}} the {{amplitude}} of interference between independent atomic systems. In particular, for the two <b>interfering</b> <b>systems</b> the variance of the fringe amplitude decreases as the inverse power {{of the number of}} particles per system with the coefficient being a non-universal number.

40|$|Chromate is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used carrier electrolyte for the determination of low molecular weight and inorganic anions by capillary electrophoresis. However, chromate electrolytes are usually prepared in the sodium form and consequently have poor buffering capacity.

An approach is demonstrated to buffer a chromate electrolyte by using a suitable buffering base as a counter-ion of the chromate. This approach does not introduce any co-anions into the background electrolyte, which is prepared by titrating the acid form of chromate to the pKa of the added base. Two buffered electrolytes were investigated containing tris(hydroxymethyl) amino- ethane (pKa = 8. 5) or diethanolamine, (pKa = 9. 2).

40|$|Abstract—To {{provide new}} and/or higher rate {{wireless}} services with limited spectrum resources, frequency overlay has been naturally proposed {{to accommodate the}} new and legacy systems in a common band. In this paper, we address the multiuser detection problem for overlaid code-division multiple-access (CDMA) scenarios. However, {{in contrast to the}} well-studied conventional single-rate CDMA, miscellaneous systems overlay almost always indicates the presence of multirate traffic that introduces an additional degree of freedom in receiver design—i. e., differences in the symbol rates. In this paper, we concentrate on receiver design for multirate traffic, while assuming a lack of information exchange between the constituent (new and legacy) systems, as is commonplace in practice. We propose a receiver architecture based on linear parallel interference cancellation where the out-of-rate intersystem interference is estimated and subtracted by means of its characteristic subspace, thereby avoiding the need for the exact knowledge of signature waveforms of the <b>interfering</b> <b>system.</b> Simulation results validate our solution and show that the proposed receiver has better performance in various aspects than several other solutions for the same purpose.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} mitigate interference on a transmission system by another system with an overlapping frequency band. The systems are uncoordinated so that they cannot be made to transmit in orthogonal coding space. The transmission environment is an interference channel rather than the multiaccess channel often considered in other multiuser detection problems, for instance at the base station of a {{code division multiple access}} wireless system. Using the fact that the inputs are all from discrete constellations, it is possible to perform a multiuser maximum-likelihood (ML) detector to decode the signals from the system of interest with low probability of error. However, the ML detector often requires impractical computation. A soft linear canceler is instead used to reduce the interference with a small loss of bandwidth in the system of interest. The method has much lower complexity than a full-blown ML detector, and the soft canceler performance is close to a ML detector. The method is demonstrated on a very-high-speed digital subscriber lines system with a home local area network interference.

The fundamental changes {{required in the}} existing physical layer using OFDM towards a hybrid physical layer (either OFDM-FBMC or OFDM- UFMC) ensuring backward compatibility are discussed. We also perform mutual interference analysis for the coexisting asynchronous systems sharing the LSA frequency band. Be- cause of the non-orthogonality between their respective transmit signals, power is spilled from a system to the other causing interference. In consideration of analyzing this interaction, power spectral densities of the multicarrier waveforms are exploited. We quantify the amount of percentage power-loss experienced by the interfering systems for not fully exploiting their available power budgets. The simulation results reveal that the <b>interfering</b> <b>system</b> with FBMC suffers the least percentage power-power loss due to its very low side-lobes while conventional OFDM-based system suffers the most.

40|$|Maintenance of {{an intact}} mucosal barrier is {{critical}} to preventing damage to and infection of wet-surfaced epithelia. The mechanism of defense {{has been the subject}} of much investigation, and there is evidence now implicating O-glycosylated mucins on the epithelial cell surface. Here we investigate a new role for the carbohydrate-binding protein galectin- 3 in stabilizing mucosal barriers through its interaction with mucins on the apical glycocalyx. Using the surface of the eye as a model system, we found that galectin- 3 colocalized with two distinct membrane-associated mucins, MUC 1 and MUC 16, on the apical surface of epithelial cells and that both mucins bound to galectin- 3 affinity columns in a galactose-dependent manner. Abrogation of the mucin-galectin interaction in four different mucosal epithelial cell types using competitive carbohydrate inhibitors of galectin binding, β-lactose and modified citrus pectin, resulted in decreased levels of galectin- 3 on the cell surface with concomitant loss of barrier function, as indicated by increased permeability to rose bengal diagnostic dye. Similarly, down-regulation of mucin O-glycosylation using a stable tetracycline-inducible RNA <b>interfering</b> <b>system</b> to knockdown c 1 galt 1 (T-synthase), a critical galactosyltransferase required for the synthesis of core 1 O-glycans, resulted in decreased cell surface O-glycosylation, reduced cell surface galectin- 3, and increased epithelial permeability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposed mucosal {{surfaces}} limit constitutive endocytosis under physiological {{conditions to}} prevent uptake of macromolecules and pathogens and, therefore, cellular damage. It is now accepted that cell surface mucins, {{a group of}} high molecular weight glycoproteins on the epithelial glycocalyx, defined by their extensive O-glycosylation, {{play a major role}} in maintaining barrier function in these surfaces, but the precise mechanisms are unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we utilized a stable tetracycline-inducible RNA <b>interfering</b> <b>system</b> targeting the core 1 ß 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase (C 1 galt 1 or T-synthase), a critical galactosyltransferase required for the synthesis of core 1 O-glycans, to explore the role of mucin-type carbohydrates in apical endocytic trafficking in human corneal keratinocytes. Using cell surface biotinylation and subcellular fractionation, we found increased accumulation of plasma membrane protein in endosomes after C 1 galt 1 depletion. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorometry revealed increased translocation of negatively charged fluorescent nanospheres after C 1 galt 1 knockdown sustained by an active transport process and largely independent of apical intercellular junctions. Internalization of nanospheres could be blocked by dynasore, nocodazole, chlorpromazine, and hyperosmotic sucrose, suggesting a mechanism for clathrin-coated pit budding and vesicular trafficking. This possibility was supported by experiments showing nanosphere colocalization with clathrin heavy chain in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, the data suggest that core 1 O-glycans contribute to maintenance of apical barrier function on exposed mucosal surfaces by preventing clathrin-mediated endocytosis...|$|E

The wave picture arises in {{the effects of}} interference which can always be explained {{in the context of}} the state description of the <b>interfering</b> <b>system,</b> interference necessitates that the measurement outcomes be calculated by squaring the amplitudes after adding and non-interference is calculated by squaring before adding. Even though the calculation for each is independently valid, the change in the statistics when one modulates between interference and noninterference, as in the quantum eraser, requires a violation of the law of conservation of energy. There is no “driving force ” in the change of statistics. It is always a change in preparation that leads to the change of interference statistics, whilst in the calculation there is only a change in the state description. The irreducibly particle like nature of the quanta requires that there be a causal “driving force ” in the change in statistics and a mere change in description is an insufficient explanation by the standards of energy conservation.

The heterogeneity in medium access parameters, transmit power and activity levels among the coexisting networks leads to detrimental cross-technology interference.
