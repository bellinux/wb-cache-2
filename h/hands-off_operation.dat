50|$|The Silent Eye is a {{backpack}} portable UAV used for scouting missions, area and perimeter control, highway monitoring and surveillance. It is also suited for search-and-rescue mission support and convoy security. It can be assembled and disassembled {{in less than}} 15 minutes, officials said. Advanced system autonomy enables <b>hands-off</b> <b>operation</b> of the system from takeoff through recovery. The I-Wing is a mini UAV with a 1.25-meter wingspan, which can be carried by two people in a lightweight, waterproof case and is shoulder-launched. The wings and tail of the I-Wing are stored in a folded position, but immediately unfold when rocket-launched. On reaching a 100-meter altitude, the hard propellant engine is ejected, and an electric motor is automatically started. The Jordan Arrow is an aerial target system that is intended for both air-defense training and testing of weapon systems. The Arrow simulates a variety of air defense threats. The target is a recoverable UAV equipped with power plant, automatic flight control system, recovery parachute and modular multi-version mission payloads.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 09 - 11, 1973 / Sheraton Inn Northeast, Washington, D. C. This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an experimental type 10. 6 μm laser communication system, consisting of a transmitter terminal and a receiver terminal, designed to operate one wav over a nominal five-mile path. The system provides a 5 MB/s digital data channel using a frequency shift keying format and optical heterodyne detection with a mercury cadmium telluride detector operating at a temperature of 77 °K. The system is the first CO 2 laser heterodyne communication system which is capable of <b>hands-off,</b> uninterrupted <b>operation</b> in a nonlaboratory environment. The achievement of single frequency operation of a laser transmitter and local oscillator in a field system is the result of more than seven years of research and development. Laser frequency purity, stability and control, all questions of primary concern previously, have been proven satisfactory with {{the development of}} this system. This paper reports the operation of the system during environmental tests, over a 4. 1 -mile test range, a 19. 5 -mile test range at the Hughes facility, and over a three mile test range at Ft. Monmouth, N. J. {{over a period of several}} months. During a period of 1320 hours of continuous operation, the system was inoperable for 65 hours due to weather conditions, demonstrating a reliability of 95 %...|$|R
40|$|An {{emergency}} {{flight control system}} that uses only engine thrust, called the propulsion-controlled aircraft (PCA) system, was developed and flight tested on an MD- 11 airplane. The PCA system is a thrust-only control system, which augments pilot flightpath and track commands with aircraft feedback parameters to control engine thrust. The PCA system was implemented on the MD- 11 airplane using only software modifications to existing computers. Results of a 25 -hr flight test show that the PCA system {{can be used to}} fly to an airport and safely land a transport airplane with an inoperative flight control system. In up-and-away operation, the PCA system served as an acceptable autopilot capable of extended flight over a range of speeds, altitudes, and configurations. PCA approaches, go-arounds, and three landings without the use of any normal flight controls were demonstrated, including ILS-coupled <b>hands-off</b> landings. PCA <b>operation</b> was used to recover from an upset condition. The PCA system was also tested at altitude with all three hydraulic systems turned off. This paper reviews the principles of throttles-only flight control, a history of accidents or incidents in which some or all flight controls were lost, the MD- 11 airplane and its systems, PCA system development, operation, flight testing, and pilot comments...|$|R
40|$|Future in-situ lunar/martian {{resource}} utilization and characterization, {{as well as}} {{the scientific}} search for life on Mars, will require access to the subsurface and hence drilling. Drilling on Earth is hard - an art form more than an engineering discipline. Human operators listen and feel drill string vibrations coming from kilometers underground. Abundant mass and energy make it possible for terrestrial drilling to employ brute-force approaches to failure recovery and system performance issues. Space drilling will require intelligent and autonomous systems for robotic exploration and to support human exploration. Eventual in-situ resource utilization will require deep drilling with probable human-tended operation of large-bore drills, but initial lunar subsurface exploration and near-term ISRU will be accomplished with lightweight, rover-deployable or standalone drills capable of penetrating a few tens of meters in depth. These lightweight exploration drills have a direct counterpart in terrestrial prospecting and ore-body location, and will be designed to operate either human-tended or automated. NASA and industry now are acquiring experience in developing and building low-mass automated planetary prototype drills to design and build a pre-flight lunar prototype targeted for 2011 - 12 flight opportunities. A successful system will include development of drilling hardware, and automated control software to operate it safely and effectively. This includes control of the drilling hardware, state estimation of both the hardware and the lithography being drilled and state of the hole, and potentially planning and scheduling software suitable for uncertain situations such as drilling. Given that Humans on the Moon or Mars are unlikely to be able to spend protracted EVA periods at a drill site, both human-tended and robotic access to planetary subsurfaces will require some degree of standalone, autonomous drilling capability. Human-robotic coordination will be important, either between a robotic drill and humans on Earth, or a human-tended drill and its visiting crew. The Mars Analog Rio Tinto Experiment (MARTE) is a current project that studies and simulates the remote science operations between an automated drill in Spain and a distant, distributed human science team. The Drilling Automation for Mars Exploration (DAME) project, by contrast: is developing and testing standalone automation at a lunar/martian impact crater analog site in Arctic Canada. The drill hardware in both projects is a hardened, evolved version of the Advanced Deep Drill (ADD) developed by Honeybee Robotics for the Mars Subsurface Program. The current ADD is capable of 20 m, and the DAME project is developing diagnostic and executive software for <b>hands-off</b> surface <b>operations</b> of the evolved version of this drill. The current drill automation architecture being developed by NASA and tested in 2004 - 06 at analog sites in the Arctic and Spain will add downhole diagnosis of different strata, bit wear detection, and dynamic replanning capabilities when unexpected failures or drilling conditions are discovered in conjunction with simulated mission operations and remote science planning. The most important determinant of future 1 unar and martian drilling automation and staffing requirements will be the actual performance of automated prototype drilling hardware systems in field trials in simulated mission operations. It is difficult to accurately predict the level of automation and human interaction that will be needed for a lunar-deployed drill without first having extensive experience with the robotic control of prototype drill systems under realistic analog field conditions. Drill-specific failure modes and software design flaws will become most apparent at this stage. DAME will develop and test drill automation software and hardware under stressful operating conditions during several planned field campaigns. Initial results from summer 2004 tests show seven identifi distinct failure modes of the drill: cuttings-removal issues with low-power drilling into permafrost, and successful steps at executive control and initial automation...|$|R

A QKD exchange up to 50 km was demonstrated in the laboratory with a secure key rate of 550 bit/s. The system is compact, portable with a fully automated start-up and stabilisation modules for polarisation, synchronisation and photon coupling allow a <b>hands-off</b> <b>operation.</b> Stable and reliable key exchange in a deployed optical fiber of 16 km length was demonstrated. In this fiber network we achieved over two weeks an automatic key generation with an average key rate of 2000 bit/s without manual intervention. During this period, the system had an average entanglement visibility of 93 %, highlighting the technical level and stability achieved for entanglement-based quantum cryptography.

40|$|Design of {{advanced}} carbon dioxide removal systems {{begins with the}} study of sorbents. Specifically, new CO 2 sorbents and desiccants need to be studied to enable greater productivity from existing and future spaceflight systems. This presentation will discuss the studies used as input for selecting future CO 2 sorbent materials. Also, the adjoining issues of understanding the effects of water co-adsorption and material selection for desiccant beds will be discussed. Current sorbents for CO 2 removal are based on 5 A zeolites, but a transition to sorbents derived from 13 X will be necessary as CO 2 levels in cabin air become leaner. Unfortunately, these 13 X zeolites {{are more susceptible to}} long-term performance loss due to water co-adsorption than 5 A due at achievable regeneration temperatures. A study on how impactful the presence of trace water will be to the cyclic operation of small-scale beds will be discussed. Also, methods to recover the performance of beds in a space environment after a major moisture adsorption event will be discussed. The information obtained from the water co-adsorption studies will play a major part in selecting a CO 2 sorbent for advanced removal systems. Pellet structural properties play another major role in the selection process. One factor for long-term, <b>hands-off</b> <b>operation</b> of a system is pellet integrity. Maintaining integrity means preventing pellet fracture and the generation of fines due to various thermal and mechanical means which would eventually clog filters or damage downstream systems. Either of these problems require significant shutdowns and maintenance operations and must be avoided. Therefore, study of high-integrity pellets and design of new pellets will be discussed...|$|E
