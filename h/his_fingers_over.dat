500|$|A fast bowler who {{operated}} from a {{very short}} run-up, Mold bowled extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through seam movement or cutting <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it before release, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that {{he was among the}} fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was [...] "beautiful" [...] and possessed [...] "fine grace". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, Wisden noted: [...] "On anything like a rough or bumpy wicket [...] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen." [...] The Times later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest.|$|E
2500|$|When Frank Miller {{expanded}} most of Daredevil's abilities, {{he attempted}} to make them [...] "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with Superman", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, {{the first thing he}} did to the character was [...] "revamp" [...] his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the [...] "proximity" [...] sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the letters on a page though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink. Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing to serve as a polygraph for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. This ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have an artificial pacemaker.|$|E
60|$|The free-trader smiled, {{partly in}} scorn and yet much in sadness, and passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> {{the strings of}} the guitar.|$|E
60|$|He {{traced a}} {{circle on the}} deck and then placed <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> {{about a quarter of}} the {{circumference}} of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't git {{much in the}} way of {{entertainment}} here," [...] explained Sid Todd, [...] "and that singin' sounds mighty good to us. It touches a fellow here, too," [...] he added, with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> heart.|$|R
60|$|He still slowly moved <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> upper lip, {{and still}} his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; {{thinking}} it urgent to say something, I asked him presently {{if he felt}} any cold draught from the door, which was behind him.|$|R
60|$|A moment after, a shade {{passed over}} his face; he pressed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> his eyes, {{and the tears}} dropped silently on his pillow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Tib {{came with}} {{us when we}} came here. Ay, Tib! purr thy best!' as he held <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her, and she rubbed her smooth head against him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fetters {{are easily}} flung off, at least," [...] said Blondel, again {{sweeping}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the strings, {{as one who}} would rather have played than listened to criticism.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poh!' said he, moving <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{carelessly}} <b>over</b> {{the notes}} of his instrument: 'WELL ENOUGH FOR SUCH AN INSTITUTION AS THIS!' ...|$|R
60|$|He puts <b>his</b> surf-wet <b>fingers</b> <b>Over</b> her startled eyes, And asks if {{she sees}} the land, the land, The land of her glad surmise.|$|R
60|$|He ran <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> nail <b>over</b> {{a spot on}} {{one side}} of the box, and there {{followed}} a tiny click. Then he ran <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> nail back, and there was another click.|$|R
6000|$|My {{grandfather}} snapped <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> his head, as he cast an eye {{round the}} room: [...] "Faith, {{this is the}} very house I've been looking after," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "But that necktie {{and that}} gown--and all those frills and tuckers?" [...] {{continued}} Jim generalizing, with a rapid twirling of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her. [...] "Are you expectin' Judge Martin, or the Expressman this evening?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{man was a}} musician. Involuntarily {{he rested}} himself on the {{mahogany}} stool, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the keys. They seemed to Virginia, standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.|$|E
6000|$|... "So do I, Mrs. Glenarm. But, with my {{experience}} of Geoffrey--" [...] He hesitated, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> nervously <b>over</b> {{the strings of}} his violin.|$|R
6000|$|... “Hold fast all I give you,” replied he; and {{he dropped}} the money all into his father’s hand, and shut up <b>his</b> father’s <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Ewan McGregor had petrol sprayed {{into his}} (recently laser-corrected) eyes at filling {{stations}} on two occasions, {{one of which}} required a trip to an optometrist in Ukraine. In the first case, Boorman attempted to stop a petrol pump by putting <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> the nozzle, only to send a jet of fuel directly into McGregor's face; in the second, petrol gushed out of McGregor's own bike's tank while filling.|$|R
6000|$|Hereward looked {{round and}} saw Teague MacMurrough {{standing}} close to him, harp in hand. He {{took it from}} him courteously enough, put a silver penny into the minstrel's hand, and running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the strings, rose and began,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Head all right, good 'n' flat," [...] Dag Daughtry murmured, first sliding <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it, {{and then}} {{lighting}} a match. [...] "An' no wrinkles, 'n' some jaw, good 'n' punishing, an' not a shade too {{full in the}} cheek or too empty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Methinks I {{have some}} remembrance of the lilt," [...] remarked the gleeman, running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the strings, [...] "Hoping {{that it will}} give thee no offence, most holy sir"--with a vicious snap at Alleyne--"and with the kind permit of the company, I will even venture upon it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold fast all I give you," [...] replied he; and {{he dropped}} the money all into his father's hand, and shut up <b>his</b> father's <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me a moment," [...] he said, {{feeling in}} his pockets. [...] "I think I've got some of my chemicals; and after that we'll {{go up to the}} house." [...] And he stooped again over the target, putting {{something}} with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> each of the shot-holes, so far as March could see merely a dull-gray smear. Then they went through the gathering twilight up the long green avenues to the great house.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Garden Party", Kevin, once again, {{wears his}} toupee to [...] "Schrute Farms". While he is there, he stops a waiter from walking around and {{offering}} hors d'oeuvres {{to the other}} guests (creepily putting <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> the waiter's mouth and going [...] "shhhh"), makes a toast to Robert California, and sits on a teeter totter with Ryan, but strands {{him up in the}} air (although Kevin believes the teeter totter is broken).|$|R
60|$|John Bunce the King's shipman shaded {{his eyes}} {{and stared at the}} long fog-bank which {{shrouded}} the northern channel. Chandos, with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the strings of his guitar, the King, the knights, all gazed in the same direction. Two small dark shapes had burst forth, and then after some minutes a third.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Vervain gave {{a little}} sob as Don Ippolito {{took her hand and}} kissed it; and she had some {{difficulty}} in leaving with him the rouleau, which she tried artfully to press into his palm. [...] "Good-by, good-by," [...] she said, [...] "don't drop it," [...] and attempted to close <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, happy thing! How well {{it falls}} out!' he exclaimed, {{snapping}} <b>his,</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> his head. 'Ha-ha--the knot is cut--I see {{a way out}} of my trouble--ha-ha!' She looked at him without uttering a sound, till, as he still continued smiling joyfully, she said, 'O--what do you mean! Is it done to torment me?' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Barber's playing is beautiful, <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> fly lightly <b>over</b> the fretboard".—Down Beat Magazine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me the box," [...] said Dick, also a bit excited. When {{he got it}} in {{his hands}} he, too, ran <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> nail <b>over</b> the {{engraved}} brass. Several tiny clicks followed.|$|R
60|$|From his pocketbook Willard drew {{something}} {{folded and}} creased and yellow {{that looked like}} a letter. He opened it carefully and, holding it in <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> looked <b>over</b> it at Miss Sally.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{with his}} mother's assistance, {{he learned the}} letters of the string alphabet, which is used in some of the {{institutions}} for the blind in Europe. When one of his friends gave him a leaf of St. Mark's Gospel, printed in embossed characters, he endeavored to read it by passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the letters as blind children do.|$|E
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hand up and reached the gas-jet. Then, staggering, feeling inch by inch for leagues {{along the edge of}} the cupboard, raising his {{ponderous}} hand with infinite effort, he touched a plate, feebly fitted <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> its edge, and with a gesture of weak despair hurled it at the window. The glass shattered. He fell to the floor.|$|E
60|$|Almost indifferently Barney {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the other panel. He ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it, his eyes following them. What was that? A finger-print? Upon the left side half way up a tiny smudge was visible. Barney examined it more carefully. A round, white figure of the conventional design that was burned into the tile bore the telltale smudge.|$|E
60|$|Moving with {{infinite}} care, {{and giving}} no heed to what Nathan might be doing, the boy crept to Master Wentworth's side, {{and it was}} with difficulty he repressed a cry of exultation as <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> closed <b>over</b> the musket.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not loved, but love,' muttered Berenger to himself, as if having {{recourse}} {{to the only}} cordial that could support him through the present suffering; and he was closing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> again <b>over</b> <b>his</b> precious hoard, when the Chevalier added, 'Stay! Nephew--that pearl? ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she stood}} under the drooping-thorn tree, in the {{darkness}} by the roadside, he kissed her, and <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> wandered <b>over</b> her face. In the darkness, where {{he could not see}} her but only feel her, his passion flooded him. He clasped her very close.|$|R
