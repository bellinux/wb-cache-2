It was inspired by Lewis' experiences explaining baseball to international students.|$|E

However, the converse is false. Prospect theory {{has been used to}} explain a range of phenomena that existing decision theories have great difficulty in explaining. These include backward bending labor supply curves, asymmetric price elasticities, tax evasion, co-movement of stock prices and consumption, etc.|$|E
25|$|Cavaradossi tells Angelotti of {{a chamber}} {{in an ancient}} Roman well on the {{property}} where he can hide until he makes his escape. It had been used by one of Cavaradossi's ancestors when he fled Rome after stabbing a Medici. Tosca arrives to confront her lover about the fan Scarpia had shown her. Cavaradossi and Angelotti <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> and she realizes with horror {{that she has been}} duped into leading Scarpia to them. On hearing the arrival of Scarpia and his men, Angelotti seeks refuge in the well. Scarpia demands to know where Angelotti is hidden. When Tosca and Cavardossi refuse to tell, Cavaradossi is taken off to be interrogated by the Procureur and tortured by Scarpia's assistant if he refuses to answer. Scarpia describes the torture device in great detail to Tosca, who is then made to listen to her lover's screams. Unable to bear it any longer, she reveals the hiding place, much to Cavaradossi's fury. Rather than be captured, Angelotti takes poison concealed in his ring. Scarpia orders his men to take Cavaradossi to the Castel Sant'Angelo for execution and orders Tosca to be brought there as well.|$|E

500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Talitha Cumi" [...] was rated an [...] "A–". The review called the episode a [...] "frustratingly provocative cliff-hanger", calling the interrogation scene of Jeremiah Smith [...] "a tour de force". Chris Carter has also noted that the interrogation 'is really a summation of my feelings about science ... that it has definitely usurped religion and can <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> now". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an [...] "A", praising its cliffhanger ending and [...] "good storytelling". Handlen felt that the episode dealt with themes familiar to the series, but in a manner which did not appear repetitive; and again noted Jeremiah Smith's confrontation with The Smoking Man as a highlight.|$|E
500|$|The kidnappers hold Charlie Bratley [...] {{whose parents}} are unaware that he is missing [...] {{overnight}} at Crystal's home. Dean eventually agrees to go to Troy's house to find the drugs. Upon delivery, Billy discovers that the bag doesn't contain the prescription drugs and starts a fight with Dean, leading to Dean's arrest. While trying to <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> to Officer Lou Bratley (John Heard), Charlie's father, Dean reveals that his brother Charlie replaced the drugs {{with a bag of}} the vitamins that their mother Allie (Allison Janney) sells. Neither Officer Bratley nor Dean's father believes his story, but he is released, whereupon his father increases his dosage of antidepressants. Meanwhile, Charlie [...] crushes the real drugs and puts them into a casserole that his mother made for Troy's memorial.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by freelance writer Kenji Terada, based on a story by Sakaguchi. Ishii heavily influenced the game's setting with his idea of the crystals. He also suggested illustrator Yoshitaka Amano as character designer, but Sakaguchi declined at first as {{he had never heard}} the artist's name before. When Sakaguchi showed Ishii some drawings on magazine clippings and told him that this was the art style he was looking for, Ishii revealed to him that these were actually created by Amano, hence leading to his involvement in the game. The music for Final Fantasy was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and marked his 16th video game music composition. Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli was hired to code the game. He initially tried to understand all aspects of the gameplay but was soon advised by Sakaguchi to just program the design concepts so {{he did not have to}} <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> to Gebelli in detail. Among the other developers were graphic designer Kazuko Shibuya, programmers Kiyoshi Yoshii and Ken Narita, as well as debugger Hiroyuki Ito. When the project started to show promise, designer Hiromichi Tanaka and his [...] "B-Team" [...] joined to aid development. The lack of faith in Sakaguchi's team, as well as its unpopularity within the company, motivated the staff members to give their best.|$|E

2500|$|Metaphysical naturalism {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in early Greek philosophy. The earliest presocratic philosophers, such as Thales, Anaxagoras or especially the atomist Democritus, were labeled by their peers and successors [...] "the physikoi" [...] (from the Greek φυσικός or physikos, meaning [...] "natural philosopher," [...] borrowing on the word φύσις or physis, meaning [...] "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as Epicureanism, which sought to <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> that exists {{as the product of}} atoms falling and swerving in a void.|$|E

2500|$|Steven Pinker, {{often called}} the world's leading expert on {{language}} and the mind lucidly, is another writer to document Tad and Dixie's romance {{for one of his}} examples analyzing the power of words. His book, The Language Instinct, which is said to <b>explain</b> <b>everything</b> a person wanted to know about languages (how it works, how children learn it, how it changes, how the brain computes it, and how it evolved) received the William James Book Award from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistic Society of America. Pinker wrote: [...] "Simply by making noises with our mouths, we can reliably cause precise new combinations of ideas to arise in each other's minds. The ability comes so naturally that we are apt to forget what a miracle it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a part of}} {{his role}} as the [...] "Evangelist of Race", Chamberlain toned his anti-Catholicism {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century, realizing belatedly that his attacks on the Catholic Church in The Foundations had alienated the German Catholic {{community}} from his message. As a well-known public intellectual, Chamberlain wrote on numerous subjects in a vast array of newspapers and magazines. Besides attacking the Jews, one of the chief themes of Chamberlain's essays was the unity of German culture, language, race and art and the need for the unity of German art with a racialized [...] "Germanic Christianity". The other major theme of Chamberlain's work was science and philosophy. Chamberlain was always keenly interested in modern science and saw himself as a scientist, but he was deeply critical of the claim that modern science could <b>explain</b> <b>everything,</b> believing there was a spiritual side to humanity that science could not explain. As such, Chamberlain believed that modern Germany was being destroyed by people losing their spiritual aspects owing to the materialist belief that science could explain all. In his 1905 biography of one of his heroes, the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown the limits of rationalism and reason for understanding the world. Instead, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown that the [...] instinctive approach based on intuition was a far more valid way of understanding the world. Inevitably, Chamberlain's [...] "Kantian" [...] way of understanding science was used to attack the Jews with Chamberlain's writing: [...] "In order to understand Kant we must…begin by once and for all [...] getting rid of the heavy burden of inherited and indoctrinated Jewish conceptions". In the same way, Chamberlain's 1912 biography of another of his heroes, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was used to pass on the same message. Chamberlain depicted Goethe as a [...] "Kantian" [...] man who had correctly embraced both the rational, scientific and instinctive, mystical approaches to life to achieve a synthesis that embraced the best of both worlds. [...] Again, Chamberlain used Goethe as a way of bashing the Jews, with Chamberlain claiming Goethe was for banning Aryan-Jewish sex and was a man who would not [...] "suffered among us" [...] Jewish artists, journalists, and professors in modern Germany. The German Jewish journal Im deutschen Reich wrote in a review of Goethe that Chamberlain had appropriated Goethe in [...] "a polemic about race politics, racial hygiene and racial worth from the standpoint of a monomaniacal Judeophobia".|$|E

2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before coming over to Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can <b>explain</b> <b>everything.</b> Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they have to take care of Emma.|$|E
