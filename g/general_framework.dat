5|$|The <b>general</b> <b>framework</b> of the {{coronation}} service {{is based on}} the sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar. Although the service has undergone two major revisions, a translation and has been modified for each coronation for the following thousand years, the sequence of taking an oath, anointing, investing of regalia, crowning and enthronement found in the Anglo-Saxon text have remained constant. The coronation ceremonies takes place within the framework of Holy Communion.|$|E
5|$|Written by Basil Dawson, this four-part story {{involving}} {{murders in}} Victorian London. Dawson, a veteran screenwriter, {{was approached by}} script editor Robert Holmes to develop a story which would introduce a new companion to replace Sarah Jane Smith following her departure. The new character {{was to be a}} Cockney girl whom the Doctor would take under his wing and educate, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle in the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. This story was planned to be the fourth story of Season 14. The Gaslight Murders was quickly abandoned, however. Its spot in the schedule was ultimately filled by The Face of Evil, while Holmes reused the <b>general</b> <b>framework</b> in The Talons of Weng-Chiang.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As {{business}} workflows on {{the internet}} are {{getting more and more}} important there is a hype in developing web services. To keep up simplicity of realising web services {{on the internet}} there exists numerous standards and technologies, like UDDI, SOAP or WSDL, which also support software engineers in the development process. For a professional web service development, there are <b>general</b> <b>frameworks</b> which include the above mentioned standards and technologies as well as they give approaches for an efficient implementation. The frameworks can be applied regardless to its platform. This paper concentrates on the development of Web Services in J 2 EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) according to the mentioned <b>general</b> <b>Frameworks.</b> J 2 EE provides a lot of tools and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for the implementation of new Web Services as well as upgrading of existing applications. Our goal is to outline the conformity and differences between J 2 EE and the <b>general</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{definition}} for Lie derivatives of spinors along generic spacetime vector fields, not necessarily Killing ones, on a general (pseudo) Riemannian manifold was already proposed in 1972 by Yvette Kosmann.
