Jay, Adams, and Franklin played the major part in the final negotiations. Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners.|$|E

The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, {{but he refused to}} take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Europe</b> to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.|$|E

His time in Padang Panjang passed uneventfully, and in July 1935 he was given leave to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Europe</b> again. He was also promoted to major at that time, which made him the highest-ranking native officer in the KNIL. The following year, upon his return to the Indies, he was stationed in Purworejo.

Early on, Chandler portrayed himself as a {{supporter}} of Roosevelt – since Roosevelt was popular in Kentucky – but opposed to the New Deal. He pointed to his fiscal conservatism as governor, including reorganizing and downsizing the executive branch and reducing the state's debt. Polls showing Barkley with a comfortable lead and an overwhelming victory by New Deal supporter Claude Pepper in Florida's May Senate primary convinced Chandler to shift his focus from the New Deal. He criticized Barkley as [...] "a stranger to the state" [...] and obliquely referred to [...] "fat, sleek senators who <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Europe</b> and have forgotten the people of Kentucky except when they run for election". Forty years old – 20 years Barkley's junior – he referred to Barkley as [...] "Old Alben".|$|E

500|$|Compounding their {{difficulties}} were Bryant's ongoing {{relationship with}} O'Neill and gynecological problems {{she was treated}} for while Reed was in the hospital. When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into World War I against Germany became highly likely. (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.) To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to Margaret Sanger, and Reed pawned his father's gold watch. At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in The Masses and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income. Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant {{that he had had}} multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a desire to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Europe,</b> he helped her convince John N. Wheeler, who had recently formed the Bell Syndicate, to issue her a press pass. Reed paid for her passage, and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France. Regrets quickly followed. According to biographer Virginia Gardner: ...|$|E

[...] When Forbes took Elias H. Mortimer's wife to Europe with him, Mortimer decided to testify against him in a Congressional investigation that started on March 2, 1923. [...] Upon his return from Europe, Forbes visited President Harding at the White House. [...] The six-foot-tall President grabbed Forbes by the throat and began violently shaking him [...] "as a dog would a rat". [...] Forbes was saved from this attack when a guest who had an appointment with the President interrupted the altercation. [...] President Harding was angered over Forbes' duplicity in stopping the Perryville shipments. [...] The Senate investigation revealed Forbes had left 200,000 unopened pieces of mail from veterans at the Bureau. Belligerent before the Senate committee, Forbes renounced involvement in illegal activities. [...] Mortimer provided damaging information that Forbes took a $5,000 payment in Chicago and got kickbacks for land deals and building contracts for veterans' hospitals.
