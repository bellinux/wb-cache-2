However, due to its mushy freezing characteristics, a lack of feeding in the ingot center often generates many defects, such as porosity and crack. A six-ton P 91 ingot was cast and sliced, and a representative part of the longitudinal section was inspected in more detail. The morphology of crack-like defects was examined by X-ray high energy industrial CT and reconstructed by 3 D software. There are five main portions of defects larger than 200 mm 3, four of which are interconnected. These initiated from continuous liquid film, and then were torn apart by excessive tensile stress within the brittle temperature range (BTR). The 3 D FEM analysis of thermo-mechanical simulation was carried out to analyze the formation of porosity and internal crack defects. The results of shrinkage porosity and Niyama values revealed that the center of the ingot suffers from inadequate feeding. Several criteria based on thermal and mechanical models were used to evaluate the susceptibility of <b>hot</b> <b>crack</b> formation.

However, they have high potential for applications in light weight constructions of automotive industry and therefore it is needed to increase weldability. One major issue is the high hot cracking susceptibility. Vaporization during laser beam welding leads to a change of concentration of the volatile elements magnesium and zinc. Hence, solidification range of the weld and therefore hot cracking susceptibility changes. Additionally, different welding velocities lead to changed solidification conditions with certain influence on hot cracking. This paper discusses the influence of energy per unit length during laser beam welding of AA 7075 on the change of element concentration in the weld seam and the resulting influence on hot cracking susceptibility. Therefore EDS-measurements of weld seams generated with different velocities are performed to determine the change of element concentration. These quantitative data is used to numerically calculate the solidification range in order to evaluate its influence on the hot cracking susceptibility. Besides that, relative <b>hot</b> <b>crack</b> length and mechanical properties are measured.

To account for the correct thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the multicomponent alloy grades, the simulation software is online coupled to commercial thermodynamic and mobility databases.

Metallographic studies were performed using optical and electron microscopy. Base metal, weld and HAZ were all characterized and discussed.

All welds of Gr. 80 showed <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> at the centerline while none of the Gr. 50 welds were cracked.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the possibility of adapting the Althoff-Radtke test for High Chromium Cast Iron. The Althoff-Radtke test is a clump attempt used for steel. The Althoff-Radtke test has four different lengths of clamp which qualifies it as a test to quantitatively take into account different kinds of shrinkage ΔL. The length of the slot of the cracked corner and the length of each staple (50 - 350 mm) are the parameters tendency to cast cracks. Castings of white cast iron have a high tendency to <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> due to the large range of solidification temperatures, unfavorable kinetics parameters of shrinkage, and especially a lack of expansion before shrinkage. Shrinkage of high chromium white cast iron is similar to the shrinkage of cast steel, and is approximately 2 %. Therefore it is important to test susceptibility to <b>hot</b> <b>cracks.</b> Research was carried out under industrial conditions. Four melts were performed, one of the initial chemical composition and the other three modified by different amounts of Fe-Ti, respectively, 0. 25 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 75 % Fe-Ti. The propensity for <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> was based on the observation of the dark surface {{in the corner of the}} sample. The study shows that the Althoff-Radtke test can be adapted to determine the tendency for <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> of high chromium cast iron. It should however be noted that the test results cannot be compared with those for other alloys...|$|R
40|$|Varestraint testing {{together}} with DSC and SEM-EDX analyses {{have been performed}} as means of investigating the <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility of Allvac 718 Plus, alloy 718 and Waspaloy. The solidification sequences in Allvac 718 Plus and alloy 718 were very similar to each other starting by an initial solidification of the gamma phase, gamma/MC reaction at around 1260 °C and then finally ending the sequence by gamma/Laves eutectic reaction at around 1150 °C. Waspaloy had the same solidification sequence, except no Laves phase formation takes place, and solidification started at a somewhat higher temperature as compared to alloy 718 and the solidification sequence ends by a gamma/MC reaction at around 1245 °C. The total amount of <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> in Waspaloy was shown to be much less than that in alloy 718 and in Allvac 718 Plus which {{is believed to be}} related to the presence of the Laves eutectic in the latter two alloys with corresponding larger solidification ranges. <b>Hot</b> <b>cracking</b> of 718 Plus is slightly less than in 718...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>cracking</b> is a {{critical}} defect frequently observed during welding of aluminium alloys. In order {{to better understand the}} interaction between cracking phenomenon, process parameters, mechanical factors and microstructures resulting from solidiﬁcation after welding, an original hot-cracking test during welding is developed. According to in-situ observations and post mortem analyses, <b>hot</b> <b>cracking</b> mechanisms are investigated, taking into account the interaction between microstructural parameters, depending on the thermal cycles, and mechanical parameters, depending on geometry and clamping conditions of the samples and on the thermal ﬁeld on the sample. Finally, a process map indicating the limit between cracking and non-cracking zones according to welding parameters is presented...|$|R
