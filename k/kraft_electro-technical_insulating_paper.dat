Hydrogel forms on patterned electrodes when electrochemical potential is applied due to electrodeposition. The experiments demonstrate that the pattern of alginate hydrogels follows the pattern of electrodes exactly. In addition, the hydrogel’s height is controllable by applied potential and reaction time. An equivalent circuit model and a hydrogel growth model have been built to predict the electrodeposition current and hydrogel’s growth.

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{electrical}} and chemical analysis in oils of some fault transformers in Shenzhen, it {{indicates that the}} corrosive sulfur contained in insulating oils may cause faults. Corrosive sulfur would react to copper wire and engender Cu 2 S during the operation of transformer. Because of the electric characteristic of Cu 2 S, this substance will penetrate and pollute <b>insulating</b> <b>paper</b> of the wire, and then weaken the insulation intensity. At last it would wear out coil insulation. Experiments indicate that adding passivator to insulating oil is an effective method to solve the problem.

40|$|Abstract—Power {{transformer}} {{consists of}} components which are under consistent thermal and electrical stresses. The major component which degrades under these stresses is the paper insulation {{of the power}} transformer. At site, lightning impulses and cable faults may cause the winding deformation. In addition, the winding may deform due to impact during transportation. A deformed winding will excite more stress to its <b>insulating</b> <b>paper</b> thus will degrade it. Insulation degradation will shorten the life-span of the transformer. Currently there are two methods of detecting the winding deformation which are Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) and Low Voltage Impulse Test (LVI).

In this paper, a transformer which experienced overheating and arcing was identified, and both SFRA and LVI were performed. Next, the transformer {{was brought to the}} factory for untanking.

In addition, theoretical breakdown strengths of nanopaper and conventional paper are also calculated to evaluate the effect of pore size.
