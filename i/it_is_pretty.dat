25|$|Some African American {{students}} have reported feeling that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class. However, some students feel that the class has shortcomings; they say that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> similar to a typical US history course, and that critical conversations about race are generally absent from class. The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E
25|$|In 1682 he was, at {{more than}} sixty years of age, {{recognized}} as one of the foremost men of letters of France. Madame de Sévigné, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection of Fables published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> certain that this was the general opinion. It was not unreasonable, therefore, that he should present himself to the Académie française, and, though the subjects of his Contes were scarcely calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends.|$|E
500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos. For inspiration, visual effects and design company A52 explored museums, {{read the script}} and researched Roman history. They created the opening sequence entirely in-house. VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's going to look like when it's completed. This project was very experimental right to the very end. The tone of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much unlike anything we've done and most of what any of us here have seen. There's a lot there that creatively sets the stage for the series." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "If Madonna is wishing {{to pass on}} her 'Material Girl' title, Gwen Stefani is happy to wear it proudly", but noted that [...] "hings are wearing a little thin, and this song doesn't have the striking impact of 'Rich Girl' or 'Hollaback Girl'." [...] Sam Shepherd of musicOMH agreed, writing that [...] "'Luxurious' {{is by no means}} a bad song, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> ordinary when compared to the songs that have preceded it." [...] PopMatters' Jason Damas found the track uninteresting and stated that Rossdale's appearance [...] "sounds like a blinged-out Saint Etienne". Alex Lai from Contactmusic.com called Stefani's performance [...] "as seductive as ever, and the production extremely polished, but it lacks the infectiousness of her other releases"; he found Slim Thug's remix unnecessary and viewed the single's release as [...] "a money-spinning exercise".|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} game, Chunsoft {{released}} an original video animation in December 2011. Created by the Japanese animation studio Gonzo, the animation {{serves as an}} introduction to the game, showcasing the characters and the basic Ambidex Game rules. As well as the video animation, a Flash game was produced and made available on the Japanese Virtue's Last Reward website. The gameplay of the Flash game has the player attempt to open a metal door by quickly clicking on it. As the door begins to open, Clover is revealed on the other side, and the player begins clicking on her breasts. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was perplexed by the Flash game, stating that: [...] "as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much the antithesis of everything presented in Virtue's Last Reward, I truly wonder how this Flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title. Perhaps it's just due to a [...] department following the old adage: 'sex sells'." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, Vincent and the Doctor has {{received}} critical acclaim. Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave the episode {{five out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a genuinely magical episode of Who, high on atmosphere...and bursting with charm". John Moore, writing on Den of Geek, also took a positive stance towards the episode, describing it as [...] "life-affirming" [...] as a Doctor Who fan, and, though he did criticise some elements of the plot, likewise wrote positively about the ending, ultimately finding the episode [...] "utterly useless, but absolutely art". Keith Watson in the Metro {{was surprised by the}} [...] "impressive imagining of Van Gogh's world", praising Curtis' humour throughout the episode. He also praised the performance by Curran as Van Gogh, feeling that, with regard to Van Gogh's depression, the producers [...] "pulled it off" [...] against the odds. Mark Lawson [...] of The Guardian praised it as [...] "exceptionally good" [...] and [...] "thrilling and funny, as well as educational", noting its [...] "historical rigour" [...] and its [...] "good arty jokes", while Deborah Orr wrote that it was [...] "hardly original for someone to alight on [...] tale as a tear-jerker, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> shrewd to think of placing it in a popular time-travel context" [...] and that [...] "the feeling that I'd been gently monstered into life-affirming feel-good sobs by Richard Curtis was not new, not in the least".|$|E

500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> boring and tame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a little bit, to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duritz hinted in a 2006 {{interview}} that Counting Crows' next studio record {{would be released}} in late 2007. He indicated that the band had spent three weeks working in a recording studio with Gil Norton, the producer behind Recovering the Satellites, and revealed the working title of the album to be Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings. Duritz explained that [...] "Saturday night is when you sin and Sunday is when you regret. Sinning is often done very loudly, angrily, bitterly, violently." [...] Vickrey stated that [...] "the idea {{at the moment is}} to have kind of a rocking side and then an acoustic-y, maybe country-ish side.

Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late March 2009, Samoa's Censorship Board {{banned the}} film from distribution, without giving a reason. Samoan {{human rights activist}} Ken Moala disputed the ban, commenting that [...] "It's really harmless, I don't know how it would affect Samoan lifestyle. It is totally {{different}} and not applicable to here, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> tame really." [...] The Pacific Freedom Forum issued a press release stating that [...] "Samoa is the only nation worldwide where censors have specifically banned the multi-Academy Award winning film", limiting Samoans to smuggled or pirated versions. American Samoan Monica Miller, the Forum's co-chair, stated, [...] "Observers are left to wonder at the censorship standards being applied {{in a country where}} fa'afafine have a well established and respected role." [...] Fa'afafine are biologically men raised to assume female gender roles, making them a third gender well accepted in Samoan society. The Fa'afafine Association also criticised the ban, describing it as a [...] "reject the idea of homosexuality".|$|E
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E

2500|$|Arisu Kashiwagi, lead {{designer}} at Imaginary Forces for {{the title}} sequence, was [...] "inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [...] — the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> amazing {{how much you can}} see and the number of windows out there with wide open shades... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act." [...] She also looked to Edward Hopper's [...] "Night Windows" [...] and Gerhard Richter's paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take [...] "a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack’s watercolor paintings from" [...] Alias. On the design concept, she added, [...] "We based the concept off of Jessica’s PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device." [...] Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window to help create the [...] "voyeuristic approach" [...] as well as [...] "using the city as a character" [...] to highlight [...] "the dark places [...] the grit" [...] where Jones investigates.|$|E
