40|$|Streptococcus salivarius <b>fructosidase</b> (beta-D-fructan fructohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 80) was {{purified}} to homogeneity. The {{molecular weight}} of the <b>fructosidase</b> {{was estimated to be}} 83, 000 to 85, 000 by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 7. 0, and the isoelectric point was pH 4. 7. The purified enzyme preparation hydrolyzed levan, inulin, and several 2 -beta-linkage-containing oligosaccharides such as sucrose and raffinose, but not melezitose, dextran, and pseudonigeran. The <b>fructosidase</b> was inhibited by Fe 3 +, Cu 2 +, Hg 2 +, and Ag+, but not by Ca 2 +, Co 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Zn 2 +, at a concentration of 10 (- 3) M. Mn 2 + was particularly effective in stimulating activity at the same concentration. The presence of either EDTA or KCN also increased <b>fructosidase</b> activity by 20 to 30 %. The enzyme was susceptible to sulfhydryl reagents since p-chloromercuribenzoate (10 (- 7) M) produced 63 % inhibition of the activity. However, this inhibition was overcome in the presence of cysteine. This enzyme acts as an exofructosidase since thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed that D-fructose was formed from levan or inulin by the action of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus acidophilus is a {{probiotic}} organism that {{displays the}} ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms and genes involved in FOS utilization by Lactobacillus species. Analysis of the L. acidophilus NCFM genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the LacI family, a four-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system, a <b>fructosidase,</b> and a sucrose phosphorylase. Transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and FOS but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. Additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter–operator region. Insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and the <b>fructosidase</b> reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on FOS. Comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the association between a <b>fructosidase</b> and an ABC transporter is unusual and may be specific to L. acidophilus. This is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of FOS compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract...|$|E
30|$|Grass juice (GJ) {{feedstock}} was {{extracted from}} ryegrass Lolium perenne {{supplied by the}} Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS, UK) (Martel et al. [2010]). GJ was screened to remove large particulates, autoclaved (121 °C, 30  min) and frozen (- 80 °C). When required {{for use as a}} growth and fermentation substrate, particle-free GJ was thawed and component fructans enzymatically hydrolysed using truncated L. paracasei β <b>fructosidase</b> (tfosEp) as previously described (Martel et al. [2010]). The concentration of free monosaccharides in untreated and enzyme pre-treated GJ + tfosEp was determined and the latter chosen for use as feedstock for all experimental work undertaken in the present study.|$|E
40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. b-Fructosidases are a {{widespread}} group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal fructosyl units from various substrates. These enzymes also exhibit transglycosylation activity when they function with {{high concentrations of}} sucrose, {{which is used to}} synthesize fructooligosaccharides (FOS) in the food industry. A b-fructosidase (BfrA) with high transglycosylation activity was purified from Aspergillus oryzae FS 4 as a monomeric glycoprotein. Compared with the most extensively studied Aspergillus spp. <b>fructosidases</b> that synthesize inulin-type b-(2 - 1) -linked FOS, BfrA has unique transfructosylating property of synthesizing levan-and neolevan-type b-(2 - 6) -linked FOS. The coding sequence (bfrAFS 4, 1. 86 kb) of BfrA was amplified and expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Both native and recombinant proteins showed transfructosylation and hydrolyzation activities with broad substrate specificity. These proteins could hydrolyze the following linkages: Glc a- 1, 2 -b Fru; Glc a- 1, 3 -a Fru; and Glc a- 1, 5 -b Fru...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlant {{cell wall}} (CWI) and vacuolar invertases (VI) play {{important}} roles in carbohydrate metabolism, stress responses and sugar signaling. Addressing the regulation of invertase activities by inhibitor proteins (C/VIF, cell wall/vacuolar inhibitor of <b>fructosidase),</b> we have identified two C/VIFs from Arabidopsis thaliana. AtC/VIF 1 showed specific inhibition of VI activity, whereas AtC/VIF 2 inhibited both, CWI and VI. Expression analysis revealed that expression of AtC/VIF 1 was restricted to specific organs, AtC/VIF 2, however, was weakly expressed throughout plant development. Promoter::GUS transformants confirmed pronounced differences of tissue/cell type-specific expression between both isoforms. Growth of an AtC/VIF 1 T-DNA KO mutant was unaffected, but VI activity and hexose content were slightly increased...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of reaction conditions for oligosaccharide synthesis from stachyose using a commercial enzymatic preparation from Aspergillus aculeatus (Pectinex Ultra SP-L) was studied. Oligosaccharides {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight–mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Galactosyl-melibiose (DP 3) was synthesized {{as a result of}} <b>fructosidase</b> activity, whereas fructosyl-stachyose (DP 5) and difructosyl-stachyose (DP 6) were formed {{as a consequence of the}} fructosyltransferase activity of Pectinex Ultra SP-L. The optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of penta- and hexasaccharides were 60 °C, pH 5. 5, 600 mg/mL stachyose, and 34 U/mL enzyme. Reaction time played an important role in oligosaccharide mixture composition constituted by 20...|$|E
40|$|Fructan polymer, {{synthesized}} from sucrose by the extracellular fructosyltransferase of Streptococcus mutans, {{is thought}} {{to contribute to the}} progression of dental caries. It may serve as an extracellular storage polysaccharide facilitating survival and acid production. It may also have a role in adherence or accumulation of bacterial cells on the tooth surface. A number of clinical isolates of S. mutans which produce large, mucoid colonies on sucrose-containing agar as a result of increased production of fructan have been discovered. By using eight independent isolates, we sought to determine if such fructan-hyperproducing strains represented a genetically homogeneous group of organisms. Restriction fragment patterns of total cellular DNA were examined by using pulsed-field and conventional gel electrophoresis. Four genetic types which appeared to correlate with the serotype of the organism and the geographic site of isolation were evident. Southern blot analysis of several genetic loci for extracellular enzymes revealed some minor differences between the strains, but the basic genomic organizations of these loci were similar. To evaluate whether the excess fructan produced by these strains enhanced the virulence of these organisms in the oral cavity, it was of interest to create mutants deficient in <b>fructosidase</b> (FruA), the extracellular enzyme which degrades this polymer. The fruA gene was inactivated by allelic exchange in two fructan-hyperproducing strains as well as in S. mutans GS 5, a strain which does not hyperproduce fructan. All of the fruA mutant strains were devoid of fructan hydrolase activity when levan was used as a substrate. However, the fructan-hyperproducing strains retained the ability to hydrolyze inulin, suggesting the presence of a second <b>fructosidase</b> with specificity for inulin in these strains...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of insect saliva in insect-host plant interactions has been acknowledged, there is very limited information on the nature {{and complexity of the}} salivary proteome in lepidopteran herbivores. We inspected the labial salivary transcriptome and proteome of Helicoverpa armigera, an important polyphagous pest species. To identify the majority of the salivary proteins we have randomly sequenced 19, 389 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a normalized cDNA library of salivary glands. In parallel, a non-cytosolic enriched protein fraction was obtained from labial salivary glands and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) and de novo peptide sequencing. This procedure allowed comparison of peptides and EST sequences and enabled us to identify 65 protein spots from the secreted labial saliva 2 DE proteome. The mass spectrometry analysis revealed ecdysone, glucose oxidase, <b>fructosidase,</b> carboxyl/cholinesterase and an uncharacterized protein previously detected in H. armigera midgut proteome. Consistently, their corresponding transcripts are among the most abundant in our cDNA library. We did find redundancy of sequence identification of saliva-secreted proteins suggesting multiple isoforms. As expected, we found several enzymes responsible for digestion and plant offense. In addition, we identified non-digestive proteins such as an arginine kinase and abundant proteins of unknown function. This identification of secreted salivary gland proteins allows a more comprehensive understanding of insect feeding an...|$|E
40|$|The fosABCDXE operon encodes {{components}} of a putative fructose/mannose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) and a β- <b>fructosidase</b> precursor (FosE) {{that are involved in}} the fructooligosaccharide (FOS) utilization pathway of Lactobacillus paracasei 1195. The presence of an N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a LPQAG cell wall anchor motif at the C-terminal region of the deduced FosE precursor amino acid sequence predicted that the enzyme is cell wall-associated, indicating that FOS may be hydrolyzed extracellularly. In this study, cell fractionation experiments demonstrated that the FOS hydrolysis activity was contained exclusively in the cell wall extract of L. paracasei previously grown on FOS. In contrast, no measurable FOS hydrolysis activity was detected in the cell wall extract from the isogenic fosE mutant. Induction of β-fructosidase activity was observed when cells were grown on FOS, inulin, sucrose, or fructose, but not glucose. A diauxic growth pattern was observed when cells were grown on FOS in the presence of limiting glucose (0. 1 %). Analysis of the culture supernatant revealed that glucose was consumed first, followed by the longer chain FOS species. Transcription analysis further showed that the fos operon was expressed only after glucose was depleted in the medium. Expression of fosE in a non-FOS-fermenting strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, enabled the recombinant strain to metabolize FOS, inulin, sucrose, and levan...|$|E

Here, a novel Lactobacillus paracasei ?-fructosidase was overexpressed as truncated cytosolic protein (tfosEp) in Escherichia coli. Purified tfosEp was thermostable (10 ? 50 ?C) with a pH optimum of 5; it showed highest affinity for bacterial levan (?[2 - 6] linked fructose) followed by nystose, chicory inulin, 1 -kestose (?[2 - 1] linkages) and sucrose (Km values of 0. 5, 15, 15. 6, 49 and 398 mM, respectively). Hydrolysis of polyfructose moieties in agriculturally-sourced grass juice (GJ) with tfosEp resulted in the release of > 13 mg/ml more bioavailable fructose than was measured in untreated GJ. Bioethanol yields from fermentation experiments with Brewer?s yeast and GJ + tfosEp were > 25 % higher than those achieved using untreated GJ feedstock (36. 5 [? 4. 3] and 28. 2 [? 2. 7] mg ethanol/ml, respectively). This constitutes the first specific study of the potential to ferment ethanol from grass juice and the utility of a novel core domain of ?-fructosidase from L. paracasei. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Excised {{leaves of}} barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) exposed to {{continuous}} light accumulate {{large amounts of}} soluble carbohydrates. Carbohydrates were analyzed in deionized extracts by high-pressure liquid chromatography on an anion exchange column coupled with pulsed amperometric detection. During the first few hours of illumination, the main sugar to accumulate was sucrose. The levels of glucose and fructans (oligofructosylsucroses) increased later. The trisaccharide 1 -kestose (1 -kestotriose) predominated initially among the fructans. Later, 6 -kestose (6 -kestotriose) and tetra- and pentasaccharides accumulated also. Total extracts from barley leaves were chromatographed on a MonoQ column, and each fraction was assayed for enzymes of interest by incubation with 200 mM sucrose for 3 h, followed by carbohydrate analysis. Freshly excised leaves yielded two peaks of invertase, characterized by formation of fructose and glucose, but had almost no trisaccharide-forming activities. In leaves exposed to continuous light, two new enzyme activities appeared that generated fructan-related trisaccharides and glucose from sucrose. One {{of them was a}} sucrose-sucrose fructosyl- 1 -transferase (1 -SST), producing 1 -kestose exclusively: the peak fractions of this activity contained almost no invertase. The other was a sucrose-sucrose fructosyl- 6 -transferase (6 -SST), producing 6 -kestose. It comigrated with one of the constitutive invertases on MonoQ but was separated from it by subsequent chromatography on alkyl Superose. Nevertheless, the preparation retained invertase activity, suggesting that this enzyme may act both as <b>fructosidase</b> and fructosyltransferase. When incubated with 1 -kestose in addition to sucrose, this enzyme formed less 6 -kestose but instead produced large amounts of the tetrasaccharide bifurcose (1 & 6 -kestotetraose), the main fructan tetrasaccharide accumulating in vivo. These results suggest that two inducible enzymes, 1 -SST and 6 -SST, act in concert to initiate fructan accumulation in barley leaves...|$|E
