40|$|BackgroundChanging {{the fuel}} supply from {{petroleum}} based ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to biodiesel and its blends {{is considered by}} many to be a viable option for controlling exposures to particulate material (PM). This is critical in the mining industry where approximately 28, 000 underground miners are potentially exposed to relatively high concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM). This study was conducted to investigate the mutagenic potential of diesel engine emissions (DEE) from neat (B 100) and blended (B 50) soy-based fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel in comparison with ULSD PM using different engine operating conditions and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> configurations. MethodsThe DPM samples were collected for engine equipped with either a standard muffler or a combination of the muffler and diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC) that was operated at four different steady-state modes. Bacterial gene mutation activity of DPM was tested on the organic solvent extracts using the Ames Salmonella assay. ResultsThe results indicate that mutagenic activity of DPM was strongly affected by fuels, engine operating conditions, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> The mutagenicity was increased with the fraction of biodiesel in the fuel. While the mutagenic activity was observed in B 50 and B 100 samples collected from both light-and heavy-load operating conditions, the ULSD samples were mutagenic only at light-load conditions. The presence of DOC in the exhaust system resulted in the decreased mutagenicity when engine was fueled with B 100 and B 50 and operated at light-load conditions. This was not the case when engine was fueled with ULSD. Heavy-load operating condition in the presence of DOC resulted in a decrease of mutagenicity only when engine was fueled with B 50, but not B 100 or ULSD. ConclusionsTherefore, the results indicate that DPM from neat or blended biodiesel has a higher mutagenic potency than that one of ULSD.

Conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, especially for NOx- adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils necessary. As far as diesel exhaust is concerned lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter and more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, sulphur, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems. Also for diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, Urea- SCR) low sulphur levels are advantageous because the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur is reduced. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, the light-off temperature being mainly affected. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are. Furthermore phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) was shown to limit catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Although there is still a lack of quantitative technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems.

40|$|A {{gasoline}} {{direct injected}} engine operating under lean conditions {{can offer a}} reduction in fuel consumption and a reduction of CO 2 emissions but meanwhile suffer from high levels of tailpipe NOx emissions. A new way of reducing NOx emissions in a lean burn gasoline engine is by using an ordinary three way catalyst (TWC) together with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst, a passive SCR concept. The basic idea of this concept is that ammonia could be formed over the TWC by operating the engine rich during short amounts of time. The produced ammonia can then be stored in the SCR catalyst further down the exhaust system. When the engine switches into lean operation the stored ammonia is then used to reduce the engine out NOx emissions over the SCR catalyst. The purpose of this master thesis was to investigate if the passive SCR concept is a possible <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> to reduce tailpipe NOx emissions for gasoline lean burn engines. This project was performed in an engine test cell at Chalmers University of Technology and was carried out experimentally. The intention was to investigate how much ammonia that could be formed over the TWC, if ammonia were stored on the SCR catalyst bed and if NOx was reduced over the SCR catalyst. To conclude, the passive SCR concept is a possible <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> Ammonia was formed over the TWC by operating rich. It was noticed that lambda, engine load and rich cycle duration affected the amount of ammonia formed at steady state conditions. The major drawback was that when ammonia was formed increased concentrations of CO was detected post the TWC. As for the SCR catalyst {{it was concluded that}} it was temperature dependent. It was noticed that there was a tradeoff between ammonia storage capacity and NOx reduction efficiency.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to collect and {{evaluate}} environmentally relevant data on exhaust emissions from the combustion products of engine oils and their effects on the function of (next-generation) emission control systems. Due to the lower EURO 4 emission limits, <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> for heavy- and light-duty vehicles will be necessary which are more efficient than the 3 -way- or oxidation-type catalysts common today. Practicable <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> are, for example, particle traps, improved catalysts (including selective catalytic reduction, or fuel-borne catalysts), NO×-adsorbers, and combinations of these systems. Most of these exhaust control devices require fuels with sulphur contents below 10 ppm. In Germany, gasoline that meets this specification has recently been introduced on a small scale. However, the emissions generated by these low sulphur levels are almost in the same order of magnitude as the emissions of sulphur compounds derived from the consumption of lubricants that contain about 0. 5 % sulphur. As measurement data in this area is very limited, conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, expecially for NO×-adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance all the way down to concentrations of O ppm, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils sem necessary. Diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, UreaSCR) perform better with sulphur levels below 10 ppm because this reduces the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, which mainly affects the light-off temperature. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are after passing over the catalyst. Enough evidence is now available to show that phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) limits catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter from diesel exhaust (passenger cars) and often more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, magnesium, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems and cannot be removed through thermal regeneration processes. Although there is still a critical lack of available technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems.

40|$|Abstract: Automotive exhaust {{emission}} testing according to legislated procedures and driving cycles is a routine process {{today in the}} United States, Europe and SE Asia. In practice, the selection of catalytic converters and the general design of <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> are mainly aimed at the attainment of the legislated emissions limits with a reasonable safety margin. However, during the system optimization process, the catalyst and/or exhaust system manufacturer screens {{a large number of}} catalysts with a significant number of system design variations. In this process, certain levels of statistical uncertainty are present and must be seriously taken into account as stricter emissions standards are addressed and the safety margins become leaner. A methodology is developed and presented in this paper that is able to determine confidence levels in the attainment of specific emissions limits. This methodology combines results from experimental assessment of the distributions of engine-out emissions and catalyst activity by employing a previously developed and extensively validated model of a diesel oxidation catalyst. In this way, the emissions control system optimization is substantially aided and the required experimental effort is considerably reduced...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of diesel exhaust aftertreatment testing and analysis done under the FreedomCAR program. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) adsorber technology was selected based on a previous investigation of various NOx aftertreatment technologies including non-thermal plasma, NOx adsorber and active lean NOx. Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were addressed by developing a catalyzed particulate filter. After various iterations of the catalyst formulation, the aftertreatment components were integrated and optimized for a light duty vehicle application. This compact <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> is dual leg and consists of a sulfur trap, NOx adsorbers, and catalyzed particulate filters (CPF). During regeneration, supplementary ARCO ECD low-sulfur diesel fuel is injected upstream of the adsorber and CPF in the exhaust. Steady state and transient emission test results with and without the <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> (EAS) are presented. Results of soot filter regeneration by injecting low-sulfur diesel fuel and slip of unregulated emissions, such as NH 3, are discussed. Effects of adsorber size and bypass strategy on NOx conversion efficiency and fuel economy penalty are also presented in this paper. The results indicate that if the supplementary fuel injection is optimized, NH 3 slip is negligible. During the FTP cycle, injection of low sulfur diesel fuel can create temperature exotherms high enough to regenerate a loaded CPF. With the optimized NOx adsorber regeneration strategies the fuel injection penalty can be reduced by 40 to 50 %. Results for various other issues like low temperature light off, reductant optimization, exhaust sulfur management, system integration and design trade-off, are also presented and discussed in this paper.

The DPF’s main function is to trap particulate matter (soot) from the exhaust stream. The trapped soot is removed by regeneration of the filter.

The dependence of the resulting pressure drop, and hence the fuel consumption penalty, on the particulate matter distribution along the inlet channels is discussed in this paper taking as reference experimental data obtained in water injection tests before the particulate filter. This technique is demonstrated to reduce the particulate filter pressure drop without negative effects on filtration performance. In order to justify these experimental data, the characteristics of the particulate layer are diagnosed applying modeling techniques.

40|$|The {{application}} of computer simulation {{in the development}} of catalytic <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> for cars is over thirty years old. However, ever-increasingly stringent exhaust emissions legislation requires an ever-increasing degree of accuracy and complexity in the mathematical models applied.

In this paper it is proved, by means of typical case studies, that the above modelling approach, with the necessary refining, can be brought to the level of accurately predicting the behaviour of advanced catalyst systems employed in EURO- 3 and EURO- 4 emissions homologation.

Variable valve actuation (VVA) can be used to improve the thermal management of the aftertreatment system- first to accelerate the warmup following a cold start and then to maintain its temperature economically.

In diesel applications the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) is located closest to the engine and is thus the most vulnerable to poisoning contaminants, such as phosphorus originating from fuel and oil additives, which deactivates the catalyst. An idea to reduce the impact from phosphorus impurities (recently patented by Scania CV) is to place a low-cost sacrificial substrate, consisting {{of one or more}} pillared clay mineral (PILC) with high affinity for phosphorus, upstream the aftertreatment system in order to protect and thus increase the lifetime of the catalytic components which contain platinum group metals.

The PILCs were exposed to a phosphorus-containing gaseous mixture using a lab-scale experimental setup in order to determine their phosphorus sorption potential. The PILC materials exhibit potential to function as sacrificial substrates for phosphorus in the intended application. It was indicated to be a correlation between increasing iron content (wt%) and increasing phosphorus sorption capability.

40|$|Emissions of {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOX) formed during the burning process in internal combustion engines {{is a major}} contributor to global air pollutions. One effective way to reduce NOX in lean environments, i. e. oxygen excess is selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH 3 -SCR). Metal-exchanged zeolites have proven to be active as SCR catalysts, where copper and iron are the most common metals. When using metal-exchanged zeolites in exhaust aftertreatment systems, several challenges arise. Resistance towards hydrothermal deactivation and chemisorption of impurities on the active sites of the catalyst are two of the more important challenges. Temperatures between 600 - 700 oC can be seen during regeneration of the particulate filter, which usually is placed upstream close to the SCR catalyst in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system,</b> and therefore hydrothermal stability of the metal-exchanged zeolite is crucial. Furthermore, high tolerance against catalyst poisons which originate from (bio-) fuels and lubricating oils is desired, where phosphorous and potassium are among the more important poisons. 	In this thesis thermal and chemical deactivation of iron-exchanged zeolite BEA as SCR catalyst is experimentally studied with special focus paid on the active iron species. Based on the experimental results a kinetic model is developed to predict the decreased activity of the catalyst after deactivation. Several characterization techniques are used to evaluate and correlate structural changes in the catalyst with the decreased activity. Catalysts are prepared and characterized using BET, XPS, XRD, TPD, in-situ FTIR and UV-Vis. The catalytic performance of the samples is measured using a flow-reactor system. 	It is concluded that the hydrothermal deactivation of Fe-BEA is a result of migration of isolated iron species forming iron cluster inside the zeolite pores and iron particles located on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. Further, it is shown that the growth of iron clusters and particles can be partially reversed by high temperature hydrogen treatment. The chemical deactivation due to phosphorous exposure is the result of formation of metaphosphates replacing hydroxyl groups on the active isolated iron species. Furthermore, the chemical deactivation of Fe-BEA by potassium is concluded to be due to exchange and loss of active isolated iron species in the zeolite forming smaller iron clusters inside the zeolite pores. 	A kinetic model where different iron species are included was developed based on the hydrothermal deactivation experiments and validated using phosphorous and potassium exposed samples. By fitting and fix the kinetic parameters towards a fresh sample, the decreased SCR activity can be predicted by just decreasing the number of active iron sites, representing loss of active iron species due to hydrothermal treatment and poisoning. 	The effect of gas atmosphere during solid-state ion-exchange of copper-zeolites was studied as well. It is concluded that copper becomes highly mobile due to formation of copper-ammine complexes in presence of NH 3 after reduction of CuII to CuI by adding NO in the exposing gas during the solid-state ion-exchange. Copper-exchanged zeolites could be prepared by exposing physical mixtures of copper-oxides with zeolites to NO and NH 3 at as low temperature as 250 oC. 	Finally, the ammonia formation during the rich period of NOX storage and reduction (NSR) cycles was studied using kinetic modeling for the possibility of combining NSR and SCR catalysts in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> It is concluded that the formation of ammonia is due to stored NOX and hydrogen from the gas {{in the first half of}} the catalyst.

40|$|Emissions from {{internal}} combustion engines contain many components {{that have a}} detrimental {{effect on the environment}} and on human health, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). In addition, the final product of any combustion of fossil fuel - carbon dioxide (CO 2) - contributes to global warming. In order to reduce the emissions of CO 2, more efficient engines are needed, and these typically necessitate the development of new <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> Lean-burn engines (e. g. the diesel engine) are more efficient than conventional petrol engines, but emit more PM and require addition of a reducing agent to reduce NOx. Usually, a urea-water solution or a hydrocarbon is sprayed into the system. In addition, the PM content of the exhaust must be reduced in terms of both mass and number. In the current work, detailed mathematical models are used to investigate the motion and deposition of PM and droplets in generic <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> It is shown that PM from {{internal combustion}} engines can be divided into three groups depending on their size, and that these groups are transported differently in the <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> This is reflected in the extent and location of particle deposition, and can be taken advantage of in emission control engineering. Several particle transport models of differing complexity are presented and used to study the PM trapping characteristics of a number of filter designs. Also the influence of turbulence on the transport of particulate matter and droplets in <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> is studied by means of numerical simulations. Finally, a model for simulations of gas-solids systems involving particles of size significant to that of the bounding geometry but also to the mean free path of the gas is presented. This very challenging flow situation is encountered inside the pores of a porous wall in a typical diesel particulate filter. It is shown that the new model can provide more accurate results than the previously available methods of similar computational cost. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} (HC-SCR) is emerging {{as one of the}} most practical methods for the removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from light-duty-diesel engine exhaust gas. In order to further promote the chemical reactions of NOx-SCR by hydrocarbons, an understanding of the HC-SCR process at the molecular level is necessary. In the present work, a novel surface-reaction mechanism for HC-SCR is set up with emphasis on microkinetic analysis aiming to investigate the chemical behaviour during the process at a molecular level via detailed elementary reaction steps. Propane (C 3 H 8) is chosen as the reductant of HC-SCR. The simulation is designed for a single channel of a monolith, typical for automotive catalytic converters, coated with a silver alumina catalyst (Ag/Al 2 O 3). The complicated physical and chemical details occurring in the catalytic converter are investigated by using the numerical method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled with the mechanism. The C 3 H 8 -SCR reaction mechanism consists of 94 elementary reactions, 24 gas-phase species and 24 adsorbed surface species. The mechanism is optimised by tuning some important reaction parameters against some measurable data from experiments. The optimised mechanism then is validated with another set of experimental data. The numerical simulation shows good agreements between the modelling and the experimental data. Finally, the numerical modelling also provides information that is difficult to measure for example, gas-phase concentration distribution, temperature profiles, wall temperatures and the occupation of adsorbed species on catalyst surface. Consequently, computational modelling can be used as an effective tool to design and/or optimise the catalytic <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} {{maldistribution}} phenomena inside porous ceramic diesel particulate filters {{and their effects}} on the pressure drop and regeneration characteristics {{is important for the}} successful design and modelling of this class of <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper the results from an experimental study of flow distribution in wall-flow diesel filters are presented. The experiments were performed on a specially designed cold flow test rig, under steady state flow conditions. The flow distribution at the exit of cordierite and SIC filters were measured with a hot film velocity sensor under low and medium mass flowrate conditions. The system configuration was varied to incorporate tests with and without the installation of an oxidation catalyst before the filter in order to investigate the effect of the catalyst honeycomb structure to the measured flow distribution. Flow distribution in filters loaded with various levels of particulate mass was also measured using the same device. The filters were loaded in a modern diesel engine run on catalyst-doped fuel up to different backpressure levels. A flow uniformity index was adopted in order to quantify the measured flow maldistribution by a single number for each case. The velocity distribution at the exit of the filters is found to be significantly affected by certain design and operating parameters of the system: diffuser-catalyst-filter. The results of this work aim to give a better assessment of the magnitude of flow maldistribution in diesel filters, which severely distort their pressure drop characteristics and affect the distribution of collected soot mass. In this way, a previously neglected aspect of the complex three-dimensional filter regeneration behaviour is better understood...|$|E
40|$|The current {{technology}} within {{combustion engines}} {{have the possibility}} of handling the more stringent legislative demands on combustion engines. However the required solutions are getting more expensive and technically challenging. One possible way towards a more simple <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> {{is the use of}} the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine cycle. The main advantage of the HCCI engine is its low output of NOx exhaust emissions. Because of its indirect combustion initiation the main disadvantage is that it requires closed loop control of its combustion process. Two methods for engine timing control were used, dual fuels or variable valve actuation(VVA). With dual fuels the timing change was achieved by changing the autoignition properties of the homogeneous charge and with VVA, timing control was achieved by changing the effective compression ratio. This thesis focuses on the control of the HCCI engine. For the purpose of studying control of the HCCI engine, special engine control software was developed. This software aimed towards engine cycle-to-cycle control and actuation. Another aid in the development was the use of Matlab/Simulink for the design of powerful control algorithms. Successful system identification control design has been shown. Different control strategies were tested, amongst the most successful was the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC), which is a control strategy that can take care of the nonlinear behavior of the dynamic engine system and its actuators. It was concluded that low order models were sufficient for capturing the important HCCI engine dynamics. The use of ion current for detection and control of the HCCI combustion was also shown. A method for obtaining combustion timing from the ion current was defined and investigated. Closed-loop control using ion currents on an HCCI engine was demonstrated...|$|E

Most of them for oxidation or reduction of harmful emissions of particulates and fumes require a certain temperature to be reached that changes with the exhaust temperature, i. e. the points of engine operation. The article describes the effect of oxidation reactor and particulate filter temperatures on specific emissions of gaseous compounds and particulate matter during the modified NRSC engine test. Before the first measurement cycle, the engine was idling, before the second measurement cycle, the exhaust system was heated with exhaust gases at full engine load until passive regeneration of the particle filter occurred (noticeable decrease in instantaneous particle concentration) ...|$|R
40|$|A new cost-based control {{strategy}} is presented that optimizes engine-aftertreatment performance under all operating conditions. This Integrated Emission Management strategy minimizes fuel consumption within the set emission limits by on-line adjustment of air management {{based on the}} actual state of the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> Following a model-based approach, Integrated Emission Management offers a framework for future {{control strategy}} development. This approach alleviates calibration complexity, since it allows to make optimal trade-offs in an operational cost sense.

40|$|There {{is great}} {{concern about the}} adverse effects {{associated}} with exposure to diesel exhaust. There is increasing evidence that diesel exhaust particulate matter (PM) is carcinogenic and may cause cancer. Non-cancerous lung damage and respiratory problems are also associated with exposure to diesel exhaust as well as acid rain and smog. Diesel exhaust PM is very easily respirable once emitted into the atmosphere and therefore poses a significant health problem. A diesel engine emissions particle removal system which utilizes Electrostatic Precipitation (ESP) and Non Thermal Plasma (NTP) technologies was studied for trapping and oxidizing micron sized particles (0. 01 to 10 microns) in the exhaust. Particles are first charged in a mono polar manner in a NTP in the diesel exhaust stream, and then collected on an electrically grounded precipitation surface. Gaseous radicals produced in the NTP oxidize the precipitated particles to provide a continuously regenerating system. This device is targeted to help meet recently instituted US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier II as well as upcoming European (Euro 4, 5) and Japanese diesel particulate emissions standards. This system can be coupled with a suitable catalyst or other emissions treatment technologies to produce a complete <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> Analytical and empirical methods were used to model the proposed Self Regenerating Diesel Emissions Particulate Trap. The analysis showed that a total particle precipitation efficiency of greater than 95 % could be obtained using less than 0. 5 % of total engine energy output at a vehicle speed of 120 km/hr for a compact diesel powered vehicle. It was determined that the energy requirement for producing gaseous radicals in the exhaust stream is higher than is needed for particle charging and precipitation. It was also determined that the conversion of radicals can be accomplished using less than 2 % of the total engine output. The results of the model developed shows that the proposed device would be effective reducing diesel PM emissions on a heavy-duty vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years, {{the concern for}} {{environmental}} effects of different industrial applications has gained a great importance. One explanation for contributing to the global warming and air pollution is the release of particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the increasing amount of vehicles that are serving our roads. New efficient engines are under constant development to utilize the fuels in a more efficient way. This also includes the <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> (EATS) that cleans the gases from the engine exhaust. Reducing the amount of released PM is of great importance to avoid contamination of our cities and avoid health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. This thesis aims to gain knowledge in the soot oxidation process to reduce release of PM to our environment. A unique In-Situ reactor from Chalmers, designed for detailed studies of soot oxidation, has been studied both with experiments and simulations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An iterative method has been applied between the experiments and the simulations were the outcome from the result is trying to improve the next setup. Experiments have been performed to study the oxidation process and simulations have been executed to study {{the behavior of the}} heat and fluid flow in the reactor to improve the reactor design and the way the reactor is operated. The results gave a good descriptions and understanding of the reactor behavior and its performance. The results include the obtained pressure drop and temperatures needed for reaction at different flow rates. As soot oxidation experiments have been executed, several conclusions have been drawn on the reaction dependencies of different temperature levels and oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and oxygen levels (O 2). Multiphase simulations have also been performed to study the effect of thermophoresis on the deposition of particles in the reactor. The results show that the particles follow the continuous phase well and that only a small effect of thermophoresis is obtained when the reactor is used with a continuous flow of air as the heat source as in the original design. The small effect of thermophoresis indicates that particle deposit on the glass tube won’t decrease the possibility to use the reactor In-Sit...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} filters (DPFs) {{are well}} assessed aftertreatment devices, equipping almost every modern diesel engine {{on the market}} to comply with today’s stringent emission standards. However, an accurate estimation of soot loading, which is instrumental to ensuring optimal performance of the whole engine-after-treatment assembly, is still a major challenge. In fact, several highly coupled physical-chemical phenomena occur at the same time, and {{a vast number of}} engine and exhaust dependent parameters make this task even more daunting. This challenge may be solved with models characterized by different degrees of detail (0 -D to 3 -D) depending on the specific application. However, the use of real-time, but accurate enough models, may be the primary hurdle that has to be overcome when confronted with advanced exhaust emissions control challenges, such as the integration of the DPF with the engine or other critical aftertreatment components (selective catalytic reduction or other NOx control components), or to properly develop model-based OBD sensors. This paper aims at addressing real time DPF modeling issues with special regard to key parameter settings, by using the 1 -D code called ExhAUST (exhaust aftertreatment unified simulation tool), which was jointly developed by the University of Rome Tor Vergata and West Virginia University. ExhAUST is characterized by a novel and unique full analytical treatment of the wall that allows a highly detailed representation of the soot loading evolution inside the DPF porous matrix. Numerical results are compared with experimental data gathered at West Virginia University engine laboratory using a MY 2004 MackVRMP 7 - 355 E, an 11 liter, 6 -cylinder, inline heavy-duty diesel engine coupled to a Johnson Matthey CCRT diesel oxidation catalystþCDPF, catalyzed DPF <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> To that aim, the engine test bench was equipped with a DPF weighing system to track soot loading over a specifically developed engine operating procedure.

Thus, the use of ExhAUST for application to advanced after-treatment control appears to be a promising tool at thi...|$|E

40|$|Particulate {{matter is}} formed during {{incomplete}} combustion in modern diesel and gasoline engines. These particulates start to grow from tiny carbonaceous structures or condensed volatiles and eventually form larger porous agglomerates. When emitted to the ambient air, they {{may end up}} in human lungs and eventually cause premature deaths among susceptible individuals. It is therefore imperative to remove as much (on a mass basis) and as many (on a number basis) of these particles before the exhaust exits the tailpipe. In the continued development and optimization of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> {{for the removal of}} diesel and gasoline particulate matter, computer-aided simulations can help both to cut the design and development time and to provide information that is otherwise difficult to access by direct measurements. In the present work, detailed mathematical models are used to investigate the motion and deposition of particulate matter in generic <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> It is shown that particulate matter from internal combustion engines can be divided into three groups depending on their size, and that these groups are transported differently in the <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> This is reflected in the extent and location of particle deposition, and can be taken advantage of in emission control engineering. Furthermore, it is shown that the different sensitivity of the particles to the range of transport phenomena present have important consequences for the construction of computationally efficient models for describing the particle motion. In addition, the effects of turbulence on the motion of particulate matter are discussed. It has often been suggested that the turbulent-to-laminar flow transition {{in the first part of}} the channels enhance the mass transfer characteristics of a monolithic reactor. With the aid of comprehensive numerical models, the effects of the upstream turbulence on the extent of particle deposition inside the channels can be quantified. It is also shown that the flow field – and thus the particle motion – inside the channels can be significantly affected by ageing and deposit accumulation in the areas surrounding the channel inlets. </p...|$|R

This contribution gives an overview on a novel approach to determine the catalyst state directly by a microwave-based technique. The method exploits the fact that the catalyst housing acts as a microwave cavity resonator. As “sensing” elements, one or two simple antennas are mounted inside the catalyst canning. The electrical properties of the catalyst device (ceramic honeycomb plus coating and storage material) can be measured.
