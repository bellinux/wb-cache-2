40|$|Abstract: The authors analyse the {{performance}} and device physics of nitride laser diodes that exhibit the highest room-temperature continuous-wave output power. The analysis is based on advanced laser simulation. The laser model self-consistently combines band structure and free-carrier gain calculations with two-dimensional simulations of wave <b>guiding,</b> <b>carrier</b> transport and heat flux. Material parameters used in the model are carefully evaluated. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements is achieved. The maximum output power is limited by electron leakage into the p-doped ridge. Leakage escalation is caused by strong self-heating, gain reduction and elevated carrier density within the quantum wells. Built-in polarisation fields {{are found to be}} effectively screened at high-power operation. Improved heat-sinking is predicted to allow for a significant increase of the maximum output power. ...|$|R
40|$|Clathrin/adaptor protein- 1 -coated {{carriers}} {{connect the}} secretory and the endocytic pathways. Carrier biogenesis relies on distinct protein networks changing membrane shape at the trans-Golgi network, each regulating coat assembly, F-actin-based mechanical forces, or the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers. How these different hubs are spatiotemporally coordinated remains largely unknown. Using in vitro reconstitution systems, quantitative proteomics, and lipidomics, {{as well as}} in vivo cell-based assays, we characterize the protein networks controlling membrane lipid composition, membrane shape, and carrier scission. These include PIP 5 K 1 A and phospholipase C-beta 3 controlling the conversion of PI[4]P into diacylglycerol. PIP 5 K 1 A binding to RAC 1 provides a link to F-actin-based mechanical forces needed to tubulate membranes.

40|$|The {{realization}} of p-n junctions in graphene, {{combined with the}} gapless and chiral nature of its massless Dirac fermions {{has led to the}} observation of many intriguing phenomena such as quantum Hall effect in bipolar regime, Klein tunneling, and Fabry-Pérot interferences all of which involve electronic transport across p-n junctions. Ballistic snake states propagating along the p-n junctions have been predicted to induce conductance oscillations, manifesting their twisting nature. However, transport studies along p-n junctions have so far only been performed in low mobility devices. Here, we report the observation of conductance oscillations due to ballistic snake states along a p-n interface in high quality graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. These snake states are exceptionally robust as they can propagate over 12 μm, limited only by the size of our sample, and survive up to at least 120 K.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that MMP- 14 is highly {{expressed}} in a panel of human solid tumors and poses as a potential molecular target for anticancer drugs. Currently, major strategies for targeted therapeutics have mainly focused on the use of antibody or ligand-based agents. For seeking an alternative approach, it is of interest to employ endogenous proteins as drug delivery carriers. Considering the facts that TIMP 2, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, shows specific interaction with MMP- 14 and that Lidamycin (LDM), an extremely potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, consists of an apoprotein (LDP) and a highly active enediyne (AE); we designed and prepared a TIMP 2 -based and enediyne-integrated fusion protein LDP(AE) -TIMP 2 by DNA recombination and molecular reconstitution consecutively. Furthermore, the MMP- 14 binding attributes of the active fusion protein were determined and its therapeutic efficacy against human esophageal carcinoma KYSE 150 xenograft and human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 xenograft models in nude mice was investigated. It is suggested that TIMP 2, the endogenous and MMP- 14 binding protein, might serve as a <b>guided</b> <b>carrier</b> for targeted therapeutics...|$|R

There is increasing attention paid to nonlinear ballistic transport both experimentally [1 – 5] and theoretically [6 – 11]. Nonlinearity is important in mesoscopic conductors because of the small device feature sizes and the fact that in principle nonlinearity starts at any nonzero current. Recently, nonlinear ballistic transport in a semiconductor microjunction, where an antidot <b>guides</b> <b>carriers</b> to a predetermined direction, was studied [12]. A new rectification phenomenon was among the observed striking geometric effects. It was argued that the so-called ballistic rectifier has no intrinsic threshold.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that binding of Helicobacter pylori to sialylated carbohydrates {{is dependent on}} the presence of the carboxyl group and the glycerol chain of Neu 5 Ac. In this work we investigated the importance of GlcNAc in the bind-ing trisaccharide Neu 5 Ac 3 Gal 4 GlcNAc {{and the role of the}} N-acetamido groups of both Neu 5 Ac and GlcNAc. An important part of the project was epitope dissection, that is chemical derivatizations of the active carbohydrate followed by binding studies. In addition we used a panel of various unmod-ified carbohydrate structures in the form of free oligosaccharides or glycolipids. These were tested for binding by hemaggluti-nation inhibition assay, TLC overlay tests, and a new quanti-tative approach using radiolabeled neoglycoproteins. The studies showed that the N-acetamido group of Neu 5 Ac is important for binding by H. pylori, whereas the same group of GlcNAc is not. In addition, Fuc attached to GlcNAc, as tested with sialyl-Lewis x, did not affect the binding. Free Neu 5 Ac was inactive as inhibitor, and Neu 5 Ac 3 Gal turned out to be active. The binding preference for neolacto struc-tures was confirmed, although one strain also was inhibited by lacto chains. The combined results revealed that an intact Neu 5 Ac is crucial for the interactions with H. pylori. Parts of Gal also seem to be necessary, whereas the role of the GlcNAc is secondary. GlcNAc does influence binding, how-ever, primarily serving as a <b>guiding</b> <b>carrier</b> for the binding epitope rather than being a part of the binding structure...|$|R
