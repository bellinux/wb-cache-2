40|$|The {{importance}} of science, {{engineering and technology}} to economic growth has long been recognised by many countries. As such, ensuring {{that there is an}} adequate supply of graduates in these areas is critical to the future development of a modern society. In 2001, the British Government commissioned an important study into "the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematical skills". The report's findings highlighted a significant fall in the number of students taking physics, mathematics, chemistry and engineering degrees in Britain, with the downward trends a threat to the Government's attempts to improve productivity and competitiveness. Much evidence suggests we have a similar problem. Department of Education, Science and Training <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolments</b> for Australian students shows that from 2002 to 2004, demand for natural and physical sciences increased by only 4. 9 per cent, engineering enrolments fell by 1. 5 per cent and information technology dropped 15. 9 per cent. These figures prompted the announcement of the Australian Government's audit of science, engineering and technology skills earlier this year. Given the British study concludes that they have a problem, what does this say for Australia...|$|E

40|$|Research {{paper that}} was {{published}} in the Zimbabwe Bulletin of Teacher Education,This article analyses the problem of school dropouts in Zimbabwe during the period 1980 to 2004 with the aim of suggesting how the problem can be eliminated. The discussion is important {{in view of the fact}} that the country is experience critical human resource challenges yet the education and training system is releasing large numbers of young boys and girls who have the potential to contribute meaningfully to socio-economic development. The methodology involved the identification and analysis of statistical <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolments</b> within schools and colleges from government publications and websites. The analysis showed that the average school dropout rate of about 26 % between 1980 and 2004 was rather too high. This was because the dropouts were not being adequately catered for at tertiary level because of strict entry requirements stipulating formal school qualifications. As a solution to this problem, the discussion proposes a paradigm shift within policy makers to address the issues of compulsory school attendance between the ages of six and eighteen, compulsory vocational education and training for all school dropouts, and the generation of local resources and technology for use within the education and training system to reduce costs...|$|E

40|$|The higher {{education}} in Nigeria has witnessed a tremendous growth in the last 50 years in terms of producing manpower that could bring about development. However, the problem of Nigeria today is not about human and natural resources, but how to translate the human potentials to meet the realization of its all round development and sustain economic growth. It is a paradox that the nation remains undeveloped. Furthermore, the educational system has failed to serve its purpose of producing manpower with relevant skills and the nation’s development is hampered by poverty, dilapidated infrastructure; economic recession, militancy and unemployment. Therefore, the paper examines the role of tertiary education and training for entrepreneurship on manpower development and sustainable development in Nigeria. <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> in tertiary institutions, employment and unemployment trend were obtained from relevant authorities.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{dynamics}} of the Doctorate of Business Administration (DBA) in Australia through the lens of a changing higher education landscape. The paper reflects on issues raised in a previous analysis of DBA programmes undertaken a decade ago, and highlights persistent challenges and emerging opportunities for professional Doctorate programmes in the Australian context. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were undertaken with higher degree research directors, deans of graduate schools, and DBA programme directors from all 18 Australian institutions offering the DBA in 2013. Quantitative <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolments,</b> accreditation requirements, course structures; and demographics are contextualised within a qualitative view of programme purposes, student and institutional motivations, rationales and concerns. Particular focus is given to perceptions of the difference between traditional research doctorates (PhDs) and professional doctorates, especially the DBA. Findings: In the decade from 2003 to 2013 DBA enrolments are down but enquiries are up, indicating unmet demand. There is a shift in the players, with some smaller, regional universities dramatically increasing their enrolments, and larger, traditional institutions exiting the space altogether. Significant changes in accreditation criteria have generated a perceptual shift: where DBAs previously suffered from “academic snobbery” regarding their legitimacy, this perception is being challenged by standards which require DBA equivalence with a PhD. This shift in standards has also created some confusion amongst supervisors and candidates. Originality/value: There is limited research into the DBA award or its candidates, and academic literature is generally silent on DBA supervision. This piece of research, one of very few that specifically examine the DBA, reflects on the past decade, analyses the present context and identifies emerging issues for the delivery of DBA programmes in Australia...|$|E

We tested the feasibility and acceptability of making unscreened results and data from a complex chronic disease pathway (renal medicine) available to patients over the Internet in a project involving more than half of renal units in the UK. Methods Content and presentation of the Renal PatientView (RPV) system was developed with patient groups. It was designed to receive information from multiple local information systems and to require minimal extra work in units. After piloting in 4 centres in 2005 it was made available more widely. Opinions were sought from both patients who enrolled and from those who did not in a paper survey, and from staff in an electronic survey. Anonymous <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolments</b> and usage were extracted from the webserver. Results By mid 2011 over 17, 000 patients from 47 of the 75 renal units in the UK had registered. Users had a wide age range (90 [*]yrs) but were younger and had more years of education than non-users. They were enthusiastic about the concept, found it easy to use, and 80 % felt it gave them a better understanding of their disease. The most common reason for not enrolling was being unaware of the system. A minority of patients had security concerns, and these were reduced after enrolling. Staff responses were also strongly positive. They reported that it aided patient concordance and disease management, and increased the quality of consultations with a neutral effect on consultation length. Neither patient nor staff responses suggested that RPV led to an overall increase in patient anxiety or to an increased burden on renal units beyond the time required to enrol each patient. Conclusions Patient Internet access to secondary care records concerning a complex chronic disease is feasible and popular, providing an increased sense of empowerment and understanding, with no serious identified negative consequences. Security concerns were present but rarely prevented participation. These are powerful reasons to make this type of access more widely available. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Enrolment {{of cancer}} {{patients}} {{in clinical trials}} is associated with significant positive outcomes. There are, however, limited Australian <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> of patients with haematological malignancies to clinical trials. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to document the number of patients with haematological malignancies enrolled on clinical trials in NSW, to establish the barriers to trial recruitment and to examine possible means by which clinical trials participation may be improved. Methods: Quantitative <b>data</b> <b>on</b> clinical trial accrual were obtained from all sites participating in clinical trials in haematological malignancies in NSW from 2004 to 2007 and were compared with the cancer incidence data for that period. Qualitative <b>data</b> <b>on</b> barriers and strategies for improvement were gathered using semi-structured interviews with clinical trials professionals from throughout NSW. Results: Between 2004 and 2007 there were significant increases in the number of active centres, clinical trials and trial participation, and by 2007, 10. 5 % of all eligible patients with haematological malignancies in NSW were enrolled in relevant clinical trials. Resource constraints were the greatest perceived barrier to participation, but the success of clinical trials is also challenged by difficulties associated with communication, ethics review, trial coordination, trial design and support for emerging centres. Conclusion: While participation in clinical trials in haematological cancer in NSW improved between 2004 and 2007, participation in clinical trials remains suboptimal. The development of specific strategies to address barriers to participation may facilitate increased enrolment and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in patients with haematological malignancies...|$|R

The project was funded by the Research Excellence Branch of the Australian Research Council. Importantly, the project was not merely the creation of yet another database but constitutes a valuable research resource in its own right. It provides an alternative source of data about research training with a focus on research output and research capacity building rather than input as does <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolment.</b> The database is significant as {{it can be used to}} track knowledge production in Australia over a twenty year period and contains approximately 54, 000 bibliographic records. The database of Australian PhDs has been constructed from downloaded bibliographic records from Libraries Australia. Recommendations for practice relate to university libraries, doctoral candidates, and the coded database. We suggest that libraries are more consistent with cataloguing procedures, including the thesis ‘publication’ date, and that they are more timely in uploading their thesis records to Libraries Australia or, alternatively, Australian Research Online. We also suggest that PhD candidates code their own theses using the new ANZSRC scheme (which replaced the RFCD classification in 2008), and also use clear and communicative thesis titles and thesis abstracts.

We use <b>data</b> <b>on</b> total <b>enrolment</b> in Primary, Secondary and at University to estimate average years of schooling using perpetual inventory methods. Several difficulties arise due to missing data. We use some simulations to assess the quality of schooling estimates and show {{that most of them}} become reliable around 1900. Then, we extend our series over the period 1960 - 2010 using Cohen and Soto (2007) database, which relies mainly on surveys. The correlation between the two sets of average years of schooling in 1960 is equal to 0. 96. We use a measurement error framework to merge the two databases while correcting a systematic measurement bias in Cohen and Soto (2007); the latter {{comes from the fact that}} surveys conducted in the 1990 s were used to infer average schooling in 1960 without taking into account differential mortality across educational groups. Basic descriptive statistics show a continuous spread of education that has accelerated in the second half of the twentieth century. We find evidence of fast convergence in years of schooling for a sub-sample of advanced countries during the 1870 - 1914 globalization period, and of modest convergence since 1980. Less advanced countries have been excluded from the convergence club in both cases. ...|$|R

Results from multivariate probit and OLS analyses suggest that political and institutional factors are among the strongest determinants explaining the variation in participation and enrolment in RSBY. In particular, districts in state governments that are politically affiliated with the opposition or neutral parties at the centre are more likely to participate in RSBY, and have higher levels of enrolment. Districts in states with a lower quality of governance, a pre-existing state-level health insurance scheme, or with a lower level of fiscal deficit as compared to GDP, are significantly less likely to participate, or have lower enrolment rates. Among socioeconomic factors, we find some evidence of weak or imprecise targeting. Districts with a higher share of socioeconomically backward castes are less likely to participate, and their enrolment rates are also lower. Finally, districts with more non-poor households {{may be more likely to}} participate, although with lower enrolment rates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{transition}} from school to labour market for the generation {{of young people in}} CEE/CIS who experienced the most turbulent years of the transition in their formative years. Using administrative <b>data</b> <b>on</b> school <b>enrolment,</b> as well as data from labour force surveys, the paper tracks the main trends in education enrollments in primary, lower and upper secondary, showing that the impact of the economic difficulties of the early 1990 s was greater in the poorest countries of the region, and was reflected in particular in falling enrollments for the non-compulsory levels of education. The post- 1998 period of economic recovery brought with it a marked divergence between upper secondary education enrollments in the Central and Eastern European countries, {{and the rest of the}} region. However, <b>data</b> <b>on</b> enrollments give only a partial picture of what happened to the school system during the transition; statistics on attendance and achievements from other data sources suggest that inequality in school access and quality increased both across the region and within countries. Education trends (using indicators measuring both quantity and quality) influence outcomes in the labour market, but can also be influenced by them: labour force surveys’ results show that young people in CEE/CIS face a high risk of unemployment or underemployment. At the same time, in particular in CEE, lack of employment opportunities encourages young people to stay longer in the education system. Mismatches between the outcomes of the education systems and labour market demand, as well as the character of recent economic growth, have resulted in significant imbalances in the labour market. transition from school to work; transitional economies; youth;Baltic States; Eastern Europe; Russia;...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years Italy has {{undertaken}} a deep pension reform process of {{both public and}} private pillars. After the reforms the Italian pension system is still public and pay as you go, even if a lot of measures aimed at increasing the role of the funded private sector have been introduced since 1993. The main objective of the reform process has been the financial sustainability of the public scheme (to fulfil the constraints to the public finances fixed by the EU), which has been pursued by extending the retirement age, changing the pension benefit formula (from defined benefit to Notional Defined Contribution – NDC) and the indexation rule (from wages to prices), and linking benefits to the retirement age and to economic and demographic developments. The latter has been done in an actuarially fair way by using the NDC method. However, in order to achieve sustainability, the reforms have hugely reduced the replacement rates provided by the public scheme (especially for early retirees). In order to keep the old replacement rates constant and, in some cases not to be exposed to social exclusion risks, workers will have to work longer (because benefits depend on the retirement age) or will have to pay contributions to supplementary private pension schemes, as often suggested in the political economy debate. However, participation in private schemes (both occupational and personal) is voluntary, recent (they were regulated in 1993) and their take up is still low. At the end of 2006, the membership of pension funds was about 14 % of private sector employees; in order to increase it the 2005 reform, phased in from January 2007, has sought to induce workers to devolve to pension funds the TFR (trattamento di fine rapporto), a deferred part of the salary which is retained by firms and is paid lump sum to employees when the job relationship ends (for firing, dismissal, retirement). This paper analyzes the role of Italian private pension schemes, focussing, in particular, on the choice – induced by the 2005 reform – between maintaining TFR in firms or moving it to pension funds. These choices are treated as two different investment options in our appraisal of the development of private pensions in Italy. In the second section we will describe the main features of private schemes are described and the TFR is defined, presenting also some <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> in pension funds after the 2005 reform. In the third section the many elements which can affect individual choice between retaining TFR in firms or devolving it to a pension fund are analyzed, showing that these two options are not at all perfect substitutes. In the fourth section the main features of the Italian private schemes development are assessed, focussing especially on their risk-return profile, on the administrative costs they impose on members and on the effects on the Italian economic system of their asset allocation strategy. The conclusions, outlined in the fifth section, will provide an overall evaluation of the reforms in the 1990 s, focussing on the possible auspicious role of private pension schemes within the Italian pension system...|$|R

Additional pyridoxine supplementation of malnourished children treated for tuberculosis is advisable, particularly those HIV-infected. © 2010 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Students from low-income {{families}} {{are eligible to}} student aid under the federal students' financial assistance scheme (BAfoeG) in Germany. We {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} a recent reform of student aid that substantially increased the amount received by eligible students to raise enrolment rates into tertiary education. We view this reform as a 'natural experiment' and apply the difference-in-difference methodology using a discrete-time hazard rate model to estimate the causal effect <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> rates into higher education. We find that the reform had a small positive but statistically insignificant effect <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> rates. Educational transitions, educational finance, natural experiment and difference-indifference estimation...|$|R

40|$|Following {{political}} opposition, all German {{states have}} abolished university tuition fees, which were originally {{implemented in the}} mid- 2000 s. Berthold U. Wigger outlines the findings {{of research on the}} effect tuition fees had <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> levels in German universities. He writes that contrary to expectations, tuition fees did not have an identifiable negative effect <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> levels within Germany. He argues that the German experience shows tuition fees will not necessarily deter potential students if they are set at a relatively low level, are combined with an effective student loans programme, and if exemptions are provided to students matching certain social criteria, such as low incomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{synthetic}} control method {{to look at}} how the L'Aquila earthquake affected subsequent enrolment at the local university. Such an issue is closely related to the economic consequences caused by this event given the large contribution made by the university to the local economy before the earthquake. The empirical results indicate that the earthquake had no statistically significant effect <b>on</b> first-year <b>enrolment</b> at the University of L'Aquila in the three academic years after the disaster. This natural disaster, however, caused a compositional change in the first-year student population, with a substantial {{increase in the number of}} students aged 21 or above. This is likely to have been driven by post-disaster measures adopted in an attempt to mitigate the expected negative effects <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> triggered by the earthquake. Finally, the results show also that the effect of the earthquake <b>on</b> <b>enrolment</b> varied by Faculty...|$|R
