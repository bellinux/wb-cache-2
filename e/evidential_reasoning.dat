Nearly {{all of the}} great minds of Western philosophy have found the argument worthy of their attention, {{and a number of}} criticisms and objections have been mounted. The first critic of the ontological argument was Anselm's contemporary, Gaunilo of Marmoutiers. He used the analogy of a perfect island, suggesting that the ontological argument could be used to prove the existence of anything. This was the first of many parodies, all of which attempted to show that the argument has absurd consequences. Later, Thomas Aquinas rejected the argument on the basis that humans cannot know God's nature. Also, David Hume offered an empirical objection, criticising its lack of <b>evidential</b> <b>reasoning</b> and rejecting the idea that anything can exist necessarily. Immanuel Kant's critique was based on what he saw as the false premise that existence is a [...] He argued that [...] "existing" [...] adds nothing (including perfection) to the essence of a being, and thus a [...] "supremely perfect" [...] being can be conceived not to exist. Finally, philosophers including C.D. Broad dismissed the coherence of a maximally great being, proposing that some attributes of greatness are incompatible with others, rendering [...] "maximally great being" [...] incoherent.|$|E

A conventional decision matrix used for modeling an MCDA problem is a special case of a belief decision matrix.|$|E

The multi-model based symptom generation procedure is used to detect changes of the current process behavior. The diagnosis task is accomplished by an <b>evidential</b> approximate <b>reasoning</b> scheme to handle different kinds of uncertainty that are inherently present in many real word processes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I give a brief {{overview}} of recent work on uncertainty in AI, and relate it to logical representations. Bayesian decision theory and logic are both normative frameworks for reasoning that emphasize different aspects of intelligent reasoning. Belief networks (Bayesian networks) are representations of independence that form the basis for understanding much of the recent work on <b>reasoning</b> under uncertainty, <b>evidential</b> and causal <b>reasoning,</b> decision analysis, dynamical systems, optimal control, reinforcement learning and Bayesian learning. The independent choice logic provides a bridge between logical representations and belief networks that lets us understand these other representations and their relationship to logic and shows how they can extended to first-order rule-based representations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{theory of}} <b>evidential</b> <b>reasoning</b> also defines non-additive probabilities of {{probability}} (or epistemic probabilities) {{as a general}} notion for both logical entailment (provability) and probability. The idea is to augment standard propositional logic by considering an epistemic operator K that represents the state of knowledge that a rational agent has about the world. Probabilities are then defined over the resulting epistemic universe Kp of all propositional sentences p, and {{it is argued that}} this is the best information available to an analyst. From this view, Dempster-Shafer theory appears to be a generalized form of probabilistic reasoning.|$|E

It {{is a broad}} tradition of collective self-experimentation backed up by <b>evidential</b> <b>reasoning,</b> fact-finding and learning. All formulations of PAR have in common the idea that research and action must be done 'with' people and not 'on' or 'for' people. It counters scientism by promoting the grounding of knowledge in human agency and social history (as in much of political economy). Inquiry based on PAR principles makes {{sense of the world}} through collective efforts to transform it, as opposed to simply observing and studying human behaviour and people's views about reality, in the hope that meaningful change will eventually emerge.|$|E

5000|$|A belief {{structure}} is a distributed assessment with beliefs. It {{is used in}} the <b>evidential</b> <b>reasoning</b> (ER) approach for multi-criteria decision analysis to represent the performance of an alternative option on a criterion. For example, the quality of a car engine may be assessed to be “excellent” {{with a high degree of}} belief (e.g. 0.6) due to its low fuel consumption, low vibration and high responsiveness. At the same time, the quality may be assessed to be only “good” with a lower degree of belief (e.g. 0.4 or less) because its quietness and starting can still be improved. Such an assessment can be modeled by a belief structure: Si(engine)={(excellent, 0.6), (good, 0.4)}, where Si stands for the assessment of engine on the ith criterion (quality). In the belief structure, “excellent” and “good” are assessment standards, whilst “0.6” and “0.4” are degrees of belief.|$|E

The study, Teaching Literacy Through Art, was administered by the LTA program, conducted by Randi Korn & Associates, and funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The study examined groups of third graders at P.S. 148 in Queens, and P.S. 86 in the Bronx. Along with classroom discussion of texts and visual documents, {{for the purposes of}} this study students were asked to discuss the painting The Artist and His Mother by Arshile Gorky (1926), and an excerpt from Cynthia Kabohata's 2004 book Kira-Kira. The study found that the third grade students who participated in the LTA program and had ample practice talking critically about works of art using inquiry, used more words to express themselves and demonstrated higher achievement in six categories of literacy and critical-thinking skills than their peers who had no experience with inquiry and visual documents.

In the second step, we focus on how to design a probability assignment function m(A) representing the exact belief in the proposition A depicted by one of features. A combining rule, which synthesizes probability assignment functions representing the fused information, is proposed based on Dempster-Shafer's <b>evidential</b> <b>reasoning.</b> The formulas for calculating the belief function Belief(A), the plausibility function Plausibility (A) and uncertainty probability are given.
