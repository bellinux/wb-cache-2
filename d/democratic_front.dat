5|$|Despite {{the violent}} {{overthrow}} of the communist government by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> in 1991, the airline managed to post a profit for the fiscal year. The market-oriented policies {{of the new government}} meant that the airline would remain operationally independent, and under Captain Bisrat Nigatu the airline remained fiscally sound, despite disruptions caused by the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.|$|E

5|$|Indian National Congress {{dominated}} {{the political scene}} in Tamil Nadu in 1950s and 1960s {{under the leadership of}} K. Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. Congress continues to be a major party in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. The party ruled with minimal opposition for 30 years in Andhra Pradesh before the formation of Telugu Desam Party by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao in 1982. Two prominent party systems in Kerala are the United <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front,</b> led by the Indian National Congress and the Left <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front,</b> led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). For the past fifty years, these two coalitions have been alternately in power and E. M. S. Namboodiripad, the first elected chief minister of Kerala in 1957 is credited {{as the leader of the}} first democratically elected communist government in the world. Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal are significant parties in Karnataka.|$|E

5|$|Followers of Biko's ideas re-organised as the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), which {{subsequently}} {{split into}} the Socialist Party of Azania and the Black People's Convention. Several figures {{associated with the}} ANC denigrated Biko during the 1980s. For instance, members of the ANC-affiliated United <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> assembled outside Biko's Ginsberg home shouting U-Steve Biko, I-CIA!, an allegation that Biko was a spy for the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These demonstrations resulted in clashes with Biko supporters from AZAPO.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major {{national}} political party, forged an electoral {{alliance with the}} Shiv Sena to dislodge the Congress in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections.

5|$|The keenest socialist {{among the}} Fasci leaders was Garibaldi Bosco. In August 1892 he {{attended}} the Socialist party’s congress at Genoa and on his return obediently purged his fascio of its anarchist and other non-socialist members. His ideal of a united <b>democratic</b> <b>front</b> was shared by the father of Sicilian socialism, Napoleone Colajanni. The leader in Catania, De Felice, also maintained contact with leading anarchists like Amilcare Cipriani. On these and other important issues there was much friction between Catania and Palermo.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
5|$|Jifna {{is governed}} by a village council {{consisting}} of ten members including the chairman. The council was founded in 1954, when a prominent resident, Nasri Ilias Samara, pressured the Jordanian authorities to recognize the institution, even though a village was normally required to have a population of at least 1,000 inhabitants for permission to establish a village council. The decision was approved by Jordan's then prime minister. Representatives from Jifna's largest families formed the original council's body, appointing Smara as chairman and Salim Issa Musleh as vice chairman. Jabi Na'im Kamil was elected as the chairman in 2005 and the Badil (Alternative) list—which represents a leftist alliance of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine and the Palestinian People's Party—won most of the council seats.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislative}} branch {{consists of a}} unicameral National Assembly of 193members who are elected every five years, and although the Malawian constitution provides for a Senate of 80seats, one {{does not exist in}} practice. If created, the Senate would provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts, as well as special interest groups including the disabled, youth and women. There are currently nine political parties, with the Democratic Progressive Party acting as the ruling party and the Malawi Congress Party and the United <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> acting as the main opposition parties in the National Assembly. Suffrage is universal at 18 years of age, and the central government budget for 2009/2010 is $1.7billion.|$|E
5|$|In April 1982, Mandela was {{transferred}} to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they {{believed that they were}} being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, President Mutharika {{split with}} the United <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> and began his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which has {{attracted}} reform-minded officials from other parties and won elections {{across the country}} in 2006. In 2008, President Mutharika had implemented reforms to address the country's major corruption problem, with at least five senior UDF party members facing criminal charges. In 2012, Malawi was ranked 7th of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, an index that measures several variables to provide a comprehensive view of the governance of African countries. Although the country's governance score was higher than the continental average, it was lower than the regional average for southern Africa. Its highest scores were for safety and rule of law, and its lowest scores were for sustainable economic opportunity, with a ranking of 47th on the continent for educational opportunities. Malawi's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011. Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014, with challenger Arthur Peter Mutharika defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda.|$|E

5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union {{motivated}} the Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on Russia's Cold War arch-rival, the United States, {{which had been}} courting the Somali government for some time. The U.S. eventually gave extensive military support. Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed the Somali Salvation <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force. Among these opposition movements were the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA), a Gadabuursi group which had been formed in the northwest to counter the Somali National Movement (SNM) Isaaq militia.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 2013, the South African Press Association {{reported}} that five opposition parties, namely COPE, the IFP, the African Christian Democratic Party, the United Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Front Plus, {{had formed a}} coalition with 20 specific priorities. The parties in the coalition, named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their own identity and contest the election individually. The IFP denied {{being part of the}} coalition, saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective {{along the lines of the}} defunct United <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front,</b> with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Cabindan rebels {{kidnapped and}} ransomed off foreign oil workers to in turn finance further {{attacks against the}} {{national}} government. FLEC militants stopped buses, forcing Chevron Oil workers out, and setting fire to the buses on 27 March and 23 April 1992. A large-scale battle took place between FLEC and police in Malongo on 14 May in which 25 mortar rounds accidentally hit a nearby Chevron compound. The government, fearing {{the loss of their}} prime source of revenue, began to negotiate with representatives from Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Renewal (FLEC-R), Armed Forces of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC), and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> of Cabinda (FDC) in 1995. Patronage and bribery failed to assuage the anger of FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended. In February 1997, FLEC-FAC kidnapped two Inwangsa SDN-timber company employees, killing one and releasing the other after receiving a $400,000 ransom. FLEC-FLAC kidnapped eleven people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a $500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol-oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an Angolan, in March 1999. While militants released the Angolan, the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5million for the hostages. When António Bento Bembe, the President of FLEC-R, showed up, the Angolan army arrested him and his bodyguards. The Angolan army later forcibly freed the other hostages on 7 July. By {{the end of the year}} the government had arrested the leadership of all three rebel organizations.|$|E
