The overall short-circuit current waveform and the components' mass and material are considered. The model was applied to a common disconnector of the network and characteristics of the results are plotted according to different forms of the asymmetric part of the short-circuit current waveform and the initial value of the short-circuit d. c. current component. The models' response is also investigated {{for a wide range}} of values of the crossing resistance and the component mass. It is convincingly shown that the short-circuit current waveform asymmetric part and component mass significantly affect temperature rise, and calculations of temperature rise which omit the above factors are questionable. An easy to use approximating equation is proposed, which could be considered in the mathematical approach of the phenomenon, according to international standards and facilitate the above components design.

Although APC {{protein is}} located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the protein domains required to maintain a predominantly cytoplasmic localization are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear export of APC is mediated by two intrinsic, leucine-rich, nuclear export signals (NESs) located near the amino terminus. Each NES was able to induce the nuclear export of a <b>fused</b> <b>carrier</b> protein. Both APC NESs were independently able {{to interact with the}} Crm 1 nuclear export factor and substitute for the HIV- 1 Rev NES to mediate nuclear mRNA export. Both APC NESs functioned within the context of APC sequence: an amino-terminal APC peptide containing both NESs interacted with Crm 1 and showed nuclear export in a heterokaryon nucleocytoplasmic shuttling assay. Also, mutation of both APC NESs resulted in the nuclear accumulation of the full-length, ∼ 320 -kDa APC protein, further establishing that the two intrinsic APC NESs are necessary for APC protein nuclear export. Moreover, endogenous APC accumulated in the nucleus of cells treated with the Crm 1 -specific nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. Together, these data indicate that APC is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein whose predominantly cytoplasmic localization requires NES function and suggests that APC may be important for signaling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of epithelial cells...|$|R

40|$|Main {{conclusion}} A RhoA-derived peptide <b>fused</b> to <b>carrier</b> molecules {{from plants}} showed enhanced biological activity of in vitro assays against {{respiratory syncytial virus}} compared to the RhoA peptide alone or the synthetic RhoA peptide. A RhoA-derived peptide has been reported {{for over a decade}} as a potential inhibitor of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection both in vitro and in vivo and is anticipated to be a promising alternative to monoclonal antibody-based therapy against RSV infection. However, there are several challenges to furthering development of this antiviral peptide, including improvement in the peptide's bioavailability, development of an efficient delivery system and identification of a cost-effective production platform. In this study, we have engineered a RhoA peptide as a genetic fusion to two carrier molecules, either lichenase (LicKM) or the coat protein (CP) of Alfalfa mosaic virus. These constructs were introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a tobacco mosaic virus-based expression vector and targets purified. The results demonstrated that the RhoA peptide fusion proteins were efficiently expressed in N. benthamiana plants, and that two of the resulting fusion proteins, RhoA-LicKM and RhoA 2 -FL-d 25 CP, inhibited RSV growth in vitro by 50 and 80 %, respectively. These data indicate the feasibility of transient expression of this biologically active antiviral RhoA peptide in plants and the advantage of using a carrier molecule to enhance target expression and efficacy...|$|R

40|$|Grim encodes {{a protein}} {{required}} for {{programmed cell death}} in Drosophila. The Grim N-terminus induces apoptosis by disrupting IAP blockage of caspases; however, N-terminally-deleted Grim retains pro apoptotic activity. We describe GH 3, a 15 amino acid internal Grim domain absolutely required for its proapoptotic activity and sufficient to induce cell death when <b>fused</b> to heterologous <b>carrier</b> proteins. A GH 3 homology region {{is present in the}} Drosophila proapoptotic proteins Reaper and Sickle. The GH 3 domain and the homologous regions in Reaper and Sickle are predicted to be structured as amphipathic α-helixes. During apoptosis induction, Grim colocalizes with mitochondria and cytochrome c in a GH 3 -dependent but N-terminal- and caspase activity-independent manner. When Grim is overexpressed in vivo, both the N-terminal and the GH 3 domains are equally necessary, and cooperate for apoptosis induction. The N-terminal and GH 3 Grim domains thus activate independent apoptotic pathways that synergize to induce programmed cell death efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Signal {{transducer}} and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins are latent transcription {{factors that}} {{reside in the}} cytoplasm before activation. On cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, these molecules dimerize and accumulate transiently in the nucleus. No specific signals mediating these processes have been identified to date. In this report, we examine the nuclear export of Stat 1. We find that treatment of cells with the export inhibitor leptomycin B does not affect steady-state localization of Stat 1 but impedes nuclear export after IFNγ-induced nuclear accumulation. We identify a conserved leucine-rich helical segment in the coiled-coil domain of Stat 1, {{which is responsible for}} the efficient nuclear export of this protein. Mutation of two hallmark leucines within this segment greatly attenuate the back transport of Stat 1 in the cytoplasm. When <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein, the Stat 1 export sequence can mediate nuclear export after intranuclear microinjection. We show that prolonging the nuclear presence of Stat 1 by inhibiting nuclear export reduces the transcriptional response to stimulation with IFNγ.

40|$|Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, alphaviruses {{replicate}} their genomes {{in association}} with modified intracellular membranes. Alphavirus replication sites consist of numerous bulb-shaped membrane invagina-tions (spherules), which contain the double-stranded replication intermediates. Time course studies with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) -infected cells were combined with live-cell imaging and electron microscopy to reveal that the replication complex spherules of SFV undergo an unprecedented large-scale movement between cellular compartments. The spherules first accumulated at the plasma membrane and were then internalized using an endocytic process that required a functional actin-myosin network, as shown by blebbistatin treat-ment. Wortmannin and other inhibitors indicated that the internalization of spherules also required the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. The spherules therefore represent an unusual type of endocytic cargo. After endocytosis, spherule-containing vesicles were highly dynamic and had a neutral pH. These primary <b>carriers</b> <b>fused</b> with acidic endosomes and moved long distances on microtubules, in a manner prevented by nocodazole.

40|$|The hdm 2 gene is overexpressed in {{a variety}} of human tumors. Its gene product localizes {{predominantly}} to the nucleus, where it acts as an inhibitor of the p 53 tumor suppressor gene product. It is shown here that the hdm 2 oncoprotein constantly shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Shuttling of hdm 2 does not depend on its interaction with p 53. Nuclear export of hdm 2 is mediated by a signal sequence similar to the nuclear export signal of the rev protein from human immunodeficiency virus and other lentiviruses. Mutation of this signal sequence abolishes detectable nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. When <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein, the hdm 2 signal sequence can mediate nuclear export after intranuclear microinjection into HeLa cells. The export of hdm 2 can be blocked by a competitive inhibitor of rev export, arguing that the export pathways for hdm 2 and rev are either overlapping or identical. Inhibition of its export modifies the ability of hdm 2 to block p 53 -mediated transcriptional activation, and hdm 2 's export function is required to accelerate the degradation of p 53. Thus the rev nuclear export pathway may be used to regulate an oncogene product's activity and modulate cellular growth...|$|R

Antisera with 1600 -fold titer at the maximum were obtained for both antigens and confirmed for their specificity by Western blotting. Anti-ERGIC- 53 antisera recognized acinar cells in the sublingual gland, and anti-c-Kit antisera recognized spermatogenic and Leydig cells in the testis.

Particular Armadillo proteins such as β-catenin and plakophilins show a partly nuclear location, suggesting gene-regulatory activities.

Previously, we reported that the human p 120 ctn gene might encode up to 32 protein isoforms as products of alternative splicing. Overexpression of p 120 ctn isoforms B in various cell lines resulted in cytoplasmic immunopositivity but never in nuclear staining. In contrast, upon expression of p 120 ctn cDNAs lacking exon B, the isoforms were detectable within both nuclei and cytoplasm. A putative nuclear export signal (NES) with a characteristic leucine-rich motif is encoded by exon B. This sequence element was shown to be required for nuclear export and to function autonomously when <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein and microinjected into cell nuclei. Moreover, the NES function of endogenously or exogenously expressed p 120 ctn isoforms B was sensitive to the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B.

The four domains are ordered in the sequence abb'xa'c; with a 19 amino acid x linker between the b' and a' domains, and an acidic tail, c, after the a' domain. PDI acts as an oxidoreductase and chaperone to help fold newly synthesized proteins into their native state through the formation of disulphide bonds via the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups of cysteines, {{as well as the}} rearrangement of mispaired disulphides in an isomerisation reaction.

P 11 was <b>fused</b> with a <b>carrier</b> protein, MalE, to facilitate its manipulation. The affinities between mAb 164 and the MalE-P 11 hybrids were measured by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The changes of the P 11 residues into progressively shorter residues, the comparison of changes into Pro and Ala, {{and the study of}} double mutants showed the following. Four hydrophobic residues of P 11, Val 276, Ile 278, Tyr 279, and Phe 280, were predominant in the interaction. For some residues, e. g., Tyr 279, most groups of the side chain contributed to the interaction. For others, only some groups played a significant role, e. g., the Cä group of Ile 278 or the Câ group of Phe 280. The lack of side chain in position Gly 281 and a tertiary interaction between the side chains of Ile 278 and Lys 283 were important. P 11 was recognized in a loop conformation, close to that of residues 273 - 283 of TrpB in the crystal structure of the complete tryptophan synthase, TrpA 2 TrpB 2.

In this initial study, ex-periments were isochronal, sothat different degrees of etching occurred at each temperature studied. In the present study, the heat-treatments were conducted in a high purity argon atmosphere for periods of t ime so chosen that at each tempera-ture an approximately equal weight loss of silicon, due to the etching process, could be expected. The effects of heat-treat-ment on the resulting surface morphology of etch structures of (100), (110), or (111) silicon wafers were compared. It was found under these equal weight loss conditions that the etching at T-< 1000 ~ is anisotropic (polyhedron etch pits are ob-served) while at higher temperatures a close to isotropic behavior is observed. It is bel ieved that the crystallographic etch structure generation in the anisotropic etching regime begins at crystal attice defect sites or at impurity inhomogeneit ies.

Here we show {{for the first time that}} metallothionein can be efficiently expressed in bacteria without being <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein to enhance mercury bioremediation. Cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry analyzes revealed that the mt- 1 transgenic bacteria accumulated up to 100. 2 ± 17. 6 μM of mercury from media containing 120 μM Hg. The extent of mercury remediation was such that the contaminated media remediated by the mt- 1 transgenic bacteria supported the growth of untransformed bacteria. Cell aggregation, precipitation and color changes were visually observed in mt- 1 and ppk transgenic bacteria when these cells were grown in high mercury concentrations. Conclusion The transgenic bacterial system described in this study presents a viable technology for mercury bioremediation from liquid matrices because it provides high mercury resistance and accumulation while inhibiting elemental mercury volatilization. This is the first report that shows that metallothionein expression provides mercury resistance and accumulation in recombinant bacteria. The high accumulation of mercury in the transgenic cells could present the possibility of retrieving the accumulated mercury for further industrial applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDiagnosis of {{infectious}} diseases often requires demonstration of antibodies to the microbe (serology). A large set of antigens, covering viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites may be needed. Recombinant proteins have a prime role in serological tests. Suspension arrays offer high throughput for simultaneous measurement of many different antibodies. We here describe a rational process for preparation, purification and coupling to beads of recombinant proteins prepared in Escherichia coli derivate Origami B, {{to be used in}} a serological Luminex suspension array. All six Gag and Env proteins (p 10, p 12, p 15, p 30, gp 70 and p 15 E), from the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), were prepared, allowing the creation of a multiepitope XMRV antibody assay. The procedure is generic and allows production of protein antigens ready for serological testing in a few working days. Instability and aggregation problems were circumvented by expression of viral proteins <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein (thioredoxin A; TrxA), purification via inclusion body formation, urea solubilization, His tag affinity chromatography and direct covalent coupling to microspheres without removal of the elution buffer. The yield of one preparation (2 – 10 mg fusion protein per 100 ml culture) was enough for 20 – 100 coupling reactions, sufficing for tests of many tens of thousands of sera. False serological positivity due to antibodies binding to TrxA and to traces of E. coli proteins remaining in the preparation could be reduced by preabsorption of sera with free TrxA and E. coli extract. The recombinant antigens were evaluated using anti-XMRV antibodies. Although hybrid proteins expressed in E. coli in this way will not have the entire tertiary structure and posttranslational modifications of the native proteins, they contain a large subset of the epitopes associated with them. The described strategy is simple, quick, efficient and cheap. It should be applicable for suspension array serology in general...|$|R

We show that the intracellular complex containing E 1 B- 55 kD and E 4 - 34 kD continuously shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and may thus serve as a nucleocytoplasmic transporter for viral mRNA. We present evidence that within this complex, it is the E 4 - 34 kD protein that directs both nuclear import and nuclear export. E 4 - 34 kD contains a functional nuclear export signal similar to corresponding sequences found in the retroviral proteins rev and rex. This sequence element is required for nuclear export of the complex, and it can function autonomously when <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein and microinjected in HeLa cell nuclei. When E 4 - 34 kD is expressed alone, {{a portion of the}} protein that contains a predicted arginine-rich amphipathic alpha-helical structure mediates nuclear retention of the protein. This retention, however, can be abolished by the association with E 1 B- 55 kD or by a specific point mutation within the arginine-rich motif. The export of E 4 - 34 kD can be blocked by an HTLV-rex derived competitive inhibitor and overexpressed E 4 - 34 kD inhibits rev-mediated transport, suggesting that the export pathways accessed by the adenoviral and retroviral proteins share components.

Expression of functional recombinant fusion proteins comprising of snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) fused to toxins from Indian red scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus toxin; ButaIT) and Blue Mountains funnel-web spider (Hadronyche versuta toxins; ω-ACTX-Hv 1 a (ω-ACTX); κ-ACTX-Hv 1 c (κ-ACTX)) was carried out in both yeast (Pichia pastoris) and plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) expression systems. Addition of purification tags, altering the design of assembly of the fusion protein and point mutation of toxin sequence were all investigated to improve yield and reduce proteolytic cleavage during expression and purification. Recombinant proteins were assayed for oral toxicity against T. castaneum as a model coleopteran species. Fusion proteins incorporating ButaIT and ω-ACTX toxins showed toxicity ranging from complete mortality when fed at 1 mg g- 1 ((his) 6 -GNA-ω-ACTX and ω-ACTX-GNA-(his) 6) to 65 % mortality when fed at 2 mg g- 1 (ButaIT-GNA-(his) 6). Fusion proteins incorporating κ-ACTX and GNA were shown to be non-toxic despite individual components being functional. Lack of toxicity was due to high proteolytic cleavage in the insect gut environment. Data was obtained to support the use of Tribolium as a model for wireworm (Agriotes spp.), serious pests of potatoes in the UK. Selected fusion proteins were expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis. Expression for ButaIT-GNA as a fusion polypeptide was readily detectable in transformants with estimated levels of expression of approx. 0. 15 % total soluble protein in leaf tissue. When plants expressing ButaIT-GNA fusion protein were fed to larvae of the tomato moth (Lacanobia oleracea) the fusion protein was shown to be fully functional with levels of toxicity comparable to that seen in previous artificial diet bioassays. ω-ACTX based constructs expressed in Arabidopsis were subject to high levels of proteolytic cleavage in planta and so were not assayed for toxicity.

40|$|Before {{stimulation}} signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) {{reside in}} the cytoplasm. STATs are phosphorylated by Janus kinases in response to cytokine stimulation and there upon rapidly translocate into the nucleus. In this thesis the IFN&# 947;-dependent nuclear import and export of STAT 1 was examined. It was found that treatment of 293 T cells with the export inhibitor leptomycin B does not induce nuclear build-up of STAT 1 in resting cells, but prolongs the nuclear accumulation phase in IFN&# 947;-stimulated cells. In {{the course of this}} work a conserved leucine-rich helical segment in the coiled-coil domain of STAT 1 was identified, which is responsible for the efficient nuclear export of this protein. Mutation of two leucines within this segment greatly attenuates the back transport of STAT 1 into the cytoplasm. When <b>fused</b> to a <b>carrier</b> protein, the STAT 1 export sequence can mediate nuclear export after intranuclear microinjection. This result indicates that STAT 1 returns to the cytoplasm via a CRM 1 -dependent pathway. The identification of a conserved NES motif in the coiled-coil domain of STAT 1 reveals {{for the first time the}} existence of an active nuclear export for a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. Notably, a reduced rate of back transport of STAT 1 into the cytoplasm results in a aborted transcriptional response to stimulation with IFN&# 947;. These data suggest that STAT proteins are actively exported from the nucleus via several separate pathways and link their activity to transcriptional activation. In addition, a nuclear targeting sequence in the DNA-binding domain of STAT 1 was identified. This conserved signal is critical for the IFN&# 947;-induced nuclear import of phosphorylated STAT 1 dimers. Mutations of two leucines within this NLS-sequence inhibits nuclear entry of tyrosinephosphorylated STAT 1, which in turn prevents induction of IFN&# 947;-inducible target genes. Interestingly, the nuclear import of unphosphorylated STAT 1 continues and the STAT 1 -dependent constitutive expression of caspases and the TNF&# 945;-mediated induction of apoptosis proceed unaltered. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated and unphosporylated STAT 1 proteins shuttle via independent pathways to distinct sets of target genes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that STAT 1 proteins C-terminal fused with a CAAX-motif functioning as a membrane anchor are fully competent to induce TNF&# 945;-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, membrane-bound STAT 1 lost the ability to activate IFN&# 947;-dependent target genes. These results indicate that STAT 1 dimers require nuclear localisation for the activation of IFN&# 947;-dependent target genes and that nuclear accumulation is not necessary for the induction of the STAT 1 -dependent activation of caspase genes and TNF&# 945;- mediated apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Parent, Michelle A. Yersinia pestis is a Gram-negative, {{facultative anaerobe}} {{that is the}} {{etiological}} agent of pneumonic plague. Y. pestis is categorized a category A select agent by the CDC, and despite {{over a hundred years}} of research an effective, safe vaccine protecting against the pneumonic form of infection has yet to be developed. Previous live vaccines using attenuated Y. pestis have been deemed unsafe for general use as it is highly reactogenic in healthy adults, and formalin killed whole-cell vaccines fail to protect against the pneumonic form of infection. Here, we investigate a novel plague vaccine using F 1 and LcrV antigens <b>fused</b> to the <b>carrier</b> protein lichenase (LicKM), a thermostable enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum in a BALB/c mouse challenge model using the attenuated Y. pestis KIM D 27 strain. Using this model, we determined the vaccine-generated parameters of protective efficacy against an intranasal challenge of Y. pestis KIM D 27. Serum from vaccinated mice, adoptively transferred into na??ve mice, conferred protection against lethal challenge. Removal of effector antibodies through Protein G column treatment eliminated this protection. Additionally, IL- 2 was produced from vaccine-generated memory CD 4 + T cells upon restimulation in vitro with vaccine proteins. Finally, adoptive transfer of F 1 and LcrV specific T cells from vaccinated mice to na??ve mice protected against lethal challenge. Taken together, we have demonstrated vaccine-generated humoral and cell-mediated protection against lethal challenge. Also, we developed a novel tool to specifically study the T cell response to Yersinia pestis infection. This immunological tool, a pKKOVA plasmid which encodes full length ovalbumin, was transformed into two attenuated strains of Y. pestis KIM D 27 and KIM 10. Using transgenic mice with T cell receptors specific for peptide residues within ovalbumin (OT-I and OT-II), we were able to evaluate the ability of Y. pestis transformed with plasmid to stimulate T cells. We determined through this model that Y. pestis KIM D 27 pKKOVA was able to stimulate OT-I, MHC I restricted, CD 8 + T cells in vitro through upregulation of memory T cell surface markers CD 44, CD 25, and CD 27. KIM D 27 pKKOVA was also able to stimulate OT-II, MHC II restricted, CD 4 + T cells but to a much lesser extent. KIM 10 pKKOVA was able to stimulate OT-I, CD 8 + T cells which showed upregulation of CD 44 and CD 27, but was unable to stimulate any OT-II, CD 4 + T cells. These results confirm the development of a novel tool allowing us to track T cell populations that change specifically in response to Yersinia pestis infection.

40|$|The {{versatile}} Escherichia coli facilitates protein expression {{with relative}} simplicity, high cell density on inexpensive substrates, well known genetics, variety of expression vectors, mutant strains, co-overexpression technology, extracytoplasmic secretion systems, and recombinant protein fusion partners. Although, the protocol is rather simple for soluble proteins, heterologous protein expression is frequently encountered by major technical limitations including inefficient translation, formation of insoluble inclusion bodies, lack of posttranslational modification mechanisms, degradation by host proteases, and impaired cell physiology due to host/protein toxicity, in achieving functional expression of stable, soluble, and bioactive protein [...] In this thesis, model protein expression systems {{are used to}} address the technical issues for enhancing recombinant protein expression in E. coli. When yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) was displayed on E. coli cell surface, {{the integrity of the}} cell envelope was compromised and cell physiology was severely impaired, resulting in poor display performance, which was restored by the coexpression of Skp, a periplasmic chaperone. On the basis of monitoring the promoter activities of degP, rpoH, and cpxP under various culture conditions, it was demonstrated that the cell-surface display induced the σE extracytoplasmic stress response, and PdegP::lacZ was proposed to be a suitable “sensor” for monitoring extracytoplasmic stress. Intracellular proteolysis has been {{recognized as one of the}} key factors limiting recombinant protein production, particularly for eukaryotic proteins heterologously expressed in the prokaryotic expression systems of E. coli. Two amino acids, Leu 149 and Val 223, were identified as proteolytically sensitive when Pseudozyma antarctica lipase (PalB) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The functional expression was enhanced using the double mutant for cultivation. However, the recombinant protein production was still limited by PalB misfolding, which was resolved by DsbA coexpression. The study offers an alternative genetic strategy in molecular manipulation to enhance recombinant protein production in E. coli. To overcome the technical limitations of protein misfolding, ineffective disulfide bond formation, and protein instability associated with intracellular proteolysis in the functional expression of recombinant Pseudozyma antarctica lipase B (PalB) in Escherichia coli, an alternative approach was explored by extracellular secretion of PalB via two Sec-independent secretion systems, i. e. the α-hemolysin (Type I) and the modified flagellar (Type III) secretion systems, which can export proteins of interest from the cytoplasm directly to the exterior of the cell. Bioactive PalB was expressed and secreted extracellularly either as HlyA fusion (i. e. PalB-HlyA via Type I system) or an intact protein (via Type III system) with minimum impact on cell physiology. However, the secretion intermediates in the intracellular fraction of culture samples were non-bioactive even though they were soluble, suggesting that the extracellular secretion did mediate the development of PalB activity. PalB secretion via Type I system was fast with higher specific PalB activities but poor cell growth. On the other hand, the secretion via Type III system was slow with lower specific PalB activities but effective cell growth. Functional expression of lipase from Burkholderia sp. C 20 (Lip) in various cellular compartments of Escherichia coli was explored. The poor expression in the cytoplasm was improved by several strategies, including coexpression of the cytoplasmic chaperone GroEL/ES, using a mutant E. coli host strain with an oxidative cytoplasm, and protein fusion technology. Fusing Lip with the N-terminal peptide tags of T 7 PK, DsbA, and DsbC was effective in boosting the solubility and biological activity. Non-fused Lip or Lip fusions heterologously expressed in the periplasm formed insoluble aggregates with a minimum activity. Biologically active and intact Lip was obtained upon the secretion into the extracellular medium using the native signal peptide and the expression performance was further improved by coexpression of the periplasmic chaperon Skp. The extracellular expression was even more effective when Lip was secreted as a Lip-HlyA fusion via the α-hemolysin transporter. Finally, Lip could be functionally displayed on the E. coli cell surface when <b>fused</b> with the <b>carrier</b> EstA...|$|R
