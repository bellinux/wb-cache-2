5|$|Hansell left Guam on January 21, 1945. Unknown at the time, his {{precision}} daylight attacks had succeeded, {{first in}} Japan's immediate and inefficient dispersion of its aircraft engine industry, {{and later in}} terms of actual destruction caused by the final raid under <b>his</b> <b>command.</b> A more immediate legacy of <b>his</b> <b>command</b> was his creation, {{in conjunction with the}} U.S. Navy, of an effective air-sea rescue system that saved half of all B-29 crews downed at sea in 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from internment, from 1 May 1918 Sikorski worked for the Regency Council, {{organizing}} the new Polish Army. He was soon at the frontlines again, {{this time in the}} Polish–Ukrainian War, where troops under <b>his</b> <b>command</b> secured and defended Przemyśl in October–November 1918.|$|E

50|$|Although Roosevelt and the Rough Riders {{achieved}} considerable fame {{with the}} victory, other soldiers fared less well.

5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in <b>his</b> <b>command,</b> particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under <b>his</b> <b>command,</b> and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E
5|$|By 31March, the Army of the Danube {{established}} {{itself in}} Neustadt, Freiburg im Breisgau, Freudenstadt and Schiltach. Jourdan set up <b>his</b> <b>command</b> headquarters at Hornberg. The cavalry {{could not find}} enough forage in the mountains, and were sent to Offenburg.|$|E
5|$|He is the {{commanding}} officer of the Niren Corps. Although he has the aura of a commanding officer, he also exudes that of a friendly middle-aged man. Both Yuri and Flynn are under <b>his</b> <b>command.</b> Niren was voiced by Takashi Taniguchi in Japanese and Christopher Sabat in English.|$|E

5000|$|Another notable {{participant}} was Ernst R. Torgler, a 24-year-old sergeant in the 37th Ohio Infantry, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his action during the battle.

5|$|The {{controversy}} over Bennett's actions became public in mid-1945, {{when the war}} ended and Percival and Callaghan were released from Japanese captivity. Percival, who had never got on with Bennett, wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing <b>his</b> <b>command</b> without permission. Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over <b>his</b> <b>command,</b> or in leaving Singapore. Veterans of the 8th Division, who were generally loyal to Bennett, protested against this finding.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{military}} career, Sharma was {{greatly influenced by}} his uncle Captain K. D. Vasudeva's gallantry in action. Vasudeva also served with the 8th Battalion, participating in the Malayan Campaign during which he died aiding hundreds of soldiers under <b>his</b> <b>command</b> to survive from the Japanese offensive.|$|E
5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from <b>his</b> <b>command</b> bunker, so {{even though he was}} able to get two of his guns back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Gary Ord did {{not receive}} {{recognition}} for his actions on San Juan Hill. The Army quietly turned down the requests for a medal for his heroism from <b>his</b> <b>commanding</b> officer and <b>his</b> <b>commanding</b> general. Partly the reason given {{was that he was}} listed {{as a member of the}} 6th Cavalry on roster reports and was also listed as an aide to his General.|$|R

5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of <b>his</b> <b>command</b> {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he worked}} as a {{district}} officer in the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea, where he {{died at the age of}} 40, probably of complications from his war wounds. He was buried on Garua Island, New Britain. Considered by many to be rather eccentric, he was also a successful tactician, a skilful organiser, and highly regarded for his treatment of the soldiers under <b>his</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
5|$|Already on September 28, 1658, a small {{fleet of}} three ships and several smaller boats landed the Norwegian forces close to Trondheim. The Swedish {{governor}} Claes Stiernsköld had 120 cavalry and 600 infantrymen under <b>his</b> <b>command</b> with the Swedish ship Gotland {{in the harbor}} of Trondheim. Two Dano-Norwegian ships attacked Gotland, thought no significant damage was inflicted on either side.|$|E

5|$|Although Umar later {{relieved}} him of high command, he nevertheless {{remained the}} effective {{leader of the}} forces arrayed against the Byzantines {{during the early stages}} of the Byzantine–Arab Wars. Under <b>his</b> <b>command,</b> Damascus was captured in 634 and the key Arab victory against the Byzantine forces was achieved at the Battle of Yarmouk (636), which led to the conquest of the Bilad al-Sham (Levant).|$|E
5|$|Although an {{extremely}} competent administrator, there were reservations within the New Zealand government following Godley's appointment as {{commander of the}} division. Allen, although publicly supportive of Godley, privately believed an alternative commander should be found after the division completed its training. Godley was a distant and remote divisional commander, not popular with most soldiers of <b>his</b> <b>command.</b> He also favoured the professional officers of the NZEF, {{most of whom were}} seconded from the British Army, over those drawn from the Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{entrance}} to the pass had been secured by a regiment, the remainder of the 10th Cavalry Brigade did not reinforce the regiment. The brigade commander, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse had disobeyed divisional orders to do so and when the brigade finally advanced, twice got lost. In consequence, Barrow, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, relieved Howard-Vyse of <b>his</b> <b>command</b> on the spot. Lieutenant Colonel W. G. K. Green of the Jacob's Horse took command of the brigade.|$|E
