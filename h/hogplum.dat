50|$|The Caloosahatchee people derived 80% to 90% {{of their}} animal food from fish. Shellfish, {{including}} crabs were also important. Minor components of their diet included white-tailed deer, other mammals, waterfowl such as ducks, American Alligators, turtles, West Indian Manatees and sea urchins. Plants collected as food included various wild roots, mastic fruit, {{prickly pear cactus}} fruit, palm fruits, sea grapes, <b>hogplum,</b> and cocoplum.|$|E
5000|$|Colubrina is a genus {{of about}} 30 species of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} buckthorn family, Rhamnaceae, native to warm temperate to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, southern Asia, northern Australia, and the Indian Ocean islands. Common names include nakedwood, snakewood, greenheart and <b>hogplum.</b> The generic name {{is derived from the}} Latin word coluber, meaning [...] "snake", and refers to the snake-like stems or stamens.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{houses a}} {{tropical}} dry forest ecosystem, within the reserve the flora consists of over 500 species of plants and tropical dry trees, such as pochote, black rosewood, mahogany, <b>hogplum</b> and guacuco, {{as well as a}} large variety and amount of orchids. The fauna consists of mammals such as variegated squirrels, opossums, anteaters, pacas, jaguarundis, howler and white-faced capuchin monkeys. As well as a variety of reptiles such as green iguanas and common boas. Over 230 species of birds have been documented in the reserve, oropendolas, falcons, hummingbirds, and 65 species of migratory birds are present. Two-hundred twenty species of butterflies have been documented in the reserve, including 25 first records for Nicaragua and dozens of mollusks. Lake Apoyo also contains a variety of fish species, including six endemic species of cichlids in the genus Amphilophus. One of these species is the arrow cichlid (Amphilophus zaliosus), described in 1976. Three additional species were described in 2008, by the multinational research team directed by the Nicaraguan NGO, FUNDECI/GAIA, which manages a research station on the shore of the lake. Two additional species were discovered in 2010. The remaining two cichlids were only described in 2010. In addition to the endemics, three cichlids (Parachromis managuense, Oreochromis aureus, and O. niloticus) are found in the lake, but these were introduced by man.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study evaluated the intake of 8 major browse species by Spanish goats (Capra hircus). Diet preference and a selection order was established for the 8 browse species by calculating instantaneous intake rates (IIR, mg/sec) following 2 types of feeding trials. A 30 -sec single species feeding trial allowed for the observation of IIR by goats on only one species. The multiple species trial allowed for goats to select their browse preference during a 5 -min time period. According to IIR, goat diet preference for both trials was: lime pricklyash > brasil > <b>hogplum</b> > spiny hackberry > catclaw acacia > Texas persimmon > huisache > kidneywood. Physical and chemical attributes of the browse species were measured and either elicited or deterred a grazing response. For both trials (single and multiple) significant correlations (P < 0. 05) between physical traits and IIR included leaf weight (0. 65, 0. 61) and canopy volume (0. 44, 0. 51). Additionally, three wavelengths were identified by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as contributors or deterrents to intake. These included: 1612 nm, 2148 nm and 2452 nm. Wavelength 1612 nm is associated with olefins, a form of alkenes, and wavelengths 2148 nm and 2452 nm are associated with aromatic compounds. One common olefin is ethylene, which is involved in plant growth responses and abscission of leaves. As the ethylene content of each browse species increased, leaf drop occurred and utilization may have decreased...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{on the role of}} fruits on public health. Amount of nutrition value on different fruits of Bangladesh also examined. Fruits are not only good source of vitamins and minerals but also highly nutritive with anti carcinogenic value. The role of sufficient intake of fruits can prevent many life threatening diseases of human beings like diabetics, blood pressure, heart diseases and cancer. Altogether 39 fruits, the highest water portion 96. 6 g was found in black berry and Jamun, and the lowest 4. 3 g were found in coconut. The highest total minerals 1. 7 g was measured in date palm and the lowest 0. 1 g was found in orange, black berry and Jamun. The maximum fiber 6. 6 mg was found in coconut and the lowest 0. 2 g was found in jackfruit and water melon. The highest Calorie 662 Kcal was found in coconut and the lowest 11 Kcal was measured in black berry and Jamun. The highest protein 3. 5 g was found in elephant’s foot apple and the lowest 0. 2 g was found in water melon. The highest fat 62. 3 g was found in coconut and the lowest 0. 1 g was found in jackfruit, ber, elephant’s foot apple, orange, Bullock’s heart/Custard apple, <b>Hogplum,</b> Olive, Aonla, River ebony and Water chestnut. The highest Carbohydrate 33. 8 g was found in date palm and the lowest 1. 4 g was found in black berry and Jamun. The highest 90 mg was found in Lime and the lowest 0. 01 g was found in River ebony. The highest amount of Fe 7. 9 mg was found in water melon and the lowest 0. 2 mg was found in Pummelo. The highest amount of Carotene 8300 µg was found in mango and the lowest 0 µg was found in litchi, ber, elephant’s foot apple, orange, lemon, Bullock’s heart/Custard apple, coconut, banana, Aonla and water chestnut. The highest amount of vitamin B- 1 0. 8 mg was found in elephant’s foot apple and the lowest 0. 01 mg was found in Wax apple, tamarind and Rose apple. The highest amount of vitamin B- 2 0. 19 mg was found in Burmese grape and the lowest B- 2 0. 01 mg was found in orange, coconut and olive. The highest amount of vitamin C 463 mg was found in Aonla and Stargareberry, and the lowest 1 mg was found in coconut and water melon...|$|E
