Variations in calcium chloride concentration from 5. 1 to 7. 1 mM were imposed, and led to {{major changes in the}} aggregate properties. The characterization of the aggregate size was performed using three distinct methods: laser granulometer, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and focus beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). Viscosity and residual native fraction were also determined. Statistical analysis of experimental data underlines the important combined effect of the two variables and paves the way for new ways of controlling the aggregate functionalities. The calcium chloride concentration has an effect on the entire aggregation process, from native beta-lg to large aggregates.

Compression molded samples were tested for tensile and impact toughness, and fractoraphic analysis using SEM {{was used to}} define the mechanisms of toughness and ductility. The rubber particles assumed a spherical geometry whose diameters assumed near normal distribution. The averaged particle diameter was 0. 9 μm, 1. 23 μm and 1. 34 μm for the 10 % NR, 20 % NR and 30 % NR, respectively.

40|$|The band {{structures}} of strained graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are examined by a tight binding Hamiltonian that {{is directly related}} to the type and strength of strains. Compared to the two-dimensional graphene whose band gap remains close to zero even if a large strain is applied, the band gap of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is sensitive to both uniaxial and shears strains. The effect of strain on the electronic structure of a GNR strongly depends on its edge shape and structural indices. For an armchair GNR, uniaxial weak strain changes the band gap in a linear fashion, and for a large strain, it results in periodic oscillation of the band gap. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>shear</b> strain always tend to reduce the band gap. For a zigzag GNR, the effect of strain is to change the spin polarization at the edges of GNR, thereby modulate the band gap. A simple analytical model is proposed to interpret the band gap responds to strain in armchair GNR, which agrees with the numerical results. Comment: 30 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

On the one hand the oxygen supply of the cells in the core becomes optimal with a higher perfusion flow.

To assess the performance of a recent column fibre finite element some well documented experimental cyclic tests, performed on simple shear walls designed to comply with different ductility requirements, were numerically simulated. The element is based on Timoshenko’s beam theory and accounts for shear-flexure interaction, a feature which might be of some relevance for the problem at <b>hand.</b> <b>Shear</b> resistance is obtained by modelling the principal resisting mechanisms. Shear and flexural behaviour are related to each other by means of suitable kinematics assumptions. This element differs from standard fibre beam elements since the principal direction of the compressive stress (direction of the fibres) is rotated to account for the contribution to shear due to arch action. Results of the experimental-numerical comparison are given in terms of the hysteretic behaviour of the structure.

40|$|Accumulative Roll-Bonding (ARB) {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{recently}} developed techniques capable of producing bulk ultra-fine grained (ufg) metals. There are still many aspects of the behavior of ufg metals that lacks an in-depth understanding, such as a generalized view of the factors that govern the cyclic deformation mechanism(s). This study aims to advance the understanding of the cyclic deformation behavior of ufg metals through the systematic investigation of ARB processed aluminum upon cyclic loading. It was found that the cyclic softening response often reported for ufg metals is largely influenced by the microstructure stability as the cyclic softening response is facilitated by grain coarsening which becomes inhibited with highly stable microstructure. On one <b>hand,</b> <b>shear</b> bands resembling braids of dislocations trespassing multiple grains have been observed to operate for the accommodation of the imposed cyclic strain in cases where grain coarsening is largely restricted. On the other hand, it was found that the microstructure stability can be overcome at higher applied cyclic plastic strain levels, leading to grain coarsening and thus a cyclic softening response. The findings in this study have further confirmed that the cyclic softening behavior found in many ufg metals, which may be detrimental in practical applications, can be inhibited by improvements in the microstructure stability...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Snow {{avalanche}} danger {{can vary}} considerably within the large forecast regions in western Canada. Experienced recreationists routinely use the regional bulletin along with local observations {{to estimate the}} local avalanche danger. However, some less experienced recreationists are unsure how to interpret the various field observations. To assess a systematic approach, we conducted a field study during the winters of 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 in the Columbia Mountains of western Canada. Experienced observers rated the local avalanche danger and made 24 observations of weather, avalanche activity and simple manual snowpack tests on approximately 130 location-days. Since the local danger was often rated separately for the elevation bands alpine, treeline, and below treeline, the observations {{could be applied to}} 272 individual local danger ratings. Fourteen of the potential predictors yielded significant rank correlations with the local avalanche danger. Reflecting their larger scale, many of the weather variables correlated better with the regional danger rating than with the local rating. In contrast, some snowpack observations including the <b>hand</b> <b>shear</b> and ski pole test correlated better at the local scale than the regional scale. Classification trees using the regional rating plus three or four of the local observations exhibited a better agreement with the local danger rating than did the regional rating by itself...|$|E
