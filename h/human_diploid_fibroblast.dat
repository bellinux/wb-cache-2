The extent of infection was similar in cell cultures passaged at split ratios of 1 : 2 or 1 : 10 and grown at 33 or 37 degrees C.

This suggests that the previously reported failure of camptothecin to inhibit interferon production in <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> cells after induction with poly(rI). poly(rC) is the result of two mutually opposing effects: a marked in-hibition of interferon messenger RNA synthesis, but a stimulation of the activity of the interferon messenger RNA that is formed...|$|R

This technique allows rapid and accurate quantitation of the growth fraction and G 1 /S transition rate of these cells. The cell cycle kinetics of <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> at all population doubling levels reveal two components: cycling cells showing a probabilistic rate of G 1 /S transition, and a variable proportion of noncycling cells. Both the transition probability (rate of exit from G 1) and the noncycling proportion of cells change systematically as a function of serum concentration and as a function of population doubling level. The data suggest the existence of an underlying heterogeneity in the population of <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> with respect to the capacity to divide in {{the presence}} of a given concentration of mitogen.

40|$|When WI- 38 <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> become confluent, {{they stop}} synthesizing DNA and dividing. Addition of serum causes the {{quiescent}} cell to reenter the cell cycle. Prolonged quiescence after confluence decreases and delays {{the response to}} serum.

During this period, although not cycling, WI- 38 cells still express c-myc and other growth-regulated genes, as measured by steady-state RNA levels. If the quiescence is prolonged further, c-myc expression (and that of two other growth-regulated genes) is no longer detectable, and its disappearance coincides with a loss of response to platelet-poor plasma. These results suggest that, also under physiological conditions, the expression of c-myc and other growth-regulated genes can cooperate with platelet-poor plasma in inducing cellular DNA synthesis in <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblasts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Timeless-Tipin {{complex and}} Claspin are {{mediators}} of the ATR-dependent activation of Chk 1 in the intra-S checkpoint response to stalled DNA replication forks. Tim-Tipin and Claspin {{also contribute to}} sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) in various organisms, likely through a replication-coupled process. Some models of the establishment of SCC posit that interactions between cohesin rings and replisomes could result in physiological replication stress requiring fork stabilization. The contributions of Timeless, Tipin, Claspin, Chk 1 and ATR to SCC were investigated in genetically stable, <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cell lines. Whereas Timeless, Tipin and Claspin showed similar contributions to UVC-induced activation of Chk 1, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Timeless induced a 100 -fold increase in sister chromatid discohesion, whereas the inductive effects of knocking down Tipin, Claspin and ATR were 4 – 20 -fold. Knockdown of Chk 1 did not significantly affect SCC. Consistent findings were obtained in two independently derived <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblast</b> lines and support a conclusion that SCC in human cells {{is strongly dependent on}} Timeless but independent of Chk 1. Furthermore, the 10 -fold difference in discohesion observed when depleting Timeless versus Tipin indicates that Timeless has a function in SCC that is independent of the Tim-Tipin complex, even though the abundance of Timeless is reduced when Tipin is targeted for depletion. A better understanding of how Timeless, Tipin and Claspin promote SCC will elucidate non-checkpoint functions of these proteins at DNA replication forks and inform models of the establishment of SCC...|$|E

The nature of the changes were suggestive of a decline in the operation of the L-system of amino acid transport with in vitro age.

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cells cease {{growth in}} culture after {{a finite number}} of {{population}} doublings. To address the cause of growth cessation in senescent IMR- 90 human fibroblast cells, we determined the level of oxidative DNA damage by using 8 -oxoguanine excised from DNA and 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine in DNA as markers. Senescent cells excise from DNA four times more 8 -oxoguanine per day than do early-passage young cells. The steady-state level of 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine in DNA is approximately 35 % higher in senescent cells than in young cells. Measurement of protein carbonyls shows that senescent cells did not appear to have elevated protein oxidation. To reduce the level of oxidative damage, we cultured cells under a more physiological O 2 concentration (3 %) and compared the replicative life span to the cells cultured at the O 2 concentration of air (20 %). We found that cells grown under 3 % O 2 achieved 50 % more population doublings during their lifetime. Such an extension of life span resulted from the delayed onset of senescence and elevation of growth rate and saturation density of cells at all passages. The spin-trapping agent alpha-phenyl-t-butyl nitrone (PBN), which can act as an antioxidant, also effectively delayed senescence and rejuvenated near senescent cells. The effect is dose-dependent and is most pronounced for cells at the stage just before entry into senescence. Our data support the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage contributes to replicative cessation in <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cells...|$|E

Aminoacylarylamidase activity assayed spectrophotometrically showed significantly increased activity in the middle age-group cells as opposed to the enzyme isolated from young and old cells. Heat-inactivation studies using the same substrate suggested the possibility of an increased proportion of heat-labile enzyme in the old cells but interpretation of the data was difficult because of the complex nature of the inactivation curves obtained.

Normal <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> continued to produce lactate in HTU-MEM, but at a greatly reduced rate. Since cells grew in HTU-MEM without glucose utilization, the probable energy and carbon source was glutamine, which is present in relatively high concentration.

40|$|Expression of p 21 Sdi 1 {{downstream}} of p 53 {{is essential}} for induction of cellular senescence, although cancer cell senescence can also occur in the p 53 null condition. We report herein that senescence-associated phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (SA-pErk 1 / 2) enhanced p 21 Sdi 1 transcription by phosphorylating Sp 1 on Ser 59 downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) α. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was increased in cellular senescence, significantly activated both PKCα and PKCβI. However, PKCα, but not PKCβI, regulated ROS generation and cell proliferation in senescent cells along with activation of cdk 2, proven by siRNAs. PKCα-siRNA also reduced SA-pErk 1 / 2 expression in old <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblast</b> cells, accompanied with changes of senescence phenotypes to young cell-like. Regulation of SA-pErk 1 / 2 was also confirmed by using catalytically active PKCα and its DN-mutant construct. These findings strongly suggest a new pathway to regulate senescence phenotypes by ROS via Sp 1 phosphorylation between PKCα and SA-pErk 1 / 2 : employing GST-Sp 1 mutants and MEK inhibitor analyses, we found that SA-pErk 1 / 2 regulated Sp 1 phosphorylation on the Ser 59 residue in vivo, but not threonine, in cellular senescence, which regulated transcription of p 21 Sdi 1 expression. In summary, PKCα, which was activated in senescent cells by ROS strongly activated Erk 1 / 2, and the SA-pErk 1 / 2 in turn phosphorylated Sp 1 on Ser 59.

This study determined the molecular mechanism of &# 947;-tocotrienol, a vitamin E homolog, in the prevention of cellular aging in <b>human</b> <b>diploid</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> using the expression of senescence-associated genes. METHODS: Primary cultures of young, pre-senescent, and senescent fibroblast cells were incubated with &# 947;-tocotrienol for 24 h. The expression levels of ELN, COL 1 A 1, MMP 1, CCND 1, RB 1, and IL 6 genes were determined using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell cycle profiles were determined using a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer. RESULTS: The cell cycle was arrested in the G 0 /G 1 phase, and the percentage of cells in S phase decreased with senescence. CCND 1, RB 1, MMP 1, and IL 6 were upregulated in senescent fibroblasts. A similar upregulation was not observed in young cells. Incubation with &# 947;-tocotrienol decreased CCND 1 and RB 1 expression in senescent fibroblasts, decreased cell populations in the G 0 /G 1 phase and increased cell populations in the G 2 /M phase. &# 947;-Tocotrienol treatment also upregulated ELN and COL 1 A 1 and downregulated MMP 1 and IL 6 expression in young and senescent fibroblasts.
