30|$|Parental {{educational}} level: Influenced by Blau and Duncan, studies frequently use paternal <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> {{to measure}} household cultural capital. This study measures it differently: by considering {{both mother and}} father, we use the highest parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> (i.e., parental <b>educational</b> <b>level)</b> rather than depending solely on paternal <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> to measure this concept. Family educational background influences the next generation through parental guidance regarding educational expectations, family's educational environment, and parental guidance on homework (Li [2006]). Passing down advantages via these three methods does not depend only on the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> of the father. This is why this study uses the comparatively higher <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> from both parents to measure educational background. Parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is divided into four categories: 1 [*]=[*]primary school education and lower, 2 [*]=[*]junior high school, 3 [*]=[*]senior high school/technical high school,h and 4 [*]=[*]junior college/college (undergraduate) and beyond.|$|R

Between 1985 and 1996 / 97, we conducted an 11 -years community cohort study with 2819 subjects, aged 15 – 70 years at baseline, in Western Norway. We examined the cumulative incidence of asthma and respiratory symptoms by <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> (primary, secondary, and university), as well as estimating the odds ratios (ORs) of <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> on the incidences, after adjustment for sex, age, hay fever, smoking habits, pack years, and occupational exposure. For all respiratory symptoms, the incidences decreased with increasing <b>educational</b> <b>level.</b> The cumulative incidence of asthma was 5. 3 %, 4. 1 %, and 1. 8 %, respectively, for those with a primary <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> secondary <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> and university level. Subjects with a primary <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> had adjusted ORs (95 % CI) from 1. 4 (0. 9, 2. 3) for the incidence of chronic cough to 2. 5 (1. 6, 4. 0) for the incidence of dyspnea grade 2, compared to those with a university level education. The adjusted OR (95 % CI) for the incidence of asthma was 2. 1 (1. 01, 4. 4) in subjects with a primary <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> and 2. 0 (1. 04, 3. 6) in subjects with a secondary <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> compared to subjects with a university <b>educational</b> <b>level.</b> In conclusion, subjects with a lower <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> had a higher risk of developing asthma and respiratory symptoms, after adjustment for sex, age, hay fever, smoking, and occupational exposure...|$|R

25|$|The {{study shows}} a {{relation}} between parental very low <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> and the students' options in higher education, where 39% of basic education teacher students, and 20% of management students, have parents with 4 {{years of study}} or less, the 4th grade (4ª classe). On the other side, law, natural sciences and related fields (particularly medicine), and fine arts, are preferred courses of students from families with higher educational and cultural backgrounds.|$|E
30|$|Second, {{the higher}} the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> of the parents, the more likely the {{children}} will have higher education opportunities. Yet {{the influence of the}} former on the latter varies significantly between genders. Taking the time after the restoration of the College Entrance Exam as a whole, among those whose parents are on the lowest <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> (‘primary school or lower’), men significantly have more advantage in receiving higher education in comparison with women. This inequality gradually disappears with the elevation of parental <b>educational</b> <b>level.</b> Men's advantage in the distribution of higher education opportunities barely exists as long as the parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> reaches junior high school or higher; this situation remains even if the parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is much higher. In the comparative models between the time before The Expansion and after, we found that the group of people whose parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is primary school or lower and those whose parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is junior high school both enjoyed better higher education opportunity before The Expansion. However, after The Expansion, the two groups differ in this respect: gender inequality of higher education opportunity remains unchanged among those whose parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is primary school or lower, whereas this inequality is fundamentally inverted among those whose parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is junior high school as women enjoy significantly better higher education opportunity than men. Further observation reveals that if the parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is senior high school or higher, men do not have an advantage in receiving higher education opportunity prior to or after The Expansion. In sum, before The Expansion, the gender inequality of higher education opportunity significantly existed when the parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> was relatively low (‘primary school or lower’ and ‘junior high school’); after The Expansion, this inequality significantly exists only when the parental educational degree is the lowest level (‘primary school or lower’).|$|R
30|$|The second {{interaction}} term is parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> {{and gender}} (i.e., parental educational level[*]×[*]gender). This interaction term analyzes how parental <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> influences gender distribution of educational opportunities differently {{between men and}} women. The Cultural Reproduction Mode has noted that the higher the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> of parents, the greater the opportunity for children to receive higher education, and if the converse, the opportunity is lower. Introducing gender into the question can investigate whether parents' <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> has a different impact on {{men and women in}} accessing higher education. Typically, the higher the parents' education level, the more likely they will accept the ideology of gender equality and the gender gap in educational investment will be smaller; the lower the parents' <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> the more likely they will accept the patriarchal concept, which will reduce women's opportunity in higher education. Thus, Hypothesis 2 : The gender gap in higher education opportunity negatively correlates with parents' educational level; in particular, people with parents who have a higher <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> have a smaller gender gap than those with parents who have a lower <b>educational</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R

However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with malnutrition and poor health care to cause medical problems.|$|E
25|$|While greater {{education}} increases women's overall earnings, education {{does not}} close the gender pay gap. Women {{earn less than}} men at all <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> and the gender pay gap widens for persons with advanced degrees compared to people with high school education. In 2006, female high school graduates earned 69 percent of what their male counterparts earned ($29,410 for women, $42,466 for men), but women's earnings dropped to 66 percent of men's for those with advanced bachelor's degrees or more ($59,052 for women, $88,843 for men).|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 revealed that poverty of Nicaraguan families heightened {{the risk of}} infant mortality.

Logistic regression models are used to estimate current differences in health (care utilization) by age, sex, and <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> using data from the Netherlands Health Interview Survey. The current differences in health (care utilization) are applied to national projections of the composition of the population by age, sex, and <b>educational</b> <b>level.</b> Also, scenarios have been made in which the health differences by <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> are assumed to converge and diverge. The rise in the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> counteracts the expected increases in ill-health based on population aging to a substantial degree (10 - 100 %).

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{question}} whether post-divorce family trajectories affect children’s educational attainment. Education and family instability are associated in a complex way. First of all, parents’ <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is negatively linked to both children’s educational attainment and family instability. In addition, family instability is associated with a lower <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> of children. In this manner, divorce may function as a force of social inequality in society. Secondly, parents’ <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> may also moderate the effects of divorce on children with children of lower educated parents being more susceptible to negative educational outcomes after divorce. This complex relationship is investigated using the Divorce in Flanders survey. First, a typology of family trajectories for children with divorced parents is developed. Next, it is tested whether a relation exists between parents’ <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and these different types of family trajectories. Finally, we investigate the effects of parents’ <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and family trajectories on children’s educational attainment.

25|$|The {{education}} {{of women in}} India {{plays a significant role}} in improving livings standards in the country. A higher women literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside the home, by encouraging and promoting {{education of}} children, especially female children, and in reducing the infant mortality rate. Several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality, poorer nutrition, lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household. Women's lower <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> is also shown to adversely affect the health and living conditions of children. A survey that was conducted in India showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and educational level.

25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} {{are those that}} argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic success can be at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences. Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in <b>educational</b> <b>levels</b> {{of men and women}} is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics. STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to measure {{horizontal}} equity in the use of healthcare services in Spain, proposing two methodological innovations. First by defending it as equality of access for equal need, irrespective of <b>educational</b> <b>level,</b> unlike the prevailing methodological approach to horizontal equity which relates it to income. Second, by estimating it by means of the slope index of the inequality of characteristics, analagous to the inequity index proposed by Kakwani, Wagstaff and van Doorslaer (1997; HIWV) but presenting some methodological advantages, the greater robustness of the data available on <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> than of those on income, and the possibility of isolating the net effect of the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> on the use of healthcare by controlling for other variables. The methodology is designed in three parts: (1) estimation of the relationship between the <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and the use of healthcare services by means of a model of the likelihood of demand for healthcare services, commonly used in the literature; (2) estimation of the relationship between <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and health by approximating a production function of individuals' health according to their personal characteristics and other factors conditioning health; and (3) estimation of the slope index of inequality as a measure of horizontal inequity, using <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> instead of income as the criterion for ranking individuals. The data base used was a sample of 55, 598 observations from the Survey of disabilities, handicaps and state of health of 1999, carried out in Spain. No significant statistical association was found between <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and use of healthcare services. On the other hand, the relationship between <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> and health, with the three proxy variables used (perception of health, days of limitation and number of chronic illnesses) shows a positive correlation, i. e. an increase in <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is associated with a greater probability of enjoying better health. Horizontal inequity, measured by the proposed slope index of inequality, gives a range of statistically significant values between 13. 91 % and 9. 40 %, depending on cases, i. e. the significant inverse relationship between state of health and <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> is not reflected proportionally in healthcare use, implying that, with greater need, the access of individuals with a lower <b>educational</b> <b>level</b> to public healthcare services is the same as for the rest.
