5|$|The {{expedition}} lacked governmental or <b>institutional</b> <b>support,</b> and {{relied on}} private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, Nimrod, {{was less than}} half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott's 1901–04 expedition ship Discovery, and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound, close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson, carried out extensive geological, zoological and meteorological work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on Manchurian ponies, motor traction, and sled dogs, were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.|$|E

Specific forms of political action, however, vary according to national context.

The World Bank was closely involved in the promotion of private sector participation in urban water supply through two projects. The first project (1998–2006) supported building capacity, rural water supply, water resources management, and the preparation of a new urban water supply strategy through a US$36m credit. This strategy, implemented during the second water project (2004–2009), supported large-scale civil works for urban water supply systems in five cities – Maputo (the capital), Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba through a US$75m credit.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Technologies {{to control}} the {{severity}} of soil erosion and water pollution are available, and a large <b>institutional</b> structure <b>supports</b> soil conservation work, but success has been rather limited. This study of a sample of farmers in the three watersheds in central Towa tests a number of hypotheses {{about the use of}} conservation technology. Tnstitutional support factors were found to have a stronger relationship to the use of conservation practices than farm operation characteristics. The erosion potential of the land was conditional for specific conservation practice utilization. The use of institutional resources was positively related to farm size and scale. Thus <b>institutional</b> <b>supports</b> seem to be going to larger farms where the need for conservation practices seems to be greatest, but may not be adequate to encourage the full extent of conservation practices required on the totality of farms...|$|R
