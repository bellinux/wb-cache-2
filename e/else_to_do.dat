5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series. Duchovny fulfilled his contractual obligations after the seventh season and felt that there was not much <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the character following the previous seven years.|$|E
5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42England's highest opening {{partnership}} of the seriesbefore the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips {{and was out}} for 13. Soon after, Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the cordon and England were 2/52. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may have hit a bump ball into the ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as the pacemen made steady progress on a seaming pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 20 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the Crusaders {{intended}} {{to relieve the}} beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre, but Louis had been diverted to Tunis. The French King and his brother Charles of Anjou, who had made himself King of Sicily, decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa. The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25August, took the life of King Louis himself. By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but return to Sicily. The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm {{off the coast of}} Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor Philip III from any further campaigning. Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9May 1271he finally landed at Acre.|$|E

25|$|Córdoba was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Naples in 1504. Jealous of him, Ferdinand II of Aragon {{accused him of}} profligately spending the public treasury to reward his captains and soldiers; the 1504 death of Queen Isabel I of Castile deprived him of a protector, and he was recalled in 1507. Although Ferdinand praised Córdoba, he gave him nothing <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> until his death. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba died on 2 December 1515 at his villa near Granada from malaria at age 62.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Noten {{used the}} large taxi driver {{community}} of the UK industrial city of Middlesbrough to promote the exhibition The Modern Jewel - In time and the mind of others at MIMA, the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. He thought of working with taxi drivers after seeing the landmark bridge in the area, the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge, that was celebrating its centenary. The transporter bridge operates {{very much like a}} ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than to talk to their passenger(s).|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz, {{always a}} perfectionist, {{personally}} tipped {{in each of}} the photogravures in every issue, touching up dust spots or scratches when necessary. This time-consuming and exhausting work assured only the highest standards in every copy but sometimes delayed the mailing of the issues since Stieglitz would not allow anyone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they were looking at the original photographs.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs are {{sometimes}} considered too expensive compared to pit latrines, but this criticism {{does not include}} the cost of emptying pits and the potential value of fertilizers that can be recycled via UDDTs should the users wish to do so (noting that most UDDT installations worldwide currently do not reuse excreta in agriculture). Rather than looking only at construction costs, long-term operational costs and benefits should also be considered, especially since the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may be a significant expense. When a period of for example 10 years is considered, UDDTs may well be the more economical alternative, since the emptying of feces vaults is simple and safer, thus less expensive, even if users decide to enter into a contract with someone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this.|$|E

25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.|$|E
500|$|... "There {{was nowhere}} <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it," [...] Moore {{says of his}} {{decision}} to use Disney World as a setting and shoot at the parks. Disney, which {{has a reputation for}} aggressively protecting its intellectual property, has been tolerant of visitors uploading videos of their visits to YouTube and elsewhere since most of those user-created videos project a positive image of the parks. But Moore did not expect to get permission from Disney to shoot there given his negative, surrealistic portrayal of the park.|$|E
500|$|Henry kept {{in touch}} with his younger brother Edgar {{sporadically}} as they grew up, often through letters but once he even visited Edgar in Richmond in the 1820s. There, Edgar introduced his brother to his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster. Edgar's foster-father John Allan also corresponded with Henry. In one letter, dated November 1, 1824, Allan apologized that Edgar was slow in writing a letter to Henry, complaining that his foster-son [...] "had little <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> for he does nothing... The boy possesses not a Spark of affection for us, not a particle of gratitude for all my care and kindness towards him." ...|$|E

500|$|Boito was overjoyed, and Verdi {{reported}} {{that he was still}} working on the opera. The two men met in October or November 1891, after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter. They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello, but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: [...] "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [...] incredible that there was nothing <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but stop the entire project". Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.|$|E
500|$|Losses were {{so great}} because Polk wrote off as total losses many films made under his predecessors; the company posted a $35,366,000 {{loss in the}} fiscal year ending August 31, 1969. [...] "Basically what we're really concentrating on at the moment is to really {{streamline}} this operation. There isn't much <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when you're losing as much money as we are," [...] Aubrey told The New York Times in December 1969. [...] Aubrey said, [...] "we have determined that we're not going to continue to produce on the basis of forty acres and acres and acres of standing sets. Young people who are the major movie audience today, refer to that as the plastic world and that is almost a deterrent in the business today." ...|$|E
500|$|Matheos asked Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{to write}} lyrics and perform vocals on one track, which would become [...] "Stockholm". Matheos and Moore sent him the track {{they wanted him}} to work on, and he sent back a rough mix of his vocals. [...] "We were really happy with it," [...] Moore said. [...] "We didn't do any {{revisions}} or ask for any changes, like we were expecting to... It was a different approach than I would have taken, and that's what was refreshing about it. That's why we wanted to get somebody <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some vocals on the album."

500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have anything <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|Ann and {{her boyfriend}} Mark run into Andy, Ann's ex-boyfriend. Andy flirts with Ann in front of Mark, and openly admits he plans to win her back from him. Mark asks advice from Tom (Aziz Ansari), who {{suggests}} Mark should take the high road (although Tom tells the documentary crew that he never takes the high road, but tells everyone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, so there is more room for him on [...] "the low road"). Mark tries to have a gentlemanly discussion with Andy, who continues to insist he loves Ann, pointing to the many photos he has of her around his shoeshine station. Finally, Ann confronts Andy and tells him to stop discussing her with Mark, {{as well as to}} remove her photos from the wall.|$|E
500|$|Wichita was a {{railroad}} terminal and {{a destination for}} cattle drives from Texas. Like other frontier railroad terminals, when the cowboys accompanying the cattle drives arrived, the town was filled with drunken, armed cowboys celebrating {{the end of their}} long journey. Lawmen were kept busy. When the cattle drives ended and the cowboys left, Earp searched for something <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> A newspaper story in October 1874 reported that he earned some money helping an off-duty police officer find thieves who had stolen a man's wagon. Earp officially joined the Wichita marshal's office on April 21, 1875, after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal (or police chief), making $100 per month. He also dealt faro at the Long Branch Saloon. In late 1875, the Wichita Beacon newspaper published this story: ...|$|E
