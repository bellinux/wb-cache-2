40|$|Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture has {{launched}} an emergency cattle feeding project using a molasses-urea mixture, reports the International Livestock Centre for Africa {ILCA) {{in a recent}} newsletter. This action follows the pattern of an earlier pilot project jointly implemented by ILCA, the Ministry and the National Sugar Corporation. It aims to save about 88, 000 cattle threatened with starvation {{in three of the}} country's worst hit provinces (Wollo, Shoa, and Hararge). The molasses-urea mixture is being distributed at wells, the focal point to which all pastoralists bring their herds every three days for watering. Each family receives 12 kilos of the mixture, just enough to ensure the survival of four breeding cows for three days. Molasses {{has been used as a}} feed since the 1950 s in developed countries and in some parts of Africa such as Zimbabwe and other parts of southern Africa For further information contact: I LCA <b>Documentation</b> services PO <b>Box</b> 5689 Addis Ababa EthiopiaEthiopia's Ministry of Agriculture {{has launched}} an emergency cattle feeding project using a molasses-urea mixture, reports the International Livestock Centre for Africa {ILCA) in a recent newsletter.

40|$|The use of ox-drawn ploughs and scoops for desilting ponds in {{rangeland}} {{areas is}} both feasible and inexpensive, reports ILCA* in Addis Ababa. The method should prove directly beneficial to and applicable by pastoral groups. Since 1967, an estimated US$ 50 {{million has been}} spent on pond/dam construction in East Africa {{and most of them}} are now abandoned due to heavy siltation. In Ethiopia, the siltation rate in the southern rangelands was estimated at 1, 000 / 2, 400 cubic metres per pond, per year. Local pastoral groups were unable to excavate more than 15 to 20 cubic metres by hand per year. According to ILCA, it appears possible to construct small to medium-sized ponds and to maintain or enlarge existing ones using ox-drawn scoops and ploughs. In an experiment, ILCA researchers used five metal scoops with a capacity of 0. 2 cubic metres each. They were made in Ethiopia at a cost of US$ 150 each. Six ploughs of the local 'Matesha' design - a simple ox-drawn aid - were also used. The oxen worked in pairs for five hours a day. Two pairs were used in two shifts every day. They were fed two kgs daily of a mixture of bran and oilseed cake (noug) and grazed for seven hours. The feeding of concentrates was considered necessary because drought had reduced grass cover to a minimum. All oxen were watered every three days, which is a common practice. Seven ponds were excavated in 81 days. The amount of silt taken away totalled 3, 254 cubic metres. The average volume of silt excavated per ox-pair per day was 13 cubic metres in 62 loads. The cost of excavation by scoop totalled US$ 0. 30 / 0. 40 per cubic metre. Excavation costs using heavy earth moving machinery were about US$ 2. 00 to US$ 3. 00 per cubic metre.

40|$|Ask {{us and we}} {{will answer}} Since its {{creation}} CTA has received many requests for information from individuals and organizations on a diverse range of subjects dealing with agriculture and rural development in ACP countries. Here are some examples: Mr. Niyomsaba, a farmer in Burundi, on cassava processing techniques; Mr. Nkeme de Garoua of Cameroon, on wildlife management; Mr. Dumur, an extension official in Mauritius, on coffee plants, lupine and wheat; Mr. Gibson, a grower in Liberia, on consultants specializing in the cultivation of cocao; Mr. van Helden, advisor to the EEC delegation in Port of Spain, Trinidad, on the 'Moko' disease that afflicts banana crops; Mr. Claessens in Senegal, on controlling termites; Mr. Bigaiypunzi in Burundi, on the possibilities of providing strawberry plants; Mr. Brosens in Dakar, Senegal, on the potential uses of rice husks; Mr. Tchango-Tchango, {{a researcher at the}} IRA (Institut de Recherche Agronomique) in Nyombe, Cameroon, on methods of analysing fruit juices; Mr. Togli, EEC civil servant on the Mozambique desk, on the practical applications of research results on protein enrichment of cassava flour; the joint ACP-EEC Working Group on 'Rural development and environment'', on food production statistics in ACP countries; Mr. Belkamel of Bambey in Senegal, on agricultural credit; Mr. Awunyo, agricultural technician in Kumassi, Ghana, on the management of livestock; Mr. Welo Vava, a student at the University of Liege, Belgium, on the use of water in tropical Africa; Mr Diakite of the Cote d'lvoire Embassy in Brussels, on sources of seed potatoes; and Mr. Mpungi Buyugu of the OIAC, on the identification of extension experts with knowledge of coffee plants and there have been many others. To handle these requests, CTA's Question and Answer Service has established a network of organizations and people specializing in tropical agriculture. It consists of some basic agricultural information banks and a number of experts based either at research centres or at development agencies or working as consultants within firms or independently. The main information sources used are AGRIS at FAO; the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau (CAB International); AGRALIN in Holland; FAIREC (tropical fruits for agro-industry) of IRFA in France; AGRICOLA (National Agriculture Library) in Washington and TROPAG of the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam. The experts are drawn from the ranks of government agencies in ACP and EEC countries, officials responsible for agricultural research and development, as well as regional and international institutes such as CILSS, IRETA, CARDI, IITA, ILCA, IRRI, etc. The services offered by CTA fall into several categories: directing questions to specialists or other information sources; technical assistance for providing practical advice; supplying reference material and publications; and the supply of basic documentation, whether in the form of copies of articles, original texts, microfiches, or statistical data etc. When outside sources are needed to supply documentation CTA uses the following centres: the British Lending Library in the UK, The National Scientific Research Centre in France, PUDOC in The Netherlands, the Documentation Information Services of CIRAD in France, the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau in London, the FAO library in Rome, and the Documentation centre of the BDPA in Paris CTA thus acts as a relay between those who need and those who have such information. The cost of providing it, however, can be very high, upto several hundred dollars depending on the request. Nevertheless, CTA has decided to provide this service free-of-charge during its initial phase. When preparing a question, {{it is very important that}} it be as precise as possible. The response to a question that is too general is rarely satisfactory. To generate a good response questions should include the nature of the research or the practical use for which the information will be used, the geographical region concerned and the languages that can be understood.
