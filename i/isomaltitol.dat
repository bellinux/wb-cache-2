The Sephadex-induced lung inflammation model was considered a suitable model due to the significant changes in global inflammatory endpoints, like oedema and leukocyte migration, usually seen upon provocation with Sephadex. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were instilled intratracheally with Sephadex (5 mg/ml), vehicle (0. 9 % NaCl), <b>isomaltitol</b> (50 mg/ml) {{or a combination of}} <b>isomaltitol</b> and Sephadex. After 24 h, the lungs were weighed to measure oedema and preserved for histology. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was used for analysis of tumour necrosis factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes, and differential and total leukocyte counts. In addition, blood differential counts and thymus weights were analysed. Contrary to what we expected from in vitro experiments, differential counts showed that <b>isomaltitol</b> increased the neutrophil component while decreasing the eosinophilia. <b>Isomaltitol</b> thus asserted a modulatory role on the usually eosinophil-dominated Sephadex-induced cell profile. <b>Isomaltitol</b> alone also increased several inflammatory parameters, including oedema and cysteinyl leukotrienes, and generally aggravated total inflammation in combination with Sephadex. Although the mechanisms were not investigated in this study, the effects could relate to a combination of isomaltitol's osmotic and structure-specific properties. Our results indicate that <b>isomaltitol</b> can modulate the inflammatory response induced by Sephadex instillation in addition to have pro-inflammatory effects on it its own, and may therefore provide new insights into the mechanisms of this widely used animal model. Sugar alcohols similar to <b>isomaltitol</b> have already been used to aid mucus clearance in cystic fibrosis patients, and it is possible that <b>isomaltitol</b> could also be used for this purpose.

40|$|Disaccharide alditols (DAs) such as maltitol, <b>isomaltitol,</b> and {{lactitol}} {{are increasingly}} being employed in food industry {{by virtue of their}} low hydroscopicity, high stability, and good bulking properties. Still, these compounds are reduced-calorie sweeteners, so they are successfully employed in many dietetic foods, like candies, chocolates, baked products; ice! creams, and beverages. sere we describe the determination of maltitol, <b>isomaltitol,</b> and lactitol, along with other common carbohydrates, in some foodstuffs such as toffees, biscuits, creams, sponge cakes, chocolates, roasted malt, and chicory leaves. Separations were accomplished by high-ps anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detection using 40 mM NaOH + 1 mM Ba(CH 3 COO) (2) as the mobile phase. The optimal detection potential (E-DET = + 0. 10 V) was established in voltammetric experiments carried out in batch and flowing stream solutions. Under optimized conditions {{there was no need for}} both postcolumn addition of strong bases to the eluent and, even more important, column regeneration between runs. A pellicular column with a relatively low ion-exchange capacity was adopted, which allows a rapid separation of sorbitol, <b>isomaltitol,</b> lactitol, maltitol, glucose, fructose, sucrose, and lactose. The presence in the alkaline mobile phase of barium ions improved selectivity and reproducibility besides shorter analysis times as well. Limits of detection were on time order of 10 - 20 pmol injected. The contents of DAs and other free sugars in some dietetic foods were evaluated by calibration graphs...|$|E
40|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, erroneous and exaggerated accumulation of leukocytes in a tissue inadvertently causes the body harm. Several efficient anti-inflammatory drugs exist, for example corticosteroids and cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors. However, these drugs have potent and diverse effects and often act by inhibiting events subsequent to initiation of the inflammatory response, leading to {{more or less}} severe side-effects, especially when used in high doses {{for long periods of}} time. For this reason, strategies aimed at early inhibition of recruitment and activation of leukocytes have been suggested as safer and more specific approaches to reduce inflammation. Leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelium is a prerequisite to the following activation and extravasation, and takes place in the initial phase of inflammation. By using a model that allows leukocytes to adhere to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -activated endothelial cells, thus mimicking aspects of an inflammatory reaction, we found that uridine, 4 -thiouridine and <b>isomaltitol</b> could all reduce adhesion. This suggested that they may have anti-inflammatory potential. We therefore tried the three substances in a Sephadex-induced lung inflammation model and found that uridine and 4 -thiouridine have several anti-inflammatory effects, such as being able to reduce leukocyte accumulation, decrease TNF protein levels and partly inhibit the oedema induced by Sephadex. <b>Isomaltitol</b> turned out to have immunomodulating, rather than anti-inflammatory, effects, which could be of interest in diseases where inadequate inflammatory responses are a problem...|$|E
