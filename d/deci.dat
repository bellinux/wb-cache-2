25|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s Edward L. <b>Deci</b> and Richard M. Ryan have {{conducted}} research that {{eventually led to}} the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT). This theory focuses on the degree to which an individual's behaviour is self-motivated and self-determined. SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{self-determination}} theory (SDT) {{was developed}} by psychologists Edward <b>Deci</b> and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses {{on the importance of}} intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.|$|E

50|$|<b>DECUS</b> {{played a}} {{critical}} role in the development of computer games in North America in the 1970s. The pioneering titles Adventure by Will Crowther; Baseball, Dungeon and Star Trek by Don Daglow and Hunt the Wumpus by Gregory Yob provided a foundation for the games industry. One of the first real-time interactive multi-user games, MTrek (MultiTrek), was also distributed on <b>DECUS</b> tapes. Major commercial game titles including Zork and Empire were first popularized by <b>DECUS.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>DECUS</b> U.S. Chapter {{conducted}} technical conferences {{at various}} locations, and ran other operations like Local User Groups (LUGs) and Special Interest Groups. Chapters {{in other nations}} did likewise. <b>DECUS</b> also promoted the open exchange of user-developed software, largely via magnetic tape.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Guilty Gear X on Dreamcast and PS2 was positive; they have average scores of 89.33 percent and 79.70 percent, respectively, on GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PS2 version 79 out of 100. Anoop Gantayat of IGN called the Dreamcast version [...] "possibly the finest-looking 2D game ever, {{thanks to the}} high-res graphics, mega-ultra special effects and smooth animation." [...] According to T.J. <b>Deci</b> of AllGame, the PS2 is [...] "notable for smooth, refined graphics, with richly detailed characters and backgrounds uncommon in 2D fighters." [...] Although Guilty Gear Xs overall graphics were praised, its sometimes-confusing backgrounds were heavily criticized.|$|E
500|$|Digimon Racings release fell on April 1, 2004 in Japan; April 30 in Europe; and September 13 in North America. The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics upon release; {{it has a}} score of 62% at Metacritic and 63.67% at GameRankings. Critics criticized the game for its close resemblance to other kart racers of the time. IGN's Craig Harris and 1UP.com's Garnett Lee stated that Digimon Racings gameplay mirrored that of Crash Nitro Kart and the Mario Kart series respectively. Aside from the familiar format, critics praised specific aesthetic points such as the graphics and music (GameZone's Michael Lafferty) and the tracks' layouts and themes (Lee). Aspects of the gameplay were also praised, such as control (Harris and Lee), multiplayer mode (Lee), replay value, and kart hopping (Harris). Nintendo Power stated that [...] "he racing action {{is similar to that}} of other kart games, but the Digimon influence adds a fun gameplay edge." [...] Famitsus four reviewers gave the game scores of 5, 5, 7, and 6 out of 10, respectively, resulting in a total score of 23 out of 40. Allgame's T.J. <b>Deci</b> gave the game three stars out of five, although he did not provide a more thorough review.|$|E
2500|$|As {{important}} as the budget differences are {{to the issue of}} pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, Edward L. <b>Deci</b> and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals. [...] <b>Deci</b> designed a study that involved college students who were given an [...] "interesting" [...] activity to perform. [...] Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, <b>Deci</b> argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards. [...] <b>Deci</b> goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.|$|E

50|$|<b>DECUS</b> was the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society, a users' {{group for}} Digital Equipment Corporation computers. Members {{included}} companies and organizations who purchased DEC equipment; many members were application programmers who wrote code for DEC machines or system programmers who managed DEC systems. <b>DECUS</b> {{was founded in}} March 1961 by Edward Fredkin.|$|R
2500|$|Eisenberger {{designed}} a study meant to refute Deci's claim. [...] His results reported that “perceived competence partially mediated the positive relationship found between performance-contingent reward and intrinsic motivation.” In other words, the detrimental effects of providing tangible rewards, {{discussed in the}} <b>Deci</b> studies, occurred under highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Self-determination is {{the ability}} to make choices and {{exercise}} a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (<b>Deci</b> et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & <b>Deci,</b> 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of [...] "helpless learning". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try. Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.|$|E
2500|$|Weibel contributed {{further to}} Perry and Deci's {{findings}} {{when she and}} her team examined the benefits and costs of an extrinsically motivated system, and compared this system in the public and the private sectors. [...] This clearly defined scope allowed the pay-for-performance policies in each sector to be evaluated individually. [...] The authors’ hypothesis was that the public sector has specific characteristics (the same as those diagnosed by <b>Deci</b> and Perry) that would make pay for performance ineffective, calling the proposed adoption for such policies “naïve.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A common {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{in using the}} decibel occurs when deciding {{about the use of}} 10×log or 20×log. [...] In the original definition, it was a power measurement, and as employed in that context, the formulation 10×log should be used, as <b>deci</b> means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current×current×resistance, ×velocity×velocity×mass. [...] Where the power is a square function of a field variable (such as voltage, current, or pressure), then 10×log is the correct expression for the square, or 20×log for the field variable itself.|$|E
2500|$|Although a {{push for}} {{providing}} extrinsic motivation is still politically popular, research continues to lean toward {{the understanding of}} <b>Deci</b> and Perry—that the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector. [...] Since those who work for government or non-profit organizations {{are more likely to}} be in the mindset of serving others, they tend to be motivated more intrinsically. [...] They perform tasks because of loyalty or an internalized sense of duty, and/or enjoyment. [...] Giving employees a performance-contingent monetary incentive to do something they already enjoy can decrease his/her motivation to do it as the person is then likely to view its action as externally driven rather than as internally appealing.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{correlational}} study, Katz and Shahar used {{a series}} of questionnaires and Likert-style scales and gave them to 100 teachers to see what makes a motivating teacher. Their results indicate that teachers who are intrinsically motivated to teach and believe that students should be taught in an autonomous style are the types of teachers that promote intrinsic motivation in the classroom [...] <b>Deci,</b> Sheinman, and Nezlek also found that when teachers adapted to an autonomous teaching style, students were positively affected and became more intrinsically motivated to achieve in the classroom. [...] However, while the students were quick {{to adapt to the}} new teaching style the impact was short-lived [...] Thus, teachers are limited in the way they teach because they’ll feel a pressure to act, teach, and provide feedback in a certain way from the school district, administration, and guardians , [...] Furthermore, even if students do have a teacher that promotes an autonomous teaching style, their overall school environment is also a factor because it can be extrinsically motivating. Examples of this would be posters around school promoting pizza parties for highest grade point average or longer recess times for the classroom that brings more canned food donations.|$|E

60|$|After the sepulchres of Saints and Martyrs {{were thus}} {{converted}} into {{places of worship}} like the heathen temples, and the Churches into sepulchres, and a certain sort of sanctity attributed to the dead bodies of the Saints and Martyrs buried in them, and annual festivals were kept to them, with sacrifices offered to God in their name; {{the next step towards}} the invocation of Saints, was the attributing to their dead bodies, bones and other reliques, a power of working miracles, by means of the separate souls, who were supposed to know what we do or say, {{and to be able to}} do us good or hurt, and to work those miracles. This was the very notion the heathens had of the separate souls of their antient Kings and Heroes, whom they worshiped under the names of Saturn, Rhea, Jupiter, Juno, Mars, Venus, Bacchus, Ceres, Osiris, Isis, Apollo, Diana, and the rest of their Gods. For these Gods being male and female, husband and wife, son and daughter, brother and sister, are thereby discovered to be antient men and women. Now as the first step towards the invocation of Saints was set on foot by the persecution of Decius, and the second by the persecution of Dioclesian; so this third seems to have been owing to the proceedings of Constantius and Julian the Apostate. When Julian began to restore the worship of the heathen Gods, and to vilify the Saints and Martyrs; the Christians of Syria and Egypt seem to have made a great noise about the miracles done by the reliques of the Christian Saints and Martyrs, in opposition to the powers attributed by Julian and the heathens to their Idols. For Sozomen and Ruffinus tell us, that when he opened the heathen Temples, and consulted the Oracle of Apollo Daphnæus in the suburbs of Antioch, and pressed by many sacrifices for an answer; the Oracle at length told him that the bones of the Martyr Babylas which were buried there hinder'd him from speaking. By which answer we may understand, that some Christian was got into the place where the heathen Priests used to speak thro' a pipe in delivering their Oracles: and before this, Hilary in his book against Constantius, written in the last year of that Emperor, makes the following mention of what was then doing in the East where he was. Sine martyrio persequeris. Plus crudelitati vestræ Nero, <b>Deci,</b> Maximiane, debemus. Diabolum enim per vos vicimus. Sanctus ubique beatorum martyrum sanguis exceptus est, dum in his Dæmones mugiunt, dum ægritudines depelluntur, dum miraculorum opera cernuntur, elevari sine laqueis corpora, & dispensis pede fæminis vestes non defluere in faciem, uri sine ignibus spiritus, confiteri sine interrogantis incremento fidei. And Gregory Nazianzen, in his first Oration against the Emperor Julian then reigning, writes thus: Martyres non extimuisti quibus præclari honores & festa constituta, à quibus Dæmones propelluntur & morbi curantur; quorum sunt apparitiones & prædictiones; quorum vel sola corpora idem possunt quod animæ sanctæ, sive manibus contrectentur, sive honorentur: quorum vel solæ sanguinis guttæ atque exigua passionis signa idem possunt quod corpora. Hæc non colis sed contemnis & aspernaris. These things made the heathens in the reign of the same Emperor demolish the sepulchre of John the Baptist in Phoenicia, and burn his bones; when several Christians mixing themselves with the heathens, gathered up some of his remains, which were sent to Athanasius, who hid them in the wall of a Church; foreseeing by a prophetic spirit, as Ruffinus tells us, that they might be profitable to future generations.|$|E
