50|$|The {{most visible}} feature of a mine shaft is the {{headframe}} (or winding tower, poppet head or pit head) which stands above the shaft. Depending {{on the type}} of hoist used the top of the headframe will either house a <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> or a sheave wheel (with the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> mounted on the ground).The headframe will also contain bins for storing ore being transferred to the processing facility.|$|E
50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, <b>hoist</b> <b>motors,</b> drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R

50|$|Motor-assist systems {{very closely}} {{resemble}} standard counterweight fly systems described above, however a drum winch, typically mounted behind the locking rail below the arbor, {{is used to}} drive a steel cable purchase line. The purchase line is still terminated {{at the top and}} bottom of the arbor, but a rope lock is not used on the motor-assist line set. Weight on the arbor helps balance the batten load so that <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> size can remain relatively small. It is often feasible to retrofit a standard counterweight line set to become a motor-assist set.|$|E
50|$|Motor-generator sets {{have been}} {{replaced}} by semiconductor devices for some purposes. In the past, a popular use for MG sets were in elevators. Since accurate speed control of the hoisting machine was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC variable-frequency drives and compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than DC-powered machinery.|$|E
5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction hoists utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>motor</b> by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|R
50|$|Later {{systems have}} used modern {{electronic}} controls and quickly reversible motors with good slow-speed {{control to the}} <b>hoist</b> winch <b>motors,</b> so as to give a positioning accuracy of inches. Some early systems used controllable hydraulic gearboxes {{to achieve the same}} result, but these added complexity and cost and so were only popular where high accuracy was needed, such as for shipbuilding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hoist</b> (winch) <b>motors</b> {{are either}} fixed speed or {{variable}} speed. Fixed speed motors are used at heavy-load and/or slow-speed line sets (e.g., electrics and orchestra shell line sets). Variable speed motors are used at line sets requiring dynamic motion {{that may be}} viewed by the audience (e.g., drapery and scenery line sets). Scenery hoists commonly allow travel at rates of hundreds of feet per minute.|$|R

Lifting and lowering the container as the fixed operation of CC. Lifting the container as forward operating of <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> and lowering the container as reverse operating of <b>hoist</b> <b>motor.</b> The type of DC motor have used to modelling. Simulink (one of Matlab toolboxes) was used to model the forward and reverse of DC <b>hoist</b> <b>motor.</b> When lifting the container (forward motoring), the current required depends on the applied load torque. But when lowering the containers (reverse motoring), the voltage generated by the engine polarity reverse is determined by the downward movement of containers (mass and height). Reverse the polarity, and let the motor functions as a generator, produces a current and then the potential energy was calculated. Conclusions were drawn {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the mathematical analysis of the speed control of the <b>Hoist</b> <b>Motor</b> installed in the Transtainer, Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Transtainer is a crane used for the handling of containers and the <b>Hoist</b> <b>Motor</b> installed in the transtainer is used for the lifting and lowering of the containers from the container vessel to the container yard or vice versa. This analysis has been done for the hoist operation of the transtainer. The hoisting speed is started from the zero speed and reached to a steady speed after the acceleration is finished and finally, it is reached to the zero speed again. This complete cycle is known as the hoist operation. A separately excited DC motor is used for the <b>Hoist</b> <b>Motor</b> to lift a container load. The operator of the transtainer uses the joystick controller having five notch positions to control the speed of the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> and when the operator uses the joystick controller from zero to fourth notch, the speed varies from zero up to the base speed and when the joystick controller is put from fourth notch position to fifth notch position, the speed of the motor is varied from the base speed to the final steady state speed which is higher than the base speed. This final speed depends on the container load which is lifted by thehoist motor. The <b>Hoist</b> <b>Motor</b> speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> is controlled by changing the DC generator out put voltage which is directly supplied to the hoist motorThe <b>Hoist</b> <b>Motor</b> speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> is controlled by changing the DC generator out put voltage which is directly supplied to the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor.</b> The out put voltage of the DC generator is controlled by changing the generator field current which is controlled by the firing signals of the thyristors. Firing signals of the thyristios are controlled by the speed controller mainly consisting of Automatic Speed Regulator (ASR) and Automatic Current Regulator (ACR). The speed reference signal produced by the joystick controller in the crane is given to the speed controller via a soft starter and this speed reference input to the speed controller is a ramp signal. In addition to the speed reference input, the armature current feedback and the motor speed feed back are given to the speed controller to control the motor speedIn this research, two mathematical models were made to analyse the motor armature voltage control and the motor field control and the both transient and steady state analysis of the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> speed have been done in addition to the stability analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the power demand of the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> in rubber-tired gantry (RTG) cranes with nonparallel cables has been {{developed}} to measure the energy consumption in a typical lift cycle. From measurements taken at the Port of Felixstowe, {{it has been observed}} that the peculiar geometrical characteristics of the hoisting mechanism cause the power demand to increase with the container height in constant rotor speed conditions. The change in the angle of the hoisting ropes causes an increase in torque load and power consumption. By using information extracted from the crane's geometry, it has been possible to calculate the potential energy increase given the weight and vertical position of the container. The load torque on the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> and the vertical speed of the mass have also been calculated, allowing for the modeling of the <b>hoist</b> <b>motor</b> power consumption when lifting containers with constant rotational speed. The proposed model has been compared to a constant power demand approximation, showing a higher accuracy for masses below 40 t...|$|E
40|$|Dragline {{productivity}} is {{strongly influenced by}} swing cycle times, comprising between 60 – 70 % of all dragline operational time. The ability to classify and report on dragline swing cycles according to their limiting motion is essential for identifying performance losses and deriving continuous improvements. This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic classification of dragline cycle dependencies. The algorithm adopts a simple graphical approach, based on coincident limits defined by the locus of points where the swing and <b>hoist</b> <b>motors</b> work at full capacity for equivalent time periods. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing three cycle dependencies; swing, hoist, and drag limited cycles. The coincident limit algorithm was applied on a dragline at a coal mine in Queensland’s Bowen Basin. A data set of 200 000 cycles consisted of: 70 % swing limited cycles; 27 % hoist limited cycles and 3 % drag limited cycles. The coincident limit algorithm permits an equivalent swing angle to be calculated for draglines in hoist limited situations. This facilitates the possibility of measuring dragline work as BCMs multiplied by the equivalent swing angle. This measure could potentially be applied to benchmark the performance of draglines in different operational contexts in which varied pit and block geometries influence the proportion of hoist limited cycles...|$|R

40|$|A P&H 2800 XP {{electric}} mining shovel {{working in}} a Western Canadian surface coal mine was instrumented with microprocessor-based monitoring equipment, and its performance monitored as it excavated a series of test blasts. Hoist and crowd motor armature voltages and currents, dipper trajectories, cycle times and load weights were recorded. A diggability index has been established based on {{the responses of the}} <b>hoist</b> <b>motor.</b> Values of the diggability index correlated well with digging conditions as observed during monitoring and with muckpile fragmentation size distributions as determined by a photographic survey. This correlation establishes the ability of an instrumented shovel to diagnose the efficiency of ground preparation practices (blasting) by identifying variations in muckpile diggability. The data on dipper trajectory has demonstrated that variations in digging practices do exist amongst an experienced group of shovel operators, and that variation in trajectory significantly influences values of the recorded motor performance parameters. An approach is described to account for variations in digging practice on assessments of diggability. An allied investigation into the ability of time studies to define diggability, revealed dig cycle times to be operator dependant, and unrelated to levels of digging effort...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has investigated {{the use of}} fuzzy logic, via the Matlab Fuzzy Logic Tool Box, to design optimized controller systems. The engineering system for which the controller was designed and simulate was the container crane. The fuzzy logic algorithm that was investigated was the 'predictive control' algorithm. The plant dynamics of the container crane is representative of many important systems including robotic arm movements. The container crane that was investigated had a trolley motor and <b>hoist</b> <b>motor.</b> Total distance to be traveled by the trolley was 15 meters. The obstruction height was 5 meters. Crane height was 17. 8 meters. Trolley mass was 7500 kilograms. Load mass was 6450 kilograms. Maximum trolley and rope velocities were 1. 25 meters per sec. and 0. 3 meters per sec., respectively. The fuzzy logic approach allowed the inclusion, in the controller model, of performance indices that are more effectively defined in linguistic terms. These include 'safety' and 'cargo swaying'. Two fuzzy inference systems were implemented using the Matlab simulation package, namely the Mamdani system (which relates fuzzy input variables to fuzzy output variables), and the Sugeno system (which relates fuzzy input variables to crisp output variable). It is found that the Sugeno FIS is better suited to including aspects of those plant dynamics whose mathematical relationships can be determined...|$|E

Gander and Chamberlain quote a weight of only [...] for these guns, presumably accounting for the extra volume of the enlarged chamber. An armored single mount, the Bettungsschiessgerüst (Firing platform) C/39 was used by these guns. It had a maximum elevation of 60° and could traverse up to 360°, depending on the emplacement. The C/39 mount had two compartments; the upper housed the guns and their loading equipment, while the lower contained the ammunition <b>hoists,</b> their <b>motors,</b> and the elevation and traverse motors. The mount was fully powered and had an underground magazine. Normally these were placed in open concrete barbettes, relying on their armor, but Hitler {{thought that there was}} not enough protection for the guns (Battery Todt) emplaced on Cap-Gris-Nez in the Pas de Calais near Wimereux and ordered a concrete casemate [...] thick built over and around the mounts.
