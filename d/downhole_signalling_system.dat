Consequently, methods and techniques to recover the transmitted <b>downhole</b> <b>signal</b> at the surface are becoming key problems for LWD mud pulse systems.|$|R
30|$|The study reviews various signal {{impairments}} {{that affect}} {{the quantity and quality}} of mud pulse telemetry signal required to maximize real-time data transmission throughput between downhole system and surface receiver. The paper explores mud pulse signal transmission and processing technical solutions to overcome limitations from <b>downhole</b> <b>signal</b> generation, signal transmission and impairments and signal detection and extraction at the surface receiver. The paper is organized into eight (8) sections: The next section explores the LWD technologies while the subsequent section reviews the mud pulse telemetry <b>system</b> <b>signal</b> generation, transmission, detection and extraction; then the following section discusses the various sources of signal impairments affecting the mud pulse signal transmission and extraction; subsequently, the current techniques and methods applied to suppress unwanted mud pulse signal impairment effects are reviewed; before summarizing the paper, comprehensive MPT technological performance advances are reviewed; thereafter, the paper is summarized and discussed; finally, the paper concludes.|$|R
30|$|Jianhui et al. (2007) {{researched}} {{the use of}} two-step filtering algorithms to eliminate mud pulse signal direct current (DC) noise components and attenuate the high frequency noises. In the study, the low-pass finite impulse response (FIR) filter design {{was used as the}} DC estimator to get a zero mean signal from the received pressure waveforms while the band-pass filter was used to eliminate out-of-band mud pump frequency components. This method used center-of-gravity technique to obtain mud pulse positions of <b>downhole</b> <b>signal</b> modulated by pulse positioning modulation (PPM) scheme. Later Zhao et al. (2009) used the average filtering algorithm to decay DC noise components and a windowed limited impulse response (FIR) algorithm deployed to filter high frequency noise. Yuan and Gong (2011) studied the use of directional difference filter and band-pass filter methods to remove noise on the continuous mud pulse differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) modulated <b>downhole</b> <b>signal.</b> In this technique, the directional difference filter was used to eliminate mud pump and reflection noise signals in time domain while band-pass filter isolated out-of-band noise frequencies in frequency domain.|$|R
30|$|Petroleum {{exploration}} and drilling activities require high density logging data collections to ensure accurate drive and control operation. Precise formation evaluation and decision-making increases drilling field operation profits and economic value.

Mud pulse telemetry robust <b>downhole</b> <b>signal</b> modulation and data compression with surface noise cancellation algorithms have guaranteed immunity to noise signals and speed data rate transmission.|$|R
30|$|Mud channel signals {{experience}} pressure fluctuations {{and uncertainty}} caused by various MPT system components that potentially change signal properties {{during the course}} of data transmission. The main noise sources that induce pressure fluctuations are mud pumps, pulsation dampeners, surface piping, pressure transducer locations, drill string components, mud properties and the well depth (Klotz et al. 2008 a, c). The mud channel that the pulse signals pass as they propagate to the surface is extremely harsh, demanding complex surface signal detection and extraction. Common mud pulse signal property distortions which degrade signal transmission and data rates are <b>downhole</b> <b>signal</b> strength, signal attenuation, surface induced noise (electrical noise) and surface piping induced signal reflections (Klotz et al. 2008 c). Unpredictable and complex adjustable signal impairments are caused by drilling noise, drill string motion noise within the borehole, attenuation and circulation pumps noise (Shearer 2010). Depending on the severity of the mud channel conditions and signal distortions, to achieve maximum possible data rates, telemetry systems must be robust and flexible, both downhole and at the surface receiver (Klotz et al. 2008 a, b, c). Despite the signal processing complexity and their varying properties, mud pulse systems must adapt the harsh working environment and recover the useful original signals. This section discusses main mud pulse telemetry <b>system</b> <b>signal</b> impairments that affect MPT data transmissions.|$|R
30|$|Exploration and {{drilling}} {{operations are}} the most costly and risky activities that require logging while drilling effective tool operation and high speed real-time data transmission. Among other logging technologies, mud pulse telemetry has been widely adopted into real-time drilling and logging data measurements for deep formation evaluation decision-making. However, the increased downhole information quantity and quality requirements have elevated demands for greater bandwidth and higher data rate transmission. Maximum possible mud pulse telemetry data rates are obstructed by unpredictable signal impairments. Researchers have implemented numerous <b>downhole</b> <b>signal</b> modulation techniques, data compression algorithms and surface receiver noise cancellation techniques to lower bit errors and increase signal-to-noise ratio. This study reviews mud pulse telemetry <b>system</b> <b>signal</b> transmission challenges and current countermeasure trends. Rigorous technical literature reviews from exploration and drilling oilfield service industry {{have been at the}} receiving end debated. Mud channel signal characteristics, signal attenuation factors, signal detection and decoding techniques are critical to successful mud pulse operations. To minimize exploration, drilling and economic risks, this study explores mud pulse data transmission challenges, strategies and possible technical solutions to the next generation engineers and scholars in the field.|$|R
