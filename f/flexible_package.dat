40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{packaging}} {{industry in}} South Africa {{is a large}} and diversified one. To classify all the applications would be well nigh impossible. <b>Flexible</b> <b>packaging</b> forms {{a very important part}} of the packaging industry and is itself divided into three basic groups, namely, the suppliers of basic materials, the converters and the product manufacturers who produce their own <b>flexible</b> <b>packages.</b> This thesis is concerned with the most prominent of these groups, namely the converters, that is, with those firms who convert basic materials into various forms of <b>flexible</b> <b>packages,</b> for product manufacturers. <b>Flexible</b> <b>packages</b> are now considered an integral part of the finished product and with the extensive application of <b>flexible</b> <b>packaging</b> for a very wide range of consumer products, they form part of the cost structure of these consumer products. The cost of <b>flexible</b> <b>packaging</b> is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the cost of the many different types of raw materials supplied to the converters and the cost of the highly specialised labour used. However the ability of converters to control costs, that is, to keep production costs within acceptable, limits is the most important factor. The effective control of costs is to a large degree dependent upon the successful application of management accounting techniques. This thesis attempts, as its prime object, to evaluate the use of such techniques in helping to achieve an effective control of costs in the converting firms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} smart {{appliances}} and devices {{in the home}} and office has grown dramatically in recent years. Unfortunately, these devices rarely interact with each other or the environment. In order to move from environments filled with smart devices to smart environments, there must be a framework for devices {{to communicate with each other}} and with the environment. This enables reasoners and automated decision makers to understand the environment and the data collected from it. Semantic web technologies provide this framework in a well-documented and <b>flexible</b> <b>package.</b> In this paper we present the Casas Ontology for Smart Environments (COSE) and accompanying data from a test smart environment and discuss the current and future challenges associated with a Smart Environment on th...|$|E

In this report it is postulated that quality of life covers life as a whole as well as different subdomains of life.

40|$|This paper {{brings into}} light a new ultra-thin and highly <b>flexible</b> <b>package</b> with {{embedded}} active chips. In this technology, no supporting and permanent substrates were needed. Copper foil {{was used as}} temporal substrate, and it became the bottom circuit after patterning and etching processes. Ultra-thin chips with 20 - 25 m thickness were assembled directly on the structured copper foils in a flip-chip fashion. The gap between chip and copper foil was only about 10 m. Subsequently, the chips were embedded into flexible adhesive/polyimide polymer layers or alternatively in highly elastic polyurethane materials, with a copper foil always laminated on the top. The resultant ultra-thin film package (UTFP) has a thickness of 100 m only. Each package sticking on a rod with 10 mm diameter could pass the electrical measuring. Stacking of three-layer chip embedded packages had also been realized and passed electrical measurements. The process details on each core technique will be disclo sed, and some results will be presented in the paper. © 2008 IEEE...|$|E
