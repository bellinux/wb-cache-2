The work {{is based on an}} existing thermodynamic theory of constrained thermoelastic materials presented by Reddy (1984) for both definite and non- conductors, but we differ by adopting a new definition of a constrained non-conductor and by investigating the consequences of isotropy. The set of constraints considered is not arbitrary but is large enough to include most constraints commonly found in practice. We also extend Reddy's (1984) work by including consideration of sets of constraints for which a set of vectors associated with the constraints is linearly dependent. These vectors {{play a significant role in}} the propagation conditions and in the <b>growth</b> <b>equations</b> described below. Propagation conditions (of Fresnel-Hadamard type) are derived for both homothermal and homentropic waves, and solutions for longitudinal and transverse principal waves are discussed. The derivations involve the determination of jumps in the time derivative of constraint multipliers which are required in the solution of the corresponding <b>growth</b> <b>equations,</b> and it is found that these multipliers cannot be separately determined if the set of constraint vectors mentioned above is linearly dependent.

40|$|The von Bertalanffy <b>growth</b> <b>equation</b> is {{commonly}} used in ecology and fisheries management to model individual growth of an organism. Generally, a nonlinear regression is used with length-at-age data to recover key life history parameters: L∞ (asymptotic size), k (the growth coefficient), and t 0 (a time used to calculate size at age 0). However, age data are often unavailable for many species of interest, which makes the regression impossible. To confront this problem, we have developed a Bayesian model to find L ∞ using only length data. We use length-at-age data for female blue shark, Prionace glauca, to test our hypothesis. Preliminary comparisons of the model output {{and the results of}} a nonlinear regression using the von Bertalanffy <b>growth</b> <b>equation</b> show similar estimates of L∞. We also developed a full Bayesian model that fits the von Bertalanffy <b>growth</b> <b>equation</b> to the same data used in the classical regression and the length-based Bayesian model.
