50|$|Under Burnham's leadership, the State Department rebuilt all global {{financial}} operations, consolidated all budgeting, accounting and disbursing, strategic planning, budget and performance integration, and {{global financial}} operations. A two-decade old Wang-based accounting system {{was replaced with}} one integrated Web-based global financial reporting system. All budgeting was linked to performance measures for {{all aspects of the}} Department, and a business planning process was implemented for all bureaus and embassies. In addition, the Department produced the first joint performance plans with USAID, the first <b>joint</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> on performance and reporting with USAID, and also for the first time, the Department eliminated all material weakness from its financial audit.|$|E

It also requires GAO to submit reports biennially.

HIPAA requires that the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Justice (DOJ) issue a <b>joint</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> to Congress on amounts deposited to and appropriated from the Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund for the HCFAC program. In April 2005, GAO reported on the results of its review of HCFAC program activities for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and made recommendations to HHS and DOJ. The objectives of this requested review were to assess the extent to which HHS and DOJ (1) took actions to address the recommendations made in the 2005 report and (2) designed effective controls over reporting HCFAC deposits and expenditures for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. GAO reviewed HHS and DOJ documentation; selected nongeneralizable samples; and interviewed agency officials. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Medicare program is the nation's largest health insurer with almost 40 million beneficiaries and outlays of over $ 219 billion annually. Because of the susceptibility of the program to fraud and abuse, Congress enacted the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) Program {{as part of the}} Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPAA) of 1996. HCFAC, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), established a national framework to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement efforts to detect, prevent, and prosecute health care fraud and abuse in the public and private sectors. HIPPAA requires HHS and DOJ to issue a <b>joint</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> no later than January 1 of each year to Congress for the proceeding fiscal year. The joint HCFAC reports included deposits of $ 210 million for fiscal year 2000 and $ 464 million for fiscal year 2001, pursuant to the act. In testing at DOJ, GAO found errors in the recording of criminal fines deposits to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund in fiscal year 2001 that resulted in an estimated overstatement to the trust fund of $ 169, 765. GAO found that the planned use of HCFAC appropriations was in keeping with the stated purpose in the act. Although GAO found expenditures from the trust fund were generally appropriate at HHS, at DOJ GAO found $ 480, 000 in interest penalties not related to HCFAC activities that were charged to the HCFAC appropriation. GAO was unable to identify expenditures from the HCFAC trust fund for activities unrelated to Medicare because the HHS/OIG and DOJ do not separately account for or monitor these activities. Likewise, GAO was unable to identify savings specifically attributable to activities funded by the HCFAC program. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between financial leverage and firm’s investment in the presence of certain control variables such as (Tobin’s Q, cash flow, liquidity, return on equity and sale. Relationship was analyzed by applying different methodologies such as pooled regression, fixed effect model and random effect model. Housman test was performed for selection between fixed and random effect model. Data was taken from balance sheet analysis of <b>joint</b> stock companies, <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> of the companies, B recorder and Karachi Stock Exchange. Data was collected for nine years from 2000 - 2008, but analyses were performed for eight years because 2000 was taken as a lag. This study found that financial leverage has significant negative impact on firms’ investment. It shows that as leverage increases firm’s investment decreases, we may say that highly levered firms invest less. The result confirms that leverage overcome overinvestment bias and attenuate agency problem. The results of the common effect model supported that capital structure plays a vital role in the decisions of firms on how to invest. But whenever we extended the model to incorporate the time and individual effect, then no relationship were seen. The relationship between liquidity and investment is positive but insignificant. Tobin’s Q has also shown positive but slightly insignificant relationship with investment for the target samples...|$|R
