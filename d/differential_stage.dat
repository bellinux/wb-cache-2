50|$|Two triodes {{with the}} cathodes coupled {{together}} to form a differential pair. This stage has the ability to cancel common mode (equal on both inputs) signals, and if operated in class A also has the merit of having the ability to largely reject any supply variations (since they affect both sides of the <b>differential</b> <b>stage</b> equally), and conversely the total current drawn by the stage is almost constant (if one side draws more instantaneously the other draws less), resulting in minimal variation in the supply rail sag, and this possibly also interstage distortion.|$|E
40|$|A {{permanent}} {{current in}} addition to the main clocked current is sometimes used to increase the maximum clock rate of a bipolar latch. Although it speeds up the activation of a clocked <b>differential</b> <b>stage,</b> it deteriorates the latch function by the additional current in the inactive phase of each <b>differential</b> <b>stage.</b> Thus, a keep-alive current must be kept small with respect to the main clocked current. In this Letter, a compensation technique is shown avoiding the erroneous output of a keep-alive current. It still speeds up the activation of the main transistor pair, but results in a constant symmetric offset without affecting the differential value of the output voltage. In simulations of flip-flops and clocked comparators, this compensated keep-alive current has a much larger effect on the maximum clock rate than the uncompensated keep-alive current used so far...|$|E

The frequency response was optimised to meet international performance requirements for electrocardiographic recorders, in particular the International Electrotechnical Commission 60601 standards [1, 2]. The pole and zero locations of a multi-stage amplifier configuration were optimised to meet both time and frequency domain specifications. The optimum assignment for a three stage amplifier, having two <b>differential</b> <b>stages</b> and a differential-to-single-ended conversion stage was established by evaluating the performance of a number of circuit configurations.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we have {{analysed}} the Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) for differential amplifiers used in bioimpedance measurement systems and derived the complete equations {{for the case}} when OPAMPs have finite differential and common mode gains. In principle, passive ac-coupling networks that include no grounded components have an infinite CMRR, but they must provide a path for input bias currents. The paper provides a novel approach as to how component tolerances limit the CMRR and affect the transient response of different networks. Experimental results and various measurements support our theoretical predictions. The best CMRR is obtained when the differential gain is concentrated in the input stage, but it decreases at frequencies above 1 kHz because of the reduced CMRR for the <b>differential</b> <b>stage</b> at these frequencies.

40|$|The {{development}} of high performance monolithic RF front-ends requires innovative RF circuit design {{to make the}} best of a good technology. A fully differential approach is usually preferred, due to its well-known properties. Although the differential approach must be preserved inside the chip, there are cases where the input signal is single-ended such as RF image filters and IF filters in a RF receiver. In these situations, a stage able to convert single-ended into differential signals (balun) is needed. The most cited topology, which is capable of providing high gain, consists on a <b>differential</b> <b>stage</b> with one of the two inputs grounded. Unfortunately, this solution has some drawbacks when implemented monolithically.

In particular, for each t, they assign a probability pt to the event that "the game ends in period t". In this framework we analyze Generalized Prisoners' Dilemma games in both finite stage and differentiable stage games. Our construction shows {{that it is possible to}} reach cooperative equilibria under some conditions on the distribution of the discrete random variable T even if the expected length of the game is finite. More precisely, we completely characterize the existence of sub-game perfect cooperative equilibria in finite stage games by the (first order) convergence speed: the behavior in the limit of the ratio between the ending probabilities of two consecutive periods. Cooperation in differentiable stage games is determined by the second order convergence speed, which gives a finer analysis of the probability convergence process when the first convergence speed is zero. Leptokurtic distributions are defined as those distributions for which the (first order) convergence speed is zero and they preclude cooperation in finite stage games with probabilistic horizon. However, this negative result is obtained in <b>differential</b> <b>stage</b> games only for a subset of these distributions. repeated games, probabilistic horizon, cooperation...|$|E
