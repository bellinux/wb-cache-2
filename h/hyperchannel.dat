40|$|Abstract — Recently, a new WDM {{optical network}} infras-tructure named SMART [1], which {{is capable of}} {{dynamically}} setting up, modifying, and tearing down optical connections, was proposed. The performance of SMART {{is determined by the}} performance of its <b>hyperchannels,</b> which are essentially optical buses or light-trails. Previously proposed MAC protocols for unidirectional optical buses can be used as distributed medium access control protocols for <b>hyperchannels.</b> However, these pro-tocols require optical detection and they are either unfair, or not work-conserving. In this paper, we propose a class of work-conserving, collision-free, detection-free, and fair MAC protocols for opportunistic <b>hyperchannels</b> which are tailored <b>hyperchannels</b> for SMART. We compare our proposed MAC protocols with known pi-persistent CSMA protocols and priority-based CSMA protocol by simulations. We show that the performances of our proposed protocols are much better than that of pi-persistent CSMA and that of priority-based CSMA protocol in terms of throughput and fairness...|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of 10 mbit/sec Ethernet in the 1980s {{was a major}} problem for the <b>HYPERchannel</b> product, one the company never clearly addressed. The company introduced products to allow <b>HYPERchannel</b> protocols to travel over Ethernet, and systems that allowed Ethernet-equipped computers to connect to <b>HYPERchannel</b> systems, as well as TCP/IP and other standard protocol support. However, these generally had the side-effect of further eroding the need for the product, other than raw performance, and it found itself pressed into an ever smaller niche that was eventually killed off by new systems with dramatically higher performance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A new {{scalable}} {{optical network}} infrastructure SMART is proposed based on light-trails and hypernetwork architecture. The underlying physical network of SMART is a reconfigurable WDM network with reconfigurability distributed over network nodes. The reconfigurable node architecture {{is capable of}} dynamically setting up, modifying, and tearing down connections that consist of multi-access <b>hyperchannels,</b> which are an extension of light-trails. Like light-trails, <b>hyperchannels</b> are used to efficiently utilize bandwidth in subwavelength granularity. Equipped with a menu of switching techniques and connection types, SMART is able to manage optimized connections, and enforce individual service qualities and overall network performance. SMART network combines the best features of optics and electronics, making the network highly intelligent. Various virtual networks can be easily constructed over SMART. SMART encompasses the best features of existing mature electrical and optical network technologies, making these technologies as special cases. SMART is customizable for constructing LANs, MANs and WANs, and for access and transport. SMART provides an excellent alternative {{for the next generation}} Internet.

40|$|CASWe report {{observations}} of backward and forward electron emission {{by a thin}} silicon crystal target traversed by 29 MeV/u Pb 56 + incident ions. For each incident ion we have performed measurements of backward and forward electron emission, of the energy loss and of the charge state of the transmitted ion. The crystal target was traversed by incident ions either in random incidence or in axial alignment conditions. In both cases these correlated measurements bring original information on electron emission. In random conditions, using an incident ion species with a charge quite far from equilibrium, we observe correlations between backward and forward electron emission, that we understand when analyzing the associated charge exchange and energy-loss data. In channeling conditions, we added electron emission measurements to simultaneous energy-loss and charge state measurements (that are known to characterize quite precisely the type of trajectory of a projectile transmitted through a thin crystal). This allowed us to observe the reduced electron emission due to <b>hyperchanneled</b> ions, that interact mainly with target valence electrons, and also the enhanced electron emission due to projectiles entering the crystal very close to atomic strings...|$|R

50|$|<b>HYPERchannel,</b> {{sometimes}} rendered <b>Hyperchannel,</b> was a {{local area}} networking system for mainframe computers, especially supercomputers, introduced by Network Systems Corporation in the 1970s. It ran at the then-fast speed of 50 mbits/second, performance {{that would not be}} matched by commodity hardware until the introduction of Fast Ethernet in 1995. <b>HYPERchannel</b> ran over very thick coax cable or fibre optic extensions and required adaptor hardware the size of a minicomputer. The networking protocol was entirely proprietary. Solutions for Control Data, IBM and Cray computers were their primary products, but a wide variety of support emerged in the 1980s, including DEC VAX and similar superminicomputers.|$|E

40|$|The {{scattering}} and recoiling imaging code (SARIC) {{was employed}} to perform classical ion trajectory simulations of hyperchanneling phenomenon of low energy noble gas ions on the Pt(111) -(1 x 1) surface. It was found that under proper conditions, incident ions can indeed possess oscillatory trajectories within one single open semichannel in the first atomic layer of the Pt surface, which confirmed the concept of hyperchanneling. This special scattering phenomenon was {{explained by the fact}} that the smooth overlapping of atomic potentials of the atoms lining the walls of the semichannel effectively provides a potential trap along the trajectories of the incident ions resulting in the hyperchanneling. In addition, it was found that the mass of the ions had a profound effect on the conditions to achieve hyperchanneling. Detailed simulations revealed that <b>hyperchanneled</b> ions suffered very little energy loss and energy spread upon exiting the surface. Due to the ultrahigh sensitivity of hyperchanneling ions to minute corrugations of the potentials of the atomic walls, hyperchanneling can be utilized to determine the surface Debye temperature, which is one of the important parameters to model most surface reactions.

50|$|NSC {{found itself}} in a strange position. Its <b>HYPERchannel</b> {{networking}} gear was being supplanted by cheaper and relatively plug-and-play LANs. In addition, the rapid evolution of routing protocols and software was not suited to their products which could neither be upgraded by the customer, nor booted from a server elsewhere on the network. In general, NSC products were maintained on-site by NSC technicians.|$|E
50|$|The A-series adapter {{was later}} supplanted by the DX adapter, which was microprocessor-based, and could contain a {{selection}} of device cards, trunk boards, link boards, as well as LAN and WAN cards including Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, or an IP router board for IP communication, in a chassis of up to 16 slots. As it could contain more than one device interface board, it could handle inter-device communication without resort to the <b>Hyperchannel</b> trunk, which was only retained for communication with legacy equipment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hyperchannel</b> Trunk was a LAN made {{of up to}} four {{parallel}} coaxial cables carrying 50 Mb/sec, which, at the time, {{was considered}} bleeding-edge technology. There could be many adapters on the trunk, so that, for example, mainframes of different types could inter-communicate across the trunk network that could also have an adapter for telecomms links to other locations. If a trunk was busy, the adapter would try the next trunk. Trunk protocol was timing-based, and three timers had to be manually calculated and set on each adapter due to data being limited to {{the speed of light}} (which travels at about 1ft/nS), and if a new adapter was installed on the trunk (thus changing the length of the trunk), the timers on all adapters on the trunk had to be revised. Each adapter had an address, set on thumb-wheel switches.|$|E

Particularly, we consider that the future wireless ad hoc networks shall be able to efficiently provide connectivity and support a variety of quality of service requirements, such as bandwidth and delay requirements. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework {{for the design of}} future wireless ad hoc networks. The key idea of this framework is to establish an overlay hypernetwork, which consists of multiple hyperchannels, each of which can provide connectivity for multiple nodes in the <b>hyperchannel.</b> By comparison, a typical tunnel in existing overlay network schemes can only provide connectivity for two end nodes. Within the framework, we also develop advanced network coding design that can further improve the performance of the network in terms of throughput and delay. I...|$|E
40|$|Light-trail is {{proposed}} {{as a candidate}} to carry IP traffic over wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks given its capability of accommodating multi-granularity traffic by time-division multiplexing (TDM). Light-trail's unidirectional shared-media multicast nature {{makes it hard to}} implement distributed access control and restricts that at most one packet transmission can take place at any time. Recently, opportunistic optical <b>hyperchannel</b> was proposed to improve light-trail by permitting easy distributed access control. In this paper, we propose a set of distributed access control protocols, namely, 1 -persistent protocols, for opportunistic optical hyperchannels to maximize the throughput and provide fair service among contending nodes by taking their inherent advantage of adaptive space-division multiplexing (SDM). We also point out a possible generalization of opportunistic optical hyperchannels by removing the restriction of linear structure, and demonstrate possible applications of such a generalization.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{describe}} the tools and techniques in use at the NASA Ames Research Center for performing visualization of computational aerodynamics, for example visualization of flow fields from computer simulations of fluid dynamics about vehicles such as the Space Shuttle. The hardware used for visualization is a high-performance graphics workstation connected to a super computer with a high speed channel. At present, the workstation is a Silicon Graphics IRIS 3130, the supercomputer is a CRAY 2, and the high speed channel is a <b>hyperchannel.</b> The three techniques used for visualization are post-processing, tracking, and steering.
