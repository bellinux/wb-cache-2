The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E

5|$|The {{democratic}} party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing {{to follow a}} populist policy in order to cajole the public. According to Aristotle, Pericles' stance can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his principal political opponent, Cimon, was both rich and generous, {{and was able to}} gain public favor by lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune. The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist {{at the same time as}} the original one.|$|E

Written by Ehud Manor and composed by Nurit Hirsh, at the contest the song was also conducted <b>by</b> Hirsh. <b>The</b> two musicians also collaborated to produced the 1978 edition's winning Israeli entry, with Manor producing overall six more Israeli entries.|$|R
30|$|The {{remarkable}} {{absence of}} lens interference is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of <b>the</b> very acute incident {{angle of the}} ultrasound beam and near-ideally smooth and regular surface; thus, the lens does not produce any echoes that could return back to the probe. The iris, on the other hand, is an excellent scatterer due to its complex structure, surface and irregularities, comparable in size with the ultrasound wavelength in the soft tissues.|$|R
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to Hasan's rule {{outside of}} his family's core region around Mosul remained, however—in Diyar Bakr, the {{governor}} of Mayyafariqin, Ali ibn Ja'far, rebelled against Hasan, and in Diyar Mudar, the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj also revolted. Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira {{by the end of}} 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward. In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{a significant portion of the}} tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but the primary goal of the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they cannot {{be made in}} the most common {{processes}} of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce {{is that it is a}} magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E

According to the Menoufiya University Hospital study, firearm injuries were found more common in rural regions (72.41 %) compare to urban areas (27.59 %). This could be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that rural population has easier access to small firearms to protect their livestock and less gun regulations than urban areas (Badawy et al. 2009).|$|R

As for investigations considering such a filtration for any studies with FPH, the information is very limited by a few publications (Chakraborty and Madhavan 1977; Loosen et al. 1994). It <b>explains</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that plate and frame filtration is rather a technological step at a large production than a matter of investigation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Studies {{have shown}} that inverse {{proteins}} are relatively abundant. In this work, we investigate {{the proposition that the}} repeat patterns they share with protein sequences explain this phenomenon. Using a new artificial set of peptide sequences which also display these features and a random set, we show that the presence of repeats contributes to protein sequence similarity. Further analysis confirms that most inverse proteins exhibit repeats. Therefore, we suggest the relative abundance of inverse proteins can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they display <b>the</b> same repeat structures and amino acid propensity of existing proteins...|$|R

25|$|The bulk of {{the present}} {{clusters}} must have formed relatively recent because only seven clusters of functionally related genes are conserved between phyla. Some of these differences can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> gene expression is very differently regulated by different phyla. For example, in vertebrates and plants DNA methylation is used, whereas it is absent in yeast and flies.|$|E
50|$|Much of the biographical {{material}} on Jean Chouan {{is based on}} the work of Jacques Duchemin des Cépeaux, in a work written in 1825 at the request of the king, Charles X, who ruled France from 1824 until 1830. Cépeaux is unapologetically a royalist partisan, and he presents a number of claims that may be unfounded. The story of Jean Chouan is, therefore, almost certainly, in large part, legendary. The persistence of the legend can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> it has been continuously nourished by a small faction of Catholics and royalist-legitimists who have remained active up to the present day.|$|R
5000|$|However, it did {{not last}} for long: on 8 November, Warsaw was already held by Russia. Russians {{discarded}} all the banknotes and declared them invalid.

This can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> Polish monetary system, even in the deep crisis, {{was better than the}} Russian stable one, as Poland used the silver standard for coins. That is why Mikhail Speransky offered to come to silver monometalism ("count on the silver ruble") in his work План финансов (Financial Plans, 1810) in Russia. He argued that: [...] "... at the same time ... forbid any other account in Livonia and Poland, and {{this is the only way}} to unify the financial system of these provinces in the Russian system, and as well they will stop, at least, the damage that pulls back our finances for so long." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical flow-through method to separate anisole and ethyl phenylacetate, respectively, from a polystyrene mixture. The microfluidic separation uses different diffusive {{dynamics of the}} substances transverse to the lamination flow formed in a microchannel. The effect of inlet flow rates and ambient temperature on separation is examined. Additionally, {{the possibility of the}} separation of the light substance from the mixture with different molecular weight is shown numerically and experimentally. The separation efficiency is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that <b>the</b> relaxation time depends on the inlet flow rate and that the diffusivity depends on the ambient temperature. This method can be applied to separate monomers from aggregates...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating a pattern of faults, represented as a binary vector, from a set of measurements. Maximum a posteriori probability estimation of the fault pattern leads to a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. Following the recent success of the belief propagation framework in the related compressed sensing and low density lattice decoding domains, we propose to solve the fault identification problem using nonparametric belief propagation (NBP). We show empirically that our belief propagation solver is more accurate than recent state-of-the-art algorithms. Our algorithm superior performance is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we take into account both the fault pattern sparsity {{as well as its}} Boolean nature...|$|R

After the early 90 s, performance improved along many dimensions for both the targeting countries and the non-targeters. In some cases <b>the</b> targeters improved <b>by</b> more; for example, average inflation fell by a larger amount. However, these differences are <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that targeters performed worse than non-targeters before the early 90 s, and there is regression to the mean. Once one controls for regression to the mean, {{there is no evidence}} that inflation targeting improves performance. ...|$|R
