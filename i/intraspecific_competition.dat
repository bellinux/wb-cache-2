5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition,</b> although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> in these dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite {{marks on the}} face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E
5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{games of}} cyclic {{competitions}} have been extensively studied to gain insights {{into one of}} the most fundamental phenomena in nature: biodiversity that seems to be excluded by the principle of natural selection. The Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game of three species and its extensions [e. g., the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) game] are paradigmatic models in this field. In all previous studies, the intrinsic symmetry associated with cyclic competitions imposes a limitation on the resulting coexistence states, leading to only selective types of such states. We investigate the effect of nonuniform <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions</b> on coexistence and find that a wider spectrum of coexistence states can emerge and persist. This surprising finding is substantiated using three classes of cyclic game models through stability analysis, Monte Carlo simulations and continuous spatiotemporal dynamical evolution from partial differential equations. Our finding indicates that <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions</b> or alternative symmetry-breaking mechanisms can promote biodiversity to a broader extent than previously thought...|$|R

The dynamics of the size distribution is governed by the McKendrick equations. An existence/uniqueness theorem for this equation is proved using an equivalent pair of partial and ordinary differential equations.

5|$|The mallard is {{omnivorous}} {{and very}} flexible in its choice of food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including {{the stage of}} the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and interspecific and <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition.</b> The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods, invertebrates (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, worms, many varieties of seeds and plant matter, and roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird's diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers, {{but have not}} been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps {{the result of the}} physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.|$|E
25|$|The {{major impact}} of <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> is reduced {{population}} growth rates as population density increases. When resources are infinite, <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> {{does not occur}} and populations can grow exponentially. Exponential population growth is exceedingly rare, but has been documented, most notably in humans since 1900. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations in Kruger National Park (South Africa) also grew exponentially in the mid-1900s after strict poaching controls were put in place.|$|E
40|$|Balancedness among species {{interactions}} may be {{an important}} key to understand species biodiversity. Biodiversity among species is usually promoted by competitions which can occur between two different species or among the same species. In this paper, we investigate how symmetry breaking of interspecific competitions can affect biodiversity on cyclic structured three species which may compete with themselves. From theoretical and numerical results of the deterministic system, we found that the symmetry breaking of interspecific competitions on the self-competitive species system can lead the emergence of new survival states in which are stable. Further, we figured out that these diverse survival states can be influenced by the moderate balance between interspecific and <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions</b> which is uncovered numerically...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of size, sex and {{season on the}} feeding regime of S. membranaceus were examined {{over a period of}} 24 months in Jebba Lake, Nigeria using frequency of occurrence, numerical, gravimetric and index of Relative Importance (RI) methods. Dietary composition and feeding intensity were sex dependent. RI established that there was a progression from a detritivorous diet in fish below 20 cm Standard Length (SL), through a transitional planktivorous phase (20 - 27 cm, SL), to a predominantly molluscivorous/insectivorous diet in fish above 27 cm SL; thus indicating a switch from a relatively passive filter-feeding habit when young to an active predatory habit at adult stage. Food preference also varied with season hence <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions</b> were low. Abundant food and ability to evolve trophic strategies that ensure optimum foraging in spite of seasonal changes enable S. membranaceus to maintain its overwhelming prominence and wide distribution in Jebba Lake...|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of species diversity {{is a central}} focus in ecology. It is not rare to observe more species {{than the number of}} limiting resources, especially in plankton communities. However, such high species diversity is hard to achieve in theory under the competitive exclusion principles, known as the plankton paradox. Previous studies often focus on the coexistence of predefined species and ignore the fact that species can evolve. We model multi-resource competitions using evolutionary games, where the number of species fluctuates under extinction and the appearance of new species. The interspecific and <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions</b> are captured by a dynamical payoff matrix, which has a size of the number of species. The competition strength (payoff entries) is obtained from comparing the capability of species in consuming resources, which can change over time. This allows for the robust coexistence {{of a large number of}} species, providing a possible solution to the plankton paradox...|$|R

40|$|Strains of D. melanogaster, {{representing}} {{a range of}} genetic diversity, were systematically subjected to each of several techniques that have been devised to assess total or net fitness. All of these techniques operationally define fitness in terms of reproductive success under competitive conditions. For the set of strains tested, an excellent correlation was obtained between the competitive indices produced by two single-generation <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions,</b> despite fundamental differences in the strains used as competitive standards. The results of two interspecific tests were also correlated, but the intraspecific vs. interspecific test result comparisons ranged from highly significant to nonsignificant correlations. For the fitness estimates, the overall variances produced by the intraspecific tests were greater than those obtained in the interspecific competitions. No significant correlations {{were found between the}} results of a long-term (multi-generation) competitive assessment of fitness and any of the single-generation tests. Therefore, although all of these tests refer to a net parameter called "fitness", they are clearly not all measuring the same thing.

40|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{relationship between}} development and other life-history parameters among anthropoid primates. Smaller-bodied anthropoids tend to mature {{more rapidly than}} do larger-bodied species. Among anthropoids of similar body sizes, folivorous species tend to grow and mature more quickly than do frugivorous species, thus attaining adult body size at an earlier age. This pattern conforms to the expectations of Janson and van Schaik 2 ̆ 7 s “ecological risk aversion hypothesis,” which predicts that rates of growth and maturation should vary in inverse relation to the intensity of <b>intraspecific</b> feeding <b>competition.</b> According to the ecological risk aversion hypothesis (RAH), species experiencing high <b>intraspecific</b> feeding <b>competition</b> will grow and mature slowly {{to reduce the risk}} of mortality due to food shortages. Species experiencing low levels of <b>intraspecific</b> feeding <b>competition</b> will shorten the juvenile period to reduce the overall duration of this high-risk portion of the life cycle. This paper focuses on development and maturation in lemurs. We show that folivorous lemurs (such as indriids) grow and mature more slowly than like-sized frugivorous lemurs (e. g., most lemurids), but tend to exhibit faster dental development. Their dental developmental schedules are accelerated on an absolute scale, relative to craniofacial growth, and relative to particular life-history landmarks, such as weaning. Dental development has a strong phylogenetic component: even those lemurids that consume substantial amounts of foliage have slower dental development than those indriids that consume substantial amounts of fruit. Implications of these results for the RAH are discussed, and an explanation for this hypothesis 2 ̆ 7 failure to predict lemur growth schedules is offered. We propose that the differing developmental schedules of folivorous and frugivorous lemurs may reflect different solutions to the ecological problem of environmental instability: some rely on a strategy of low maternal input and slow returns, while others rely on a strategy of high maternal input and fast returns...|$|R
30|$|Seed mixes were {{rudimentary}} {{and much}} less diverse in 1977. The emphasis was on commercially available seed and quick-establishing plants with little understanding or regard to inter- and <b>intraspecific</b> species <b>competition.</b> Ecological diversity, longevity and wildlife habitat value were often secondary considerations. Species such as crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) and smooth brome (Bromus inermis) (often used for pasture grass) were commonly used in reclamation but are now considered invasive and thus undesirable. Commonly seeded legumes were also agriculturally-based, i.e., alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis).|$|R
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. <b>Intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less favored by that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{interspecific}} competition {{occurs when}} members of different species compete for a shared resource.

Each fungus was inoculated alone or in combination {{with one of the}} other five fungi in various proportions into rice plants under experimental conditions. Leaves developing lesions were harvested and incubated in a moist chamber. The yield of each fungus was its conidial production on the rice leaves. The artificial inoculations indicated that interactions between the pathogens in the mixture could be beneficial, antagonistic, or null. Interspecific interaction (i. e. antagonism) occurred in the majority of paired combinations (H. oryzae + P. oryzae; H. sativum + H. spiciferum, H. australiensis, C. lunata or P. oryzae; H. australiensis + H. spiciferum, C. lunata or P. oryzae; and P. oryzae + C. lunata). The relative yield total (RYT) lines were significantly lower than the expected value, which is 1. The RYT lines were concave upward, revealing a beneficial effect of one or both pathogens on the other, when H. oryzae was in mixture with H. sativum or H. spiciferum. A null effect between fungi occurred in four combinations (H. oryzae + H. australiensis or C. lunata; H. spiciferum + C. lunata; and P. oryzae + H. spiciferum) showing that with these combinations inter- and <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competitions</b> were equal in intensity.

25|$|For {{competing}} species {{within the}} same community to coexist, they have to meet one fundamental requirement: the impact of competition from a species on itself must exceed its competitive impact on other species. In other words, <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition</b> must exceed interspecific competition. For example, jackrabbits {{living in the same}} area compete for food and nesting grounds. Such competition {{within the same}} species is called <b>intraspecific</b> <b>competition,</b> which limits the growth of the species itself. Members from different species can also compete. For instance, jackrabbits and cottontail rabbits also compete for food and nesting grounds. Competition between different species is called interspecific competition, which limits the growth of other species. Stable coexistence occurs when any one species in the community limits its own growth more strongly than the growth of others.|$|E

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{risk assessment}} of pesticides is generally based on toxicity {{data obtained from}} single-species laboratory experiments and {{does not take into}} account ecological interactions such as <b>competition</b> or predation. <b>Intraspecific</b> and interspecific <b>competition</b> are expected to result in additional stress and might increase the sensitivity of aquatic populations to pesticide contamination. To test this hypothesis, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the population dynamics of the micro-crustacean Daphnia magna under different levels of <b>intraspecific</b> and interspecific <b>competition</b> for an algal food resource, using the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as competing species. The experiments were performed in glass jars with three different carbendazim concentrations (i. e., 50, 100 and 150 µg/L), and had a duration of 25 days, with a 4 -day pre-treatment period in which competition was allowed to take place and a 21 -day exposure period. The endpoints evaluated were D. magna total population abundance and population structure. Results of these experiments show that competition stress on its own had a significant influence on shaping D. magna population’s structure, however, a different response was observed in the <b>intraspecific</b> and interspecific <b>competition</b> experiments. The use of a 4 -day pre-treatment period in the intraspecific experiment already led to an absence of interactive effects due to the quick abundance confluence between the different intraspecific treatments, thus not allowing the observation of interactive effects between competition and carbendazim stress. Results of the interspecific competition experiment showed that rotifers were quickly outcompeted by D. magna and that D. magna even profited from the rotifer presence through exploitative competition, which alleviated the original stress caused by the algal resource limitation. These experiments suggest that competition interactions play an important role in defining population-level effects of pesticides in a more complex way than was hypothesized (“increasing competition leading to a sensitivity increase”), as the interspecific experiment showed. Therefore, these should be taken into account in the extrapolation of single-species toxicity data to protect higher levels of biological organization. </p...|$|R
