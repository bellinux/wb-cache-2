Based on the comparative studies of the phase graph and the correlation dimension of the vibration signals under normal condition, outer peeling fault condition and rolling element <b>electric</b> <b>erosion</b> fault condition, the following conclusions are shown: (1) The dynamical behavior of the wheelset bearing with fault is complicated than of the normal condition. (2) The correlation dimension of wheelset bearing is different under normal, outer peeling fault and rolling element <b>electric</b> <b>erosion</b> fault conditions.

While the synthesis of monocrystalline thin films is well-documented, common synthesis processes for titanium nitride nanoparticles yield only polycrystalline, spherically-shaped powders.

40|$|Ball {{bearings}} can {{be affected}} by several damage typologies. Surface flaws on inner and outer races or on rolling elements are the main causes of failure.

40|$|The paper shows {{results of}} the study into {{influence}} of chemical composition and consolidation process conditions on changes of physical and electrical properties of silver-based composites used in production of electric contacts. The investigations addressed influence of content of zinc oxide (ZnO) and modifying additions in a form of silver tungstate (Ag 2 WO 4) and silver molybdate (Ag 2 MoO 4) on changes in density, porosity and electrical conductivity. Density of the produced compacts was established by geometric method. The results of density measurements were used in determination of total porosity of sinters. Also arc erosion was examined to determine applicability of the produced composites for production of <b>electric</b> contacts. The <b>erosion</b> was measured as mass loss of individual materials after specific number of connections. The studies were conducted at current intensity of 10 A and voltage of 500 V. The scope of the studies covered also evaluation of kinetics of sintering of the examined composites and determination of the mechanisms of mass transport in the process. Studies into kinetics of sintering were conducted in the air atmosphere at constant temperature of 900 ◦C. Production of the examined composite materials consisted of mechanical synthesis of powders of silver, zinc oxide and silver tungstate and molybdate, and then their consolidation by two-sided pressing and subsequent sintering. In cold pressing various pressures were applied 200, 300 and 400 MPa. Sintering was performed with a partial participation of liquid phase in temperature of 900 ◦C.

40|$|Quality of Life Plus {{has been}} {{improving}} {{the lives of}} many wounded servicemen and first responders around the country. Its mission is to foster and generate innovations to aid and {{improve the quality of life}} for those injured in the line of duty. This project is the fifth iteration of designing a prosthetic hand for an active duty Navy SEAL. The first iterations have been myoelectric systems where sensors are attached to the user’s muscles to actuate the prosthetic. However, the most recent has been a purely mechanical system, and was shoulder actuated. The design was more robust, it was lightweight compared to the first iterations, and it is also waterproof. This project is made out of Titanium 6 AL- 4 V, which offers a great strength-to-weight ratio, is robust, reliable and easy to assemble. This project took a different avenue of approach when manufacturing the prosthetic hand. The vast majority of the hand was 3 D-printed using the latest technology of direct metal laser sintering. The material chosen for this device is Ti 6 - 4, where it was printed and donated by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory located in Livermore, CA. Most of the hardware was made out of stainless steel and was purchased from McMaster Carr, and the Sure-Lok was obtained from a previous iteration. The prosthetic hand will include shock cord, non-flexible cable to withstand up to 200 lbs. per finger and a break cable that will interlock the fingers, palm and gantlet sub systems of the prosthetic. The device will also include a silicon sleeve with an embedded plate that will attach to the palm. The sleeve will attach via suction to the users residual and has been proven to work as he currently uses a similar device with a purely aesthetic hand. This prosthetic was designed by analyzing the Raptor Hand created by e-Nable, an organization that helps small children by creating prosthetic hands that can be easily printed and assembled. In order to actuate our prosthetic, the user will need sufficient wrist movement and strength for proper function. Since our client has full mobility of his wrist, this will be the best method. The prosthetic uses a Sure-Lok to allow the user to maintain a grip without applying any excess force. The non-flexible cable will maintain a tension that will allow the user to grip and hold heavy items over a long period of time. Once the Sure-Lok is not active, the flexible cord will spring the fingers back into the initial position. The thumb is not connected to any cables and is spring loaded to allow the user to manually place the thumb in three different positions. During the initial inspection of the titanium parts received, the team noticed that the support material was still intact and needed to be removed. This will delay the assembly and testing of the titanium prototype. The support material will be removed via Electric Discharge Machining (EDM), which is a controlled process that is used to remove metal by <b>electric</b> spark <b>erosion.</b> The <b>electric</b> spark is used as the cutting tool to erode the work piece to the desired surface finish. Once completed, the hand will be assembled and tested and will be sent to the client’s prosthetist to implement the silicon sleeve. Furthermore, our donor has agreed to reprint the prosthetic to allow any improvements of the design. This will be done towards the end of the summer. Several of our team members will remain in contact with the sponsor and LLNL to oversee the completion of this design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. All {{electrical}} motor or generator bearings can potential suffers from <b>electric</b> <b>erosion.</b> Unfortunately, problems can start {{after just a}} few months of running a new electric motor or generator. From visual inspection, {{it was found that the}} failure happened on the raceway surface in equal spacing. There may be many reasons for this – heavier loading than has been anticipated, inadequate or unsuitable lubrication, careless handling, ineffective sealing, or fits that are too tight, with resultant insufficient internal bearing clearance. Each of these factors produces its own particular type of damage and leaves its own special imprint on the bearing. Consequently, by examining a damaged bearing such as visual inspection, it is possible, in the majority of cases, to form an opinion on the cause of the damage and to take the requisite action to prevent a recurrence...|$|E
