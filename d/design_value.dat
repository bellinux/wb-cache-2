The development of <b>design</b> <b>values</b> in contemporary architecture by tracking traditional <b>design</b> <b>values</b> in architecture paves the way for arguments concerning the implementation of authentic Malay traditional house <b>design</b> <b>values</b> in contemporary Malay houses. In addition, it is hypothesized that the Malay traditional houses theoretically provide a constructive innovative framework for the design performance of the contemporary Malay house. In this research, data was compiled through field observation and documentary review. The evidence revealed that Malay traditional houses convey a concrete message of richness encompassing architectural <b>design</b> <b>values</b> and theoretical propositions. The credibility of the results was improved and confirmed by a confluence of evidence via a confirmation process. The findings suggested that there is a rich source of subjective support, lending proof to the premise of the research investigation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the <b>design</b> <b>values</b> of digital {{role-playing}} games. <b>Design</b> <b>values</b> is an underresearched topic whereas digital role-playing games has become a chart-topping genre. <b>Design</b> <b>values</b> refer to designers' individual values and principles that guide the design process and so take part in shaping its outcome. With their flexible rules and lack of quantifiable outcomes, role-playing games are an exception among games. Role-playing games have had {{to adapt to the}} digital medium and they may be closer to digital games and their conventions than their tabletop origins, but they offer experiences distinctive enough to warrant their own genre in digital gaming. The goal {{of this study was to}} discover <b>design</b> <b>values</b> from digital role-playing game postmortems to see what <b>values</b> drove their <b>design</b> decisions. The postmortems were gathered from an online publication, Gamasutra, and they covered 16 digital roleplaying games within 15 years. Using content analysis and affinity diagram, the study identified six value categories ranging from pure <b>design</b> <b>values</b> to more general game development values. Player expression focused on strengthening the experience that players' characters are their own and that the game world reflects their actions. Player engagement saw value in broad appeal, cooperation, simple controls, exploration, immersion and clear goals that all provide to attaining players and keeping them engaged with the game. Gameplay priorization put an emphasis on gameplay and its seamless integration with other game elements. Open <b>design</b> <b>valued</b> openness to <b>design</b> input in a collaborative environment. Restrained design emphasized simplicity and quality. Development management focused on issues arising from leadership, ambition, adaptability, efficiency and team spirit...|$|R
