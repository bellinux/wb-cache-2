500|$|In 2009, she {{appeared}} in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented {{that part of what}} was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare". Aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to Aguilera's own song [...] "Beautiful", the composition of [...] "Blank Page" [...] was subject to critique by Jim Farber writing for New York Daily News. He criticised the song for replicating the structure and lyrical content of [...] "Someone Like You", a song performed by English singer-songwriter Adele: ...|$|E
2500|$|Honey, the way {{you play}} guitar makes me feel so... makes me feel so...masochistic. The way you go down low deep into the neck... and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything...</b> and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> And Patty Hearst, you {{standing}} {{there in front of}} the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread. I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty?

2500|$|When Pérez {{offered him}} the {{position}} of [...] "drug czar", Halvorssen says he accepted because, [...] "I went to a detoxification clinic in the US and I was so appalled by what I saw there that I resolved that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> I could to fight drug trafficking." [...] According to Isabel Hilton, writing in the British edition of Gentleman's Quarterly (GQ), observers say that Pérez may even have offered Halvorssen the job as a necessary matching gesture when US president George H. W. Bush appointed William Bennett as his Director of National Drug Control Policy, thinking that Halvorssen was still drinking and wouldn't cause problems. [...] Halvorssen performed his duties well, deciding to use his worldwide contacts and intelligence connections to detail the extent of Venezuela's role in the drug world. [...] Halvorssen believed that Pérez wasn't responding to his reports on drug trafficking and money laundering and approached his ally, Venezuelan Senator Cristobal Fernandez Daló. [...] In 1992, he was appointed special overseas investigator of an Anti-Money-Laundering Commission by the Venezuelan Senate. [...] He was a liaison between law enforcement agencies around the world, working on drug and money-laundering cases.|$|E
