40|$|Abstract: Bimetallic welds {{made between}} {{ferritic}} steels and {{austenitic stainless steels}} are conventionally fabricated using arc welding procedures such as Tungsten Inert Gas, Metal Inert Gas, Shielded Metal Arc Welding and Submerged Arc Welding. However friction welding provides a new and unique solid state approach for joining many similar and dissimilar materials, {{which may not be}} possible to join by other welding techniques available without adding any <b>external</b> <b>filler</b> metal. This approach is mostly used in joining of dissimilar materials. The reason for increased utility being the absence of any <b>external</b> <b>filler</b> material which may otherwise add to the heterogeneity of the weld structure. In this paper, the fabrication and effect of friction welding parameters on mechanical-micro structural changes of bimetallic weld joints has been discussed. An attempt has also been made to relate the effect of friction welding parameters on the peak temperature values taken near faying surface and micro hardness changes measured in various zones of weld...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — {{over the}} last few years a lot of {{research}} has been going on in the area of Friction Stir Welding and Friction Stir Processing (FSP). FSP has developed as a new processing technique to improve the surface characteristics of materials especially Aluminium. In this research we have tried to improve the surface properties, mainly corrosion resistance of Aluminium alloy AA 6061 by using an <b>external</b> <b>filler</b> plate during the FSP. A thin sheet of commercial Aluminium was coated on the AA 6061 base plate with the help of FSP technique. Different combinations of process parameters like tool speed and plunge depth along with various external cooling modes and backing plates were tested to optimize the process. FSP was also carried out on weld zones of fusion welded samples. Later the processed samples were subjected to various tests like salt spray corrosion test, grain size measurement etc. The test results show that the coating of commercial Aluminium plate did improve the corrosion resistance considerably...|$|E
50|$|At {{the front}} of the car a new bumper removed the original’s fake central grille and also {{replaced}} the Ferrari prancing horse emblem. The side intake cooling ducts were enlarged and the engine cover was replaced with a glass item allowing a view of the V8 engine. A new triple tail-light arrangement and an electronically operated spoiler were added. A double bubble roof was added, the idea being that Zagato could lower the roofline of a car, but retain enough headroom for each occupant. Other modifications included custom OZ Racing alloy wheels, <b>external</b> fuel <b>filler</b> caps and a completely reworked interior including a three-inch rear view screen and suede upholstery. Zagato initially announced a production run of 22 examples, but only 10 or 12 cars were made.|$|R
50|$|In Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, Herbie {{is again}} fitted with wide racing wheels (Goodyear GT radials), {{and has an}} <b>external</b> fuel <b>filler</b> cap. Post-1967 Beetles did feature the fuel tank {{accessible}} {{on the right side}} behind the fender; the silver cap itself, however, was fake and added for the film's storyline. With the addition of the fuel filler, the antenna is now a retractable unit fitted on the front cowling, near the windshield wipers. He has a roll cage again, and he has Monte Carlo racing stickers on his windows (one on the front window, two on the left back window, and one on the rear window). Herbie still sports the hood-mounted Carello fog light with an added black cover sporting the company name. He now has gray bucket seats instead of stitched seats. Throughout this film, Herbie has an asymmetrical door mirror. There were a total of 9 VWs used in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo. Many of these cars were recycled for use in Herbie Goes Bananas.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1959 {{significant}} {{styling and}} technical refinements {{gave rise to}} the 356 B (a T5 body type). The mid-1962 356 B model was changed to the T6 body type (twin engine lid grilles, an <b>external</b> fuel <b>filler</b> in the right front wing/fender and a larger rear window in the coupé). The Porsche factory did not call attention to these quite visible changes with a different model designation. However, when the T6 got disc brakes, with no other visible alterations, they called it the model C, or the SC when it had the optional extra powerful engine. A unique [...] "Karmann hardtop" [...] or [...] "notchback" [...] 356 B model was produced in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 production run (T5) was essentially a cabriolet body with the optional steel cabriolet hardtop welded in place. The 1962 line (T6 production) was a very different design in that the new T6 notchback coupé body did not start life as a cabriolet, but with its own production design—In essence, part cabriolet rear end design, part T6 coupé windshield frame, unique hard top. Both years of these unique cars have taken the name [...] "Karmann notchback".|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is student housing in Brno, {{which is in the}} {{administrative}} area of Pole. The building has four floors above ground and it is mounted on slightly sloping land. The main entrance is a follow-up to the entrance hall, where is the reception with twostaircases, which are on north side. There is the technical part of the building on the first side, lodging for 2 personswith reduced mobility, studyroom, game room and grillbar. The remaining three floors are designed as a cellular system of accommodation for university students. Every unit of them is designed for four students. The every unit of them has a hall, bathroom, toilet and kitchen. Total capacity is 98 students. The bearing system of the building is monolithic concrete skeleton with <b>filler</b> <b>external</b> walls, which are made of aerated concrete blocks. The building is coveredby flat single roof.

5000|$|As {{the film}} progresses, two thieves, Max (Bernard Fox) and Quincey (Roy Kinnear), steal the famous Étoile de Joie (French for [...] "Star of Joy") diamond and cleverly hide it in Herbie's fuel tank (Herbie was fitted with an <b>external</b> fuel <b>filler</b> cap for this film - a 1963 Beetle's cap {{actually}} being {{inside the front}} luggage compartment) {{in order to avoid}} being captured by a swarm of searching policemen. But little did they know that they picked the wrong car to hide it in, because of one car that was alive and had a mind of its own. That causes them to blow every chance they get in getting back the diamond they hid in him. Because of this, and on a count of an attempt where they at one point tried to threaten Jim and Wheely at gunpoint to relinquish the car to them, an encounter from which Herbie managed to escape, and thanks to a misunderstood conclusion thereafter that Diane would have tried to mastermind the whole event. Subsequently, Herbie is placed under the protection of the French police. It is also revealed not too far in that Inspector Bouchet (Jacques Marin), also known as [...] "Double X" [...] especially as a code name to the thieves, is the mastermind behind the museum robbery, though the fact of his scheme is revealed {{near the end of the}} movie. It is the eager, and somewhat knee-jerk and unpunctual young detective Fontenoy (Xavier Saint-Macary), of whom the Inspector is the superior officer, who unravels the mystery of L'Étoile de Joie, and has Bouchet clapped in handcuffs. All the way through the plot, Inspector Bouchet appears to have an annoyance and sour attitude towards Detective Fontenoy. The reasons are never plain, but some of them could be due to things that the Inspector tells the Head Official of Monaco about the detective when he tries to persuade him to cancel out a diamond search that the detective ordered for.|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} process that pan be used to join {{materials}} without melting. The process was invented by The Welding Institute (TWI), Cambridge, England. Friction stir welding exhibits several advantages over fusion welding in that it produces welds with fewer defects and higher joint efficiency and is capable of joining alloys that are generally considered non-weldable with a fusion weld process. In 1994, NASA-Marshall began collaborating with TWI to transform FSW from a laboratory curiosity to a viable metal joining process suitable for manufacturing hardware. While teamed with TWI, NASA-Marshall began its own FSW research and development effort to investigate possible aerospace applications for the FSW process. The work involved nearly all aspects of FSW development, including process modeling, scale-up issues, applications to advanced materials and development of tooling to use FSW on components of the Space Shuttle with particular emphasis on aluminum tanks. The friction stir welding process involves spinning a pin-tool at an appropriate speed, plunging it into the base metal pieces to be joined, and then translating it along the joint of the work pieces. In aluminum alloys the rotating speed typically ranges from 200 to 400 revolutions per minute and the translation speed is approximately two to five inches per minute. The pin-tool is inserted at a small lead angle from the axis normal to the work piece and requires significant loading along the axis of the tool. An anvil or reaction structure is required behind the welded material to react the load along the axis of the pin tool. The process requires no <b>external</b> heat input, <b>filler</b> material, protective shielding gas or inert atmosphere typical of fusion weld processes. The FSW solid-state weld process has resulted in aluminum welds with significantly higher strengths, higher joint efficiencies and fewer defects than fusion welds used to join similar alloys...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes, when {{we visit}} a medieval temple and we observe the ribbed vaults that are {{developed}} on our heads, it costs certain effort {{to suppose that}} such a complex disposition only {{turns out to be}} an elaborated reinforcement stone roof, since on them there is willing a cover (usually wooden) that solves the contact with the external weather. Most of the existent bibliography, treats this way the topic. Therefore, when we are carried out predictions on the mechanical behaviour, the fundamental load is the dead load of the vault. However, there are places where the situation is different. The internal surface of the vaults takes place with similar geometries to those already known, but have more than enough its <b>external</b> surface a <b>filler</b> it is located on the one that a roof is built (sometimes passable). This inclusion has an enormous impact in the behaviour of the vault (mechanic, water, thermal changes, etc [...] .). And on the other hand, when the covers are observed they are manifested as non-concluded. To contribute to conclude them and to preserve them in the time is the fundamental objective of this article. En ocasiones, cuando se visita un templo medieval y se observa el despliegue de formas de crucer&# 237;a que se desarrolla sobre nuestras cabezas, cuesta cierto esfuerzo suponer que una disposici&# 243;n tan compleja s&# 243;lo resulte ser un elaborado falso techo de piedra, ya que sobre ellos hay dispuesta una cubierta (normalmente de madera) que resuelve el contacto con el ambiente exterior. La mayor parte de la bibliograf&# 237;a existente, trata el tema as&# 237;. Por lo tanto, cuando se realizan predicciones sobre el comportamiento mec&# 225;nico, la carga fundamental es el peso propio de la b&# 243;veda. Sin embargo, hay lugares en donde la situaci&# 243;n es distinta. El intrad&# 243;s de las b&# 243;vedas se produce con geometr&# 237;as similares a las ya conocidas, pero sobre su trasd&# 243;s se localiza un relleno sobre el que se construye una azotea (a veces transitable). Esta inclusi&# 243;n tiene un impacto enorme en el comportamiento de la b&# 243;veda (mec&# 225;nico, estanqueidad, cambios t&# 233;rmicos, etc [...] .).
