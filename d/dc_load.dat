Fifteen patients with metastatic melanoma (stage III or IV) received four subcutaneous, intradermal, and intranodal vaccinations of both <b>DC</b> <b>loaded</b> with tumor cell lysate and <b>DC</b> <b>loaded</b> with hepatitis B surface protein (HBs) and/or tetanus toxoid (TT).

Four out of nine patients who received the full treatment survived for more than 20 months. Two patients showed signs of clinical response and received 3 additional doses of vaccine: one patient showed regression of in-transit metastases leading to complete remission. Eighteen months later, the patient was still free of disease. The second patient experienced stabilization of lung metastases for approximately 10 months.

5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the <b>DC</b> <b>load</b> line, an AC load line can be drawn through the Q point. The AC load line is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC load line depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC load lines, that vary from the <b>DC</b> <b>load</b> line (at low frequency) to a limiting AC load line, all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}. This limiting load line, generally referred to as the AC load line, is the load line of the circuit at [...] "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.|$|E

Because capacitor C1 blocks direct current (DC), the average current through it (IC1) is zero, making inductor L2 the only source of <b>DC</b> <b>load</b> current. Therefore, the average current through inductor L2 (IL2) {{is the same as the}} average load current and hence independent of the input voltage.|$|E

Pioneered by UK based IMO Precision Controls Ltd, and later adopted by other manufacturers in this marketplace such as Santon and ABB, the isolator design incorporates a user independent switching action so as the handle is moved, it interacts with a spring mechanism which, upon reaching a set point, causes the contacts to [...] "SNAP" [...] over, thereby ensuring a very fast break/make action.

For each AC phase, a wire from each end of that phase winding is connected to a separate anode [...] "arm" [...] on the mercury-arc rectifier. When the voltage at each anode becomes positive, it will begin to conduct through the mercury vapor from the cathode. As the anodes of each AC phase are fed from opposite ends of the centre tapped transformer winding, one will always be positive with respect to the center tap and both halves of the AC Waveform will cause current to flow in one direction only through the load. This rectification of the whole AC waveform is thus called {{full-wave rectification}}.|$|E

50|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to a filter, and essential if the <b>DC</b> <b>load</b> requires very low ripple voltage, is to follow the reservoir capacitor with an active voltage regulator circuit. The reservoir capacitor must {{be large enough to}} prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage. The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics. It would be possible to use a smaller reservoir capacitor (these can be large on high-current power supplies) and then apply some filtering as well as the regulator, {{but this is not a}} common strategy. The extreme of this approach is to dispense with the reservoir capacitor altogether and put the rectified waveform straight into a choke-input filter. The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother and consequently the rectifier no longer has to deal with the current as a large current pulse, but instead the current delivery is spread over the entire cycle. The disadvantage, apart from extra size and weight, is that the voltage output is much lower - approximately the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak.|$|E
5000|$|However, most commercially {{available}} [...] "electronic DC loads" [...] or [...] "programmable DC loads" [...] {{on the market}} cannot source power, since by being DC loads, by strict definition, {{they do not need}} to. (They are not power supplies), being only able to absorb power (sinking current from a positive voltage, or sourcing to a negative voltage). These most commonly use one transistor/FET, or an array of parallel connected transistors/FETs for more current handling, to act as a variable resistor. Internal circuitry in the equipment monitors the actual current through the transistor/FET, compares it to a user-programmed desired current, and through an error amplifier changes the drive voltage to the transistor/FET to dynamically change its resistance. This 'negative feedback' results in the actual current always matching the programmed desired current, regardless of other changes in the supplied voltage or other variables. Of course, if the power source is not able to supply the desired amount of current, the <b>DC</b> <b>load</b> equipment cannot furnish the difference; it can restrict current to a level, but it cannot boost current to a higher level. Most commercial DC loads are equipped with microprocessor front end circuits that allow the user to not only program a desired current through the load ('constant current' or CC), but the user can alternatively program the load to have a constant resistance (CR) or constant power dissipation (CP).|$|E
50|$|Many {{alternative}} solutions, {{particularly those}} based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use bridge contacts, have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is {{directly linked to}} the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce arcing times of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or sooting caused by arcing {{is likely to have}} a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary knife contact mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per contact set. As <b>DC</b> <b>load</b> switching creates electrical arcing, the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the arcing points and contact surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per pole is kept as low as possible, and consistent {{over the life of the}} product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.|$|E
