50|$|Surface {{plates were}} {{traditionally}} made by scraping. Three raw (plates {{that have been}} `seasoned` or residual stress relieved and received suitable surface treatments, but unfinished) cast surface plates, a <b>flat</b> <b>scraper</b> (as pictured {{at the top of}} the image) and a quantity of bearing blue (or Red Lead) were all that was required in the way of tools.|$|E
50|$|Charles B. Brooks, an African American {{man from}} Newark, New Jersey, invented the U.S.' first {{self-propelled}} street sweeper truck. Brooks' patent was approved on March 17, 1896; his application for the patent had been filed on April 20, 1895. His street sweeper had a truck-like frame mounted on axles supported by wheels. There are drive-wheels for the sweeping, elevator mechanisms, and an endless chain that travels around a sprocket-wheel and travels {{up to an}} additional sprocket-wheel. The patent drawings go on to explain the complete composition of the invention. The truck had brushes attached to the front fender which would revolve. These revolving brushes could interchange with a <b>flat</b> <b>scraper</b> for use on snow and ice.|$|E
50|$|Hermel IV or Wadi el Joz is a {{collection}} of megaliths that are 1.5 km east of Hermel Attika, southeast of Hermel on dry terraces that slope towards the channel of the Orontes. It was found by Mohammed Hamadé, surveyed by P. Billaux and published by Maurice Tallon in 1959. A number of tumuli were discovered in this area which covered chambers on rectangular foundation platforms. They were usually orientated east to west with some remnants of walls constructed of megalithic stones. Maurice Tallon made collectins of flint and pottery from the area dating to various periods. These included an incised sherd and a tanged scraper from the very earliest Neolithic times, an Early Bronze Age <b>flat</b> <b>scraper</b> along with later Middle Bronze Age and Iron Age material.|$|E
50|$|A grindometer is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the {{particle}} size of suspensions, typically inks such as those used in printing, or paints. It consists of a steel block with a channel of varying depth machined into it, starting at a convenient depth for the type of suspension to be measured, and becoming shallower until it ends flush with the block's surface. The depth of the groove is marked off on a graduated scale next to it. The suspension to be tested is poured into the deep end of the groove, and scraped towards the shallow end with a <b>flat</b> metal <b>scraper.</b> At the point where the depth of the groove equals the largest particles in the suspension, irregularities (for example pinholes in an ink sample) will become visible.|$|R
40|$|Traces of man {{dating from}} before the Neolithic period in Greece, even after the discoveries {{claimed to have been}} made by Markowitz in Megara and by Stampfuss in the Seidi-cave in Copais, were rather doubtful. Only after the revolutionary {{observations}} of Prof. Milojcic in Thessaly was the Palaeolithic age established for this region. Since then, more discoveries have been announced; in particular four stone implements from Elis were published as Palaeolithic and one single piece from Argolis has recently been published as belonging to the «Levalloisian type». This last implement was found by Jameson in Riniza, not far from Ermione and published by him and by P. Bialor in AJA 66 (1962) p. p. 181 - 182, with hgures and further bibliography. The question of the date of such flint or obsidian implements found {{on the surface of the}} soil, without stratigraphical evidence, still remains problematic. Typological examination is no definite guidance. In order to help establish a more accurate date, some implements from Kephallenia are published here for the first time, though their study is not yet ready. They are a characteristic series of flint implements and flakes (a few of obsidian), together with a flint arrow head. They were collected on the surface of the soil near Skala, on the South East coast of Kephallenia. The site is nearly two miles long and the implements are numerous. As flint is native in Kephallenia, there is no doubt that the implements were fabricated on the spot. There are several such places on other points of the Island and it seems that near Chaliotata (district of Same) the number of flint implements is still greater than at Skala. There are mainly four chief types: a long dagger of «stiletto» section (10 cm or even longer); broad and <b>flat</b> <b>scrapers</b> (sometimes almost 10 cm. long); triangular, very irregular «arrowheads»; and long or short flakes of triangular or trapezoid section. A characteristic of all these implements is that they are made by perpendicular percussion and that they show no further finishing by side-percussion on the edges. Only in rare examples and in the unique flint arrow-head have we the minute splitting to give the form desired. These facts as well as the absence of any Neolithic celt among the Kephallenian finds seem to indicate that the flint and obsidian implements in question are, at least partly, late and indeed very late. They may belong to an advanced stage of the bronze-period; they may have been reproduced owing to conservatisme in these remote Western districts, just as the hand-made plain pottery contemporaneous with the late Mycenaean ware. Similar flint and obsidian implements are known from other districts, particularly from Leucas. These last specimens, as far as found in the Choirospelia-cave, may be partly Neolithic, but the greater bulk was found in the Nidri-plain and in the Achaen tombs and surely belong to the 2 nd millenary. It is certain that the Kephallenian flint-industry exceeded local needs and that export was made, for instance to Leucas or to Elis. It may be, that this industry went as far as Lipari and that the obsidian found in Kephallenia was from Lipari rather than from Melos; but further search is needed before we can say anything more precise about this...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoral reefs are {{characterized}} by intense herbivory. Spatial patterns in herbivory [...] particularly along the depth gradient [...] influence the distribution and abundance of algae. Depth gradients in herbivorous reef fishes are generally assumed to be temporally stable, but this assumption has rarely been questioned. Here, we use underwater visual census and herbivore exclusion experiments to study the community composition and temporal patterns in habitat use by roving herbivorous fishes in an environment characterized by profound seasonal changes in algal biomass and distribution and extreme summer temperatures. Among the 18 species of roving herbivores recorded, parrotfishes were dominant in species richness and biomass, while regional endemic species represented 77 % of the total biomass. During most of the year, roving herbivores aggregate in the shallow reef zones and their biomass declines with depth. The herbivore community on the reef flat is distinct from that in deeper zones. The former is characterized by Siganus rivulatus, Acanthurus gahhm and Hipposcarus harid, while the deeper reef zones {{are characterized}} by S. ferrugineus, Chlorurus sordidus and Ctenochaetus striatus. In summer, the distinct community structures among reef zones are lost as reef flat herbivores tend to exploit deeper reef zones and some reef crest species venture on to the reef flat. This summer change in herbivore distribution is also reflected in reduced turf biomass and increased yield to herbivores in the deeper reef zones. Habitat use {{is related to the}} feeding mode such that browsers dominate the reef <b>flat</b> and <b>scrapers</b> the reef crest, while the seasonal changes correspond to changes in availability of targeted algal resources. These seasonal changes appear to be driven by the extreme temperatures in summer, reaching 36 °C on the shallow reef flat...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{emissions}} (NH 3 GHG) {{from four}} pig fattening rooms on slatted flooring with flat scraping and under-floor air evac uation were measured in three consecutive batches between May 2009 and June 2010 i n the experimental station of Crecom (France). Gas concentrations and ventilation rates were measured and recorded during 3 periods of 14 days during the bre eding period (day 7 to 21, 35 to 49 and 63 to 77). Gas concentrations were {{measured with a}} n infrared photoacoustic monitor (INNOVA 1412) in the room area. Manure was scrap ed once a day and stored in the breeding rooms for two weeks. Measured carbon emissions (C-CH 4 and C-CO 2) were validated by comparison with the C mass balanc e deficit, whereas measured nitrogen emissions (N- NH 3 and N-N 2 O) were not validated by comparison with the N mass balance deficit. Observed differences between measurement and mass balance deficits were explained by the samplin g point site for concentration measurements that was not representative of the exha ust air. With additional experiments, we demonstrated that ammonia concentrat ions measured in the exhausted air were 51 % higher than those measured in the room. Under-floor air evacuation combined with a <b>flat</b> <b>scraper</b> system enabl ed the reduction of ammonia concentrations {{in the room and}} improved air quality and the working environment. However, compared to a slurry storage system, a <b>flat</b> <b>scraper</b> system with manure stored in the room after scraping, reduces GHG emiss ions (N 2 O and CH 4) in the exhaust air, but can increase NH 3 emissions...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a microwear {{analysis}} of samples of fan scrapers and fan scrapers spalls from late Pottery Neolithic (PN) and Early Bronze Age (EBA) occupation layers at Ein Zippori, Lower Galilee, Israel are presented. The goal of the microwear analysis {{was to determine the}} function of the fan scrapers and compare the visible usewear on the scrapers found in late PN and EBA lithic assemblages. The results indicate that during both periods most of the fan scrapers were used to skin and butcher animals, while some were also used for hide processing and bone working. The working edges of the fan scrapers had sharp, moderate, or steep edge-angles, and different edges were used for different tasks. Edges with microwear from scraping meat, bone, and hides (including some hides that may have been treated with abrasives) had steep edge-angles, while there were moderate or sharp edge-angles on the edges of fan scrapers used for cutting. Two sub-types of fan <b>scrapers</b> were identified, <b>flat</b> cortex fan <b>scrapers</b> (FCFS), and cortical fan scrapers (CFS) with convex dorsal faces. The CFS were abundant in PN contexts, while the FCFS were more common in EBA layers. However both of the sub-types had similar microwear traces...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the ability of a single roll caster equipped with a scraper. The purpose of the development of the single roll caster equipped with a scraper is casting of the strip without centre line segregation and porosity and with sound free solidified surface. The single roll caster can cast the strip without the centre segregation and porosity. However, the conditions of the free solidified surface and the thickness distribution are not sound. The scraper was adopted in order to improve the free solidified surface. Investigation of the effect of the scraper and the properties of the roll cast strip is the purpose {{of this paper}}. Design/methodology/approach: A scraper was developed to improve the free solidified surface condition. The scraper scribed the semisolid metal on the free solidified surface to make the free solidified surface <b>flat.</b> The <b>scraper</b> was made from mild-steel-plate, and it was coated by the insulator sheet of 2 mm-thick. The scraper was pushed to free solidified surface by the constant load. Findings: The scraper was very useful to improve the free solidified surface. AA 5182 aluminium alloy strip could be cast at the speed up to 40 m/min. There was no centre segregation and porosity. There was no difference between the roll contact surface and the scribed surface. The mechanical properties of the roll cast strip were as same as those of strip made from D. C. cast slab. Hi-content Al-Mg alloy like Al- 10 mass%Mg, which cannot be cast into the strip by the twin roll caster without centre segregation, could be cast into the strip without defect. Research limitations/implications: Metal which was investigated was only aluminium alloy. It is not clear that this process is useful to other alloys like steel, copper et. al. Practical implications: This process may be able to be used instead of the D. C. casting and the twin roll casting. Especially, this caster is useful the strip casting of the Al-Mg alloy. Originality/value: The single roll caster equipped with a scraper is original development. This caster may be useful for aluminium and magnesium sheet making companies...|$|R
