5|$|A liberal, Anspach {{feared the}} {{weakness}} and rigidity {{of the government}} and therefore gave the work of covering the river to a private British company, the Belgian Public Works Company (the English name was used), which was created for the task. However, partway through construction, it was forced to relinquish control to the city of Brussels after an embezzlement scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2.5 million francs from the company. Anspach only barely kept <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> 1869 by-elections.|$|E
5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney in addition to <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off {{the floor of the}} Senate).|$|E

5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Vienna to his father. He {{set about}} using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 1969, Eduardo Mondlane {{was killed}} by {{explosives}} smuggled into his locale. Many sources state that, {{in an attempt to}} rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Dar es Salaam. Inside the parcel was a book containing an explosive device, which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 24 May 1984, Buendía left <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Mexico City and was walking to his car when a man shot him from behind several times, killing him on the scene. For over five years, the murder case remained unsolved and with several irregularities, including the loss of evidence. In 1989, {{several members of the}} extinct Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's top police force, were arrested for their involvement in the murder of Buendía. The murder case was closed after the perpetrators were arrested, but several journalists doubt the probe's results and believe that the masterminds behind Buendía's murder were never arrested.|$|E
5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report in <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{advocated}} {{within the}} NDRC {{for a comprehensive}} report to be {{released to the public}} following the weapon's first use. Vannevar Bush, who as civilian director of the OSRD oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant. Groves granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security-minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote {{what became known as the}} Smyth Report in <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Princeton's Palmer Laboratory, which later became the Frist Campus Center.|$|E

5|$|The AFL became {{involved}} in politics when seventeen soldiers launched a coup on April 12, 1980. The group {{was made up of}} Master Sergeant Samuel Doe, two staff sergeants, four sergeants, eight corporals, and two privates. They found President Tolbert sleeping in <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the Executive Mansion and there they killed him. While then-Sergeant Thomas Quiwonkpa led the plotters, it was the group led by Samuel Doe that found Tolbert in his office, and it was Doe, as a master sergeant the highest ranking of the group, who went on the radio the next day to announce the overthrow of the long-entrenched True Whig Party government.|$|E
5|$|The Army assumed {{responsibility}} for the Manhattan Project on 17 September 1942, with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., as director, although the Army did not formally take over the contracts with the University of California from the OSRD until 1 May 1943. Major Thomas T. Crenshaw, Jr., became California Area Engineer in August 1942, with Captain Harold A. Fidler, who soon replaced him, as his assistant. Crenshaw established <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the Donner Laboratory at the University of California. In September 1942, the S-1 Executive Committee recommended that a five-tank pilot plant be built along with a 200-tank section of a production plant.|$|E
