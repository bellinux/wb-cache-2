St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.|$|E

5000|$|The {{national}} dialect {{is known}} as American English, which itself consists of numerous regional dialects but has some shared unifying features that distinguish it from other national varieties of English. There are four large <b>dialect</b> <b>regions</b> in the United States—the North, the Midland, the South, and the West—and several smaller <b>dialect</b> <b>regions</b> {{such as those of}} New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. A standard dialect called [...] "General American" [...] (analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the English-speaking world), lacking the distinctive noticeable features of any particular region, is believed by some to exist as well; it is sometimes regionally associated with the vaguely-defined [...] "Midwest".|$|R
500|$|Gawain's trek {{leads him}} {{directly}} into {{the centre of the}} Pearl Poet's <b>dialect</b> <b>region,</b> where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott located the chapel ("two myle henne" [...] v1078) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park {{at the bottom of a}} valley ("bothm of the brem valay" [...] v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" [...] v2147) in an enormous fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" [...] v2182-83). Several have tried to replicate this expedition and others such as Michael Twomey have created a virtual tour of Gawain's journey entitled 'Travels with Sir Gawain' that include photographs of landscapes mentioned and particular views mentioned in the text.|$|E
500|$|The Chapel is {{considered}} by Gawain as an evil place: foreboding, [...] "the most accursed church", [...] "the place for the Devil to recite matins"; but when the mysterious Knight allows Gawain to live, Gawain immediately assumes the role of penitent to a priest or judge, as in a genuine church. The Green Chapel may also be related to tales of fairy hills or knolls of earlier Celtic literature. Some scholars have wondered whether [...] "Hautdesert" [...] refers to the Green Chapel, as it means [...] "High Hermitage"; but such a connection is doubted by most scholars. As {{to the location of}} the Chapel, in the Greene Knight poem, Sir Bredbeddle's living place is described as [...] "the castle of hutton", causing some scholars to suggest a connection with Hutton Manor House in Somerset. Gawain's journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's <b>dialect</b> <b>region,</b> where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, {{as it is in the}} writer's dialect area, and matches the land features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott for example located the chapel the knight searches for near ("two myle henne" [...] v1078) the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley ("bothm of the brem valay" [...] v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" [...] v2147) in a large fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" [...] v2182-83).|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} of Mexico uses Spanish for most official purposes, {{but in terms}} of legislation its status is not that of an official language. The Law of Linguistic Rights establishes Spanish as one of the country's national languages, along with 68 distinct indigenous languages (from seven different families, and other four isolated languages). The law, promulgated in 2003, requires the state to offer all of its services to its indigenous citizens in their mother tongues, but in practice this is not yet the case. Note that the actual number of spoken languages in Mexico is much higher than the 68 groups mentioned here; National Institute of Indigenous Languages (INALI) identifies only macro-languages and distinct ethnic groups for the purposes of political classification.

A multi-talker multi-dialect {{corpus of}} spoken American English has been {{designed}} to provide researchers who are interested in variation and variability with a large number of speech samples from twenty talkers in each of four cities located in phonologically distinct <b>dialect</b> <b>regions</b> of the United States: West (Los Angeles), South (Atlanta), Midland (Indianapolis), and Northern Cities (Chicago). The speech samples to be collected include word-length, sentence-length, and paragraph-length utterances, and have been designed to elicit phonological forms that differentiate the four regions. Once collected, these materials can be used for a range of perceptual and acoustic studies investigating the perception and production of dialect variation in the United States. Objectives of the Corpus The purpose of this project is to create a speech corpus containing recordings from a large number of talkers from phonologically distinct <b>dialect</b> <b>regions</b> in the United States for use in a range of perceptual studies and acoustic analyses. Dialect variation, both regional and social in origin, has been an important topic of research in American English since the 1930 ’s when plans for a “Linguistic Atlas of North America ” were first discussed (Cassidy, 1993).
