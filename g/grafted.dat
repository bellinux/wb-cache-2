40|$|Abstract Background Coronary artery bypass <b>graft</b> (CABG) {{surgery is}} the {{standard}} of care {{in the treatment of}} advanced coronary artery disease, and its long-term results are affected by the failure of bypass <b>grafts.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the early patency rate in coronary bypass <b>grafts.</b> Methods A total of 107 consecutive patients who underwent CABG were included in this study. Early <b>graft</b> patency was evaluated via computed tomography (CT) angiography in the first week after surgery. Results There were a total of 366 <b>grafts,</b> comprised of 250 venous <b>grafts</b> and 116 arterial <b>grafts.</b> Multi-slice CT detected acute <b>graft</b> occlusions in 32 (8. 7 %) of all the <b>grafts,</b> including 26 (10 %) of the 250 venous <b>grafts</b> and 6 (5 %) of the 116 arterial <b>grafts.</b> The patency rates obtained were 97. 3 % for the left internal mammary (IMA) <b>grafts,</b> 50 % for the radial artery <b>grafts,</b> and 50 % for the right IMA <b>grafts.</b> Additionally, 107 (96. 4 %) <b>grafts</b> to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were classified as patent, whereas 1 (30 %) of the 3 <b>grafts</b> in the left circumflex (LCX) region and 1 (50 %) of the 2 <b>grafts</b> in the right coronary artery (RCA) territory were found to be occluded. In the venous category, 8 (13. 7 %) of the 58 <b>grafts</b> to LAD were found to be occluded. In the LCX region, 9 (8. 5 %) of the 106 <b>grafts</b> were classified as occluded, while the remaining 97 (91. 5 %) <b>grafts</b> were patent. The venous <b>grafts</b> to RCA were occluded in 9 (10. 4 %) of the 86 <b>grafts.</b> Amongst the multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors, pump time was significantly longer in the patients with occluded <b>grafts</b> than in those with patent <b>grafts</b> (P = 0. 04). Conclusion The IMA <b>grafts</b> had the highest early patency rate amongst the coronary bypass <b>grafts.</b> However, the other arterial <b>grafts</b> were associated with a high rate of acute occlusions. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveA {{bioengineered}} microporous polycarbonate-siloxane polyurethane <b>graft</b> {{has been}} developed for coronary artery bypass <b>grafting.</b> Biological agents can be impregnated into its absorbable collagen and hyaluronan microstructure and stable macrostructure to promote patency. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the in vivo biological performance and biomechanical characteristics of this <b>graft.</b> MethodsThree types of <b>graft</b> (3. 6 -mm internal diameter, 24 -mm length) were manufactured: heparin alone (H) <b>grafts,</b> heparin and sirolimus (HS) <b>grafts,</b> and <b>grafts</b> without any drug impregnation (C). All H and HS <b>grafts</b> were impregnated with 54 U of heparin in the microstructure for early elution to prevent acute <b>graft</b> thrombosis and 56 U of heparin in the macrostructure to prevent late thrombosis. In addition to the heparin, the HS <b>graft</b> was impregnated with 2. 1 mg of sirolimus in the macrostructure for prolonged elution to inhibit intimal hyperplasia. All <b>grafts</b> (3. 6 -mm internal diameter, 24 -mm length) were implanted into the abdominal aortas of rabbits (n = 55). Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene <b>grafts</b> (4. 0 -mm internal diameter, 24 -mm length; n = 7) were implanted as controls. At 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery, the <b>grafts</b> were removed for histologic, scanning electron microscopic, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations. ResultsThe patency rate was 100 % in the H, HS, and C <b>grafts</b> at each time point. Although the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene <b>grafts</b> were patent at 1 and 3 months after surgery, 1 of 2 <b>grafts</b> (50 %) were occluded at 6 months. None of the H or HS <b>grafts</b> had any stenosis or thrombus. Scanning electron microscopic examination proved that endothelial cells propagated smoothly from the anastomotic sites after 6 months in the H and HS <b>grafts</b> in comparison with the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene <b>grafts,</b> which had rare endothelialization. Neointima formation was inhibited in the HS <b>graft</b> compared with the H or C <b>graft</b> at 6 months (123 ± 126 μm vs 206 ± 158 μm or 202 ± 67 μm; P <. 05). In addition, the H, HS, and C <b>grafts</b> had greater cellular infiltration inside the <b>graft</b> than the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene <b>grafts.</b> All <b>grafts</b> except the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene <b>graft</b> had marked neocapillary formation 6 months after surgery. The <b>graft</b> compliance between 80 and 120 mm Hg was 6. 0 % ± 2. 5 % and 6. 2 % ± 0. 9 % at 6 months in the H and HS <b>grafts,</b> respectively. The <b>graft</b> macrostructure was unchanged according to the biomechanical evaluation in the H and HS <b>grafts.</b> ConclusionA unique drug-eluting <b>graft</b> had excellent patency throughout the 6 months after implantation. The heparin-sirolimus <b>graft</b> encouraged luminal endothelialization without excessive intimal hyperplasia. This <b>graft</b> performed significantly better than the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene <b>graft.</b> This <b>graft</b> has the potential to become an implantable <b>graft</b> for coronary artery bypass <b>grafting...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early <b>graft</b> {{failure is}} a common cause of cardiac {{mortality}} and morbidity after coronary artery bypass <b>grafting,</b> {{but there is little}} information on its natural incidence. Furthermore, there is particular concern about <b>graft</b> patency in off-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> and total arterial <b>grafting.</b> METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study to assess intraoperative <b>graft</b> patency in patients undergoing off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting,</b> who also underwent total arterial <b>grafting.</b> We used an intraoperative imaging system, SPY (Novadaq Technologies Inc), based on the fluorescent properties of indocyanine green dye. RESULTS: We assessed the intraoperative <b>graft</b> patency of 533 conduits in 200 patients. The mean number of <b>grafts</b> was 2. 7 per patient. Of these patients, 155 (78 %) had off-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting,</b> and 45 (22 %) had on-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting.</b> Overall, 161 (80 %) had total arterial <b>grafting,</b> with composite arterial <b>grafting</b> performed in 120 (60 %) patients. Fluorescence, confirming <b>graft</b> patency, was observed in all but 8 (1. 5 %) conduits in 8 (4 %) patients, necessitating <b>graft</b> revision. Six (3. 9 %) and 2 (4. 4 %) of these patients, respectively, had off-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> and on-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting.</b> CONCLUSION: Intraoperative fluorescence imaging demonstrated a low (1. 5 %) but well-defined incidence of intraoperative <b>graft</b> failure, which affects around 4 % of patients. This emphasizes the need for routine assessment of <b>graft</b> patency. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging permits detection and revision of failed <b>grafts</b> in the operating room. We found no difference in the incidence of failed <b>grafts</b> when comparing on-pump and off-pump total arterial <b>grafting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Superior patency {{rates for}} {{internal}} mammary artery (IMA) <b>grafts</b> compared with vein coronary bypass <b>grafts</b> {{have been demonstrated}} by retrospective studies. This difference may {{have been affected by}} selection bias of patients and coronary arteries for IMA <b>grafting.</b> Methods and Results To estimate the difference between IMA and vein <b>grafts,</b> we analyzed <b>graft</b> patency data of 912 patients who entered a randomized clinical drug trial. In this trial, 494 patients received both IMA and vein <b>grafts</b> (group 1) and 418 only vein <b>grafts</b> (group 2). Occlusion rates of IMA <b>grafts</b> and IMA plus vein <b>grafts</b> in group 1 were compared with those of vein <b>grafts</b> in group 2. Multivariate analysis was used to compare occlusion rates of IMA and vein <b>grafts</b> while other variables related to <b>graft</b> patency were controlled for. In addition, 1 -year clinical outcome was assessed by the incidence of myocardial infarction, thrombosis, major bleeding, and death. Occlusion rates of distal anastomoses in group 1 versus group 2 were 5. 4 % (IMA <b>grafts)</b> versus 12. 7 % (vein <b>grafts)</b> (P Conclusions The observed difference in 1 -year occlusion rates between IMA and vein <b>grafts</b> can be explained by a maldistribution of <b>graft</b> characteristics by selection of coronary arteries for IMA <b>grafting</b> rather than being ascribed to <b>graft</b> material. One-year clinical outcome is not improved by IMA <b>grafting...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the type of <b>graft</b> material and bacteria involved in an infrainguinal arterial anastomotic infection can be used as guidelines for <b>graft</b> preservation. Between 1972 and 1990, the authors treated 35 anastomotic infections involving a common femoral or distal artery. The <b>graft</b> material was Dacron in 14 patients, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 14, and vein in 7. Of the 14 Dacron <b>grafts,</b> immediate <b>graft</b> excision was required for overwhelming infection in eight patients (bleeding in five, sepsis in three) and for an occluded <b>graft</b> in one patient. Three of five patients failed attempted <b>graft</b> preservation because of nonhealing wounds. Thus, 12 of the 14 Dacron <b>grafts</b> ultimately required <b>graft</b> excision. Of the 21 "smooth-walled" vein and PTFE <b>grafts,</b> 10 required immediate <b>graft</b> excision for occluded <b>grafts</b> (five PTFE, one vein) or bleeding (three PTFE, one vein). Ten of the remaining 11 (91 %) patients with patent "smooth-walled" <b>grafts,</b> intact anastomoses, and absence of sepsis managed by <b>graft</b> preservation healed their wounds and maintained distal arterial perfusion. Wound cultures grew pure gram-positive cocci in 17 of 21 "smooth-walled" <b>graft</b> infections versus 8 of 14 Dacron <b>graft</b> infections. In the absence of systemic sepsis, <b>graft</b> preservation is the treatment of choice for gram-positive infections involving an intact anastomosis of patent PTFE and vein <b>grafts.</b> Regardless of the bacterial cause, the authors recommend that any infrainguinal anastomotic infection of a Dacron <b>graft</b> be treated by immediate excision of all infected <b>graft</b> material...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Cylindrical <b>grafts</b> are {{currently}} {{used to cover}} defected area in mosaicplasty. However, there are some difficulties with cylindrical <b>grafts,</b> such as potential dead space between <b>grafts</b> and insufficient coverage. Hexagonal <b>graft</b> (honeycomb model) was created and evaluated in this biomechanical study. Hypothesis was that harvesting <b>grafts</b> with hexagonal shape, which has the best volume geometry characteristics in nature, would be biomechanically advantageous and provide superior pull-out strength. Methods: Total of 24 fresh calf femurs were divided into 3 equal groups. In the first group, 1 cylindrical and 1 hexagonal <b>graft</b> were compared. Second group consisted of 3 cylindrical and 3 hexagonal <b>grafts.</b> Third group was designed to evaluate effect of <b>graft</b> depth; hexagonal <b>graft</b> implanted at 5  mm depth was compared with 20 -mm-deep hexagonal <b>graft.</b> All specimens were subjected to pull-out test. Friction field and <b>graft</b> surface area were also evaluated. Results: Pull-out strength comparison of 15 -mm-deep triple cylindrical <b>grafts</b> and 15 -mm-deep triple hexagonal <b>grafts</b> in second group revealed statistically significant difference in favor of hexagonal <b>grafts</b> (p <  0. 05). Surface area of cylindrical <b>graft</b> with 9 -mm diameter was calculated to be 50. 27  mm 2, while hexagonal <b>graft</b> surface area was 55. 425  mm 2. Volume ratio of cylindrical and hexagonal <b>grafts</b> was 753. 98  mm 3 and 831. 375  mm 3, respectively. Conclusion: This biomechanical study demonstrated that <b>graft</b> geometry, especially in multiple <b>graft</b> applications, is a factor that influences stability. Hexagonal <b>grafts</b> {{appear to be more}} stable than cylindrical <b>grafts</b> in multiple applications, and they may be used to cover a larger defected area...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intraoperative <b>graft</b> patency {{assessment}} during {{coronary artery}} bypass <b>grafting</b> enables detection and immediate correction of <b>graft</b> failure. Currently transit-time flowmetry is used to assess <b>graft</b> patency {{on the basis of}} mean <b>graft</b> flow and derived values, such as the pulsatility index. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging, based on the fluorescence of indocyanine green dye, provides direct visual images to confirm <b>graft</b> patency. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study to assess intraoperative <b>graft</b> patency in patients undergoing {{coronary artery bypass}} <b>grafting,</b> by using an intraoperative fluorescence imaging system (SPY) and transit-time flowmetry (BF 2004). Poor flow with the intraoperative fluorescence imaging system was defined if there was an absence of fluorescence or if it did not appear within 15 seconds in the <b>graft.</b> A persistent mean <b>graft</b> flow value less than 5 mL/min and a pulsatility index greater than 5 with transit-time flowmetry were considered unacceptable and prompted <b>graft</b> revision. RESULTS: We assessed the intraoperative patency of 266 <b>grafts</b> in 100 coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> patients. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging and transit-time flowmetry confirmed adequate flow in 241 (91 %) <b>grafts</b> in 75 patients (75 %). Transient poor flow was detected with both intraoperative fluorescence imaging and transit-time flowmetry in 7 (2. 6 %) <b>grafts</b> in 7 (7 %) patients. This subsequently proved to be adequate on repeat testing and hence did not necessitate <b>graft</b> revision. Both intraoperative fluorescence imaging and transit-time flowmetry confirmed persistent poor flow in 8 (3 %) <b>grafts</b> in 8 (8 %) patients that necessitated <b>graft</b> revision. However, in a further 10 (3. 8 %) <b>grafts</b> in 10 (10 %) patients, transit-time flowmetry indicated persistently poor flows on the basis of mean <b>graft</b> flow and pulsatility index values, whereas the intraoperative fluorescence imaging system demonstrated satisfactory flow. These <b>grafts</b> were not revised. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, both intraoperative fluorescence imaging and transit-time flowmetry are useful to confirm intraoperative <b>graft</b> patency. However, in a small proportion of patients (10 %), <b>graft</b> patency assessment with transit-time flowmetry alone might prompt unnecessary <b>graft</b> revision...|$|R

However, as fabrication defects and Dacron fibre deterioration are both factors affecting the whole <b>graft,</b> it is not surprising to find multiple aneurysms in the same <b>graft</b> synchronously or metachronously. Thus, a total <b>graft</b> replacement should be the treatment of choice for <b>graft</b> failure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Arterial bypass <b>grafts</b> {{are used}} to improve blood flow in the lower extremities, and {{ultrasound}} {{is often used to}} monitor these <b>grafts</b> after place-ment.

40|$|Objectives: To use the {{autologous}} gastroepiploic artery (GEA) as arterial bypass <b>graft</b> for peripheral revascularisation. We {{compared the}} development of intimal hyperplasia and nitric oxide (NO) capacity in GEA and internal jugular vein (IJV) implanted as peripheral <b>grafts.</b> Materials and methods: In pigs the GEA was implanted into the right peripheral circulation as a femoropopliteal bypass <b>graft.</b> In the left peripheral circulation the IJV was implanted as a femoropopliteal <b>graft.</b> After 21 days all <b>grafts</b> were harvested. Vascular rings of each <b>graft</b> before and after operation were studied for NO capacity. The distal half of each <b>graft</b> was prepared for histomorphometric studies. Results: Administration of bradykinin to IJV and GEA induced relaxation. After implantation bradykinin resulted in contraction in IJV <b>grafts,</b> whereas in GEA <b>grafts</b> relaxation was reduced. In IJV <b>grafts</b> extensive intimal hyperplasia was formed, whereas in GEA <b>grafts</b> only small areas of intimal hyperplasia were formed. Conclusions: The functional studies lost NO capacity in IJV <b>grafts,</b> whereas NO capacity in GEA <b>grafts</b> remained intact. Intimal hyperplasia in IJV <b>grafts</b> was extensive, whereas GEA <b>grafts</b> demonstrated preservation of pre-existent intimal architecture. These results may encourage {{the application of the}} human GEA as bypass <b>graft</b> for reconstruction of arteries in the lower limb or foot...|$|R
