40|$|A {{significant}} loss {{of biodiversity}} resulting from human activity has caused biotic homogenisation {{to become the}} dominant process shaping forest communities. In this paper, we present a rare case of biotic differentiation in European temperate deciduous forest herb layer vegetation. The process is occurring in nutrient poor <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forests</b> in mountain areas (Polish Eastern Carpathians, Central Europe) where non-timber use was converted into conventional forest management practice. This change contributed to increases in the nitrogen content and pH reaction of the soil that, contrary to predominant beliefs on {{the negative impact of}} habitat eutrophication on diversity, did not result in a decrease in the latter. We discuss possible reasons for this phenomenon that indicate the important role of tree stand composition (an increasing admixture of beech worsening the trophic properties of the soil). The second issue considered involves the effect of the changes in herb species composition of <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest</b> on its distinctiveness from the beech forest predominating in the Polish Eastern Carpathians. Unfortunately, despite the increase in the species compositional dissimilarity of <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest,</b> a reduction in their distinctiveness in relation to the herb species composition of beech forest was found. Such a phenomenon is an effect of the major fragmentation of <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forests,</b> a spread of beech forest-type species, and forest management that gives preference to beech trees. Consequently, it can be expected that changes occurring in <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest</b> vegetation will contribute to a decrease in the forest vegetation variability at the regional scale...|$|R

40|$|The ‘Czmoń' {{nature reserve}} (23. 65 ha) was {{established}} in 1998 to protect one of the best-retained areas of natural <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest</b> (<b>Galio-Carpinetum)</b> {{in the center of}} the Wielkopolska Region. Apart from <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest,</b> the ash-elm riparian forest (Querco-Ulmetum) and alder riparian forest (Fraxino-Alnetum) are found in the reserve. These plant communities, both natural and degenerated as a consequence of previous forest management, have created the convenient conditions for assessment the phytocoenoses' regeneration potential. The aim of this study was to assess the age and species structure of woody species natural regeneration of the whole area of the nature reserve. To achieve that target, during August and September 2012, 142 sample plots were established with the total area 3550 m 2 on which tree and shrub composition and densities were calculated. Woody species regeneration created various diverse communities among individual sub-units, however <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest</b> species were predominant in the whole regeneration layer. The character of a ‘natural' forest was retained on a part of the stands. Moreover, regeneration in degenerated parts of the ‘Czmoń' nature reserve stands is changing according to potential vegetation. Whereas, the establishment of gaps in the Scots pine stands using artificial regeneration was not worthwhile. The natural regeneration structure under the canopy layer of Scots pine stands unambiguously supports the claim that phytocoenoses can regenerate on their own. In spite of the oak regeneration being infrequent, all stands within the ‘Czmoń' nature reserve retain substantial rejuvenation potential. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R

40|$|The ‘Czmoń’ {{nature reserve}} was {{established}} in 1998 to protect <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest</b> (Galio sylvatici-Carpinetum betuli) – a plant community rare in the Wielkopolska region. The reserve covers the area of 23. 65 ha of forest in which also other plant communities rare in this region are found (Querco-Ulmetum minoris and Fraxino-Alnetum). Both communities of natural character, as well as degenerated communities, {{can be found in}} this reserve.

The objective of this study was to characterise the stand structure and species composition in this reserve and to trace potential changes in stands resulting from the abandonment of treatments associated with forest management. On potential <b>forest</b> sites of <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest,</b> elm-oak riparian forest and ash-alder riparian forest, forest communities at different stages of development and forms of degeneration are found to occur. On the basis of the species composition analysis of the undergrowth layer, the quantity of dead trees and shrubs, as well as the DBH distribution of living trees, we found an advancing process of regeneration in the direction of communities complying with potential vegetation. The highest proportion of dead trees was determined among those tree species growing in the reserve which were site (Pinus sylvestris) or geographically (Populus canadensis, Fagus sylvatica) alien for this particular area. In the undergrowth layer, a domination of <b>oak-hornbeam</b> <b>forest</b> and riparian forest tree species (primarily Carpinus betulus and Acer pseudoplatanus) was recorded.
