40|$|Blocks {{of tissue}} {{were removed from}} various {{locations}} in the bovine digestive tract and fixed and processed for transmission and scanning electron microscopy by techniques that retained adherent bacteria. The distribution of bacteria {{on the surface of}} epithelial cells was examined by scanning electron microscopy. This showed intermittent colonization of the epithelia with the formation of occasional microcolonies of morphologically similar bacterial cells. Transmission electron microscopy of ruthenium red-stained material showed the presence of both the glycocalyx of the bovine epithelial cells and <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> coats surrounding adherent bacteria. The carbohydrate coats appeared to mediate the attachment of bacteria to the epithelium, to food particles, and to each other so that microcolonies were formed. Careful examination of the bacterial colonization of keratinized cells {{in the process of being}} sloughed from the surface of the stratified squamous epithelium of the rumen showed that these dead cells were digested by adherent bacteria of a limited number of morphological types. The spatial relationship of this mixed, adherent, microbial population to living and dead epithelial cells and to food particles indicates that digestive processes of some importance may be accomplished by this stationary component of the microbial flora of the digestive tract...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to evaluate the concentration of fibrous carbohydrates and no fibrous in the diet of ruminants and the effects on ruminal microflora. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biomolecules nature, have structural and energetic function, {{the main energy source}} for ruminants. Can be classified according to their structure, function and nutritional point of view, the break of fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are fermented in the rumen by action of microbial flora, which has its development directly affected by the type of carbohydrate, for the rumen microorganisms have specificity as to substrate fermenting. In addition to that, the rate of fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen alters the rumen conditions, directly affecting the development of microorganisms present in it. The non-fibrous carbohydrates have a high rate of fermentation, leading to lowering of ruminal pH, influencing the development of the rumen flora, since the nonfibrous carbohydrates have low fermentation rate, and stimulate rumination and increased salivation animal, which aids in tamponade the pH of the rumen. Therefore, the balance in the supply of fibrous and non <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> is important for maintaining stable rumen. The main product of ruminal fermentation of carbohydrates are the AGV's, which are used by ruminants as the main energy source...|$|E

The bulls {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 diets (10 bulls per treatment) : CON – Control (without glycerin or Essential® oils); GLY – Glycerin (15 % on dry matter - DM); and GEO – Glycerin (15 % on DM) and Essential® oils (3 g animal day- 1). Three different markers were used to estimate apparent digestibility in the diets: indigestible dry matter –iDM; indigestible neutral detergent fiber – iNDF; and purified lignin – LIPE®. Feed efficiency and animal performance were not affected by the corn partial replacing by glycerin. No effects were found in partial corn replacing by glycerin and Essential® oils addition in the diets on the fecal output, crude protein and ether extract digestibility among the diets. The DM and OM apparent digestibility were higher for bulls fed with glycerin and Essential® oils. The CHO digestibility was higher for CON diet. The markers iDM, iNDF and LIPE® were similarly to estimate apparent digestibility to all nutrients in the diets.

The kinetics parameters of non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) and B 2 fraction were estimated using cumulative gas production technique. Among the foods studied {{there was considerable}} variation in chemical composition. The crambe meal was the only food that did not present synchronism between carbohydrate and nitrogen fractions. In this food there was predominance of A+B 1 carbohydrates fractions and B 1 +B 2 nitrogen compounds fraction, and for the other predominated B 2 carbohydrate fraction and B 1 + B 2 nitrogen compounds fraction. There were differences among the digestive kinetic parameters for all foods. The greater participation in gas production due to non-fibrous carbohydrates {{was found in the}} crambe meal and oilseed radish meal. The fermentation of <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> provided higher gas volume in the wet brewery residue and in the soybean meal, however, the soybean meal was food with higher total gas volume.

40|$|The {{effect on}} milk {{production}} of the balance between <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and readily fermentable carbohydrates in the diet is discussed. Supplements of over 2. 5 kg sugars daily to diets of hay and concentrates were very poorly utilised by milking conga. It seems probable that this was because they caused a reduction in fibre digestion, no reducing total energy supply, and they also altered the pattern of rumen fermentation towards one less favourable to milk production. It is suggested that avoidance of the low rumen pH following the ingestion of large amounts of sugar in discrete meals would improve the utilisation of sugar supplements. In a large-scale feeding trial, substitution of starchy concentrates for roughages reduced milk fat secretion and increased liveweight gain. The change in milk composition was {{closely related to the}} molar proportions of rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA). Studies in cannulated cows showed that starch digestion in the rumen was about 90 % when the concentrates were based on rolled barley, but 70 % or less when they were based on ground maize.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the in situ and in vitro degradation kinetics and to predict the digestible neutral detergent fiber (dNDF) from the incubation times; in situ and in vitro degradation kinetic parameters; and equations fitted for agricultural and agro-industrial byproducts. Byproducts from pineapple, cocoa, palm kernel, corn gluten meal, common bean, sunflower, guava, cassava bark, cassava stems, cassava foliage, papaya, mango, passion fruit and turnips were evaluated. There were differences between the byproducts as for the potentially neutral detergent fiber (NDF) fraction and the in situ NDF degradation rate in the final volume of the gases generated by <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> (FC), for the lag time and for the in vitro fractional degradation rate of the FC. There was equivalence between the dNDF values predicted in situ and those observed in vivo; however, there was low precision of estimates. The degradability in the in vitro incubation times of 30 and 48 hours presented equivalence with the values observed, but also did not present precision in the estimates. The equations fitted without lignin were not precise and accurate to estimate the dNDF of agricultural and agro-industrial byproducts. The equation with lignin and with the digestion rate obtained by the in vitro method presented more precise estimates. Byproducts from common bean, cassava bark and papaya presented greater NDF availability, whereas those of guava had the lowest NDF availability. The digestible NDF fraction was best predicted with the in situ incubation time of 72 hours. The equation fitted utilizing in vitro or in situ digestion rates enables the prediction of the NDF availability of agricultural and agroindustrial byproducts...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Eight rumen-cannulated steers were {{assigned}} to two 4 × 4 balanced Latin squares to evaluate degradability and kinetics of fiber particles from diets based on corn silage and supplements with or without addition of lipids. Dietary treatments were: only corn silage (T 1), corn silage plus concentrate with no added lipids (T 2), corn silage plus concentrate with added soybean oil (T 3), and corn silage plus concentrate containing ground soybean seeds (T 4). Kinetics of gastrointestinal transit of fibrous particles was evaluated based on chromium-mordanted fiber. Events of rumen degradation dynamics of <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> were quantified using the in situ incubation procedure. The mixed models methodology from SAS was used to fit models and the Tukey {{test was used to}} compare means. The ruminal digestibility of fiber was lower in treatments T 3 and T 4 and, consequently, lower proportions of potentially digestible fraction of standardized fiber and higher proportions of indigestible fraction of standardized fiber for treatments T 3 and T 4 compared with T 1 and T 2 were observed. However, there were no differences in mean retention time of the rumen, total mean retention time, mean digestion time, and rumen fill among diets. Animals from T 2, T 3, and T 4 showed higher dry matter intake, organic matter intake, and crude protein intake rates than animals receiving T 1 diet, but there was no effect of the addition of lipid. Treatments did not differ regarding neutral detergent fiber intake. Animals from T 1 had lower crude fat intake than animals from T 2, which showed lower crude fat intake than those from T 3 and T 4. The addition of lipid to concentrate has no effect on passage rate, digestion rate, and intake, when a good quality roughage is used...|$|R
40|$|Energy is {{the most}} {{important}} factor that effects exercise. It derives from different substrates used by the animal to produce a chemical intermediate that fuels all vital functions. The particular pathways and substrates that can be effectively used depend from the intensity and duration of exercise which in turn interact with the nutrient source. Energy providing nutrients are carbohydrates, fat and protein. The latter should not be primarily used for energy because this way is highly inefficient and amino acids may be needed as matter per se. Carbohydrates can be roughly subdivided into fermentable carbohydrates (f-CHO) and hydrolysable carbohydrates (h-CHO). f-CHO derive mainly from dietary fibres of roughage which can not be digested by mammalian enzymes but fermented by microbes. This occurs predominantly in the hind gut. <b>Fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> do not simply act as energy source but additionally help to maintain gut health in general and hydration during the specific situation of long-lasting strenuous exercise. h-CHO are represented by monosaccharides, disaccharides and starch that can potentially be digested by horse-own enzymes in the small intestine. However, high amounts of h-CHO may be critical concerning unfortunately elevated insulinaemic response {{on the one hand and}} disturbed hind gut fermentation on the other. Oils and fats can be substituted for h-CHO to increase dietary energy and mitigate of problems associated with starch feeding. However, fats may be problematic through inhibiting microbial fermentation. In general, energy providing nutrients have considerable side effects. To ensure gut health and for metabolic reasons it is recommended to feed no more than 0. 3 kg of starchy feeds like cereal grains/kg of body weight (bwt) and day and at most 1. 0 g of supplemental fat/kg bwt/day, respectively. On the other hand, 1. 0 kg of roughage/kg bwt/day is the upper safe limit that needs to be ensured. vo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{goals of}} this study were to {{evaluate}} the ability of a nonlinear optimization tool to provide solutions for maintaining consistent qualities of diets irrespective of the plane of nutrition (L) and to evaluate the effect of the plane of nutrition on intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), non <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> (NFC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and metabolizability (qm) of diets using sheep as a generalized experimental model. Eight wethers were randomly assigned to two balanced four-treatment Latin squares conducted simultaneously with four diets providing nutritional levels that were multiples of maintenance levels (ME=Mm; 1. 5 Mm; 2 Mm; and 2. 5 Mm, where ME is the metabolizable energy intake, and Mm is the metabolizable energy intake for maintenance). The ME, Mm, metabolizable protein (MP) and NDF of the diet were subjected to nonlinear constraints; the model was considered a general nonlinear programming problem and solved using Microsoft Excel Solver® with Newton's method of resolution. The intake of nutrients, digestible nutrients, digestible energy (DE) and the amounts of feces and urine produced daily were measured and analyzed statistically by fitting a linear mixed model. The corrected metabolizability (qm') and plane of nutrition (Lc) were obtained {{on the basis of the}} digestible, urinary, and simulated methane losses. The trends of some variables were reanalyzed by regressing observed values against Lc. All measured variables were affected by L. The intakes of DM and OM increased in an asymptotic fashion as Lc increased, whereas the intake of NDF increased linearly as Lc increased. At levels immediately below maintenance, observed values were approximately constant. Digestible amounts of OM, DE, CF, and CP consumed increased linearly at levels above maintenance, whereas the digestible amounts of total carbohydrates, neutral detergent solubles, and ashes increased in an asymptotic fashion. Under conditions of controlled feeding, the nonlinear optimization tool yielded dietary solutions with a nearly constant metabolizability in which the rate of increase in crude protein, digestible crude protein, and digestible energy intakes remained constant as the plane of nutrition increased...|$|R

Regarding the two groups fed only mineral mixture in the phase 1, one continued receiving mineral mixture in phase 2 and the other receiving supplement in phase 2. In the phase 1, supplemented animals presented higher daily average gain (DAG), the supplementation increased intake in kg/day of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), CP, non <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> (NFC), digested dry matter (DDM), and total digestible nutrients (TDN) and it improved digestibility of all dietary constituents (P< 0. 10), except those of neutral detergent fiber (NDFap) and ether extract (EE) (P< 0. 10). The supplementation in the dry-rainy transition season (phase 2) increased intake in kg/day of DM, forage dry matter (FDM), OM, forage organic matter (FOM), CP, EE, DDM, digested neutral detergent fiber (DNDF) and indigestible neutral detergent fiber. There was an interaction effect on supplementation in the dry season and in the dry-rainy transition season on the DAG, NFC intake, on the coefficients of DM, OM, CP, NDFap and on the content of TDN.

Em relação às características agronômicas, o híbrido BRS 802 se destacou por apresentar maior produtividade de matéria seca (PMS) e de matéria seca digestível (PMSD) (P 0, 05). Em relação ao valor nutritivo, o híbrido BR 800 destacou-se em relação aos demais híbridos convencionais por apresentar menores teores de FDA e lignina e maior digestibilidade in vitro da FDN (P 0. 05). Regarding the {{nutritional}} value, the hybrid BR 800 stood out {{when compared to}} other conventional hybrids due to its lower levels of ADF and lignin and higher in vitro NDF digestibility (P< 0. 05). The bmr- 6 mutation led to an increased nutritional value due to reductions in NDF, ADF and lignin levels and an increase in crude protein content and in vitro dry matter and NDF digestibility (P< 0. 05). Regarding the in vitro fermentation kinetics, at ages of 61, 67 and 74 days, the bmr- 6 mutation caused an increase in cumulative gas production after an incubation time of 72 and 96 hours (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Summary : The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the fermentation quality characteristics of Chineria-Mama whole crop rice silage and to examine the effect of addition of fermented juice of silage extract (FJSE) and fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB) on the fermentation quality. Rice plant (Oryza sativa L. line, Chineria-Mama) was cultivated by using conventional methods and was harvested on September 8 (Sept-cutting) and October 6 (Oct-cutting), 2006. The rice plants were cut with a cutter blower into 1 - 3 cm pieces and were crammed into plastic pouches without (control) or with 1 % of FJSE (FJSE treatment) or FJLB (FJLB treatment) in the fresh matter. All silages were maintained indoors and opened after 1 month. FJSE and FJLB were prepared according to the following method. 100 g of the cut fresh Chineria-Mama silage and Chineria-Mama rice plant were macerated with 500 mL of water and 10 g granulated sugar was added. The mixture was incubated anaerobically at room temperature for 2 days, and then filtered through quadruple layers of cheesecloth. The filtrate was collected in a plastic bucket and blended with 10 g granulated sugar. There was no remarkable difference in crude protein, ether extracts and neutral detergent fiber content between the Sept-cutting rice plant and the Oct-cutting rice plant. The non <b>fibrous</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> content of Chineria-Mama rice plant was 33. 1 % Sept-cutting and 33. 6 % Oct-cutting in the dry matter. The pH values for silage of control, FJSE treatment and FJLB treatment were the range of 3. 6 - 3. 8. Moisture contents for all silages of Sept-cutting were higher than those of Oct-cutting (P＜ 0. 01). The lactic acid contents in the fresh matter of all silages were more than 1 %, and that of FJSE treatment silage was lowest (P＜ 0. 05) at Sept-cutting and Oct-cutting. Propionic acid was observed only in FLSE treatment silage (P＜ 0. 01). Butyric acid contents were low in the silage of control, FJSE treatment and FJLB treatment. There was no large difference in volatile basic nitrogen content among three treatment silages. The present results suggest that the fermentation quality of Chineria-Mama whole crop rice silage is good, and the addition of FJSE and FJLB prepared in this experiment can not improve on the lactic fermentation of silage. 　　Key Words : Chineria-Mama, fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria, fermented juice of silage extract, fermentation quality, whole crop rice silage　　キーワード：イネ「チネリア・ママ｣,サイレージ抽出培養液,原材料由来乳酸菌培養液,発酵品質,イネホールクロップサイレー...|$|R
