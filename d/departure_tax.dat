The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. This paper examines the case for internationally coordinated indirect taxes on aviation (as a source of general revenue—not (necessarily) as a source of development finance). The case for such taxes is strong: the tax burden on international aviation is currently limited, yet it contributes significantly to border-crossing environmental damage. A tax on aviation fuel would address the key border-crossing externalities most directly; a ticket tax could raise more revenue; <b>departure</b> <b>taxes</b> face the least legal obstacles. Optimal policy requires deploying both fuel and ticket taxes. A fuel tax of 20 U. S. cents per gallon (10 percent, at today’s fuel prices, corresponding to assessed environmental damage), or alternatively ticket taxes of 2. 5 percent, would raise about US$ 10 billion if imposed worldwide, and US$ 3 billion if applied only in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Does the {{adoption}} of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) by E. U. countries result in a reduction or in an increase {{of the degree of}} alignment between tax and financial reporting? What are the potential tax effects if IFRS were used as the basis for corporate taxation? We address these issues {{in the context of the}} Italian accounting and taxation systems. Italy is one of the European countries with a closer linkage between financial and tax accounting and where there are relevant conceptual differences between the domestic accounting framework and the IFRS framework. As a consequence, the choice of extending IFRS to the annual accounts of certain types of companies has immediately implied a problem of mismatch between the new set of accounting standards and tax rules. After a three years parenthesis of tax neutrality, Finance Act 2008 established that the tax base of regional business tax (Irap) is exclusively driven by financial reporting, regardless of the set of accounting standards adopted, domestic Gaap or IFRS. The paper compares the recognition and measurement criteria proper to Italian Gaap and IFRS potentially responsible for a different Irap tax burden among taxpayers. We propose a framework to detect the expected effects that, in principle, might affect the measure of the specific items included in the Irap base; afterwards, using a sample of Italian listed companies, we empirically test the <b>departure</b> from the <b>tax</b> neutrality principl...|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} estate and gift tax rules currently applicable to martial wealth transfers and proposes {{a new system}} in which all transfers between spouses {{will be subject to}} taxation. The article begins by tracing the historic development of what the author calls the 2 ̆ 2 one flesh, one taxpayer 2 ̆ 2 approach to wealth transfer taxation. Over a period of more than thirty years, the marital deduction evolved from a tool for achieving geographic uniformity into an institution based on an unreal and idealized story of proper gender roles and the economic significance of marriage. After describing the wealth transfer tax benefits of marriage under present law, the article next analyzes the jurisprudential implications of the extant 2 ̆ 2 one flesh, one taxpayer 2 ̆ 2 approach to wealth transfer taxation. Notwithstanding the law 2 ̆ 7 s gender neutrality, the author argues that the current estate and gift tax approach to marriage is a vestige of the common law rule of coverture that suspended a woman 2 ̆ 7 s legal identity during marriage. Furthermore in <b>departure</b> from important <b>tax</b> policy goals, federal wealth transfer tax laws privilege heterosexual marital relationships over other socially important relationships with economic or emotional characteristics similar to marriage. The author proposes the elimination of the marital deduction in favor of a 2 ̆ 2 one flesh, two taxpayer 2 ̆ 2 approach to marriage that would cause all gratuitous transfers to be subject to taxation, regardless of the identity of the recipient. As part of this proposal, the author advocates increasing the applicable exclusion amount to 10 million. The author argues that raising the exemption amount will increase federal tax revenue and enhance the vitality of common law and community property systems. The article concludes by connecting the estate and gift tax treatment of marriage to the larger issue of estate tax repeal and reform...|$|R
