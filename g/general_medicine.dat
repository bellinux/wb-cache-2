40|$|While the {{completion}} of the Human Genome Project has amplified the opportunities of personalized medicine, personalized medicine {{is not limited to the}} use of genetic information. This thesis synthetizes the work we have done on different genetic and/or non‐genetic aproaches to personalize <b>general</b> internal <b>medicine.</b> To illustrate the concept of personalized <b>general</b> internal <b>medicine,</b> we use three specific domains commonly encountered in <b>general</b> internal <b>medicine</b> (osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer), and present three different approaches to potentially personalized care (biological markers, genetic markers,and shared‐decision making).

40|$|Purpose: Over {{the past}} 7 decades, {{theories}} in the systems and complexity sciences {{have had a}} major influence on academic thinking and research. We assessed the impact of complexity science on <b>general</b> practice/family <b>medicine.</b> Methods: We performed a historical integrative review using the following systematic search strategy: medical subject heading [humans] combined in turn with the terms complex adaptive systems, nonlinear dynamics, systems biology, and systems theory, limited to <b>general</b> practice/family <b>medicine</b> and published before December 2010. A total of 16, 242 articles were retrieved, of which 49 were published in <b>general</b> practice/family <b>medicine</b> journals. Hand searches and snowballing retrieved another 35. After a full-text review, we included 56 articles dealing specifically with systems sciences and general/family practice. Results: <b>General</b> practice/family <b>medicine</b> engaged with the emerging systems and complexity theories in 4 stages. Before 1995, articles tended to explore common phenomenologic <b>general</b> practice/family <b>medicine</b> experiences. Between 1995 and 2000, articles described the complex adaptive nature of this discipline. Those published between 2000 and 2005 focused on describing the system dynamics of medical practice. After 2005, articles increasingly applied the breadth of complex science theories to health care, health care reform, and the future of medicine. Conclusions: This historical review describes the development of <b>general</b> practice/family <b>medicine</b> in relation to complex adaptive systems theories, and shows how systems sciences more accurately reflect the discipline’s philosophy and identity. Analysis suggests that <b>general</b> practice/family <b>medicine</b> first embraced systems theories through conscious reorganization of its boundaries and scope, before applying empirical tools. Future research should concentrate on applying nonlinear dynamics and empirical modeling to patient care, and to organizing and developing local practices, engaging in community development, and influencing health care reform...|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{nephrology}} (or often renal medicine) is a subspecialty of <b>general</b> <b>medicine.</b> A nephrologist {{has completed}} medical school, foundation year posts (FY1 and FY2) and core medical training (CMT) {{and passed the}} Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) exam before competing for a National Training Number (NTN) in renal medicine.

40|$|The Society of <b>General</b> Internal <b>Medicine</b> asked a {{task force}} to redefine the domain of <b>general</b> {{internal}} <b>medicine.</b> The task force believes that the chaos and dysfunction that characterize today's medical care, and the challenges facing <b>general</b> internal <b>medicine,</b> should spur innovation. These are our recommendations: while remaining true to its core values and competencies, <b>general</b> internal <b>medicine</b> should stay both broad and deep—ranging from uncomplicated primary care to continuous care of patients with multiple, complex, chronic diseases. Postgraduate and continuing education should develop mastery. Wherever they practice, general internists should be able to lead teams and be responsible for the care their teams give, embrace changes in information systems, and aim to provide most of the care their patients require. Current financing of physician services, especially fee-for-service, must be changed to recognize the value of services performed outside the traditional face-to-face visit and give practitioners incentives to improve quality and efficiency, and provide comprehensive, ongoing care. <b>General</b> internal <b>medicine</b> residency training should be reformed to provide both broad and deep medical knowledge, as well as mastery of informatics, management, and team leadership. <b>General</b> internal <b>medicine</b> residents should have options to tailor their final 1 to 2  years to fit their practice goals, often earning a certificate of added qualification (CAQ) in special generalist fields. Research will expand to include practice and operations management, developing more effective shared decision making and transparent medical records, and promoting the close personal connection that both doctors and patients want. We believe these changes constitute a paradigm shift that can benefit patients and the public and reenergize <b>general</b> internal <b>medicine...</b>|$|R
