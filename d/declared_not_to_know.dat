40|$|We {{sought to}} verify the {{knowledge}} of the patients who are going through haemodialysis concerning their arterovenous fistula (AVF). This is a descriptive study which was accomplished at a haemodialysis clinic in the city of Fortaleza-CE. We selected, at random, 21 patients going through haemodialysis treatment. Concerning the results, we obtained the following data: 11 women and 10 men aged between 30 and 50 years, predominantly single, familiar income varying between 2 and 4 minimum wages, most of them have not graduated in high school and are retired. As far as knowledge is concerned, most of them <b>declared</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the anatomo-physiology and durability of their fistula and were not aware of the amount of fistulas which can be formed. However we got to the conclusion that there is a great deficit of knowledge {{on the part of the}} interviewed with regard to his fistula. We agree that it is up to the professionals who assist such patients to supply them with clear, concrete and objective information about the issue once it is really important to the patients to learn about their problems. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of sociodemographic and health-provider factors on women's {{understanding}} of abnormal results on measurement of nuchal translucency (NT) and maternal serum screening (MSS), 18 months after {{the implementation of a}} policy aimed at increasing women's awareness regarding MSS. METHODS: A representative sample of women (n = 734) who gave birth in Parisian maternity units in 1999 were asked about their understanding of an abnormal result on MSS and NT. We assessed {{the effects of}} sociodemographic and health-provider factors on the probability of women interpreting an abnormal result correctly, misinterpreting it as a definitive diagnosis, or declaring that they did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> interpret the result. Response rate was 92 % and the analyses included multinomial models. RESULTS: For both MSS and NT measurement, the majority of women interpreted an abnormal result correctly. However, there were substantial sociodemographic differences in the probability of women interpreting an abnormal result correctly, and more so in the probability of their <b>declaring</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> interpret the result. The probability of correct interpretations was substantially higher, and that of <b>declaring</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> interpret the result substantially lower, for MSS than NT measurement. However, for several sociodemographic groups, the proportion of women who misinterpreted an abnormal result on screening as indicative of a definitive diagnosis was also higher for MSS as compared with NT measurement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for additional efforts, along with alternative strategies, to inform women about the implications of prenatal screening, particularly in the case of measurement of NT...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the presence of recyclable and compostable materials in the residual wastes (or residue) produced with the separate collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) in two municipalities of the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy, namely Maiori and Tramonti. In the light of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system, the money recovery for the Municipalities from the recoverable materials was evaluated, on the one hand, and the sociological reasons for the wrong behaviours in separating MSW components were analysed, on the other hand. 58. 5 % and 41. 5 % were the average percentages of recyclable and compostable materials wrongly found in the residue of Maiori and Tramonti, respectively. On the base of the economic value of the recyclables and the avoided cost of landfill disposal, it was possible to calculate the amount of possible money recovery: 11, 900 Euro/month for Maiori and 2100 Euro/month for Tramonti. A sociological survey was conducted with a structured questionnaire in the same areas where the composition analysis was performed. The areas with the lowest percentages of recyclables in the residue corresponded to the areas in which the highest number of correct answers to questions in the knowledge section of the questionnaire were given, as well as to the areas in which the highest presence of school and university graduates are living. The fraction of recyclables in the residue increases with wrong answers to questions in the knowledge section of the questionnaire as well as with the number of people defining “discards” the fractions that they separate from MSW. Finally, the fraction of putrescible materials in the residue was increases with the number of people <b>declaring</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what compost is...|$|R
50|$|This Captain of the Chilean Navy {{played a}} key role in the history of the coup conspiracy, because he was the one who fooled the Board of Admiralty on September 9, assuring them that the army had already {{confirmed}} their participation in the coup; it was he who (accompanied by Admiral Sergio Huidobro) convinced Pinochet of joining the coup, threatening that if he did not join them, he himself would lead from Valparaíso the Chilean marines on their way to Santiago.After the coup and as chief of EMDN intelligence, he organized the enforcement of “new interrogation techniques” (meaning, torture) together with Brazilian intelligence agents. In 1973 U.S. authorities asked for information about the Horman case to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vice admiral Ismael Huerta, to Vice admiral Patricio Carvajal (by that time Minister of Defense), to the EMDN, and even the American ambassador Nathaniel Davis transmitted their concern to Pinochet himself. However, Ariel González, chief of EMDN intelligence and Carvajal's subordinate (both were naval officers), <b>declared</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> anything about the Horman case until 2004, but his account has been questioned as implausible. Researcher Jonathan Haslam quotes the son in law of Gen. William Westmoreland (commanding officer of American forces in Vietnam between 1964 and 1968) as stating that Vernon Walters (Deputy Director of CIA between 1972 and 1976) operated in Chile through Ariel González. In spite of this record, during the thirteen years judge Zepeda led the judicial inquiry on the murder of Charles Horman, he never interrogated personally former Navy intelligence officer Ariel González, nor did he ascribe any responsibility in the crime to him. “Today, Ariel González Cornejo keeps drifting around Viña del Mar free and clear”.|$|R
