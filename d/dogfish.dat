5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black <b>dogfish</b> in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species. A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black <b>dogfish</b> is the sister species of the whitefin <b>dogfish</b> (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular <b>dogfish</b> (C.granulatum) and combtooth <b>dogfish</b> (C.nigrum).|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper <b>dogfish</b> captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other <b>dogfish</b> sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper <b>dogfish</b> are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{do need to}} swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} go through {{a process known as}} sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny <b>dogfish</b> that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny <b>dogfish</b> can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.|$|E

5|$|The viper <b>dogfish</b> feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other <b>dogfish</b> sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper <b>dogfish</b> is the only <b>dogfish</b> species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Relatively common, the Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> is {{an active}} hunter capable of {{tackling}} fast, large prey. It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes, though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion. This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey, as sunlight does not reach the depths at which it lives. The Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> is aplacental viviparous, with the young provisioned by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid. The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year. Valued for its liver oil {{and to a lesser}} extent meat, Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal, the British Isles, Japan, and Australia. These fishing pressures and the low reproductive rate of this species have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Near Threatened.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} black <b>dogfish</b> under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened. The reproductive characteristics of the black <b>dogfish,</b> such as a large female maturation size, may render it susceptible to overfishing, though it is more fecund than other deep-sea <b>dogfish</b> sharks. In the northeastern Atlantic, catches of this species are managed {{as part of the}} total allowable catch for deep-sea sharks set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).|$|E
5|$|The black <b>dogfish</b> forms shoals or {{schools that}} tend to be larger during the winter and spring. Though fairly active, its {{swimming}} muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of creatine phosphokinase compared to the shallow-water spiny <b>dogfish</b> (Squalus acanthias), suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed. The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy. Potential predators of the black <b>dogfish</b> are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} deep-sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host. Other known parasites of this species include the fluke Otodistomum cestoides, the copepods Neoalbionella fabricii and Neoalbionella centroscyllii, and the protozoans Haemogregarina delagei and Trypanosoma rajae.|$|E
5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E

50|$|Rough {{sharks are}} small to medium in size, ranging from 49 to 150 cm in adult body length, {{depending}} on species. Their bodies are compressed, {{giving them a}} triangular cross-section.

5|$|The viper <b>dogfish</b> has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese <b>dogfish.</b> An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} <b>dogfish</b> is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black <b>dogfish</b> contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E
500|$|The bignose shark feeds {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling bony fishes (including lizardfishes, croakers, flatfishes, and batfishes), {{cartilaginous}} fishes (including Squalus <b>dogfishes,</b> Holohalaelurus catsharks, Dasyatis stingrays, and chimaeras), and cephalopods. In turn, juveniles may potentially {{fall prey to}} larger sharks. Like other requiem sharks, this species is viviparous: when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Females bear litters of three to 15 pups, with seven being typical, following a gestation period of approximately 10 months. A single litter may be sired by two or more males.

The contemporary distribution of species {{in relation to their}} biogeography and major changes in the distribution are discussed. Nursery areas of elasmobranchs were typically in shallower water than adult habitats, a pattern evident for blonde (Raja brachyura), thornback (R. clavata), small-eyed (R. microocellata) and spotted ray (R. montagui). In contrast, juvenile cuckoo ray Leucoraja naevus occurred further offshore and were most abundant in the western Irish Sea and northern St George’s Channel.

40|$|Almost half of {{the known}} chondrichthyans are deep-sea species, {{but most of these}} belong to the groups squaloid <b>dogfishes,</b> scyliorhinid catsharks, skates, and holocephalans. The bulk of our {{knowledge}} of deep water chondrichthyans comes from only a handful of species. The literature on chimaeras is limited. For species where data are available, productivity and rebound potential decrease with depth of occurrence. For a suite of deep-sea species studied, their productivity was on average less than half that of shelf and pelagic species. At present, about 17 species of sharks are fishery targets, and most are depleted or collapsed. On the other hand, some shelf sharks, such as houndsharks and sharpnose sharks might be fished sustainably since they are more productive than most deep-sea shark species. The major issues in assessing the status of deep-sea shark stocks include lack of time series data, lack of species-specific data, poor understanding of stock structure, and the unresolved taxonomy of several groups...|$|R

5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese <b>dogfish</b> has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E

40|$|The {{abundance}} and species {{richness of the}} cartilaginous fish community of the continental shelf and slope off central Chile is described, based on fishery-independent trawl tows made in 2006 and 2007. A total of 194, 705 specimens comprising 20 species (9 sharks, 10 skates, 1 chimaera) were caught at depths of 100 – 500 m along a 1, 000 km transect between 29. 5 °S and 39 °S. Sample site locations were grouped to represent eight geographical zones within this latitudinal range. Species richness fluctuated from 1 to 6 species per zone. There was no significant latitudinal trend for sharks, but skates showed an increased species richness with latitude. Standardised catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased with increasing depth for sharks, but not for skates, but the observed trend for increasing CPUE with latitude was not significant for either sharks or skates. A change in community composition occurred along the depth gradient with the skates, Psammobatis rudis, Zearaja chilensis and Dipturus trachyderma dominating communities between 100 and 300 m, but small-sized, deep-water <b>dogfishes,</b> such as Centroscyllium spp. dominated the catch between 300 and 500 m. Cluster and ordination analysis identified one widespread assemblage, grouping 58 % of sites, and three shallow-water assemblages. Assemblages with low diversity (coldspots) coincided with highly productive fishing grounds for demersal crustaceans and bony fishes. The community distribution suggested that the differences between assemblages {{may be due to}} compensatory changes in mesopredator species abundance, as a consequence of continuous and unselective species removal. Distribution patterns and the quantitative assessment of sharks, skates and chimaeras presented here complement extant biogeographic knowledge and further the understanding of deep-water ecosystem dynamics in relation to fishing activity in the south-east Pacific Ocean...|$|R

40|$|V Jornadas Ibéricas de Ictiología SIBIC, Conhecer para preservar, 24 - 27 June 2014, Lisboa. [...] 1 pageThe genus Squalus, or <b>dogfishes,</b> {{includes}} many coastal shark species commonly caught in commercial fisheries around the world. Despite their abundance, species diversity within Squalus is still poorly understood. In fact, recent {{studies on the}} Indo-Pacific region have described several new species, highlighting the need for revisionary taxonomic work clarifying and discriminating the different taxa. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the diversity of Squalus in the Atlantic Ocean sensu lato, where only five species have been reported out of the 27 species currently accepted for the genus, namely S. acanthias, S. blainville, S. megalops, S. mitsukurii, and S. cubensis. Notwithstanding, species identification across the region appears to be very inconsistent and there is great taxonomic uncertainty among some of the Atlantic Squalus, particularly concerning the status of S. megalops and S. blainville. This situation has contributed to the present confusion in terms of the actual species composition in the region, thus compromising the effectiveness and adequacy of any management and conservation efforts. In an initial effort to contribute to a comprehensive and clear alpha taxonomy of this highly diverse worldwidedistributed genus, we applied molecular genetic markers (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and NADHdehydrogenase 2) aiming to evaluate the number of discrete genetic lineages within Squalus in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we compared this regional lineage diversity to that found worldwide, using publicly available data. Our results confirm the inconsistencies in species identification in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. For instance, putative S. blainville and S. megalops sampled across the Mediterranean and along the eastern Atlantic from Portugal to South Africa clustered together in a single clade, sister to the clade of the Australian S. megalops (i. e. from the type location).
