[...] One Clinton campaign aide attempted to penetrate more deeply into Hsu's motives, remarking that Hsu's business activity [...] "was reinforced by his efforts in politics and philanthropy; <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a generous guy, but only later did you realize what he was up to." ...|$|E

He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine." ...|$|E
500|$|Humber debuted {{with the}} White Sox in their third game in relief. He made two pitches, {{both of which}} {{resulted}} in hits and base runners that came around to score. With Jake Peavy injured {{at the start of}} the 2011 season, the White Sox gave Humber the opportunity to pitch in their starting rotation. On April 9, 2011, Humber won his first start with the White Sox, pitching [...] innings and only allowing one run. Humber surprised the White Sox with his strong performance. On April 25, in the sixth start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, but with one out Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle. He finished with seven scoreless innings. He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In early July, when he led the major leagues with [...] innings pitched and held an 8–4 record with a 2.69 ERA, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a probable selection for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In mid-July, the White Sox switched to a six-man rotation. By early August, Humber was in a slump. Humber denies the extra rest affected his pitch command. He spent time on the disabled list with a facial bruise after Kosuke Fukudome lined a baseball into his face above the right eye on August 18. After he was hit, he was very concerned for his wife: [...] "I thought, 'I've got to get up because she's in the stands,'" [...] Humber said. [...] "As soon as I went in , I asked one of the guys to call her to make sure she knew I was OK.", adding [...] "My main concern was cheering up my wife." [...] He appeared in one rehabilitation start for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League. Humber pitched seven scoreless innings in his major league return. Humber completed his first full season as an MLB starting pitcher with a 9–9 win–loss record with a 3.75 ERA in 163 innings.|$|E

They jumped all over the place in range and subject matter, short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic story-fires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Handsome Dan was {{selected}} based {{on his ability to}} tolerate bands and children, negative reaction to the color crimson and to tigers (the symbols of rival schools Harvard and Princeton respectively), and Graves (?) cleaned up the dog and named him “Handsome Dan.” Soon, Dan followed Graves everywhere around campus, including sporting events. The students quickly adopted Dan as the Yale mascot. After Graves graduated and returned to England, Dan stayed on campus with his master’s brother. Before football and baseball games would begin, Handsome Dan founded a tradition and a dynasty by being led across the field. One newspaper reported: [...] "He was a big white bulldog, with one of the greatest faces a dog of that breed (English) ever carried". This was not an exaggeration, as Handsome Dan was one of the finest specimens of his breed in America, and went on to win first prize at the Westminster Dog Show and at least thirty other first prize ribbons in the United States and Canada. According to the Hartford Courant, [...] "In personal appearance, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a cross between an alligator and a horned frog, and he was called handsome by the metaphysicians under the law of compensation. The title came to him, he never sought it. He was always taken to games on a leash, and the Harvard football team for years owed its continued existence {{to the fact that the}} rope held." [...] The Philadelphia Press reported that [...] "a favorite trick was to tell him to 'Speak to Harvard.' He would bark ferociously and work himself into physical contortions of rage never before dreamed of by a dog. Dan was peculiar to himself in one thing – he would never associate with anyone but students. Dan implanted himself more firmly in the hearts of Yale students than any mascot had ever done before." [...] Handsome Dan crossed the Atlantic to join his old master in 1897 and died in 1898. Graves had Dan stuffed and returned him to be displayed at Yale in the old gymnasium. When it was torn down, Dan I was sent to the Peabody Museum for reconstruction. Handsome Dan I now is in a sealed glass case in one of the trophy rooms of Yale's Payne Whitney Gymnasium, where, according to Stanton Ford, [...] "he is the perpetual guardian of the treasures which attest to generations of Yale athletic glory." [...] Andrew Graves died of tuberculosis on February 18, 1948, in Westbury, Long Island.|$|E
