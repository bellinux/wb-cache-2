One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a <b>fire</b> <b>monitor</b> was constructed on the stern of the ship.

However, special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and retransmit this data. Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected. This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship or steal large portions of cargo with another ship since an escort can be sent more quickly than might otherwise have been the case.|$|E

50|$|Hull {{form for}} the vessel was {{developed}} based on a semi displacement hard chine form, flared forward in combination of built in spray rail to further improve the vessel's performance and planing at high speeds. The hull was initially developed and designed by Tenix using hydrostatics software Maxsurf and later sent to the Maritime Research Institute (MARIN) for review, which confirmed the predicted performance of the vessel. Seakeeping features includes sustained speeds of 12 knots in Sea State 4. Hull is of all-welded construction with grade 250 steel with aluminum superstructure including flight deck. Stern door constructed of aluminum alloy to reduce weight. Main propulsion consists of two medium speed Caterpillar 3612, producing 4,060 bkW at 1,000 rpm mounted with a flexible coupling connecting the flywheel to a clutchable Reintjes LAF 3445 reduction gearbox, gearbox ratio 2.515:1. The gearbox is hard mounted with a horizontally offset output driving a shaft line connected to acbLips four-bladed (Hub 4D710D) controllable-pitch propeller. Each propulsion train and ancillary systems are capable of operating independently. Port reduction gearbox provides a power take-off connection for the <b>fire</b> <b>monitor</b> pump which are used alongside firefighting capability. Main engines and auxiliaries are fueled by 109,762 liters of diesel, sufficient for an operational range of 1,000 nm at speeds of 24 knots and 2,000 nm at speeds of 15 knots, both with 10% remaining fuel. Electrical power is supplied by two Caterpillar 3406 generators sets each provides 260 ekW located in the forward area of the engine room. The design allows for the complete electric power demand to be supplied with only one generator. Emergency Caterpillar 3306 harbor generator located at main deck aft provides 105 ekW in case of main generator failure. The emergency set is air cooled and configured for automatic startup on loss of the ships main power. Main engine room is protected with a carbon dioxide extinguishing system. Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) is provided for protection of the flight deck via a mixed foam tank and proportioners. Electronics includes Furuno GPS with Furuno ARPA 26 plotter, Furuno X and S band radars, Furuno depth sounder, Furuno 8000 GMDSS, Furuno Inmarsat B and C Satcom, Furuno FAX 2084 weatherfax, Tokimec 110GS gyrocompass and Tokimec PR 2213 autopilot. Flight deck located on the after end of the bridge deck can support a helicopter for airborne SAR or emergency evacuation, with a maximum weight of 4,672 kg (10,728 lb). Weapons hardpoints located at the bow can mount heavier caliber guns, which was specified by the PCG.|$|E
40|$|Forest fire {{fighting}} {{is a very}} important issue in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can play an important role. The paper presents the use of UAVs as tools for forest <b>fire</b> <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>monitoring</b> is defined as the computation in real-time of the evolution of the fire front shape and potentially other parameters related to the fire propagation. The paper shows how an UAV can automatically obtain this information by means of on-board infrared or visual cameras. Particularly, UAVs with hovering capabilities like helicopters are very useful, as they can move to vantage points of view of the fire. Moreover, it is shown how multiple UAVs can collaborate in <b>fire</b> <b>monitoring</b> activities, allowing to cover bigger fires or to obtain complementary views of a fire. The paper presents results obtained in experiments considering actual controlled forest fires in quasi-operational conditions, involving a fleet of three UAVs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ordinarily, water <b>fire</b> <b>monitor</b> {{extinguishing}} {{systems are}} applied to protect large space places from fire. To intellectualize them and improve the water usability and extinguishing efficiency, {{it is necessary to}} realize the closed-loop control of the landing position of the water jet out from the monitors in order to let the water jet reach the fire point as fast as possible. According to the characteristics of the adjusting mechanism of fire monitors, combing with the new theoretical model for their water jet track, the closed-loop control procedure is simulated. The results show that the water jet can reach the ignition point after only several adjustments. The effective control procedure simulation paves a sound basis for the closed-loop control of the landing position of the water jet out from water fire monitors...|$|E
