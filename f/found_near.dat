5|$|Although lithium {{is widely}} {{distributed}} on Earth, {{it does not}} naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are <b>found</b> <b>near</b> hydrothermal vents.|$|E

5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it can sometimes be <b>found</b> <b>near</b> heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, {{chromium}} {{was primarily}} {{used as a}} component of paints and in tanning salts. At first, crocoite from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite were <b>found</b> <b>near</b> Bursa, Turkey.|$|E
5|$|E. reichenbachii var. albertii (commonly {{called the}} Black Lace cactus) is a federally listed {{endangered}} {{species of the}} United States that is endemic to Texas. It has been listed as endangered since 1979. Populations of E. reichenbachii var. albertii are <b>found</b> <b>near</b> the Kleberg, Jim Wells, and Refugio counties of south Texas. Destruction of habitat, over-collecting, and livestock grazing have all contributed to its endangered status.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold {{or if it was}} spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their {{formations}} but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that the two brothers led the pursuit. The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold's brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were <b>found</b> <b>near</b> Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being <b>found</b> <b>near</b> his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.|$|E
