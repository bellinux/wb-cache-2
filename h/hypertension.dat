5|$|One {{study found}} that people with or without <b>hypertension</b> who {{excreted}} less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with <b>hypertension</b> were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without <b>hypertension.</b> The US FDA states that adults with <b>hypertension</b> and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|Venous sinus stenoses {{leading to}} venous <b>hypertension</b> appear {{to play a}} {{significant}} part in relation to raised ICP, and stenting of a transverse sinus may resolve venous <b>hypertension,</b> leading to improved CSF resorption, decreased ICP, cure of papilloedema and other symptoms of IIH.|$|E

5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial <b>hypertension,</b> and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as <b>hypertension.</b> In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{prescribing}} information {{notes that}} <b>hypertension,</b> sometimes severe, {{was observed in}} some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing <b>hypertension.</b> The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1% and not significantly higher than found with placebo. A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is safe to use in people {{with a variety of}} serious cardiac conditions.|$|E
5|$|Shaughnessy {{retired to}} Santa Monica, California. On May 4, 1970, he was {{admitted}} to Santa Monica Hospital suffering from <b>hypertension.</b> He died there {{at the age of}} 78 on May 15.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{arterial}} pressure (i.e., <b>hypertension)</b> {{can be a}} consequence of OSA syndrome. When <b>hypertension</b> is caused by OSA, it is distinctive in that, unlike most cases (so-called essential <b>hypertension),</b> the readings do not drop significantly when the individual is sleeping (non-dipper) or even increase (inverted dipper).|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypertension</b> is a {{risk factor}} for atherosclerosis, heart failure, {{coronary}} artery disease, stroke, renal disease, and peripheral arterial disease, and is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries. Prior to 1940 approximately 23% of all deaths among persons over age 50 were attributed to <b>hypertension.</b> Severe cases of <b>hypertension</b> were treated by surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>hypertension,</b> another cardiometabolic syndrome component, {{has been increasing}} for the last decade. In 1994, 24% of U.S. adults had <b>hypertension.</b> Today, that figure has risen to 29%, {{according to data from}} the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In addition, nearly 30% of U.S. adults have prehypertension. <b>Hypertension</b> increases one’s risk of suffering a stroke, developing end-stage renal disease, and dying from cardiovascular disease. In recent years, <b>hypertension</b> has directly claimed more than 61,000 U.S. lives and has contributed to approximately 347,000 deaths each year.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{to stress}} {{increases}} sympathetic outflow, and repeated stress-induced vasoconstriction {{may result in}} vascular hypertrophy, leading to progressive increases in peripheral resistance and blood pressure. This could partly explain the greater incidence of <b>hypertension</b> in lower socioeconomic groups, since they must endure greater levels of stress associated with daily living. Persons with {{a family history of}} <b>hypertension</b> manifest augmented vasoconstrictor and sympathetic responses to laboratory stressors, such as cold pressor testing and mental stress, that may predispose them to <b>hypertension.</b> This is particularly true of young African Americans. Exaggerated stress responses may contribute to the increased incidence of <b>hypertension</b> in this group.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostaglandin}} iloprost is used {{to manage}} critical ischemia and pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan {{is used to}} manage severe pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|They {{may cause}} stomach or bowel upsets, and, on rare occasions, {{allergic}} reactions. Very rarely, severe headache and vision problems may be signs of dangerous secondary intracranial <b>hypertension,</b> {{also known as}} idiopathic intracranial <b>hypertension.</b>|$|E
25|$|If the {{individual}} has refractory <b>hypertension</b> (persistent <b>hypertension</b> on the maximum doses of three different classes of antihypertensive agents), an involvement of the renal arteries in the aortic dissection plane should be considered.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, {{one billion}} people suffer from <b>hypertension.</b> In the U.S., {{half of the}} 146 million {{hypertensive}} patients don't have their blood pressure under control. In <b>hypertension</b> {{patients who suffer from}} vitamin D deficiency, UVB radiation (but not UVA) lowered blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The adaptogenic {{nature of}} gypenosides {{have been found}} to keep blood {{pressure}} in a normal range. In vitro studies indicate that jiaogulan stimulates the release of nitric oxide in isolated heart cells; this is one proposed mechanism by which jiaogulan reduces high blood pressure. In a double-blind study, gypenosides administered to those with Grade II <b>hypertension</b> showed 82% effectiveness in reducing <b>hypertension,</b> compared to 46% for ginseng and 93% for indapamide (a <b>hypertension</b> medication).|$|E
25|$|An over-active renin-angiotension system {{leads to}} {{vasoconstriction}} {{and retention of}} sodium and water. These effects lead to <b>hypertension.</b> Therefore, renin inhibitors {{can be used for}} the treatment of <b>hypertension.</b> This is measured by the plasma renin activity (PRA).|$|E
25|$|Imatinib was {{initially}} {{thought to have}} a potential role {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary <b>hypertension.</b> It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary <b>hypertension.</b> However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial <b>hypertension</b> was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, benign {{intracranial}} <b>hypertension.</b>|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} is {{often associated with}} persistent <b>hypertension,</b> sometimes in childhood. In the majority of Turner syndrome patients with <b>hypertension,</b> no specific cause is known. In the remainder, it is usually associated with cardiovascular or kidney abnormalities, including coarctation of the aorta.|$|E

25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{is associated}} with <b>hypertension</b> (high blood pressure) and many connective tissue disorders. Vasculitis (inflammation of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also {{be the result of}} chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of <b>hypertension.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{contributes}} to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Humans with atherosclerosis, diabetes, or <b>hypertension</b> often show impaired NO pathways. A high salt intake was demonstrated to attenuate NO production {{in patients with}} essential <b>hypertension,</b> although bioavailability remains unregulated.|$|E

25|$|Pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> (increased {{pressure}} on the pulmonary artery) can lead to strain on the right ventricle and a risk of heart failure; typical symptoms are shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, and episodes of syncope. 21% of children and 30% of adults have evidence of pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> when tested; this is associated with reduced walking distance and increased mortality.|$|E
25|$|Reserpine {{is one of}} the few {{antihypertensive}} {{medications that}} have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce mortality: The <b>Hypertension</b> Detection and Follow-up Program, the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group in Anti-hypertensive Agents, and the Systolic <b>Hypertension</b> in the Elderly Program. However, these studies are dated, with the results of the most recent study being published in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Despite the inefficient {{production}} of aldosterone, the more characteristic mineralocorticoid effect of 11β-OH CAH is <b>hypertension.</b> Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme over{{production of}} 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood. DOC is a weak mineralocorticoid, but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of mineralocorticoid excess: salt retention, volume expansion, and <b>hypertension.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypertension</b> and pre-hypertension are {{significant}} national medical concerns. Studies conducted {{in rural communities}} of Nicaragua that have revealed that 41.1% of their residents have <b>hypertension.</b> Beyond these patients who have met this traditional hypertensive minimum cut-off, {{there is also a}} large population of pre-hypertensive patients. Health promotional efforts that focus on preventative measures have been proposed to address this pre-hypertensive sub-population.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{correction}} of an ASD, an evaluation {{is made of}} the severity of the individual's pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> (if present at all) and whether it is reversible (closure of an ASD may be recommended for prevention purposes, to avoid such a complication in the first place. Pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> is not always present in adults who are diagnosed with an ASD in adulthood).|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary <b>hypertension</b> may {{be treated}} with epoprostenol, treprostinil, {{bosentan}} and possibly aerolized iloprost.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular malformations (typically {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, {{and some}} other left-sided cardiac malformations) and <b>hypertension</b> predispose to aortic dilatation and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop aortic dilatation. Only {{a small number of}} patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of <b>hypertension</b> is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to aortic dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and <b>hypertension</b> should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg. As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of aortic dilatation is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.|$|E
