In the current study, the effects of galanin on <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion in the domestic fowl were investigated. Intravenous injections of galanin into both 8 -week old and 18 -week old female Hubbard broilers produced marked increases in plasma <b>growth</b> <b>hormone,</b> similar in magnitude to that evoked by human growth hormone-releasing factor. Galanin produced dose-related increases in <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release,</b> with a peak response occurring within 10 min of administration. <b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> {{in response to a}} maximal challenge of growth hormone-releasing factor was further augmented when galanin was given at the same time. Galanin stimulated <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> from chick hemipituitary glands in vitro, a response which was not dependent upon hypothalamic input. In addition, galanin potentiated the actions of growth hormone-releasing factor on <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> in vitro and these responses were reversed by somatostatin. These results show that galanin is able to stimulate <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> in the domestic fowl by acting directly on the pituitary gland. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular calcium is a {{ubiquitous}} molecule required for secretagogue induced <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> from somatotroph {{cells of the}} chicken anterior pituitary. <b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> can be induced via different intracellular pathways and these in turn can act to produce a synergistic <b>hormone</b> <b>release.</b> This thesis sought to further characterise the intracellular and membrane dependent pathways involved in <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> {{with regard to the}} regulation of calcium ion and other ion fluxes, and to determine the mechanism for GRF and TRH synergy in the domestic fowl. <b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion from chicken somatotroph cells was dependent upon the extracellular calcium concentration and its subsequent influx into dispersed chicken somatotroph cells in vitro, which was blocked by voltage dependent calcium channel antagonists. Both parameters also demonstrated a dependence on extracellular sodium. TRH stimulated <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> was similarly dependent on the influx of calcium from the extracellular space in dispersed chicken somatotroph cells in vitro. hpGRF- 44 /TRH synergy, however, failed to show a corresponding potentiated calcium influx with the synergistic <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> - this response was merely additive with respect to the two secretagogues. The intracellular second messenger dbc-AMP produced similar responses, {{in the presence of the}} various modulatory agents, to those observed with hpGRF- 44, although the maximal levels reached were lower. hpGRF- 44 depolarised chicken somatotroph cells in vitro. The profile of changes in the membrane potential indicated the presence of sodium, calcium and potassium channels. Removal of extracellular sodium abolished hpGRF- 44 induced depolarisation. Low and high extracellular calcium concentrations resulted in potentiated and reduced responses respectively. Repolarisation of the somatotroph cells was dependent on calcium and although none of the calcium dependent potassium channel antagonists affected the maximal depolarisation that was reached, apamin removed the ability of the cells to repolarisc and thus depolarisation was prolonged. In the presence of these agents an enhanced <b>release</b> of <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> was observed under conditions of a prolonged depolarisation whilst it was diminished when the depolarisation was shortened or abolished. It is therefore concluded that hpGRF- 44 induced <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> in chickens is dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium which in turn is dependent on a variety of mechanisms not least the voltage dependent calcium channels. Ion fluxes are also modulated via a hpGRF- 44 induced depolarisation characterised by its sodium, calcium and potassium components and which are necessary for eliciting and maintaining the <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release.</b> Synergistic <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> involves a mechanism other than a potentiated calcium influx and in short involves the integration of a complex array of intracellular events and pathways. A model is suggested which summarises the role of extracellular calcium in GH release from somatotroph cells of the domestic fowl integrating the regulatory mechanisms involved both at the membrane level and the intracellular level...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine if}} copy number variation (CNV) at specific genes related to BST had an effect on milk production. Hair samples from 1000 fresh heifers from Maddox Dairy in Riverdale, CA were sent to Geneseek, a Neogen Company for DNA extraction and processing. The DNA was processed using the BovineSNP 50 BeadChip and the data were loaded into the GenomeStudio software. The data were manipulated in GenomeStudio to estimate the CNV at each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of which a vast majority was two. The SNPs with a copy number of two were excluded and all remaining copy number values were converted into a comma separated value file and loaded into an Excel spreadsheet for final processing. This resulted in 283, 558 SNPs from 578 individuals. The genes studied were <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (GH 1), <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor (GHR), <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> (GHRH), <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor (GHRHR), insulin-like growth factor (IGF- 1), and insulin (INS). SNPs located near the start and end of the gene sequences for those genes were found that had a copy number of three.

40|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> {{secretion}} is classically modulated by two hypothalamic <b>hormones,</b> <b>growth</b> hormone-releasing <b>hormone</b> and somatostatin. A third pathway {{was proposed}} in the last decade, which involves the <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> secretagogues. Ghrelin is a novel acylated peptide which is produced mainly by the stomach. It is also synthesized in the hypothalamus and is present in several other tissues. This endogenous <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> secretagogue was discovered by reverse pharmacology {{when a group of}} synthetic growth hormone-releasing compounds was initially produced, leading to the isolation of an orphan receptor and, finally, to its endogenous ligand. Ghrelin binds to an active receptor to increase <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> and food intake.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} a possible direct, growth hormone-releasing, hormone-independent action of a <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> secretagogue, GHRP- 2, in pituitary somatotroph {{cells in the}} presence of inactive <b>growth</b> hormonereleasing <b>hormone</b> receptors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The responses of serum <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> to acutely injected growth hormone-releasing P- 2 in lit/litmice, which represent a model of GH deficiency arising frommutated growth hormone-releasing hormonereceptors, were compared to those observed in the heterozygous (lit/&# 43;) littermates and wild-type (&# 43;/&# 43;) C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. RESULTS: After the administration of 10 mcg of growth hormone-releasing P- 2 to lit/lit mice, a <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>release</b> of 9. 3 ± 1. 5 ng/ml was observed compared with 1. 04 ± 1. 15 ng/ml in controls (p< 0. 001).
