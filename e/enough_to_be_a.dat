5|$|Phellodon was {{circumscribed}} in 1881 by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten to contain white-toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: P.cyathiformis, P.melaleucus, and the type, P.niger (originally published with the epithet nigrum). P.nigrum was originally described by Elias Fries in 1815 {{as a species}} of Hydnum. Some early authors did not consider Phellodon distinct <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> separate genus, and folded species assigned to this genus into Hydnellum.|$|E
5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; {{both have a}} long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} humeral head. These were initially {{the basis of the}} taxon's referral to the clade Azhdarchidae, but they are also similar <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of a detailed description for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is quite clearly distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E

25|$|Externally, {{about every}} half-billion {{years or so}} an open cluster tends to be {{disturbed}} by external factors such as passing close to or through a molecular cloud. The gravitational tidal forces generated by such an encounter tend to disrupt the cluster. Eventually, the cluster becomes a stream of stars, not close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cluster but all related and moving in similar directions at similar speeds. The timescale over which a cluster disrupts depends on its initial stellar density, with more tightly packed clusters persisting for longer. Estimated cluster half lives, after which half the original cluster members will have been lost, range from 150–800 million years, depending on the original density.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the war, enthusiasm for the Southern cause was high, and many ship owners responded to the appeal by {{applying}} for letters of marque. Not all of those who gained authorization actually went to sea, but the numbers of privateers were high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major concern for US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Many ships of the Union Navy were diverted from blockade duty in efforts to capture privateers. Most of the privateers managed to remain free, but enough were caught that the owners and crew had to consider the risk seriously. The capture of the privateers Savannah and Jefferson Davis resulted in important court cases that did much to define the nature of the Civil War itself.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to {{cross-examine}} his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity. In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice. However, a genuine bona fide mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> breach of natural justice.

25|$|The {{restoration}} {{was carried}} out by Mr and Mrs H Fisk, Marcus Cook and Chris Hullcoop. The mill was repainted, with paint donated by ICI. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings entered into talks with East Suffolk County Council and a small grant was given to the volunteers. In 1964, Stanley Freese joined the team. The fantail was repaired and the Spring sails were dismantled as they were unsafe. Neville Martin, the Beccles millwright, inspected the mill for the Ministry of Works. As the mill was not structurally sound <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> working mill, it was decided to restore it as a landmark. Four Common sails were fitted; these are lighter than Spring sails. The body of the mill was reinforced by a cantilever beam to support the prick post added when the head of the mill was extended.|$|E
25|$|Known in Przemyśl as the {{beautiful}} Rosenbach daughter, Helene {{was given the}} title of most 'brilliant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> son.' It was in early childhood when Helene and her father began to experience tension in their relationship. Spurred by her thirst for education and her disdain for the life her mother planned for her, Helene turned to her father, only to find him unwilling to help her further her education {{past the age of}} fourteen. In her work, The Psychology of Women, Deutsch connects one aspect of feminine masochism with her attachment to her father and the possible consequences of such an identification. She writes that a father will sometimes break his relationship with his daughter when she approaches the age of sexual maturity. Helene later attributed her father's resistance to his subservience to his wife and desire for peace at home.|$|E

In Singapore, the FW32 sported a new front wing, and Barrichello put this to good use to set the sixth fastest time in qualifying, although Williams technical director Sam Michael reckoned the car was fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> couple of positions higher. In the race despite losing places to Robert Kubica and Nico Rosberg at the start, Barrichello had a solid run to sixth at the finish. In Japan, he qualified in a strong seventh, he raced strongly before fading to ninth as he was overtaken by the two Saubers towards the closing stages of the race. It was later revealed that an apparent loss of grip he had suffered during the race was caused by a six per cent loss of downforce.|$|E

25|$|During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as town {{boundaries}} {{were being}} drawn up, small areas would sometimes be left over, {{not included in}} any town. Typically smaller than a normal-sized town, these areas were known {{by a variety of}} names, including gores, grants, locations, purchases, surpluses, and strips. Sometimes these areas were not included in any town due to survey errors (which is the technical meaning of the term “gore”). Sometimes they represent small areas that were left over when a particular region was carved into towns, not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> town on their own. Some appear to have simply been granted outside the usual town structure, sometimes in areas where it was probably not contemplated that towns would ever develop. Over time, those located in more populated areas were, in general, annexed to neighboring towns, or incorporated as towns in their own right. No such areas exist today in Massachusetts, Connecticut or Rhode Island, but some remain in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.|$|E

Navigation was improved in the 1470s when Morton's Leam, a straight channel between Peterborough and Wisbech, was constructed by Bishop Morton. It was improved in 1570 and 1631, and was largely superseded by Smith's Leam, a straight cut from Peterborough to Guyhirn made by the Bedford Level Corporation in 1728. In order to improve {{the mouth of the}} river, which followed a tortuous route through salt marshes, {{the construction of a new}} channel was proposed by Nathaniel Kinderley, and work started on it in 1721.
