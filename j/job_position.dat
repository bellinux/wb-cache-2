Hopper was initially offered the <b>job</b> <b>position</b> by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at Digital Equipment Corporation, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky's boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she {{was hired as a}} full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} that those interested in a Chemistry degree understand the variety of roles available to them (on average), which vary depending on education and job experience. Those Chemists who hold a bachelor's degree are most commonly involved in positions related to either research assistance (working {{under the guidance of}} senior chemists in a research-oriented activity), or, alternatively, they may work on distinct (chemistry-related) aspects of a business/organization/enterprise, including aspects that involve quality control, quality assurance, manufacturing/production, formulation, inspection, method validation, visitation for troubleshooting of chemistry-related instruments, regulatory affairs, [...] "on-demand" [...] technical services, chemical analysis for non-research purposes (e.g. as a legal request, for testing purposes, or for government or non-profit agencies); chemists may also work in environmental evaluation & assessment. Other jobs/roles may include sales and marketing of chemical products and chemistry-related instruments, and/or technical writing. The more experience obtained, the more independence & leadership/management roles these chemists may perform in those organizations. Some chemists with relatively higher experience might change jobs or <b>job</b> <b>position</b> to become a manager of a chemistry-related enterprise, a supervisor, an entrepreneur or a chemistry consultant. Other chemists choose to combine their education and/or experience as a chemist with a distinct credential to provide different services (e.g. forensic chemists, chemistry-related software development, patent law specialists, environmental law firm staff, scientific news reporting staff, engineering design staff, etc.)... In comparison, Chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in Chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and/or responsibility earlier in their careers (with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree); Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties, in comparison with the roles/positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. Although good chemists without a PhD. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that PhD. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in Chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are PhD. holders. Jobs that involve intensive research and actively seek to lead the discovery of completely new chemical products under specifically assigned monetary funds & resources, or jobs that seek to develop new scientific theories, require a Ph.D. more often than not. Chemists with a PhD. as the highest academic degree are found typically on the R department of an enterprise, and can also hold university positionsΉ as professors. Some smaller colleges, [...] as well as Community Colleges, usually hire chemists with M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or temporary staff), but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer PhD. holders instead.|$|E

30|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of this}} study is its experimental design. We use as a case study the public LMI system in Peru, a country that adopted an innovative e-government initiative in labor intermediation 1. We implement a social experiment with multiple treatments as part of regular (non-experimental) public labor intermediation services. From June 22, 2009 to September 1, 2009, the experimental sample was selected at the initial registration filing for the normal inflow of applicants into Lima. Jobseekers that signed up to receive public labor-market intermediation were randomly assigned to four treatment groups according to two information channels (i.e., digital and non-digital intermediation) and the scope of information they received (i.e., restricted [public] and unrestricted [public/private] information sets). The restricted set only considers SMS messages regarding <b>job</b> <b>positions</b> from firms that have registered within the public LMI system in Peru, while the unrestricted one considers SMS messages regarding <b>job</b> <b>positions</b> from firms inside and outside the LMI system (e.g., firms advertising <b>job</b> <b>positions</b> in newspapers).|$|R
