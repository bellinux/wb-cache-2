25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E
500|$|I ... {{appeal to}} the House to {{consider}} well our interests in the Western Ocean, on our western coast, and the trade to China and India; and {{the ease with which}} it can be brought down the Missouri. What is this commerce? Thousands of years have passed by, and, year after year, all the nations of the earth have, each year, sought the rich commerce of that country; all have enjoyed the riches of the East. That trade was sought by King Solomon, by Tyre, Sidon; this wealth found its way to Egypt, and at last to Rome, to France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and finally to this Republic. How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce, which has never ceased, one day, from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking,</b> to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease, comfort, and enjoyment! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment, if not to govern and direct the whole, can it be possible that doubt, or mere points of speculation, will weigh with the House and cause us to lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation?" ...|$|E

When he died, the fortress was breached and now people are going out of Islam [...] Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah before Umar died famously said: If Umar dies, Islam would be weakened People asked him why and his reply was You will see what <b>i</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> about if you survive ...|$|E

And on 19 March, Franco asked for the suspension of the bombings, for fear of [...] "complications abroad". Mussolini, on the other hand, was {{very pleased with the}} bombings. Italian Foreign Minister and Mussolini's son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano said that: [...] "He was pleased {{by the fact that the}} Italians have managed to provoke horror, by their aggression instead of complacency with their mandolins.

In the letter, Cronkite wrote: [...] "Today, our nation is fighting two wars: one abroad and one at home. While the war in Iraq is in the headlines, the other war is still being fought on our own streets. Its casualties are the wasted lives of our own citizens. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> of the war on drugs.

[...] According to singer Bradfield the title was the last line of a suicide note left by the friend of someone close to the group. The second single, [...] "Autumnsong", and a third, [...] "Indian Summer", were released in August. ″Indian Summer″ peaked at number 22, making it the first Manics single not to chart in the Top 20 since 1994's She Is Suffering.

2500|$|West {{attempted}} to cast his work overseas in historical terms, theorizing that America is {{following in the}} footsteps of Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, or the 300 Spartan Hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylae, in defending Western civilization against Muslim threats from the Middle East. In speaking on what he believed to be Islam's proclivity for violence, West remarked that [...] "Something happened when Mohammed enacted the Hijra and he left Mecca and he went out to Medina, it became violence." [...] Because of this view, in February2011, West cited the threat of [...] "radical Islamic terrorists" [...] as his motivation for voting to extend provisions of the Patriot Act; He voted against another extension in May 2011. When asked during an interview with The Shalom Show how he would work with others [...] "like Keith Ellison, who supports Islam," [...] West stated that Ellison, a Minnesota representative and practicing Muslim, represents the [...] "antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established." [...] West later argued that his initial comment was misconstrued. He said the comments were [...] "not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)." [...] In a Boynton Beach Town Hall meeting, West told the Miami leader of CAIR that [...] "I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment, but what you must understand, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>speaking</b> the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth.
