40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the wood natural resistance of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. of phenotypes (plants) with and without prickles to subterranean termite (Nasutitermes corniger Motsch.) in <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> and feeding preference assays, under laboratory conditions. Wood test samples measuring 2. 54 x 1. 50 x 0. 64 cm (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 10. 00 x 1. 50 x 0. 64 cm (feeding preference), with the largest measurement in the fiber direction, were obtained from three positions from pith to bark direction. The samples were exposed for 28 days (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 45 days (feeding preference) to Nasutitermes corniger Motsch. termites. In <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> assay the termites caused superficial attack in wood and lived during 8 to 10 days, thus the wood was classified as resistant. In <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> assay more mass loss and attack in wood of external positions to both phenotypes was observed. To the waste and survival time of termites were similar to both types. In feeding preference a larger mass loss and waste to inner position in both phenotypes was observed. In general, the plants with prickles lost more mass than the one without prickles. Therefore, the wood of plants without prickles is more suitable to be use in construction of fences, sheepfolds and other similar uses where the wood shall be subject to attack by termites...|$|R

40|$|From {{the age of}} 9 weeks, 90 - 90 Kolos, Gourmaud and Babati goose breeds were force {{fed with}} 2 {{different}} types of technology and 3 types of feedstuff. <b>Force</b> <b>feeding</b> technologies were the traditional Hungarian and Israeli soft groats quick methods. In {{the case of the}} latter, feedstuff was fed both in a pre-fermented (Lactobacillus plantarumlactic acid bacteria) form and without fermentation. Frequency of daily <b>force</b> <b>feeding</b> was gradually increased from 2 to 6 until the 21 st day of <b>force</b> <b>feeding.</b> Live weight before and after fattening and liver weight were measured in the case of each breed and treatment. Liver quality was also determined. On the basis of our results, differences in liver weight average were significantly influenced only by the genetic property of the breed. Liver quality was also influenced by the method of <b>force</b> <b>feeding</b> of one breed (Babati). Feedstuff tested did not result in significant differences in liver weight or in liver quality.

The results showed that theEremanthus erythropappus oil in the retentions of 10. 61 kg/m 3 (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 38. 35 kg/m 3 (preference feeding) inhibited theattack and in the retentions of 16. 73 kg/m 3 (<b>force</b> <b>feeding)</b> and of 58. 22 kg/m 3 (preference feeding) prevented the attack in woodsamples, making unfeasible the access of the termites to the food source...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the effects of process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) on performance characteristics (tangential <b>force,</b> <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> surface roughness and flank wear) in turning of EN- 19 steel with uncoated carbide cutting tool. Experiments are designed and conducted based on Taguchi's L 27 orthogonal array carried out under dry cutting conditions for tangential <b>force,</b> <b>feed</b> <b>force</b> and surface roughness, whereas for the flank wear the experiments are conducted as per L 9 orthogonal array. The responses are <b>feed</b> <b>force,</b> tangential force, surface roughness and flank wear were recorded for each experiment The depth of cut was identified as the most influential process parameters in the responses of both tangential <b>force</b> and <b>feed</b> <b>force.</b> The <b>feed</b> rate was identified as the most influential process parameter on the surface roughness, while the cutting speed has a significant contribution for flank wear.

50|$|AGD's Warp <b>Feed</b> is a <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> {{system used}} to feed paintballs into a marker. It is fed by a hopper {{set on the}} top of the actual warp feed system.

Paintballs are fed from a loader, and when the Warp Feed senses the vibration from the marker firing, the Warp Feed begins turning disks inside, and accelerates the paintballs into the elbow of the paintball marker.|$|R
