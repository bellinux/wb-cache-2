50|$|However, in {{lightly loaded}} bearings, such as disk drives, the typical ball bearing {{stiffnesses}} are ~10^7 MN/m. Comparable <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> have stiffness of ~10^6 MN/m. Because of this, some <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings,</b> particularly hydrostatic bearings, are deliberately designed to pre-load the bearing {{to increase the}} stiffness.|$|R

50|$|The <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are pads {{with holes}} through which {{pressurized}} inert gas (such as helium) or oil presses against the spherical {{shell of the}} platform. The <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are very slippery, and the spherical platform can turn freely. There are usually four bearing pads, mounted in a tetrahedral arrangement to support the platform.|$|R

5000|$|They can be broadly {{classified}} into two types: <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>bearings</b> (also known as hydrodynamic bearings) and hydrostatic bearings. Hydrostatic bearings are externally pressurized <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings,</b> where the <b>fluid</b> is usually oil, water or air, and the pressurization {{is done by}} a pump. Hydrodynamic bearings rely on the high speed of the [...] (the part of the shaft resting on the fluid) to pressurize the fluid in a wedge between the faces. <b>Fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are frequently used in high load, high speed or high precision applications where ordinary ball bearings would have short life or cause high noise and vibration. They are also used increasingly to reduce cost. For example, hard disk drive motor <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are both quieter and cheaper than the ball bearings they replace.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{typically}} quieter and smoother (more consistent friction) than rolling-element bearings. For example, hard disks manufactured with <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> have noise ratings for bearings/motors {{on the order}} of 20-24 dB, which is a little more than the background noise of a quiet room. Drives based on rolling-element bearings {{are typically}} at least 4 dB noisier.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> {{may have}} been invented by French civil {{engineer}} L. D. Girard, who in 1852 proposed a system of railway propulsion incorporating water-fed hydraulic bearings.|$|E
50|$|Around 1890, {{the modern}} <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> was invented, now universally {{used to support}} heavy water turbine spindles. As of 2002, fluid {{bearings}} {{appear to have a}} mean time between failures of more than 1300 years.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} {{generally have}} very low friction—far better than mechanical bearings. One source of friction in a <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> is the viscosity of the fluid. Hydrostatic gas bearings {{are among the}} lowest friction bearings. However, lower fluid viscosity also typically means fluid leaks faster from the bearing surfaces, thus requiring increased power for pumps or friction from seals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>{{bearings}}</b> are bearings {{in which}} the load {{is supported by a}} thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas between the bearing surfaces. [...] Since there is no contact between the moving parts, there is no sliding friction, allowing <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> to have lower friction, wear and vibration than many other types of bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a bearing {{is how the}} distance between the parts which are separated by the bearing varies with applied load. With rolling element bearings {{this is due to the}} strain of the ball and race. With <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> it is due to how the pressure of the fluid varies with the gap (when correctly loaded, <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are typically stiffer than rolling element bearings).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>{{bearings}}</b> can catastrophically seize under shock situations. Ball bearings deteriorate more gradually {{and provide}} acoustic symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Sufficient oil {{pressure}} {{ensures that the}} metal of the rotating shaft (journal) and the bearing shell can never touch, and wear is therefore confined to initial start-up and shutdown. The {{oil pressure}}, combined with {{the rotation of the}} shaft, also hydrodynamically centers the journal in its shell and cools the bearings. Such a bearing is known as a <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Company built {{all types}} of ships but were {{particularly}} well known as producers of fine cross-channel steamships and ferries. It was {{a pioneer in the}} development of the ship's stabiliser in conjunction with Edinburgh-based Brown Brothers & Company. In 1913 the Channel steamer Paris was one of the first ships to use geared turbine engines utilising new Michell tilting-pad <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing.</b> It also undertook experimental work in hovercraft and helicopter-type aircraft.|$|E
50|$|According to the ASME (see {{reference}} link), {{the first}} Michell/Kingsbury <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> in the US {{was installed in}} the Holtwood Hydroelectric Power Plant (on the Susquehanna River, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, US) in 1912. The 2.25-tonne bearing supports a water turbine and electric generator with a rotating mass of about 165 tonnes and water turbine pressure adding another 40 tonnes. The bearing has been in nearly continuous service since 1912, with no parts replaced. The ASME reported {{it was still in}} service as of 2000. As of 2002, the manufacturer estimated the bearings at Holtwood should have a maintenance-free life of about 1,300 years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>bearings,</b> {{where the}} axial thrust is {{supported}} on {{a thin layer}} of pressurized liquid—these give low drag.|$|R
5000|$|Oil <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{impractical}} in environments where {{oil leakage}} can be destructive or where maintenance is not economical.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike greaseless {{mechanical}} <b>bearings,</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> cannot {{operate at}} the extremely low temperatures needed for some specialized scientific research applications.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a roller}} or ball is heavily loaded, fluid {{bearings}} have clearances that change less under load (are [...] "stiffer") than mechanical bearings. It might seem that bearing stiffness, as with maximum design load, {{would be a}} simple function of average fluid pressure and the bearing surface area. In practice, when bearing surfaces are pressed together, the fluid outflow is constricted. This significantly increases {{the pressure of the}} fluid between the bearing faces. As <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> faces can be comparatively larger than rolling surfaces, even small fluid pressure differences cause large restoring forces, maintaining the gap.|$|E
50|$|Bearings {{that are}} made from bearing grade {{materials}} always run in the dry condition. The other two classes of plain bearings can run in all three conditions; the condition in which a bearing runs {{is dependent on the}} operating conditions, load, relative surface speed, clearance within the bearing, quality and quantity of lubricant, and temperature (affecting lubricant viscosity). If the plain bearing is not designed to run in the dry or boundary condition, it has a high coefficient of friction and wears out. Dry and boundary conditions may be experienced even in a <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> when operating outside of its normal operating conditions; e.g., at startup and shutdown.|$|E
5000|$|A kugel {{fountain}} (also {{called a}} [...] "floating" [...] sphere fountain {{or by the}} pleonasmic name kugel ball) is a water feature or sculpture where a sphere sits in a fitted hollow in a pedestal, and {{is supported by a}} thin film of water. Pressurized water flows between the sphere and socket, creating a mechanical <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing</b> that is nearly frictionless. The sphere can weigh thousands of pounds, but the efficient bearing allows it to be spun by the force of a hand. The sphere does not float, being denser than water; it is often made from granite. Ring sculptures that rotate on an axis are also built.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluid</b> and {{magnetic}} <b>bearings</b> can have practically indefinite service lives. In practice, there are <b>fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> supporting high loads in hydroelectric plants {{that have been}} in nearly continuous service since about 1900 and which show no signs of wear.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> {{have the}} {{advantages}} of near-silent operation and high life expectancy (comparable to ball bearings), but {{tend to be the}} most expensive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>bearings</b> often {{inherently}} add significant damping. This helps attenuate resonances at the gyroscopic {{frequencies of}} journal bearings (sometimes called conical or rocking modes).|$|R
50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} were a breakthrough {{at the end}} of the 19th century because bearings used in wheel axles had not changed much since ancient times. They consisted of a cylindrical seat on the frame and part of the axle enclosed in a case or box that held a lubricant. These were called journal bearings and relied on the lubricant to form a <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing.</b> Without adequate lubrication, journal bearings would fail due to the excessive heat caused by friction. Timken was able to significantly reduce the friction on his axle bearings by adding tapered elements which actually rolled while transferring the load evenly from axle to frame through the hardened steel inner and outer rings and the rollers - his tapered roller bearing.|$|E
50|$|Two {{designs were}} {{produced}} for the ships propellers because of disagreement between the admiralty and Parsons on the better design. For the same overall dimensions, Parsons used a blade area of 54 sq ft while the admiralty preferred 42.5 sq ft. The introduction of gearing meant that bearings holding the shafts were now subject to large lateral forces where the gears pushed against each other. This {{was a significant}} difficulty in gearbox design but was overcome {{by the introduction of}} the new Michell tilting-pad <b>fluid</b> <b>bearing.</b> This was first employed in 1913 on a cross-channel steamer, Paris built by Denny of Dunbarton which also used geared turbines, and then on Leonidas and Lucifer. Traditional bearings were found unable to support the forces in turbine gearboxes but also had higher friction in more traditional application with reciprocating engines. It was estimated that the reduced frictional losses on new bearings introduced throughout the fleet saved the admiralty £500,000 in reduced fuel consumption in 1918.|$|E
