25|$|Feet Up Friday - This {{began on}} the {{afternoon}} show. Two teams of listeners {{would come in and}} play games, including 'The Yes/No Game' and 'The Square' to win Feet Up Friday. When Greg moved to drivetime, the feature was reinvented so that the two teams make music choices to be played between 17:15 and 17:45, the winning team, that <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> their choices, was chosen by listener vote. This feature ended when The Official Chart occupied the Friday show.|$|E
25|$|The {{winner of}} the Qualifying Round played the day's {{returning}} champion in the renamed Championship Round, which kept the same line/position form of scoring. However, {{instead of being a}} race against time, the Championship Round was a race to achieve a score of one hundred points. The normal scoring format was used until someone reached fifty points. Once that happened, the bell rang to indicate it and each word played after that was worth double the points. Whoever reached 100 points won the game and the championship and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the Solo Game for the jackpot.|$|E
25|$|While the BCS {{routinely}} involved {{controversy about}} which two teams {{are the top}} teams, in rare instances there was a clear-cut top two; the BCS ensured these top two would play {{each other for the}} championship. For example, USC and Texas in 2005 were the only undefeated teams; both teams were only tested a couple of times all season and mauled every other opponent they faced by large margins. Had this scenario occurred before the inception of the BCS, the teams would have been unable to play each other due to contractual obligations with the major bowls and there would have been dual national champions. Under the BCS system however, these two teams <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the championship.|$|E

50|$|He {{debuted in}} the 1989/90 season. He was a {{right-handed}} batsman who made over 8,000 runs in his career. For many {{years he was}} on the fringes of selection for Pakistan, but the closest he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> for his country was selection to the squad for a One Day International against India in 2005.|$|R
25|$|He {{was a part}} of the Deccan Chargers team {{during the}} 2011 and 2012 Indian Premier League (IPL) tournaments but only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> one match for the team in IPL 2012. He was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for the 2013 {{competition}} but did not get the chance to play in a single match. For the 2014, season he was signed by the Kolkata Knight Riders and in his first game he was the man of the match, scoring 45 off 31 balls and taking a brilliant catch near the boundary to dismiss AB de Villiers and turn the game in the final over. In IPL 2015, he was retained by the Kolkata Knight Riders but he got injured and was ruled out of the tournament. Johan Botha came in as a replacement.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 2016, Roeselare won {{the opening}} tournament and was {{therefore}} assured of playing at least the promotion play-offs. Following a loss against Antwerp on the penultimate day of the closing tournament, Roeselare could no longer win the closing tournament (and direct promotion) {{and as a result}} the promotion play-offs would be held. On {{the final day of the}} closing tournament, Roeselare then held Lierse to a draw, denying them the play-offs and setting Roeselare up with Antwerp to decide promotion. Antwerp twice beat Roeselare and thereby allowed the club to return to the highest level of professional football in Belgium following thirteen seasons at the second level. Initially, they did not receive a license to compete in professional football the following season, but the decision was overturned. Roeselare <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the Europa League play-offs.|$|E
25|$|Mendis {{made his}} debut for Sri Lanka in 1972, batting at number three against the visiting Tamil Nadu side. Mendis top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 52, and also made 34 in the second innings, but could not prevent an innings defeat. This match did not have {{international}} status, and indeed Mendis represented Sri Lanka {{in a number of}} non-internationals. His first ODI, however, came in 1975, when he made 8 against the West Indies in a batting collapse. It took seven more years before Mendis <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a Test match; on 17 February 1982 he joined forces with the other Sri Lankans against England. In that match, he was sent in to bat at number four, but only made 17 and 27 in Sri Lanka's seven-wicket defeat. More defeats followed, and in his first eight innings he only recorded one fifty, in the first Test of three against Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Moterram {{was born}} in Birmingham and joined Birmingham City as a 12-year-old. He progressed through the youth and trainee sides and turned {{professional}} in August 2003. He made the substitutes' bench {{for the trip to}} Tottenham Hotspur on 7 January 2004, but that was the closest he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> for Birmingham's first team.|$|R

50|$|He {{and former}} Kangaroos {{teammate}} Glenn Archer <b>got</b> together <b>to</b> <b>play</b> one {{match for the}} Caulfield Grammarians Football Club.|$|R
25|$|Team {{started the}} {{campaign}} by losing first 2 games but team won next match. There after team started losing badly despite winning some games {{and was therefore}} eliminated from the competition. But team bounced back by showing pride by winning final 3 matches which didn't allow a chance for other teams for qualifiers. Team disappointing performance was clearly due to inexperience in the squad especially {{due to lack of}} Indian international batsmen. Fans of DC have criticized management for not holding back Rohit Sharma during player retention. Chargers <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> IPL matches at Hyderabad after almost 3 years, but dismal performance at their home ground continued with a win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Knight Riders, Pune Warriors and Kings XI Punjab. They ended on a high with 3 consecutive wins but could not scale above 7th position in the league standings.|$|E
25|$|In 1985–86, Partizan won {{the title}} with a 4–0 win over Željezničar due to better goal {{difference}} than second-placed Red Star. However, Yugoslav FA President Slavko Šajber {{decided that the}} entire last round of fixtures had to be replayed after accusations that certain results had been fixed. Partizan refused to replay its match, after which the game was awarded 3–0 to Željezničar, and the title was given to Red Star, who thus <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in 1986–87 European Cup. Because of these events, 12 clubs started the next 1986–87 season with a deduction of six points, Partizan among them. Vardar, {{who had not been}} deducted six points, won the title and subsequently participated in 1987–88 European Cup. However, after a sequence of appeals and lawsuits which eventually led to Yugoslav Constitutional Court, the original final table of 1985–86, with Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in mid-1987. Also, the points deduction from 1986–87 season was annulled and the title was given to Partizan, who headed the table without the deduction. These controversial events prevented the generation of Milko Đurovski, Fahrudin Omerović, Zvonko Varga, Vladimir Vermezović, Admir Smajić, Goran Stevanović, Nebojša Vučićević, Miloš Đelmaš, Srečko Katanec, Fadil Vokrri and Bajro Župić from showing their full potential in Europe.|$|E
25|$|After {{the horrors}} of the Brisbane Test the MCC <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> another upcountry game played in a rodeo dustbowl. Hutton won the toss, batted and put on 112 with Bill Edrich (74), who seemed to have regained his form, before he was out for 40. Peter May made 69 and Jim Wilson 61, but the last five wickets fell for 26 runs., from 291/5 to 317 all out, with the retired Queensland leg spinner Donald Watt taking 5/56 with help from fellow leggie Kenneth Jenkins (4/44). The innings had reduced the {{makeshift}} wicket to the consistency of a golf bunker and Hutton allowed it to be rebuilt for the next day. Opener Wilfred Brown top scored with 22 in the Country innings as they collapsed to 95 off 42.1 eight-ball overs with Peter Loader (3/22), Johnny Wardle (2/22), Bob Appleyard (2/18) and Tom Graveney (2/8) sharing the wickets. Hutton put them straight back in again and this time they did better, Brown making 78 and adding 108 for the second wicket with Renald Sippel (45), but Appleyard (7/51) spun his way {{through the rest of the}} batting order with some help from Graveney (2/49). The home team agreed to play past stumps so that the MCC could dismiss them, and the tourists won by an innings and 12 runs. This received some criticism in the Australian press, who forgot that Hutton had sportingly allowed the wicket to be remade.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} Rolling Stone editor, David Wild {{why he was}} {{performing}} the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: [...] "It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's why I never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the songs live. [...] I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what this is all about. [...] I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E

About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, [...] "Finally, all of your questions [...] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, [...] "No, they will not". Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet and honest. And I think, hopefully, when people see our scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too. [...] are so incredibly real with each other. I was really grateful that I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> those scenes and Libby got to sort of express herself in ways that she hasn’t been able to." ...|$|E

Larson quickly bumped his total to over $10,000. Early on, his pattern play was irregular, as he stopped four times on squares that did not follow his pattern: a trip to Kauai worth $1,636 in square #7, $700 and one spin in square #17; [...] "Pick a Corner" [...] in square #6 (where {{he was given the}} choice of $2,250 in square #1, $2,000 in square #10, or $1,500 and one spin in square #15—he chose $2,250); and a sailboat worth $1,015 in square #7.|$|E
500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you get on the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the age of}} thirteen, Mitchell {{was educated}} at Abingdon School, a public school in Oxfordshire. Having always been top of the class at Primary school and Prep school, once he moved to Abingdon, he {{realised}} that {{there were plenty of}} people more intelligent than he was; so he turned his attention to debating and drama, [...] "where [...] had a chance of being the best". There, Mitchell often took part in plays, [...] "largely because you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> cards backstage." [...] His roles mainly consisted of small minute-long parts, until he won the role of Rabbit in Winnie-the-Pooh. This {{was the first time that}} he was [...] "consciously aware I was doing a performance" [...] and that that [...] "was better, even, than playing cards." [...] Mitchell had been [...] "obsessed" [...] with comedy writing since his school days, as he [...] "always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing", and [...] "would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself".|$|E

500|$|Chopra {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of her triple roles by playing each one as differently as possible. She used the script to identify unique characteristics of each—Aradhana is a Punjabi girl, Ruksar speaks with the manners of a popular Bollywood actress from Lucknow, and Radha displays a contemporary confidence. Of the three, Chopra found playing a girl from 1910 to be the toughest. She said, [...] "There was no reference point for it except some books," [...] and the few sketches Kohli was able to provide for costume design. Even with only written sources, she worked toward developing an accent {{that would have been}} typical for a Punjabi girl from Pakistan. In contrast, Chopra was able to consult Saira Banu, a leading Hindi film actress of the 1960s, to understand the way her character Ruksar lived. Like Kapoor, Chopra enjoyed the novelty of playing a character in 1910, [...] "a certain period which normally [...] would not get to play," [...] and she related best to her contemporary character Radha. But for her Ruksar was the most interesting. [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a superstar actress of the 1960s," [...] she said. [...] "I got to wear the glamorous clothes of those days, don big hair-dos and speak the way actresses spoke then. I loved all those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Springsteen and {{the band}} {{returned}} to the U.S. to make their first-ever appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, as the headlining act on June 13, 2009. Playing before festival audiences who were not guaranteed to be fans of his music was largely new to Springsteen, but after a slow start the show captured {{over most of the}} Bonnaroo audience. [...] The following night, Springsteen joined the recently reunited and headlining Phish for three songs, [...] "Mustang Sally", [...] "Bobby Jean", and [...] "Glory Days". [...] Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio said later, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with Bruce. That's my hero." [...] The Bonnaroo performance of [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] was included on a Fuse TV show of festival highlights, and the performance of [...] "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" [...] included a bit with Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog singing along that was included on a Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien segment. [...] Springsteen subsequently reflected, [...] "We played festivals {{for the very first time}} on this tour, and that was one of the greatest experiences of all of them. That was an eye-opener. When we played Glastonbury [...] you come out and there's like 100,000 kids in their 20s and under. It was fun playing on bills with other bands, and it's something I'd do again in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast of Blue Velvet {{included}} several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her Lancôme {{ads in the}} early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian film director Roberto Rossellini. After completion of the film, during test screenings, ICM Partners—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client. Furthermore, the nuns at the school in Rome that Rossellini attended in her youth called {{to say they were}} praying for her. Dennis Hopper was the biggest [...] "name" [...] in the film, having starred in Easy Rider (1969), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's critical and commercial failure Dune (1984), a science fiction epic based on the novel of the same name. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: [...] "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with." [...] Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Frank! I am Frank!" [...] as Hopper confirmed in the Blue Velvet [...] "making-of" [...] documentary The Mysteries of Love, produced for the 2002 special edition. For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role. Laura Dern, then just 19 years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including Molly Ringwald.|$|E
