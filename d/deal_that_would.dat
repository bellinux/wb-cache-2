5|$|In {{an effort}} to build up their lineup, the Red Sox set up a {{potential}} <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> send reigning AL MVP Alex Rodriguez to Boston and Red Sox Manny Ramírez and other players to Texas. The deal eventually fell through after Rodríguez indicated he would not go against the MLBPA, which opposes a proposed renegotiation, which would have potentially reduced Rodríguez's earnings in the later years of his contract. A freak off-season basketball injury to Aaron Boone just several months removed from his historic home run had Yankees management looking at possible options to replace him. Despite being courted by Boston for nearly three months, Rodríguez was traded from Texas to New York.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when {{the full extent of}} the required federal appropriations became clear. Krulitz was replaced with Eric Jankelassistant for intergovernmental affairs to Interior Secretary Cecil Andruswith whom Tureen had previously negotiated the settlement to the Narragansett land claim in Rhode Island. Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> limit the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Governor Tom McCall {{appointed}} Goldschmidt to {{what would}} {{be known as the}} Governor's Task Force, which was tasked with exploring regional transportation solutions. Goldschmidt served alongside notable leaders: Glenn Jackson, chair of the board of Portland Power and Light and chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, was considered the state's leading power broker on transportation issues; and Gerard Drummond, a prominent lawyer and lobbyist, was president of Tri-Met's board of directors. The task force considered an unpopular <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have funded the construction of the Mount Hood Freeway, which would have bisected southeast Portland. The deal, which would have been 90% funded by the Federal Highway Administration, was rescinded, with first the Multnomah County Commission and, later, Portland City Council reversing their positions and advising against it. Goldschmidt was initially opposed to diverting funds to light rail, instead favoring busways and more suitable local road projects; as the 1981 deadline to reallocate the funds approached, however, light rail became a more attractive prospect. By a process not clearly documented, light rail was included in the final plan. All federal money initially intended for the Mount Hood Freeway ultimately went to other road projects, but the total amount was doubled and the first leg of MAX light rail was approved and ultimately completed in 1986.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2013, Charlene Johnson, the {{minister}} responsible for trade, along with Fisheries minister Keith Hutchings {{announced that the}} government supported the agreement in principle for CETA, that had been announced early that day. The ministers said the trade agreement would a game changer for the fishing industry. The agreement would eliminate MPRs for the European Union {{three years after the}} ratification of the deal, which is expected to occur in 2015. In return for eliminating minimum processing requirement, high tariffs and import restrictions on almost all fish would be eliminated on the first day that CETA comes into effect. Currently only 13.1 per cent of seafood is duty-free. But by 2022, all seafood would be 100 per cent duty-free. Following the conclusion of the CETA negotiations Dunderdale said that other provinces and the federal government had been pressuring her to accept a <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> eliminate minimum processing requirements on fish right away, in exchange for concessions on tariffs later. Dunderdale said they refused that deal and were eventually able to negotiate the current arrangement. Her government also felt that eliminating MPRs was a safe trade away because they did not feel European countries could compete with Newfoundland and Labrador fish plants, due to higher operating costs in those countries.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{released}} by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract {{at the end of}} 2007–08. He trialled with Darlington of League Two, but was told by manager Dave Penney he was not what they were looking for. He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August. He joined York City in the Conference Premier on loan on 27 November, becoming Martin Foyle's first signing as manager, in a <b>deal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> expire on 6 January 2009. Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 1–1 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club in a higher division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this. York eventually made an offer of a quarter of Gainsborough's asking price, which was rejected.|$|E
