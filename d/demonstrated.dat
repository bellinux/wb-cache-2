40|$|Based on {{the field}} investigations, this paper {{analyzes}} systematically the achievements and problems of constructing the <b>demonstrating</b> areas of the ecological rebuilding and economic sustainable development in Hexi, Gansu Province, and then the thoughts on constructing the <b>demonstrating</b> areas are brought forward. It is considered that all kinds of ecological <b>demonstrating</b> areas should be merged in order to construct large-scale characterized <b>demonstrating</b> areas which go beyond the district. In other words, in Hexi Region, Zhangye District should be constructed as the largest ecoagriculture <b>demonstrating</b> area of high technology; Wuwei District should be constructed as the largest ecological <b>demonstrating</b> area of agricultural comprehensive exploitation; JiuJia District, which is the shortened form of Jiuquan and Jiayuguan, should be constructed as the largest ecotourism <b>demonstrating</b> area; and Jinchang City should be constructed as the largest ecoindustry <b>demonstrating</b> area. At the same time, the constructing pattern should be selected according to the actual circumstances; science and technology should be applied to construct the <b>demonstrating</b> areas and accelerate the industrialization in the big market. Additionally, {{it is important to}} smooth the constructing system and implement the flexible and efficacious running mechanism, and it is suggested that the committee should be organized to administer the ecological <b>demonstrating</b> areas in Hexi Region...|$|R

5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) <b>demonstrated</b> that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) <b>demonstrated</b> a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
