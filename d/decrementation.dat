5000|$|The {{advantage}} of skew binary {{is that each}} increment operation {{can be done with}} at most one carry operation. This exploits the fact that [...] Incrementing a skew binary number is done by setting the only two to a zero and incrementing the next digit from zero to one or one to two. When numbers are represented using a form of run-length encoding as linked lists of the non-zero digits, a form called the sparse representations of numbers by Okasaki, incrementation and <b>decrementation</b> can be performed in constant time.|$|E
5000|$|... is a {{theoretically}} interesting idealization of a computer. There {{are several}} variants. In most of them, each register {{can hold a}} natural number (of unlimited size), and the instructions are simple (and few in number), e.g. only <b>decrementation</b> (combined with conditional jump) and incrementation exist (and halting). The lack of the infinite (or dynamically growing) external store (seen at Turing machines) can be understood by replacing its role with Gödel numbering techniques: the fact that each register holds a natural number allows the possibility of representing a complicated thing (e.g. a sequence, or a matrix etc.) by an appropriate huge natural number — unambiguity of both representation and interpretation can be established by number theoretical foundations of these techniques.|$|E
5000|$|All 2-operand 8-bit {{arithmetic}} {{and logical}} (ALU) operations {{work on the}} 8-bit accumulator (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory cell addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination other than the accumulator are the unary incrementation or <b>decrementation</b> instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit register or on memory addressed by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and a HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved {{into any of the}} foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (MOV B,B, for instance), which are of little use, except for delays. However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., MOV M,M) instead encodes the HLT instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs.|$|E
40|$|Observing the {{existing}} {{relationships between the}} elementary operations of addition, multiplication (iteration of additions) and exponentiation (iteration of multiplications), a new operation (named incrementation) is defined, consistently with these laws and such that addition {{turns out to be}} an iteration of incrementations. Incrementation turns out to be consistent with Ackermann's function. After defining the inverse operation of incrementation (named <b>decrementation),</b> we observe that R is not closed under it. So a new set of numbers is defined (named E, Escherian numbers), such that <b>decrementation</b> is closed on it. After defining the concept of pseudoorder (analogous to the order, but not transitive), it is shown that Escherian numbers are not transitive. Then addition and multiplication on E are analysed, and a correspondence between E and C is found. Finally, incrementation is extended to C, {{in such a way that}} <b>decrementation</b> is closed on C too.

30|$|As for term size, {{we cannot}} discern any pattern from the results. The term sizes of NPL and CACM are small, {{but the results}} are very different. NPL’s PCC is the highest among the eight test sets, but CACM’s PCC is the second lowest. Cranfield and Medline have a large term size along with their high PCC, {{which is more than}} 0.9. Time has a greater term size than Cranfield and Medline, but its PCC is lower than these two. NPL has a smaller term size but a higher PCC than these two. There is no impact of term size in each test {{collection}} based on their PCC. According to our experiments, a 50 % <b>decrementation</b> of the Wikipedia index matrix yields similar results for different test collections.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} “big-step ” {{operational}} semantics {{of a small}} programming language NIL (Natural Imperative Language) in definite clauses, thus building on the fixpoint semantics of logic programs. NIL operates on a state {{which is just a}} sequence of counters. As basic statements NIL has incrementation, <b>decrementation</b> and test for null. NIL allows for sequential composition and non-deterministic choice of statements as well as mutually recursive definitions of procedures, which we find support our long-term aim of formalizing and reasoning about specific actions and planning tasks for rational agents. A novelty is the use of the de Bruijn notation instead of names. To our knowledge the operational semantics of an imperative language like NIL have not been given in definite clauses, although it is well-known that it is possible...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{regulation}} of neuroendocrine axis {{is one of}} the most important goals in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Disease modifying drugs such as chloroquine with low dose steroid is the first choice in clinical practice by some physicians. This combination therapy is evaluated by this study. Methods: This survey is a prospective study on furty patients. Variables for determining the activity index of disease were joint tenderness, joint swelling, morning stiffness and erythrocytes sedimentation rate in two years follow up. Results: <b>Decrementation</b> of disease activity index was statistically significant before and after treatment, joint tenderness (X&sup 2;= 7. 205, P= 0. 007), morning stiffness (X&sup 2;= 19. 253, P= 0. 00001), joint swelling (X&sup 2;= 14. 107, P= 0. 0001), ESR (T= 2. 428, P= 0. 02). Conclusion: The combination of chloroquine with low dose steroid is beneficial in the treatment of Rheumatoid arthriti...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} fuzzy logic controller for efficiency optimization control of a drive while keeping good dynamic response. At steady-state light-load condition, the fuzzy controller adaptively adjusts the excitation current {{with respect to the}} torque current to give the minimum total copper and iron loss. The measured input power such that, for a given load torque and speed, the drive settles down to the minimum input power, i. e., operates at maximum efficiency. The low-frequency pulsating torque due to <b>decrementation</b> of flux is compensated in a feed forward manner. If the load torque or speed commands changes, the efficiency search algorithm is abandoned and the rated flux is established to get the best dynamic response. The drive system with the proposed efficiency optimization controller has been simulated with lossy models of converter and machine, and its performance has been thoroughly investigated.
