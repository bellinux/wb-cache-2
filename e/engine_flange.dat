40|$|Abstract: Reports {{on large}} {{economic}} savings using Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{has been found}} in literature when exploiting the positive capabilities of AM. This paper evaluates the economic potential of, the AM method, laser metal deposition (LMD) in production of add-on features compared to conventional manufacturing methods. This is done by theoretical case studies, which explore factors critical to the cost of manufacturing a jet <b>engine</b> <b>flange.</b> LMD {{has the potential to be}} an economical viable alternative to conventional manufacturing methods when the manufactured component has a high buy-to-fly ratio, the component is small and complex, if the operator time can be kept to a minimum, and/or when the design freedom of LMD can be capitalized into lighter and more efficient components...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} tolerance variability of hardware, flange misalignments occur during installation of mating components for a liquid propellant rocket <b>engine.</b> <b>Flange</b> misalignments include axial, lateral, and angular offsets. If these misalignments are high, they can impart significant loads into the two mating components. These significant loads {{can then be}} a driver {{in the design of}} the propellant ducts. Such was the case for the Rocketdyne RS- 83 engine design for the Space Launch Initiative Program. To address this flange misalignment issue, Marshall Space Flight Center joined with Rocketdyne to develop and test a spherical flange system that allows for misalignment, yet reduces loads imparted, and at the same time provides sufficient sealing against leakage. The flange design was tested to evaluate and compare performance parameters such as misalignment and leakage. The environmental conditions ranged from - 100 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (F) with 1000 to 4000 pounds per square inch gage (psig) pressure. The desirable design features will be extracted and synthesized into a new flange design concept. This paper will address the spherical flange design and the test results...|$|E

The pilot made a pan-pan call but {{was able to}} land the plane without incident. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau after investigating found a fatigue crack in the <b>engine’s</b> propeller mounting <b>flange.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{functional}} (total care) products {{emerge in}} the jet engine industry, the need for product life-cycle models capable of definition and evaluation of life cycle properties increases, since functional products (FP) includes both hardware and service. Recent life-cycle models are intended for hardware products and mostly handle design and manufacturing knowledge. The aim {{of this article is}} to present a design approach that extends the evaluation capabilities beyond classical hardware design and manufacturing evaluation. The focus has been to introduce evaluation of manufacturing and post-manufacturing activities in evaluation of conceptual designs. For this purpose, a model has been proposed to handle the information flow between teams when developing structural jet engine components. A case study, in which the proposed model was used in cooperation with a jet engine component manufacturer, is presented. Aspects concerning design, manufacturing, performance, and maintenance of jet <b>engine</b> <b>flanges</b> were included in the example by means of a knowledge based engineering (KBE) -system coupled to databases and spreadsheets. The model is more suitable than recent work for the development of hardware parts of functional products (HFP), since knowledge from more product development disciplines is included. As the engineer changes the design and directly assesses the life-cycle cost (LCC) and how the changes impact the interface to other jet engine components, more knowledge on the impact of design decisions is available at hand for the engineering designer than without the mode...|$|R
40|$|Key {{airworthiness}} {{design criteria}} considerations for fragment protection {{as found in}} various FAA requirements in FAR Parts 25 and 33, and in interpretive 8110 orders are reviewed. The impact of providing aircraft armor in lieu of engine armor for typical three- and four-engine wide bodied transports for protection within {{the length of the}} engine case as well as from fragments exiting ahead of the enlet <b>engine</b> inlet <b>flange</b> is assessed. For protection within the length of the engine case, armor weight penalties, plus fuel burned and dollar cost of carrying the armor protection are defined. Immediately ahead of the inlet flange, direct tangential impacts are predominant, but further forward, rebound impacts predominate. Armor thickness requirements and fuel cost impact of protection are given...|$|R
40|$|The actual product {{ownership}} often remains with the manufacturer as functional (total care) products emerge in aerospace business agreements. The business risk is {{then transferred to}} the manufacturer why downstream knowledge needs to {{be available in the}} concept phase to consider all product life cycle aspects. The aim of this work is to study how a multidisciplinary design tool can be used to embed downstream processes for conceptual design and evaluation allowing simulation of life cycle properties. A knowledge enabled engineering approach was used to capture the engineering activities for design and evaluation of jet <b>engine</b> component <b>flanges.</b> For every design change, cost of manufacturing operations, maintenance and performance aspects can be directly assessed. The design tool assures that the engineering activities are performed accordingly to company design specification which creates a better control over the process quality. It also creates a better understanding enabling the engineers to optimize the concept in real time from an overall product life cycle view. The new tool will be the base for optimize the total product system and will be used not only between companies but also between product development departments in large global companies.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of static, fatigue and thermal testing of titanium honeycomb acoustic panels representing the acoustic tailpipe for the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft JT 8 D Refan engine which is being studied for use on the Boeing 727 - 200 airplane. Test specimens represented the <b>engine</b> and tailpipe <b>flange</b> joints, the rail to which the thrust reverser is attached and shear specimens of the tailpipe honeycomb. Specimens were made in four different batches with variations in configuration, materials and processes in each. Static strength of all test specimens exceeded the design ultimate load requirements. Fatigue test results confirmed that aluminum brazed titanium, as used in the Refan tailpipe design, meets the fatigue durability objectives. Quality of welding {{was found to be}} critical to life, with substandard welding failing prematurely, whereas welding within the process specification exceeded the panel skin life. Initial fatigue testing used short grip length bolts which failed prematurely. These were replaced with longer bolts and subsequent testing demonstrated the required life. Thermal tests indicate that perforated skin acoustic honeycomb has approximately twice the heat transfer of solid skin honeycomb...|$|R
