5000|$|Another {{witness to}} refute the {{accidental}} death theory was a vehicular expert {{who had studied}} {{the remains of the}} Morris Minor, and who testified that a joint on the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been forcibly loosened to allow petrol to flow into and beneath the motor, thus discrediting earlier defence claims that excessive heat in a burning car would invariably result in the loosening of this particular joint. (At one stage as Rouse stood in the witness box to reiterate his claims the fire had been accidental, prosecuting attorney William Norman Birkett placed the actual carburettor of Rouse's vehicle in his hands, causing Rouse to become visibly nervous as he attempted to explain earlier witness testimony as to the forcible loosening of the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and carburettor of his vehicle.) ...|$|E
50|$|In this written confession, Rouse {{stated that}} as he had driven his {{intended}} victim to the Midlands, he had encouraged him to drink from the bottle of whisky he had purchased in order to inebriate him before turning onto Hardingstone Lane. At this location, he had strangled he victim {{to the point of}} unconsciousness before loosening the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and the carburettor of his vehicle; he had then taken the petrol can from the boot and poured petrol on both the victim and about his car before placing the petrol tank in the rear of his car and, standing from a distance, setting the vehicle ablaze with a match.|$|E
50|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the vehicle revealed a joint on the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been loosened before the fire had ignited, thus allowing petrol to freely stream both into and beneath the car, indicating the blaze had been deliberate. Moreover, spectroscopic tests conducted upon the victim's blood, and a microscopic examination of his air passages revealed the victim had been alive, albeit unconscious, when the fire had started. Furthermore, he was estimated to have died within 30 seconds of {{the onset of the}} fire. The victim himself was estimated to be around 30 years old, and due to the condition of his lungs, had likely worked in an extremely dusty atmosphere throughout his life.|$|E
40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how the feed flow from such a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). The feed flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements were performed with different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of the feed flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate the feed flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> average values of several parameters characterising the feed flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> are the same for different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the impeller speed is high, the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of the feed flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> opening and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

40|$|The {{demand for}} seafood is {{continuously}} growing throughout the world, {{while the number}} of sheltered locations for fish farming is decreasing. Consequently, the industry is pushed to fin nd new and innovative solutions to this problem. One solution is to move the fish farms in non-sheltered locations, which requires extensive research on all structural parts of a fish farm, including components of the feeding system. The main goal of this thesis is to predict the hydrodynamic loads on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> used by fish farmers in the industry, which is an important aspect of design to assure successful operation. The aquaculture industry has expressed the need for increasing the knowledge on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> for fish farming. The bending of the pipes is of particular concern, especially when introducing non-sheltered locations. The hydrodynamic loads of the feed barge were obtained by generating a finite element model in GeniE and performing hydrodynamic analysis in frequency domain with the potential solver Wadam. The displacement RAOs of the feed barge were imported into OrcaFlex after conducting a sensitivity-and convergence study to verify the results. Dynamic simulations of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> were carried out in time domain using OrcaFlex, where the design basis was established using typical environmental and design data for Norwegian salmon farming. Analyses were performed under different sea states, investigating different responses of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Due to the limited work available on the force coefficients for floating pipes on the sea surface, a sensitivity study regarding the force coefficients was carried out. It was concluded to implement a variable data set for the drag-and added mass coe cient of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes.</b> The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in high loads for all <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths. The main problem that was found for the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> was the large bending moment at the connection points, i. e. at the fish cage and the feed barge. For this reason, bend stiffeners at the connection points were installed. A reduction of 846 % for the bending moment was observed with the bending stiffener attached to the pipe. To conclude, the dynamic analysis exhibits too large hydrodynamic loads for offshore use. The use of bending stiffeners seems inevitable for the harsh environment in the open sea. More research on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> must be carried out to secure safe operation offshore...|$|R
50|$|Upon being {{confronted with}} the {{forensic}} evidence that the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been loosened, Rouse remained adamant the fire had been accidental, offering conjecture {{it may have been}} started by the inebriated victim lighting the cigar he had been given after he had filled the petrol tank of his vehicle, and accidentally spilled some of the contents of the petrol tank inside his vehicle. Furthermore, when questioned as to why he had been by the two young men seen walking from the scene of the fire with a briefcase in his hand, Rouse claimed he had taken the briefcase out of the car because he had earlier noticed the man had placed his hand upon it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prosecution}} contention at Rouse's {{trial was}} that the actual motive behind Rouse's committing this murder had been to fabricate his own death in order that he could escape the financial constraints brought about by his numerous affairs, and to simply start his life afresh. To emphasise this, William Birkett called three of his mistresses to testify, explaining to the jury the testimony of these women would illustrate that [...] "Rouse's domestic life was not what it should have been". Also to testify was a Government fire and insurance inspector named Colonel Cuthbert Buckle, who demonstrated to the jury how, in his view, the fire had been deliberately started by what he termed [...] "human agency", with a deliberate loosening of the locknut of the petrol <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rouse himself {{testified in}} his own defence at his trial.

He would often perform poorly in the witness box; repeatedly being forced to either admit to the contradictions in the earlier statements he had provided to police and his current claims, or that he had lied about his actions or movements. He could not, for instance, explain why he had falsely claimed to his mistress in Glamorganshire that his car had been stolen in Northamptonshire and that he had reported the theft to police, or why this mistress had earlier testified that when he had arrived at her house on 6 November he had smelled of petrol, and his eyebrows had appeared slightly scorched.|$|E

50|$|Throughout his trial, Rouse {{stuck to}} his claim {{the death of the}} unknown man had been accidental. To support this contention, Donald Finnemore {{introduced}} an engineer who testified that in many instances, excessive heat in a burning car would invariably result in the loosening of the joint on the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe,</b> and as such, Rouse's contention the victim had inadvertently set the vehicle ablaze could be true. This claim was refuted by both Sir Bernard Spilsbury and Dr. Eric Shaw, who had together performed an autopsy upon the unidentified victim and who were each called to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Both men testified that the victim had been alive and unconscious when the fire had been started, and that the mallet found near the Morris Minor had likely been the weapon used used to club the victim about the head prior to the inception of the fire. Spilsbury further testified that one the few fragments of clothing found upon the victim not to have been destroyed in the fire was a section of the fork of the victim's trousers, which was found to be soaked in petrol, thus corroborating the prosecution's contention that Rouse had extensively doused both his victim and his vehicle in petrol before setting his vehicle ablaze. This forensic claim would be challenged by the defence, who alleged the petrol stain supported Rouse's claims the victim may have spilled the petrol over himself while lunging in a drunken stupor.|$|E

The product mean size increases with increasing circulation rate in the loop, with increasing feed point mixing intensity, with decreasing feed rate and with decreasing feed pipe diameter. Increased mixing intensity on any level leads to larger product crystals, but especially the rate of mesomixing is of importance.

The analysis of the residence time distribution functions revealed different flow patterns according to different regions of the polymerization column. We estimated the stagnant volume of each polymerization zone by comparing the experimental mean residence time and corresponding nominal residence time, defined as the ratio between the total volume of the zone and the volumetric flow rate. The detection of some important flow anomalies occurring in the 3 rd and 4 th zones of the polymerization column indicates the positions requiring an improvement of hydrodynamic regime.

40|$|International audienceExperiments {{are carried}} out with {{substitution}} fluids (air and water), without heat and mass transfer on a rocket engine mockup. The work presented here intends to reproduce the experimental results using incompressible twophase flow simulations. The geometry used {{is representative of the}} experimental mockupcomposed of a <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe,</b> a dome, and a number of injectors. The objective of the paper is to adapt a Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model approach to simulate the filling of a dome and to test its ability to reproduce some experimental evidences. The main difficulties to be faced are the fast transients in a complex geometry, including in particular the valve opening sequence, and the drastic evolution of the two-phase flow regime as the flow evolves from gas only to liquid only. An important work has been conducted to obtain the proper inlet conditions to be imposed in the code in coherence with the experiments. The influences of the turbulence modeling and the interfacial momentum transfer modeling are also studied. The former has no macroscopic or local effect on the mass flow rate of water, the mass of water in the dome, and the dome pressure. The drag model, however, has a major impact on the results as much globally as locally. The Simmer-like drag model is preferred in comparison to the Large Interface Model, due to a better agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, it has to be highlighted that the Simmer-like model is very sensitive to the inclusion diameter...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{thermomechanical}} refining is {{a critical}} step for the manufacturing of medium density fiberboard (MDF). To increase productivity and improve fiber quality with a reduction in energy consumption during refining, {{it is essential to}} determine appropriate refining conditions, such as the chips retention time (accumulated chip height, CH) in the pre-heater, feeding screw revolution speed (SR) in the chip <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe,</b> and the opening ratio of the discharge valve (OV) in the discharge pipe. Using multiple regression analysis, relationships between the response variables (the total fibers, the specific energy consumption obtained by the motor power consumption/the total amount of dry fibers, and the percentage of qualified fibers) and the predictor variables (OV, CH, and SR) were modeled. Specific energy consumption decreased with an increase in CH. When more chips were stored in the pre-heater, the chips were softened by the extended steam-treatment time, reducing the energy consumption. There were negative relationships between the percentage of qualified fibers and the predictor variables (OV and SR). It was reasoned that a greater proportion of coarse fibre was produced when the discharge valve opening ratio or the feeding screw speed increased. This resulted in a reduction in the percentage of qualified fibers. Due to the large sample size (1667 measurements for each variable) in this study, the resulting regression equations can be applied to estimate the productivity, energy consumption, and fiber quality during refining in an MDF mill...|$|E

40|$|A rather {{complete}} {{mathematical model}} for a Common Rail injection-system dynamics numerical simulation was developed to support experimentation, layout and control design, as well as performance optimization. The thermo-fluid dynamics of the hydraulic system components, including rail, connecting pipes and injectors was modeled {{in conjunction with the}} solenoid-circuit electromagnetics and the mechanics of mobile elements. Onedimensional flow equations in conservation form were used to simulate wave propagation phenomena throughout the high-pressure connecting pipes, including the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> of the injector nozzle. In order to simulate the temperature variations due to the fuel compressibility, the energy equation was used in addition to mass conservation and momentum balance equations. Besides, the possible cavitation phenomena effects on the mass flow rate through the injector bleed orifice and the nozzle holes were taken into account. A simple model of the electromagnetic driving circuit was used to predict the temporal distribution of the force acting on the pilot-valve anchor. It was based on the experimental time-histories of the current through the solenoid and of the associated voltage that is provided by the electronic control unit (ECU) to the solenoid valve. The numerical code was validated through the comparison of the prediction results with experimental data, that is, pressure, injected flow rate and needle lift time-histories, taken on a high performance test bench Moehwald-Bosch MEP 2000 -CA 4000. The novel injection-system mathematical model was applied to the analysis of transient flows through the hydraulic circuit of a commercial multijet second-generation Common Rail system, paying specific attention to the wave propagation phenomena, to their dependence on solenoid energizing time and rail pressure, as well as to their effects on system performance.

40|$|Hawaiian calderas form by {{collapse}} {{during the}} last stages of growth of shield volcanoes built by frequent eruptions of tholeiitic basalt.

They may never have formed on some volcanoes, and all are partly or wholly filled by continued eruption. Toward {{the end of the}} filling activity slows, and alkalic lavas complete the filling and build a thin cap over the caldera. Gravity studies reveal masses of ultra-dense rocks only 1 - 2 km below the surface of several of the volcanoes-perhaps olivine-rich cumulates in the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> of the volcano, or perhaps protrusions of the mantle. The idea that these may have led to formation of the calderas by isostatic sinking of a heavy column culminating in the caldera appears to be negated by the facts that some calderas show no associated gravity high, in some the high is offset {{to one side of the}} caldera, and some highs are not associated with any apparent caldera collapse. Caldera formation probably depends on the formation of a magma reservoir within the mass of the shield volcano, with its top within a few kilometers of the summit of the shield. The Glen Coe mechanism of caldera formation seems to be ruled out by the lack of upward displacement of magma around the sinking block. Caldera collapse is probably the result of sinking of a block bounded by inward-dipping conical fractures, permitted by distension of the top of the volcano and removal of support due to drainage of magma into the rift zones, with or without flank eruption. The distension of both the summit region and the rift zones may result from a lateral spreading of the lower part of the ultra-dense core of the volcano...|$|E

The strike-slip regime was obtained using a mobile rigid basal plate sliding horizontally. Boundary conditions were chosen in order to analyze the influence of different rheologic profiles of the upper crust on {{the pattern of the}} intrusion. Experiments showed that: 1) intrusions are elongate and their long axis tends to track the principal stretching direction associated with the strike-slip regime, 2) intrusions are asymmetric shaped in horizontal view, with the development of a sheared tail trailing behind the intrusion, 3) the strike slip environment allowed local rising of the injected fluid along faults formed in the overburden, 4) when the crustal rheologic profile is similar in both sides of the shear zone, intrusions are asymmetric drop shaped, 5) when the viscosity of materials above the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> is higher that viscosity of materials of {{the other side of the}} shear zone, the asymmetric drop shape not appears.
