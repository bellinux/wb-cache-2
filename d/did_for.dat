5|$|Baeyertz did {{not intend}} to convert to Christianity when she married him, but she {{subsequently}} <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the sake of her children. Her husband {{died as a result of}} a shooting accident in 1871, whereupon she experienced a full conversion to Christianity. She spent the following few years giving sermons and, by 1879, she was featured speaker for a YWCA campaign of sermons, before spending a decade conducting Christian missions around Victoria.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as <b>did,</b> <b>for</b> instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he rarely <b>did</b> <b>for</b> presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Mario explores Princess Peach's {{castle and}} must rescue her from Bowser. As {{one of the}} earlier 3D {{platform}} games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites. The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. <b>did</b> <b>for</b> 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, {{in addition to the}} occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games, and the same visual style.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sequel}} series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit {{occasionally}} {{serves as the}} spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself {{to listen to her}} past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Hardy {{is the son}} of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy, and {{the younger}} brother of Matt Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986, when Hardy was nine. He {{developed}} an interest in motocross aged 12 and got his first bike, a Yamaha YZ-80, at age 13. He had his first race when he was in ninth grade. Hardy played baseball as a child, but had to stop after he crashed during a motocross race, injuring his arm. He also played football during high school as a fullback and linebacker. He briefly competed in amateur wrestling in high school. He had to stop playing football in high school, after he was ordered to pick between professional wrestling and football, and he chose wrestling. Hardy's favorite subjects in school were U.S. history and art, which he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> extra credit.|$|E
5|$|Lambda is an {{advanced}} lifeform created on Fodra. His mistreatment by humans fueled his hatred towards them. During the party's childhood, he resides inside Richard {{after he was}} injured by Sophie and as a result, saved Richard's life. Seven years later, Lambda is reawakened when Richard receives a fatal wound. Lambda empowers Richard and manipulates him to achieve his goals of destroying humanity. After he is defeated by the party, Lambda is absorbed by Asbel who convinces him to give humans a chance. In Lineage and Legacies, he absorbs Fodra's consciousness to dissuade her hatred as Asbel <b>did</b> <b>for</b> him. He is voiced by Shigeru Nakahara and dubbed by Keith Silverstein.|$|E
5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems <b>did</b> <b>for</b> George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by {{swinging}} on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E

5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy <b>did</b> <b>for</b> her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. Under the reformed Kirk, divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1955, viewers {{were able}} to see {{first-hand}} what Perry <b>did</b> <b>for</b> a living before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they <b>did</b> <b>for</b> five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks. Newell {{said that they would}} have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would have allowed Valve to provide the same feature set that it <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the PlayStation 3, but later said that {{cross-platform}} play would not be present in {{the final version of the}} game. Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{colocation}} of the Angels and Apostles {{as well as}} the affinity {{between them}} suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, though at the end, it devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, the Angels of Tamagnino are far superior to the Apostles. In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa, and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano <b>did</b> <b>for</b> his Apostles.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy <b>did</b> <b>for</b> her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E
