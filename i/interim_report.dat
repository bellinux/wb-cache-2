5|$|On 26 February, an <b>interim</b> <b>report</b> {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth <b>interim</b> <b>report</b> of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
40|$|International Analysis This study {{examines}} empirically {{the extent to}} which the frequency of <b>interim</b> financial <b>reporting</b> affects stock price volatility over the course of the fiscal year in four countries with different <b>interim</b> <b>reporting</b> regimes: the United States and Canada with quarterly reporting, and Great Britain and Australia with semi-annual <b>interim</b> <b>reporting.</b> It is hypothesized that, in the tradeoff between timeliness and predictive value of the <b>interim</b> <b>reports,</b> semi-annual <b>interim</b> <b>reporting</b> will lead to lesser price volatility after accounting for other potential influences. Results found support this hypothesis, with price volatility much lower in Great Britain (and to a lesser extend Australia) than in the United States and Canada. The results support the conclusion that quarterly <b>interim</b> financial <b>reporting</b> appears to induce greater capital market volatility than semiannual reporting...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} firms that voluntarily provide <b>interim</b> financial <b>reports.</b> Based on a sample of Swiss companies, where semi-annual reports became mandatory in 1997, I document that before <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> became mandatory, analyst coverage, i. e. analysts 2 ̆ 019 demand for disclosure, affected the management decision on the regularity of <b>interim</b> <b>reporting</b> significantly. Higher information asymmetry, measured by the percentage of intangibles in the firm, increases the supply of <b>interim</b> <b>reports.</b> However, companies that provide more regular <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> do not face less uncertainty among analysts, i. e. the standard deviation among analyst forecasts is not decreasing with reporting frequency. Further analyses reveal that analyst forecasts become significantly more accurate for firms with more regular <b>interim</b> <b>reports.</b> Finally, the results indicate that, voluntary interim reporters face significant negative abnormal returns around earnings announcement, when they report a profit, which fails to meet expectations. This underlines the importance of careful communication and earnings expectations guidance...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between audit committee characteristics and the decision to engage external auditors to review published <b>interim</b> <b>reports.</b> The motivation for the study derives from the consensus notion that the audit committee enhances the quality of financial <b>reporting.</b> Using <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> of 258 UK listed companies published in the period 2001 – 2002, the results of logistic regression analyses show that the likelihood of engaging an external auditor to review <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> increases with audit committee independence and financial expertise and decreases with share ownership by audit committee members. The results show that audit committee size {{and the number of}} audit committee meetings are not significantly associated with the decision to engage auditors in <b>interim</b> <b>reporting.</b> Taken overall, these findings suggest that an effective audit committee is associated with a review of <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> by external auditors...|$|R
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an <b>interim</b> <b>report</b> on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that the average reporting lag of Belgian <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> is large but has decreased slightly over the years 1991 - 1998. Contrary to US findings, we show that the disclosure of <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> containing bad (good) news is not systematically delayed (speeded up). <b>Interim</b> <b>reports</b> are value relevant since good (bad) news, according to a naïve earnings expectations model, induces positive (negative) abnormal returns.

40|$|<b>Interim</b> <b>reports</b> are summary {{statements}} {{that are usually}} prepared in semi-annual format in the UK. Until the EU’s Transparency Directive was put into practice in the UK in 2007, there was no legal necessity for companies to provide <b>interim</b> financial <b>reports.</b> (Note 1) Instead such preparation was only a regulatory requirement of the London Stock Exchange. The responsibility on companies listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide these financial reports was first prepared as an suggestion in 1964, {{to meet the requirements}} for updates by financial analysts (May, 1971). In 1973, this advice to provide the market with interim information became a requirement for the admission of stocks and securities to be listed on the stock Exchange (Lunt, 1982). This study investigates the preparation of <b>interim</b> <b>reports,</b> and accounting standards for <b>interim</b> <b>reporting.</b> Also, this study discusses the main purpose of <b>interim</b> <b>reports,</b> the methods of preparation and the benefits of reporting frequency...|$|R

40|$|Mandating <b>interim</b> <b>reporting</b> is lively {{discussed}} in Europe, {{especially since the}} European Union has set up mandatory quarterly reporting on the agenda. By examining the Swiss stock market, in which <b>interim</b> <b>reporting</b> became mandatory in 1997, we find that tightening disclosure frequency by mandating <b>interim</b> financial <b>reports</b> has a very limited and thus not convincing impact on information asymmetry. We suspect that firms that did not provide <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> {{on a voluntary basis}} prior to the new rules potentially anticipated the insignificance of a greater information environment in their specific situation and thus reasonably chose not to publish costly <b>interim</b> <b>reports.</b> Further analysis supports this hypothesis and documents that firms affected by the new rules did not experience an enhancement in their information environment simply because they have already been characterized by lower information asymmetry before the regulation became effective. They thus obviously chose other disclosure channels possibly more appropriate in their specific situation in order to decrease information asymmetry. The question whether firms should really be obliged to provide financial <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> must therefore be further challenged by asking for the objectives of the regulation. If the main objective is decreasing information asymmetry, our results suggest that regulation partly fails...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} studies conducted, and reports published, by {{international}} and local accounting bodies {{have found that the}} proliferation of disclosures in financial reports has hampered users’ understanding of these reports.
