Monomer reactivity ratios for glycidyl acrylate-acrylonitrile copolymerization, and for glycidylacrylate-styrene copoymerization were respectively determined.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{hydrophilic}} polymer {{surface with}} low friction has been devel-oped. A coating can be attached by {{the reaction of}} an epoxy containing poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) with the polyamino compound formed {{on the surface of}} the substrate. The epoxy containing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was obtained by the copolymerization of vinyl pyrrolidone, <b>glycidyl</b> <b>acrylate,</b> and vinyl acetate. A molecular weight of 400, 000 or more is essential to achieve low surface friction. Polyurethane catheters in rabbit models, both with and without the hydro-philic low friction coating, were evaluated for surface friction coefficient and blood compatibility. The coated catheters produced no lesions of the intima of the blood vessels and no thrombus formation on the catheter surface, while the non-coated catheters injured the intima of the blood vessels and severe throm-bus formation was found on their surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene {{copolymers}} {{with different}} polar comonomers, such as vinyl acetate, methyl <b>acrylate,</b> <b>glycidyl</b> methacrylate, and maleic anhydride, {{were used for}} the preparation of polymer/clay nanocomposites by statically annealing their mechanical mixtures with different commercial or home-made organically modified montmorillonites containing only one long alkyl tail. The nanostructure of the products was monitored by X-ray diffraction, and the dispersion of the silicate particles within the polymer matrix was qualitatively evaluated through microscopic analyses. The effect of the preparation conditions on the structure and the morphology of the composites was also addressed through the characterization of selected samples with similar composition prepared by melt compounding. In agreement with the findings reported in a previous paper for the composites filled with two-tailed organoclays, intercalation of the copolymer chains within the tighter galleries of the one-tailed clays occurs easily, independent of the application of a mechanical stress. However, the shear-driven break-up of the intercalated clay particles into smaller platelets (exfoliation) seems more hindered. A collapse of the organoclay interlayer spacing was only observed clearly for a commercial one-tailed organoclay – Cloisite® 30 B – whereas the same effect was almost negligible for a home-made organoclay with similar structure...|$|R
40|$|Blends of PET {{with the}} {{different}} commercial co(ter) polymer compatibilisers were prepared {{and the effect}} of their glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) content and viscosity on the blend properties was determined. The efficiency of compatibilisation of the commercial co(ter) polymer in the ternary blends was examined and compared. For all the ternary blends (PET/EPR/co(ter) polymer, the PET content was fixed at 70 wt% of the total weight of the blends. Higher compatibilisation effect was found in PET/EPR blends compatibilised with the commercial copolymer ethylene glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA 8 (5)) containing 8 % GMA and MFI = 5 (g/ 10 min) was achieved as reflected in the observed higher elongation at break when compared to corresponding blends compatibilised with the methyl acrylate containing terpolymer ethylene methyl <b>acrylate</b> <b>glycidyl</b> methacrylate EM-GMA 8 (6) containing 8 % GMA and MFI = 6 (g/ 10 min). The presence of methyl acrylate ester groups in the commercial terpolymer EM-GMA (containing similar amount of GMA and same MFI) resulted in low level of compatibilisation due to the possibility of a higher extent of branching and crosslinking resulting from the presence of the ester groups and this would be responsible for the observed lower elongation, and the less favourable morphology observed. Further, the more bulky structure of the terpolymer compared to the copolymer would give rise to a more difficult migration to the interface, thus lowering the efficiency of compatibilisation. However, the morphology of both blends compatibilised with either the terpolymer or the copolymer were not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|A novel UV-induced procedure, in the {{presence}} of <b>glycidyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> and proper radical/cationic photoinitiators, is here proposed to promote the in situ grafting of a methacrylic polymer network to the surface of natural cellulose fibers. As a result, composite polymer membranes reinforced by cellulose handsheets are obtained and demonstrate excellent mechanical features. The reactivity of the monomers is studied by FT-IR in real time measurements and the successful grafting is confirmed by surface spectroscopies. The polymer membranes prepared show high elastic modulus and tensile resistance and maintain high flexibility even after activation by swelling into a standard liquid electrolyte solution. The swelling procedure allowed us to obtain high ionic conductivity and remarkable electrochemical behavior when tested in laboratory scale lithium polymer cells. The system shows attractive features such as intrinsic safety, eco-compatibility, and low production cost and industrialization potentials, and is highly suitable for the rapidly expanding field of Li-based flexible batteries...|$|E
40|$|Photoinduced living radical {{polymerization}} of acrylates is achieved upon UV irradiation (λmax ≈ 360 nm) {{in the presence}} of an aliphatic tertiary amine ligand (Me 6 -Tren) {{in the presence of}} low concentrations of CuBr 2, yielding poly(acrylates) with near perfect retention of end group fidelity. The effect {{of the nature of the}} solvent on the rate of polymerization was investigated in order to expand the scope and identify the limitations of the system. Subsequently, a range of acrylic monomers containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic substituents have been screened, including lauryl acrylate, octadecyl acrylate and diethylene glycol ethyl ether acrylate, all of which present low dispersities (Đ ≈ 1. 1) at very high conversions. Functional monomers, including <b>glycidyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> and solketal acrylate, were also found to be tolerant to the photomediated reaction. Finally, solketal acrylate was copolymerized with methyl acrylate which, following deprotection of the pendant ketal group, furnished an amphiphilic diblock copolymer. Self-assembly of this block copolymer into polymer micelles in aqueous media was exemplified by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{polymerisation}} (ECP) of non conducting polymers to form thin, passive {{films on}} electrodes has received attention {{in recent years}} as a potential adhesion promotion technique. Work on carbon electrodes with applications in the carbon fibre composite industry have shown {{that it is possible to}} enhance adhesion of carbon fibres to the composite matrix through ECP pretreatments. ECP to produce passive coatings on metals has also been studied, however much of this work is concerned with production of corrosion inhibiting films, rather than adhesion promoting layers. ECP methods are a promising alternative to the chromate pretreatments and primers presently used to improve the adhesion and corrosion resistance of organic coatings on metals. This is because they can be non toxic, offer the possibility of pinhole free coatings and can be produced insitu, preventing the need for separate processing. Thin, uniform, reproducible polymer coatings based upon poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly (<b>glycidyl</b> <b>acrylate)</b> (PGA) were produced on stainless steel cathodes from dilute aqueous sulphuric acid containing potassium persulphate. Electrochemical activities of the solutions were identified by cyclic voltammetry. The polymers were confirmed to be PMMA and PGA by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thickness of the coatings (between 30 and 400 nm) were measured by ellipsometry, and found to increase with increasing treatment time and with less negative electrode potential. The porosity of the coatings was assessed electrochemically and after an annealing treatment the porosity and coating thickness were both found to decrease for the PMMA coatings and remain relatively unchanged for the PGA coatings. The morphology of the ECP coatings were studied by various microscopy techniques. Further characterisation of the PMMA coatings was undertaken in order to clarify the polymerisation mechanism. This involved differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility studies. A free radical polymerisation mechanism has been proposed in which the radicals are long lived resulting in post electrolysis polymerisation and very high molecular weights. The PMMA and PGA ECP coatings were used as tie layers in adhesion tests by adhering aluminium studs onto the ECP surface with the desired adhesive and subsequently pulling the stud off at a reproducible rate with an Instron tensile testing machine. It was conclusively shown that the adhesion strength between the stainless steel and a cyanoacrylate adhesive was improved by the presence of the PMMA ECP tie layer. In contrast the adhesion of the PMMA ECP tie layer to a standard epoxy adhesive was very poor. The adhesion of the PGA ECP tie layers to the stainless steel substrate was too great to be measured by the standard epoxy adhesive, therefore a toughened adhesive was employed to measure the strength of the interaction between the PGA layers and the stainless steel. This study demonstrates that the ECP technique can be used to improve adhesion of metals to adhesives if the tie layers are chemically compatible with both the metallic oxide and the adhesive. The adhesion is proposed to be improved by increased primary and/or secondary bonding at these interfaces and by excellent interfacial contact between the metallic electrode and the electropolymerised tie layer...|$|E
