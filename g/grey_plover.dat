40|$|The {{time and}} energy budgets of <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> (Pluvialis squatarola) at Teesmouth were {{investigated}} by observation of birds both by day and night, supplemented by additional information from a radio telemetry study and laboratory measurements of metabolic rates. The radio telemetry study of <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> confirmed that, on Seal Sands, some birds defended low water feeding territories, whilst others were non-territorial. This behaviour was maintained both diurnally and nocturnally, with territorial birds defending the same areas at night as by day. However territorial birds occasionally vacated their territories to forage on other areas at Teesmouth. Multivariate statistical methods characterised {{the conditions under which}} these birds changed foraging locations. The low-water time budgets of territorial birds were determined for both diurnal and nocturnal periods. No statistical differences could be found between these two budgets. The birds spent an extremely high (in excess of 90 %) percentage of time foraging over the low water observation period. The diurnal low water time budget of non-territorial individuals was also determined and compared with that of territorial birds. The calorific intake rates of territorial birds during the daylight hours showed significant seasonal changes, characterised by a rise to a mid-winter peak, followed by a steady decline to mid March. This pattern may have been influenced by the temperature on the day of measurement. Respirometric measurements on <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> produced an estimate of their fasting metabolic rate, together with values for lower critical temperature and the rate of increase of metabolic rate with temperature below lower critical temperature. These measurements were consistent with estimates produced from general allometric equations. Information on the time budgets of territorial <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers,</b> and measurements of metabolic parameters, enabled a simple energy budget to be constructed for the birds at Teesmouth...|$|R
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and <b>grey</b> <b>plover</b> winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E
25|$|Below the outfall, Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve {{is located}} {{to the east}} among the dunes and saltings. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Ramsar site, which {{provides}} a diverse habitat for birds such as <b>grey</b> <b>plover</b> and knot, plants including brackish water crowfoot and insects including the red-banded sand-wasp, among others. Gibraltar Point Sailing Club is located at Gibraltar Point, and the east {{bank of the river}} channel is used for mooring yachts. Now called Wainfleet Harbour, the channel crosses sand and mudflats to reach Wainfleet Swatch, an area of water protected from the North Sea by the Inner Knock sandbank at low water. The area to the south of Wainfleet Harbour is called Wainfleet Sand and is a danger area. It has been used for artillery practice since at least 1890, but may have been used for cannon and musketry practice long before that. More recently, it was part of RAF Wainfleet, and was used for weaponry practice by aircraft, until the closure of the range in December 2009.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{intertidal}} habitats by <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers,</b> Pluvialis squatarola, and Curlews, Numenius arquata, was studied on Seal Sands in the Tees estuary, north-east England {{during the}} three winters 1975 - 78. Birds were uniquely marked with combinations of colour rings to obtain information on the behaviour of individuals throughout and in successive winters. <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> arrived on the estuary from July to February, giving rise to peak numbers in February, but left mainly in March and April. Thus periods of stay by individuals varied markedly, M contrast most Curlews arrived in late summer and left in spring. Consequently most individuals were present for similar periods, and {{the number on the}} estuary remained constant through the winter. However, the number of Curlews feeding on Seal Sands fell to a minimum in mid winter when some moved to feed on the fields. Both species showed a high percentage return rate to the estuary in successive winters. During each tidal cycle individuals changed their feeding sites in predictable ways. For any one bird the pattern was constant over periods of several weeks or months, and sometimes repeated in successive winters. In both species, four basic patterns in use of space could be identified. These were distinguished by: i) whether one or more than one feeding site was used during a tidal cycle, and ii) whether or not a feeding site was defended. The strategy employed on a particular site could be predicted from two characteristics of that site: i) its period of exposure, and ii) the rate of drainage of the substrate. It is argued that these characteristics determine the availability of Nereis diversicolor, the main prey of both bird species on Seal Sands. Simple models based on the supposed activity and depth distribution of Nereis on different sites explained much of the variety in use of space shown by individual <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> and Curlews both during a tidal cycle and during a winter. However the models were inadequate to explain the detailed components of foraging behaviour observed. Also, variability in the foraging responses to changes in Nereis availability was considerable, both between individuals and between days for the same individual; this raises doubts over the validity of studies based on "average" birds. Curlews show marked sexual dimorphism in bill length. This influenced the pattern in use of space employed by individuals. Most long-billed birds remained on the mudflats all winter, but many short-billed individuals (i, e. males) fed upon the adjacent pastures, particularly in mid winter when Nereis was most likely to be buried out of reach of their bills...|$|R

40|$|The repair {{jobs that}} birds {{have to do}} to {{maintain}} high quality plumage take energy and time, so should be under intense selection. Recently, we have shown that secondary moult in the Eurasian Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria is incomplete, irregular and asymmetric between wings, and argued that this reflected their ‘relaxed’ migratory habits. On the basis of this hypothesis, we predict that relatives of this species that have to make long flights between breeding areas and winter quarters would invest more in the moult of secondaries. To test this we collected data on moult patterns in two populations of Pacific Golden Plovers Pluvialis fulva (Siberia and Alaska), on American Golden Plovers Pluvialis dominica (Alaska) and <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis squatarola. Data were from the breeding, staging (Mongolia and Indiana) and wintering (Uruguay) areas. We found patterns consistent with our prediction: Pacific Golden Plovers from Siberia, and <b>Grey</b> <b>Plovers</b> have a similar moulting pattern to Eurasian Golden Plovers. Although both go to remote winter quarters, they migrate mainly over land, probably making short or moderate flights, as they are able to stage frequently. In contrast, the Alaskan populations of Pacific Golden Plovers and American Golden Plovers tend to renew all their secondaries from their second wing moult onwards. In line with their moult patterns, these two populations are known to make very long non-stop flights between breeding and winter areas. We argue that irregular moult and the partial renewal of secondaries is a primitive character in all four species. The full replacement of secondaries in the Pacific Golden Plovers and American Golden Plovers from Alaska may be considered as an adaptation for very long demanding flights. Regular moult patterns of secondaries, as found in many other shorebirds, could be a further refinement of this adaptation. ...|$|R
