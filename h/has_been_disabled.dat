The early buzz about B {{was that he was}} making outsider art and England is probably the closest he comes to that standard. He has ideas about what the creation of spoken word poetry and ambient music entails but it's quite clear he hasn’t taken a ton of time to study those forms." [...] David Morris of Tiny Mix Tapes said that although the album is [...] "conceptually daring" [...] and a showcase for Lil B's [...] "poetic, philosophical streak", he called the musical backing [...] "utter garbage" [...] and [...] "pure, unstructured noodling". Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be [...] "left-field and trendy" [...] on Lil B's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press. The Quietus praised the album as [...] "baffling, flawed but utterly engrossing", and said Lil B's flow is [...] "more measured but no less dexterous than his contemporaries, and the pace of his eloquent, brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien, frosted glass synth sounds and syrupy electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here. Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant, a man whose inner filter <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>disabled,</b> creating something which may polarise but which is, at least, utterly distinctive." [...] Daniel Levin Becker wrote in Dusted that, despite its unconventionality, the album is [...] "irredeemably bad".|$|E
