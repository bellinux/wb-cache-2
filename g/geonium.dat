50|$|At the University of Washington, Hans Dehmelt {{captured}} single {{charged particles}} in very stable orbits in a Penning trap. This arrangement, called <b>geonium,</b> enabled {{measurement of the}} magnetic moment of the electron with exquisite precision for which Dehmelt won the Nobel Prize. Brown became fascinated with this new experimental procedure and with coworkers wrote many papers investigating the detailed workings of <b>geonium.</b> His work culminated in a long review article (Brown & Gabrielse 1986) {{that has become a}} handbook for other experimenters who use a Penning trap.|$|E
50|$|A <b>geonium</b> atom, {{so named}} because it is bound to the earth, is a pseudo-atomic system created in a Penning trap, useful for {{measuring}} fundamental parameters of particles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{properties}} of <b>geonium</b> {{are different from}} a typical atom. The charge undergoes cyclotron motion around the trap axis and oscillates along the axis. An inhomogeneous magnetic [...] "bottle field" [...] is applied to measure the quantum properties by the [...] "continuous Stern-Gerlach" [...] technique. Energy levels and g-factor of the particle can be measured with high precision. Van Dyck, Jr et al. explored the magnetic splitting of <b>geonium</b> spectra in 1978 and in 1987 published high-precision measurements of electron and positron g-factors, which constrained the electron radius.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{comments}} are provided on Rogers’s model experiment {{to measure the}} circular Unruh vacuum noise {{by means of a}} hyperbolic Penning trap inside a microwave cavity. It is suggested that cylindrical Penning traps, being geometrically simpler, and controlled almost at the same level of accuracy as the hyperbolic trap, might be a better choice for such an experiment. Besides, the microwave modes of the trap itself, of known analytical structure, can be directly used in trying to obtain measurable results for such a tiny noise effect. PACS 03. 65.

Pj- Optical cooling of atoms; trapping The physics of electromagnetic traps is an extremely vigorous discipline, both theoretically and experimentally speaking [1].

50|$|He {{created the}} first <b>geonium</b> atom in 1976, which he then used to measure precise {{magnetic}} moments of the electron and positron with R. S. Van Dyck into the 1980s, work {{that led to his}} Nobel prize. In 1979 Dehmelt led a team that took the first photo of a single atom. He continued work on ion traps at the University of Washington, until his retirement in October 2002.|$|E
50|$|A Penning trap is {{a device}} for {{the storage of}} charged {{particles}} using a homogeneous axial magnetic field and an inhomogeneous quadrupole electric field. This kind of trap is particularly well suited to precision measurements of properties of ions and stable subatomic particles. <b>Geonium</b> atoms have been created and studied this way, to measure the electron magnetic moment. Recently these traps {{have been used in}} the physical realization of quantum computation and quantum information processing by trapping qubits. Penning traps are used in many laboratories worldwide. For example, at CERN to store antimatter like antiprotons.|$|E
40|$|By substituting the {{relativistic}} {{spin state}} {{dependence of the}} cyclotron frequency for the continuous Stern-Gerlach effect and running the <b>geonium</b> atom as a microsynchrocyclotron accelerator we have detected spin flips of the individual trapped electron. In our initial efforts {{we have been able}} to obtain a simple symmetric spin resonance about 4 -fold narrower instead of a complex asymmetric one and also to support but not as yet seriously test the result of the earlier <b>geonium</b> "S" work, g/ 2 = 1. 001 159 652 185 5 (40) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{presented}} the realisation of `The <b>Geonium</b> Chip', a novel planar Penning trap. The chip is designed {{with the goal}} of building a truly scalable planar Penning trap, while retaining the accuracy of 3 D traps. Manufactured with conventional metalon- silicon microfabrication techniques, the chip takes the 5 electrodes of the compensated cylindrical trap and projects them onto a ground-plane surface, thus forming the basis for its layout by reducing the electrode shape to an array of at rectangular surfaces. In this thesis I describe the conception, design and construction of a full cryogenic set-up, including the magnetics, for trapping and observing a single electron in the <b>Geonium</b> Chip Penning trap. The cyclotron mode of the trapped electron lies in the microwave regime, and thus the <b>Geonium</b> Chip has the potential to become a powerful building block for quantum microwave circuits, with coherent coupling to the cyclotron degree of freedom. This will also allow non-destructive measurement and interaction with the spin state of the electron. The development of the experimental process is detailed from scratch including the design, fabrication, and testing of the <b>Geonium</b> Chip, as well as the design, fabrication and testing of the experimental apparatus. The original solutions and space saving designs developed as part of the construction process are detailed, such as the custom on-chip cryogenic vacuum chamber, planar magnetic field source, and the LED-based electron loading system. The vacuum chamber and control systems are also described, and the in-house manufacturing capabilities of the <b>Geonium</b> group are detailed at length, with an emphasis on rapid prototyping high-accuracy components suitable for experimental use. The apparatus built within this PhD is within a few weeks of performing the first loading of electrons into the chip trap...|$|E
40|$|A novel planar Penning trap is presented, {{which results}} from the {{projection}} of the well-known three-dimensional cylindrical trap {{onto the surface of}} a chip. The introduced trap is also a coplanar-waveguide cavity, similar to those used in circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments with superconducting two-level systems. It opens up the possibility of integrating a single trapped electron, or <b>geonium</b> atom, into quantum circuits. The trap is an elliptical Penning trap, with the magnetic field parallel to the chip's surface. A design procedure is described, which permits the compensation of electric anharmonicities up to sixth order. This should render possible the observation of a single trapped electron and the accurate measurement of its eigenfrequencies, a sine qua non requirement for a useful planar <b>geonium</b> technology...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the classic}} work of McMillan and of Bohm and Foldy, we have {{developed}} a phase equation describing the microsynchrocyclotron acceleration process in <b>geonium.</b> By computer integration of this equation, {{we are able to}} confirm that, by making use of the slight relativistic spin dependence of the zero-energy cyclotron frequencies, the acceleration process can be made selective enough to distinguish between spin-up and spin-down states. Quantum effects have been allowed for approximately...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} some {{background}} {{information and a}} summary of results in atomic supersymmetry. The connection between the supersymmetric Coulomb and oscillator problems in arbitrary dimensions is outlined. Next, I treat the issue of finding a description of supersymmetry-based quantum-defect theory in terms of oscillators. A model with an anharmonic term that yields analytical eigenfunctions is introduced {{to solve this problem}} in arbitrary dimensions. Finally, I show that <b>geonium</b> atoms (particles contained in a Penning trap) offer a realization of a multidimensional harmonic oscillator in an idealized limit. The anharmonic theory presented here provides a means of modeling the realistic case. Comment: published festschrift; publication information on cover page macro adde...|$|E
