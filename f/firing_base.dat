With little time left to prevent more ammonids returning in meteorites, he and Leo are forced to use the Quatermass II to attempt to destroy the asteroid, despite the known flaws in the rocket's design and its liability to explode.

50|$|The field {{howitzer}} carriages of the M3 {{family were}} non-dismantling, split trail. All these were fitted with metal wheels with pneumatic tires; all had an additional retractable support, {{referred to as}} a <b>firing</b> <b>base.</b> In firing position, the <b>firing</b> <b>base</b> could be lowered and wheels raised, leaving the weapon to rest on the <b>firing</b> <b>base</b> and trails.|$|E
50|$|The {{small-scale}} {{tactic of}} using a <b>fire</b> <b>base</b> with a flanking group was also employed {{on a larger scale}} by a platoon, with, for example, one section acting as a <b>fire</b> <b>base,</b> while the other two flank a position.|$|R

25|$|With {{their light}} {{infantry}} screen withdrawn, the Thai <b>fire</b> <b>bases</b> now came under attack. The PAVN used a new tactic of counter-fire on the batteries to coop the Thai gunners in their bunkers. It would lift this fire in bare time for its infantry to overrun the <b>fire</b> <b>bases.</b> Without time to react, {{many of the}} Thais were trapped in their bunkers.|$|R
50|$|Also of {{interest}} is a comparison to the American 155 mm M1/M2 gun, nicknamed Long Tom. Somewhat inferior in range (23.2 km), Long Tom was much lighter (13.9 tons in travel position) and was transported as a complete weapon. Its split trail carriage with <b>firing</b> <b>base</b> allowed traverse of 60° and provided better stability in firing position.|$|E

5000|$|The 172 IBCT {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{in the summer}} of 2011. The brigade left behind its [...] "heavy" [...] vehicles, Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks, for MRAPs. Soldiers will spend some of their time during the deployment patrolling on foot, as their normal heavy tracked vehicles are incompatible with rugged terrain of Afghanistan.. During this deployment the Brigade was responsible for Paktika province along the Pakistani border. One of the more controversial aspects of the deployment was the formation of the first US/Afghan Joint <b>firing</b> <b>base</b> with Afghan National Army Artillery firing in support of U.S. forces in the Urgun district.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fire support}} base was {{originally}} a temporary <b>firing</b> <b>base</b> for artillery, although many evolved into more permanent bases. Their main components varied by size: a typical FSB usually had {{a battery of}} six 105 millimeter or 155 mm howitzers, a platoon of engineers permanently on station for construction and maintenance projects, at least two landing pads for helicopters (a smaller VIP pad {{and at least one}} resupply pad), a Tactical Operations Center (TOC), an aid station staffed with medics, a communications bunker, and a company of infantry serving as the defense garrison. Large FSBs might also have 2 artillery batteries, and an infantry battalion. Under the original concept of the artillery fire support base, a 6-gun battery set up with one howitzer in the center to fire illumination rounds during night attacks and serve as the base's main registration gun. The other 5 howitzers were arranged around it in a [...] "star" [...] pattern. Smaller FSBs tended to vary greatly from this layout, with two to four howitzers of various calibers (usually 105 mm and 155 mm at battalion level) located in dispersed and fortified firing positions. These smaller bases arranged their guns in square or triangle patterns when possible.|$|E

25|$|The Thai mercenaries {{were trapped}} {{for ten days}} before their rescuers linked up and led {{them back to the}} improvised <b>fire</b> <b>base.</b> The Communists {{followed}} suit. Both Air America and the U.S. Air Force were loath to attempt an exfiltration because of potential ground fire. At that point, the Thai commander on scene parachuted into the <b>fire</b> <b>base</b> to show there was no ground fire. The 22nd Special Operations Squadron then lifted out troops and guns to end the operation.|$|R

On 8 March, two PAVN battalions reinforced by T-34 tanks pushed the Thai battalions out of Laongam and back upon the <b>fire</b> <b>base.</b> At about the same time, the PAVN 39th Regiment sent two battalions forth from Salavan in a southwestern anti-clockwise move {{around the base of}} the Plateau.|$|R
