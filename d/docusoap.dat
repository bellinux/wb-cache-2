500|$|He {{worked on}} other {{projects}} {{at the same}} time as Cold Feet: After watching the 1997 <b>docusoap</b> Holiday Reps, he became interested in what happens in the personal lives of holiday representatives while in foreign countries. Out of this idea he developed Sunburn for BBC One. Sunburn starred Michelle Collins and was broadcast for two series from 1999 to 2000. Bullen shared writing duties with Lizzie Mickery and Sally Wainwright. His inspiration from American television continued; following the premiere of The West Wing in 1999, he began outlining a British version, The Firm, that would be set in Buckingham Palace. The project never moved beyond planning stages because Bullen believed that British political issues such as [...] "cod wars with Spain" [...] are not as [...] "sexy" [...] as the issues covered in The West Wing.|$|E

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The representation of gender and emotionality in the major public media {{has long been the}} subject of much discussion and research. This thesis sets out to assess the impact on this field of representations of <b>docusoaps,</b> a television programme form, which by crossing generic boundaries has the potential to unpick the ties binding the chain of dichotomies that organise everyday mental maps around the binary oppositions between male/female, reason/emotion, rational/irrational, and public sphere/private sphere. This question is explored in four main ways; historical and theoretical research on changing concepts of gender and emotionality; contextual research on the origins and development of <b>docusoaps</b> as a genre; detailed textual analyses of the organisation of meaning in three programmes chosen to represent the major sub genres of contemporary docusoaps; and explorations of audience understandings and responses to these programmes using focus group methodology...|$|R

40|$|A {{figure that}} has been pushed to the {{periphery}} of television shows throughout history, the African American woman has {{become more and more}} visible recently thanks to the proliferation of the cheap-to-produce reality television genre. Although many of these shows do feature African American women, critics often argue that these shows are a disgrace to the community, full of bickering women who are more obsessed with their labels than one another. This dissertation is an attempt to recuperate these programs from such denigration. I argue that reality television shows that focus on African American women do provide a great service to the community. Using soap opera theory as a theoretical foundation and close reading as an analytic tool, this project argues that these reality programs, which are called <b>docusoaps,</b> provide complex representations of African American women that are rarely seen on television. In addition, they offer therapeutic space to the women on the program as well as possible ones to the Black female viewers at home. The case study is The Real Housewives of Atlanta, a show that has aired on Bravo since 2008. This show has served as the template for the various African American <b>docusoaps</b> that have followed it, making it an important site for the investigation of how these programs present Black women and possible therapeutic spaces for that community...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ethical turn {{in new and}} old {{television}} formats. From <b>docusoaps</b> to tabloid talk to lifestyle shows, examinations of ways to live are now {{a major source of}} content and conflict. Television is now deeply implicated in shaping our ethical sensibilities. This development makes trouble for the logic of tabloid moralism and its obsession with policing the boundaries between right and wrong, for when moralism gives way to ethics the role of television in governing populations becomes much more complex and multifarious. Using the ethical theories of Foucault and Deleuze, the political implications of television’s version of ethics are examined...|$|R

40|$|Emerging Adulthood is a {{transitional}} stage that entails different developmental tasks. One specific task is developing sexual identity. Mass media (e. g., television, Internet, and movies) {{play an important}} role in influencing the emerging adults' development of their sexual beliefs and patterns of behavior. Among regularly scheduled programs on prime time television, the top four were reality television shows. This study investigated the relationship between emerging adults' sexual attitudes and reality television viewing. This quantitative research study included 91 participants from a southeastern university. Results revealed a positive relationship between sexual objectification between men and women and a negative relationship between sexual permissiveness and sexual objectification of women. A t-test for independent variables revealed females reported endorsing more permissive attitudes than males, females reported significantly higher approval of sexual objectification of men than males, males reported significantly higher approval of sexual objectification of women than females, and males indicated a higher adherence to sexual double standards than females. A chi-square for independence was performed and discovered sexual attitudes variables were correlated with three reality television sub-genres: <b>Docusoaps,</b> Gamedocs, and Exceptional Moments. A logistic regression found that Major, Race, and sexual attitudes with the exception of Sexual Permissiveness contributed to the prediction of viewing <b>Docusoaps.</b> Major, Gender, and Sexual Objectification of Women contributed to the prediction of viewing Gamedocs. Gender, Race, Sexual Double Standards, and Sexual Objectification of Women were individual variables that contributed to the prediction of Exceptional Moments viewing.  M. S...|$|R

40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of what {{has become known as}} the business entertainment format on British television. Drawing on interviews with channel controllers, commissioners and producers from across the BBC, Channel 4 and the independent sector this research highlights a number of key individuals who have shaped the development of the business entertainment format and investigates some of the tensions that arise from combining entertainment values with more journalistic or educational approaches to factual television. While much work has looked at <b>docusoaps</b> and reality programming, this area of television output has remained largely unexamined by television scholars. The research argues that as the television industry has itself developed into a business, programme-makers have come to view themselves as [creative] entrepreneurs thus raising the issue of whether the development off-screen of a more commercial, competitive and entrepreneurial TV marketplace has impacted on the way the medium frames its onscreen engagement with business, entrepreneurship, risk and wealth creation...|$|R

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{focuses on}} the topic of the mockumentary, which is a film and {{television}} genre, which combines elements of a documentary and fiction. Mockumentaries became, {{in the first decade of}} the 21 st century, an eminent form of televisual entertainment, mainly because of the introduction of the British series The Office in 2001 and its American adaptation four years later. The name mockumentary itself is a neologism and there isn't an agreement as to what is and is not a mockumentary. In any case the blending of fiction and reality has a long tradition on TV and radio and this fusion has become the foundation for many popular hybrid genres, as for example reality shows, docudramas and <b>docusoaps.</b> With these mockumentaries share a lot of similar traits but also differ from them. A mockumentary can be reflexive in that it gives us the possibility to question the authenticity of real documentaries and the "reality", that they display, but it can also be satirical and a parody and it gives the creators an original perspective as how to communicate with the viewer and gives a new source of comedy and humour. The enumeration of these typical traits of a mockumentary and their examples can be found in the case study, which forms the final part of this thesis...|$|R
