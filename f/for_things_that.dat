25|$|Important {{forms of}} {{intangible}} rewards include praise, recognition and rewards. Intangible rewards are ones from which an employee does not derive any material gain. Such rewards {{have the greatest}} impact when they soon follow the desired behavior and are {{closely tied to the}} performance. If an organization wants to use praise or other intangible rewards effectively, praise should be offered for a high level of performance and <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they employee has control over. Some studies have shown that praise can be as effective as tangible rewards.|$|E

25|$|The {{prairie dog}} is well adapted to predators. Using its dichromatic color vision, it can detect predators {{from a great}} distance; it then alerts other prairie dogs of the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Constantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a {{sophisticated}} system of vocal communication to describe specific predators. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, how big it is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also writes that prairie dogs have calls <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat.|$|E
25|$|Progress on Le Griffon was {{fraught with}} problems. Suffering from cold and low on supplies, {{the men were}} close to mutiny. The uneasy truce with the Indians was tested by threats and {{attempts}} of sabotage and murder. Tonti learned {{of a plan to}} burn the ship before it could be launched, so he launched ahead of schedule and Le Griffon entered the waters in early May, 1679. Hennepin's first account says she was a vessel of about 45 tons; his second says 60 tons. Because his second account has numerous exaggerations and cases where he credits himself <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> La Salle had done, Hennepin's first account is considered more reliable. In any case, Le Griffon was larger than any other vessel on the lakes at the time, and as far as contemporary reports can confirm, the first named vessel. Her fitting out continued {{the next couple of months}} and when La Salle arrived in July he was encouraged by her readiness.|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears as}} a central {{character}} in the animated TV series , voiced by Venus Terzo. She is a popular soccer player and also teaches and trains the mutant students of Xavier Institute. Jean is also a popular athlete of Bayville. She wears a black costume with green accent. Since she is a telepath, she's the one who operates Cerebro aside from Professor Xavier. When humans {{found out about the}} existence of mutants, Jean was accused of using her physic/psionic abilities <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she successfully accomplished without using her powers, such as playing basketball in school. At one point, Jean lost control of her powers which caused her to be uncontrollably read people's minds telepathically. The X-Men were having a hard time trying to help her, but luckily Rogue was present and used her own powers to drain enough of Jean's energy for Scott to prompt her to focus on Scott. Jean appears to have a fear of clowns, to which Mesmero uses this to take control of her mind, so she could do the villain's bidding.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E

In a 1982 interview with Down Beat magazine Frith said that so much more {{can be done with}} tape: [...] "I'm interested in using the studio <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you couldn't possibly do in a performance, to use the medium of tape {{in a way that is}} intrinsic to it."

500|$|In 2004, {{the company}} {{committed}} itself to a redesign of its entire packaging line that tied the packaging into its irreverent advertising campaign created by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky. Each product's packaging included a tongue-in-cheek commentary about the product itself. Alex Bogusky, partner and executive creative director of CP+B, stated that BK decided [...] "to create {{a dialogue with the}} consumer" [...] by utilizing the large areas of white space found on its packaging at the time. All of its sandwich wrappers, cartons, tray liners, bags, breakfast platters, chili cups, condiments, and regional product packaging received what was described as [...] "quirky ad copy" [...] specifically targeting the 18–34-year-old male demographic segment. Besides the humorous commentary, the company also created sniglet-type names <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would appear in its products, such as a [...] "ringer" [...] – a single onion ring that had been accidentally included in an order of fries.|$|E

500|$|The Last of Us {{features}} an original score composed primarily by Gustavo Santaolalla, along with compositions by Andrew Buresh, Anthony Caruso, and Jonathan Mayer. Known for his minimalist compositions, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including some {{that he was}} unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. This minimalist approach was also taken with the game's sound and art design. The sound of the Infected {{was one of the}} first tasks during development; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible. To achieve the sound of the Clicker, they hired voice actress Misty Lee, who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the [...] "back of the throat". The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration, such as Robert Polidori's photographs following Hurricane Katrina, which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. The art department were forced to negotiate <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they wished to include, due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The game's opening credits were produced by Sony's San Diego Studio.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} {{the game from}} an artistic viewpoint, the team took various pieces of work as inspiration. Robert Polidori's photographs of Lower Ninth Ward following Hurricane Katrina were used as a reference point when {{designing the}} flooded areas of Pittsburgh. [...] " [...] did these amazingly beautiful, horrific photos... it's not just decay and rot and post-apocalyptic grey, it's a human world that we're playing with when we portray this destruction," [...] said Straley. The concept of post-apocalyptic environments was considered a [...] "starting point" [...] for the artists. The art team also strived to achieve realism within every piece of art. Straley explained that the artists [...] "would be like, I'm {{going to make this}} the most awesome fucking wall ever," [...] in terms of creating attractive environments. The art department were forced to fight <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they wished to include, due to the high demand during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The artistic composition of the game's locations was also a feature strongly focused on, in order to evoke varying emotions from players. In the final weeks of development, roles from the art department were undertaken by other members of the team; for example, Straley hand-arranged the texts on the game's training screens, a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual. [...] "I have never even heard of a game director doing that! That's like... an intern task," [...] Wells said.|$|E

2500|$|CRISPR/Cas can immunize {{bacteria}} against certain phages {{and thus}} halt transmission. For this reason, Koonin described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism. However, this was disputed by a critic who noted, [...] "We should remember [...] {{for the good}} he contributed to science, not <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> resemble his theory only superficially.

2500|$|In Tigrinya and Amharic, this root survives {{only in the}} noun kitab, meaning [...] "amulet", and {{the verb}} [...] "to vaccinate".

2500|$|Prescriptions {{are also}} used <b>for</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not {{strictly}} regulated as a prescription drug. Prescribers will often give non-prescription drugs out as prescriptions because drug benefit plans may reimburse the patient only if the over-the-counter medication is taken {{under the direction of}} a medical practitioner. Conversely, if a medication is available over-the-counter, prescribers may ask patients if they want it as a prescription or purchase it themselves. Pharmacists {{may or may not be}} able to price the medication competitively with over-the-counter equivalents. If the patient wants the medication not under prescription, the prescriber is usually careful to give the medication name to the patient on a blank piece of paper to avoid any confusion with a prescription. [...] This is applied to non-medications as well. For example, crutches, and registered massage therapy may be reimbursed under some health plans, but only if given out by a prescriber as a prescription. Some software now requires a prescription.|$|E
2500|$|Things That Happen Again: For a Here and a There (1986-1991) was {{installed}} at the Chinati Foundation by Donald Judd and Roni Horn in 1988. The work consists of two identical truncated cones that are 35 inches long, tapering from a diameter of 17 inches to 12 inches. [...] The pair {{is part of a}} 1986-1991 suite consisting of four sets of paired, solid copper forms, each hand-lathed to duplicate mechanical identity. The entire suite is titled Things That Happen Again, and also includes For Two Rooms, For a This and a That, and <b>For</b> <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> are Near. In describing the piece's intention, Horn states the importance of the two objects' apparent duplicity: The narrative involves the recognition of uniqueness through the sequential experience of things which are identical. Then the subsequent and irreversible loss of the unique identity. Obviously the notion of being identical is a purely ideal one since when you have two things, no matter how perfect the identity, you always have a this and a that, a here and a there. In both pieces we’re talking about the critical role of relation in defining the form.|$|E
