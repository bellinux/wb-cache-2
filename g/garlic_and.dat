40|$|INTRODUCTION Tubular {{toxicity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important side effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics, especially gentamicin. OBJECTIVES We histopathologically studied the effect of <b>garlic</b> extract <b>and</b> metformin co-administration, in attenuation of genetamicin induced tubular toxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study seventy rats were divided into seven equal groups and except group 1 (control) were injected 100 mg/kg/day gentamicin (GM) intraperitoneally (i. p.) for 10 days. Other than GM, group III received 20 mg/kg garlic (i. p.), group IV metformin (MF) (100 mg/kg, orally), group V a combination of MF with <b>garlic</b> juice (100 <b>and</b> 20 mg/kg/day, respectively) and group VI a combination of MF <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> juice (50 <b>and</b> 10 mg/kg/day, respectively) for following 10 days. Group VII received a combination of MF <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> juice (100 <b>and</b> 20 mg/kg, respectively) along with GM. Animals were sacrificed on the 20 (th) day of the experiment and the kidneys were removed for histological examinations. RESULTS GM induced nephrotoxicity <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> or MF alone and a combination of both with high doses (not low doses) significantly abolished the kidney tubular injury induced by GM. In addition, co-administration of GM, MF <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> (group 7) prevented the GM- induced tissue damage more than the groups in which MF <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> were injected 10 days post GM administration. CONCLUSION <b>Garlic</b> extract <b>and</b> Metformin, alone or in a combination, might be safely used to ameliorate GM induced tubular toxicity...|$|R

5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. <b>Garlic</b> <b>and</b> onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E
