500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm shooting up his nose almost, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> very disorienting. The show's got a certain ennui that appeals to me, the film noir-y movies of the '40s look, an undercurrent of tension and anxiety 'cause of all the weird things going on".|$|E
500|$|... "I Made It" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Tye Tribbett and David Outing. Prior to its release on her album The Definition Of... (2016), Fantasia {{had played a}} portion of the song on Periscope and revealed to her fans that she worked with Tribbett. In the video, she incorrectly reported that she had handled the songwriting by herself. Tribbett explained its concept and his collaboration with Fantasia to Christine Thomasos of The Christian Post, saying: [...] "We've been talking about working together for a minute. So when the opportunity came <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a no brainer". He said that he instantly agreed to work with Fantasia after receiving a phone call to write a song for her. Fantasia had contacted Tribbett at the suggestion of music executive Ron Fair. Prior to the writing process, Tribbett had asked to [...] "do it on [...] terms" [...] and [...] "maintain the integrity of his message" [...] by creating an inspirational gospel record. He used Fantasia's testimony, as well as his own experiences with God, as inspiration for the lyrics. He described the song {{as the result of a}} close connection between Fantasia and himself: [...] "I basically just combined testimonies between her and myself when I wrote the song and it resonated so richly with her, her audience and with everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I think [...] "Sweater Weather" [...] might've {{been the}} best song we'd ever written," [...] Rutherford added, [...] "but I didn't {{think it was going}} to be the best song we'd ever write. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> getting a Platinum record, like a little tap on the butt." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{dad used to}} {{ride out}} at Terry Caldwell's yard and I {{followed}} him down one weekend…that was how it all started.

5000|$|On August 22, 2014, he {{announced}} the album would be titled Ohio in a vlog, saying: [...] "The {{sound of my}} current music is intelligent truck music. It’s a sound that’s built for the cars. But you can also enjoy it in your headphones, your computer or however you {{want to listen to}} it. Me, growing up, I rode around listening to music. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> the soundtrack my days or wherever I was going." ...|$|E

5000|$|When we {{realized}} that Kristoff {{was going to have}} this relationship with the trolls which was kind of the key discovery {{we realized}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> okay, he’s bringing this girl that he’s not dating home to this big, ruckus family and they’re gonna misinterpret the situation. So we thought oh, gee it’s gotta have that kind of New York dating song cabaret feel and so that’s how the music kind of came about.|$|E
5000|$|... "As I {{was writing}} for the album, I {{actually}} made a few trips to Oklahoma. I would drive my truck down {{to the edge of}} the river where we shot the cover of the album. I wrote quite a few of the lyrics there. And I just had this vision of me with mud all over myself. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> an Apocalypse Now/Martin Sheen type of thing. It just fit the vibe of the stuff I was writing." ...|$|E
50|$|I thought, wow, this is fantastic. They {{actually}} have colleges like this? Where I {{can do the}} things that I am really interested in doing? That was amazing to me. I loved SVA. I loved the kind of freedom that it provided. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> this great experiment—okay, you're here because you like something. So let's see how much you like it. We're not going to regulate you too much. We're going to see how passionate and driven you are, and how much you want this thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not you," [...] countered Cecily, [...] "and I wouldn't want {{to frighten}} any one as I <b>was</b> frightened. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> an awful dream--but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> interesting, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|Interviewed in 2007, Paul Anka said he {{had been}} [...] "somewhat destabilized by the Sex Pistols' version. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> curious, but I felt he (Sid Vicious) was sincere about it." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "The whole {{thread of}} the songs is more tied {{together}} than ever before," [...] explains Strnad.

What's {{going to be the}} most quintessential Black Dahlia Murder thing we can do?' That's kind of what we set our foothold in. And 'Ritual', it just lends itself to that — it's mysticism and magic and all of that. Everyone has an association with some kind of ritual, so we just thought it was the next logical step." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 1999, when Jon Stewart {{became the}} host of The Daily Show he tapped former Onion writer/editor Karlin to be head writer of the newly {{restructured}} show. [...] "He had heard about this group of Onion people in L.A. and, in a weird way, I was the de facto ringleader of our group in L.A. I came to New York. Jon and I connected. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a slightly awkward, but successful, first date. When I got back to Los Angeles, they offered me the head writer job".|$|E
5000|$|During {{the merger}} between Polygram and Universal, which {{ultimately}} put the album's release in limbo, the band {{decided to call}} it quits. Said Adams at the time: [...] "The decision was made for us, really, just by time and circumstance, and I respect things that happen like that. By the time we went to make Pneumonia, {{there were only three}} surviving members. Everybody kind of pooled thoughts together for that album, and when it didn't come out, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> we reached an end that's inevitable, and we all knew it in the back of our minds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{am glad to}} see you," [...] cried Dave, in return. He {{shook hands}} with both men. [...] "Mr. Wadsworth, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> you to answer my letter so quickly," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mean to Harriet," [...] said Anne rebukingly, [...] "to go {{with her}} and get her talked about and then drop her as you did. Don't you think so yourself, Jerome?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm so to speak, as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{responsible}} for you. What I {{mean to say}} is, if you go doing {{this sort of thing}} I'm apt to get in the soup somewhat." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the criticism, Andrew Cromeek argued that the filmmakers {{did not expect to}} gain a large amount of {{attention}} on YouTube and that the filmmakers were not professional. Cromeek said [...] "I think the way it was shot was quite cool. We are all amateur actors. We all had one take. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> shoot, go, OK, done. So it's fine. It's completely OK if people are like, 'It's the worst acting in the world.' It's totally fine with me." [...] Ip wrote that Verax [...] "is a source of pride for the friends who made it, even as they acknowledge its limitations." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lewis {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "We felt like happiness is something everyone strives to have, and sometimes it's not just about being happy, but if you have obstacles in your life that you have to get over to be happy. And it's just about that striving to get there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> looking back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song." [...] The song was released with two B-sides: [...] "Let It Rain" [...] in Europe and Japan, and [...] "Fly Here Now", only in Japan.|$|E
5000|$|Julie Corman {{later said}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one project of hers {{she wished she}} could remake with a bigger budget. [...] "On a low budget, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hard to create that world," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|But {{her mind}} had been active. [...] "At {{the end of}} this road," [...] she said, gulping a sob, [...] "you must go back. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> you to come, Mr. Lewisham. But you were ashamed--you are sure to be ashamed. My {{employer}} is a spiritualist, and my stepfather is a professional Medium, and my mother is a spiritualist. You were quite right not to speak to me last night. Quite. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> you to come, but you must go back. Life is hard enough as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ...

5000|$|American Nights was {{originally}} {{scheduled for a}} 2014 release by Hollywood Records. During production however, the band had creative disagreements with the label's executives, which led Hollywood to delay the album's release. Lead vocalist Tom Higgenson said of the conflict, [...] "They were pushing for songs that the band wasn't 100 percent on. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> 'You don't want us to record this song that everybody loves, but {{you want us to}} do this one that one of the five guys don't like at all?' It was a really annoying process." [...] After the album was completed, the band decided to leave Hollywood Records altogether and recut the album according to their vision.|$|E
5000|$|... "Now or Never" [...] {{was written}} by Halsey and Starrah {{alongside}} producers Cashmere Cat, Happy Perez and Benny Blanco. This later also served as her [...] "therapist in a weird way" [...] during the recording process. She stated: [...] "We'd finish the track and then be ready to go, and he'd (Blanco) be like, 'Hey, I heard that thing you sang. Are you OK?'. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> he was hearing a cry for help in what I was singing, which was cool because it made us bond." [...] The song {{has been described as}} an R&B slow jam. Lyrically, it sees Halsey offering a lover an ultimatum to love her [...] "now or never".|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{published}} on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube on 26 January 2016. The video features clips of the band throughout the years, highlighting their tours and personal anecdotes (including clips with former member Zayn Malik). The video ends as the band walk off in separate directions. It was later confirmed that the band were originally supposed to run back together {{at the end of}} the music video. Ben Winston, who directed the video, also added [...] "The ending wasn't supposed to look like they're just walking off in different directions, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a 'see you in a bit, guys.'" [...] In 2017, the deleted clip was unveiled online.|$|E
