Those with an NVQ level 1 comprise 8.0% of the population while 15.2% have a level 2 NVQ, a City and Guilds craft certificate, BTEC or general diploma. Just over 20% of residents had two or more A-levels, four or more AS-Levels or an advanced diploma while 15.8% possessed a degree, such as a BA or BSc or a higher degree such as an MA or PhD. An NVQ level 4 or 5, HNC, HND, higher BTEC or higher diploma, is held by 4.2% and a professional qualification is held by 13.9% of residents.

5|$|The {{local council}} {{operates}} a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend {{one of the}} 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school. Bournemouth {{is one of the}} minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education, with two grammar schools (one for boys, one for girls) and ten secondary modern/comprehensive schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town, and a further education college. Bournemouth has two universities: Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth, both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole. They are also home to AECC University College (formally known as Anglo European College of Chiropractic), which is located on Parkwood Road in Bournemouth. In 2012, 60.7% of the borough's school leavers gained 5 GCSEs of <b>grade</b> <b>C</b> or above. This was slightly better than the national average of 59.4% and above the average for the rest of Dorset, with 58.8% of pupils from the local authority of Poole, and 54.1% from the remainder of the county, managing to do likewise.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the school}} adopted the General Certificate of Education, but {{students}} {{were barred from}} taking any exams {{before the age of}} 16, which meant that many students left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5percent in 1970, peaking at 95percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92percent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88percent pass rate in 1978. League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2009 A-level students achieved an average of 999.2 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.1 and 100percent of students achieved five or more <b>grade</b> <b>C</b> results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. In its league table of the 500 best state secondary schools in the United Kingdom, The Sunday Times ranked The Judd School 27th.|$|E

25|$|Despite these gains, women’s {{academic}} {{careers in}} Europe remain characterized by strong {{vertical and horizontal}} segregation. In 2010, although female students (55%) and graduates (59%) outnumbered male students, men outnumbered women at the PhD and graduate levels (albeit by a small margin). Further along in the research career, women represented 44% of <b>grade</b> <b>C</b> academic staff, 37% of grade B academic staff and 20% of grade A academic staff.11 These trends are intensified in science, with women making up 31% {{of the student population}} at the tertiary level to 38% of PhD students and 35% of PhD graduates.

25|$|Whole {{foie gras}} is readily {{available}} from gourmet retailers in Canada, the United States, Hungary, Argentina and regions with a sizeable market for the product. In US, raw foie gras is classified as Grade A, B or C. Grade A is typically the highest in fat and especially suited for low-temperature preparation, because the veins are relatively few and the resulting terrine will be more aesthetically appealing because it displays little blood. Grade B is accepted for higher temperature preparation, because the higher proportion of protein gives the liver more structure after being seared. <b>Grade</b> <b>C</b> livers are generally reserved for making sauces {{as well as other}} preparations where a higher proportion of blood-filled veins will not impair the appearance of the dish.|$|E

500|$|The United States used (some {{states still}} do, as they await state regulation) {{different}} grading standards. Maple syrup {{was divided into}} two major grades: Grade A and Grade B. Grade A was further divided into three subgrades: Light Amber (sometimes known as Fancy), Medium Amber, and Dark Amber. In Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed as Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste. The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: [...] "AA", [...] "A", etc. The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baumé scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or <b>Grade</b> <b>C,</b> was also produced under the Vermont system.|$|E
500|$|Michael Sragow of Orange County Register {{gave the}} film <b>grade</b> <b>C,</b> {{saying that the}} film is [...] "a coarse, rickety comedy."

[...] Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that the film is [...] "so dumb, lazy, clumsily assembled and unoriginal, it could crush any actor forced to execute its leaden slapstick gags and mouth its crude, humorless dialogue." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews wondered, [...] "Has it come to this for director Nick Cassavetes?", comparing his career negatively to that of his father, John Cassavetes. Berardinelli elaborated, [...] "what a comedown to find him in charge of such an unfocused, unfunny, scatologically-obsessed 'comedy.'" [...] Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.Com gave the film two out of four stars and said, [...] "While [...] "The Other Woman" [...] raises some thoughtful questions about independence, identity {{and the importance of}} sisterhood, ultimately it would rather poop on them and then throw them through a window in hopes of the getting the big laugh."

John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a [...] "technically mesmeric" [...] one, felt that thematically it was a [...] "disappointingly retrograde step" [...] for Argento. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com called it a [...] "gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick", while Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews dismissed it as [...] "trash", giving it the <b>grade</b> <b>C.</b> Gary Johnson, editor of Images, complained, [...] "Not much of Tenebre makes much sense. The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And {{these are some of the}} bloodiest murders of Argento's career." [...] In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, [...] "Tenebre is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors".|$|E
