5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Previously, the <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{influences}} of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next {{to the concept of}} shared and participative governance a new form of governance has emerged, i.e. the notion of corporate governance of institutions, that has increasingly become a more <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> to tertiary management. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate governance and the decline of the shared or consensual governance can be seen to be a result of the decline in academic participation, a growing tendency towards managerialism and the new environment where the universities are operating.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{formulate}} a comprehensive theory {{of the nature of}} early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields including evolution by natural selection, object relations theory (psychoanalysis), control systems theory, evolutionary biology and the fields of ethology and cognitive psychology. There were some preliminary papers from 1958 onwards but the full theory is published in the trilogy Attachment and Loss, 1969-82. Although in the early days Bowlby was criticised by academic psychologists and ostracised by the psychoanalytic community, attachment theory has become the <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> to understanding early social development and given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children's close relationships.|$|E
25|$|In the Kids {{for cash}} scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who {{promoted}} {{a platform of}} zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary Kids for Cash interviews experts on adolescent behaviour, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.|$|E

It has since become a classic on the subject. Cardoso has also received the Livre-Docência degree in 1963, the most senior level of academic recognition in Brazil, also from Universidade de São Paulo. In 1968, he received the title of Cathedratic Professor, holding the chair of Political Science at Universidade de São Paulo.|$|E

25|$|One naïve Bayesian {{approach}} to hypothesis testing is to base {{decisions on the}} posterior probability, but this fails when comparing point and continuous hypotheses. Other approaches to decision making, such as Bayesian decision theory, attempt to balance the consequences of incorrect decisions across all possibilities, rather than concentrating on a single null hypothesis. A number of other approaches to reaching a decision based on data are available via decision theory and optimal decisions, {{some of which have}} desirable properties. Hypothesis testing, though, is a <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> to data analysis in many fields of science. Extensions to the theory of hypothesis testing include the study of the power of tests, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false. Such considerations can be used for the purpose of sample size determination prior to the collection of data.|$|E

2500|$|British {{descriptions}} of English intonation {{can be traced}} back to the 16th century. Early in the 20th century the <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> in the description of English and French intonation was based on a small number of basic [...] "tunes" [...] associated with intonation units: in a typical description, Tune 1 is falling, with final fall, while Tune 2 has a final rise. Phoneticians such as H.E. Palmer broke up the intonation of such units into smaller components, the most important of which was the nucleus, which corresponds to the main accented syllable of the intonation unit, usually in the last lexical word of the intonation unit. Each nucleus carries one of a small number of nuclear tones, usually including fall, rise, fall-rise, rise-fall, and possibly others. The nucleus may be preceded by a head containing stressed syllables preceding the nucleus, and a tail consisting of syllables following the nucleus within the tone unit. Unstressed syllables preceding the head (if present) or nucleus (if there is no head) constitute a pre-head. This approach was further developed by Halliday and by O'Connor and Arnold, though with considerable variation in terminology. This [...] "Standard British" [...] treatment of intonation in its present-day form is explained in detail by Wells and in a simplified version by Roach. Halliday saw the functions of intonation as depending on choices in three main variables: Tonality (division of speech into intonation units), Tonicity (the placement of the tonic syllable or nucleus) and Tone (choice of nuclear tone); these terms (sometimes referred to as [...] "the three T's") have been used more recently.|$|E
2500|$|While when a {{contract}} is silent a court must essentially {{make an informed}} choice about whether a right to terminate should exist, if {{a contract}} deals with the matter the courts' general approach is to follow the parties' wishes. The drafters of the old Sale of Goods Act 1893 distinguished between [...] "conditions" [...] (major terms, which when breached confer a right to terminate) and [...] "warranties" [...] (minor terms, which do not), and under the present Sale of Goods Act 1979 some terms, such as descriptions about quality, are conditions by default. A third kind is an [...] "innominate term", which is typically a vague term like citrus pulp pellets being [...] "in good condition", or a ship having to be [...] "seaworthy". Because such a term could be breached in both a major way (e.g. the ship sinks) or a trivial way (e.g. a lifejacket is missing) the court will determine whether the right to terminate arises based on how serious in fact {{the consequences of the}} breach were. So in The Hong Kong Fir, Lord Diplock held that a ship crew being too incompetent to properly operate the vessel did not breach the contract's [...] "seaworthiness" [...] term in a serious enough way as to allow for termination, because the charterers still got a working boat and could have replaced the crew. If a contract specifies that a particular obligation is a [...] "condition" [...] the <b>dominant</b> <b>approach</b> of the courts is to treat it as such. Nevertheless, concerned with the ability of a stronger party to specify the terms it finds most convenient as [...] "conditions" [...] {{at the expense of the}} weaker, courts retain the ability to construe an agreement contra proferentum. In L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd the majority of the House of Lords held that clause 7 of a contract, stating it was [...] "a condition of this agreement" [...] that Mr Wickman would visit 6 major car companies [...] "at least once in every week" [...] to try selling panel presses, was not really a condition in the technical sense. So when Mr Wickman was found to have visited much less, Schuler AG could not dismiss him. This was because clause 11 said that 60 days of warning was needed before Schuler AG could terminate, so the whole contract read together meant the clause 7 had to be subject to clause 11. The language in the contract is not decisive. If the word [...] "condition" [...] is not used, but the contract describes a right to terminate, such as the contract being terminable for [...] "any breach" [...] of obligation, the issue is, again, one of construction and the courts may be reluctant to give effect to the plain meaning if it would have [...] "draconian consequences" [...] for the weaker party. By contrast, in Bunge Corporation v Tradax SA the House of Lords held that giving notice for a ship to start loading the soya bean cargo four days late, when the contract expressly stipulated the date, should allow the right to terminate regardless of the actual consequences of the breach. In mercantile contracts, 'broadly speaking time will be considered of the essence', and so it is highly likely the courts will enforce obligations to the letter.|$|E
