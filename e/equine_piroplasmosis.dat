Etiology <b>Equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> results from infection by the protozoa Babesia caballi or Theileria equi (formerly Babesia equi). Both organisms belong to the phylum Apicomplexa and order Piroplasmida. They can infect an animal concurrently.

40|$|Background: <b>Equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> (EP) is {{the cause}} of {{persistent}} tick-borne infection with no symptoms, but the most important problem of EP is due to the persistent carrier state. Carrier animals to Babesia (Theileria) equi (Laveran 1901) and B. caballi (Nuttall, 1910) infestation could be identified by extremely sensitive PCR-based method. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the causative agents of <b>equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> based on molecular and microscopic assays in equids from Kurdistan Province, Iran. Methods : Thirty one horse and mule blood samples were used with history of liv­ing in Kurdistan Province of Iran.   The blood specimens were utilized for T. equi and B. caballi DNA identification by PCR and Giemsa stained smears for micro­scopic observation. Results : The results clearly showed the presence of B.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Imidocarb dipropionate is the {{drug of choice}} for <b>equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis,</b> but its administration causes severe colic and diarrhoea. An imidocarb protocol that reduces these signs is required. Objectives: (1) Quantification {{of the effects of}} imidocarb dipropionate on equine orocaecal transit time (OCTT), with and without atropine or glycopyrrolate premedication; (2) Investigation of an improved pre-treatment regimen for imidocarb administration. Hypothesis: Treatment with imidocarb dipropionate will result in colic and reduced OCTT as demonstrated by the lactose 13 C-ureide breath test (LUBT), which will be ameliorated by premedication with atropine or glycopyrrolate. Methods: The effects of three drug therapies on OCTT were compared in six healthy horses in a randomised double-blind study versus a saline control: (i) imidocarb dipropionate 2. 4 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM) with intravenous saline (I/S); (ii) imidocarb dipropionate 2. 4 mg/kg IM with atropine 0. 035 mg/kg IV (I/A); (iii) imidocarb dipropionate 2. 4 mg/kg IM with glycopyrrolate 0. 0025 mg/kg IV (I/G). The LUBT was used to measure OCTT in each case, and significance of treatment effect determined by a linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: I/A treatment caused an increase in OCTT (P < 0. 05), whereas I/S produced a non-significant decrease in OCTT. I/S caused colic and diarrhoea in four of six horses after injection, which was not seen in any horse with I/A or I/G treatments or saline control.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleThe apicomplexan protozoan Theileria equi (also known as Babesia equi) causes <b>equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> (EP) and is a growing threat to the horse industry [1 - 3]. T. equi is an obligate intracellular parasite that requires a tick host for sexual reproduction and an equine host for asexual reproduction during a haploid phase [2]. T. equi can be naturally transmitted by ticks of the family Ixodidae [4] and, in addition to this biological route, T. equi has the iatrogenic transmission is thought to have been the primary mode of transmission in an outbreak in Florida, U. S., in 2008 [6]. Once a horse becomes infected, the parasite undergoes asexual reproduction within erythro-cytes; high parasitemia is found during this acute phase of infection [7]. If the horse overcomes the acute infec-tion it will typically carry a life-long persistent infection that is usually asymptomatic [8]. Due to the low parasit-emia that is characteristic of a persistent infection the parasite is not detectable by microscopic examination of blood smears. However, infections can be detected b...|$|E
40|$|Theileria equi is the causative {{agent of}} {{worldwide}} piroplasmosis, an important tick-borne disease of equids associated to a lifetime carrier state of infected horses. Since rapid, accessible and reliable tests have been posted {{as a challenge}} for clinicians, {{the aim of the}} present study was to verify the agreement between an in-house immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) and a commercial competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) in a population of 198 carthorses from Southern Brazil. The horse seroreactivity for T. equi revealed 152 / 198 (76. 8 %) positive samples by IFA and 155 / 198 (78. 3 %) by cELISA. Using cELISA as gold standard, IFA has shown a sensitivity of 91. 6 % (95 % CI = 86. 18 - 95. 03 %) and specificity of 76. 7 % (95 % CI = 62. 26 - 86. 85 %), with a substantial degree of agreement (k = 0. 8445). In conclusion, the in-house IFA may be used as a screening test for diagnosis of <b>equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Equine</b> <b>Piroplasmosis</b> (EP) is {{a disease}} that {{negatively}} impacts the horse industry worldwide and is caused by two distinct species of protozoan parasites, Babesia caballi and Theileria equi. Currently the United States is considered free of EP and strict regulations are in place to prevent its introduction. If an outbreak does occur, there are two options for infected horses: lifelong quarantine or humane euthanization. Treatment options are limited {{in their ability to}} clear infection. Rifampicin and fosmidomycin are anti-microbial agents that are successful at treating related protozoan diseases, such as malaria. These two drugs were screened for anti-protozoal properties against the erythrocytic stage of T. equi and B. caballi by performing in vitro inhibition assays. Parasite growth was evaluated over a 72 h treatment period and was significantly reduced for both species with notable morphological changes. Rifampicin was shown to possess more potent effects at lower concentrations than fosmidomycin for both T. equi and B. caballi. Based on data acquired during the trial, further in vitro and in vivo tests should be performed for rifampicin and fosmidomycin. Further, the results attained suggest that other existing anti-microbials should be evaluated for their efficacy in treating EP...|$|E
40|$|The <b>equine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> {{caused by}} Theileria equi {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parasitic diseases of the equine, causing damage to animal health and economic losses. In T. equi, 2 merozoite surface proteins, equi merozoite antigen EMA- 1 and EMA- 2, have been identified as the most immunodominant antigens. This suggests that these antigens might be used as immunobiological tools. The EMA- 1 of Theileria equi was cloned and expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The transformed yeast was grown at high cell density, expressing up to 389 mg. L- 1 of recombinant protein. The protein was concentrated and detected in Dot blot. The recombinant product was antigenically similar to the native protein as determined using monoclonal antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies obtained from equines naturally infected with T. equi. The immunogenicity of rEMA- 1 protein was demonstrated by IFAT using sera from recombinant-protein-immunized mice using aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant. All animals vaccinated with rEMA- 1 developed a high specific antibody response. This results suggest that rEMA- 1 expressed in P. pastoris might be a strong candidate to be used as an antigen for immune diagnostics as well as a vaccine antigen...|$|E
