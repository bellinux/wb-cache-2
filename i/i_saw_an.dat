500|$|In {{a letter}} {{dedicating}} the new opera to Queen Anne, Hill wrote of {{his choice of}} story: [...] "I could not chuse a finer Subject than the celebrated story of Rinaldo and Armida". He had, however, exercised [...] "a Poet's Privilege", to render Tasso's work suitable for the stage. This [...] "privilege" [...] moved the opera's story {{a long way from}} Tasso's original. Hill invented a new heroine, Almirena, to provide the main love interest with the hero Rinaldo, and the relationship between Rinaldo and Armida scarcely figures in the opera. Likewise, the affair between Argante and Armida is Hill's creation, as are the conversions to Christianity, the latter possibly a [...] to English susceptibilities. Rossi was required to turn the elaborate scenario into verses, a relatively light task which, he said, was [...] "the delivery of a few evenings". Nevertheless, Rossi complained that Handel hardly gave him time to write: [...] "To my great wonder <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> entire Opera set to music by that surprising genius, with the greatest degree of perfection, in two weeks". Price argues that Rossi's role was beyond that of a mere versifier, quoting Hill's words of praise for Rossi in the preface to the libretto, which suggest that Rossi was the senior partner in the birth of the libretto. Price also points to the likely influences on the structure of Rinaldo from two British semi-operas—George Granville's The British Enchanters, and Purcell's King Arthur. The transformations of characters to others' shapes, Price contends, is likely derived from John Dryden's play Amphitryon.|$|E

[...] "...in essence our relations are relations between two states and we hope that under the new presidential term the Turkish-U.S. relations will be much better.

2500|$|In 51 Mithridates’ nephew Rhadamistus (a.k.a. Ghadam) invaded Armenia {{and killed}} his uncle. The {{governor}} of Cappadocia, Julius Pailinus, decided to conquer Armenia but he settled with the crowning of Radamistus who generously rewarded him. The current Parthian King Vologases <b>I,</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity, invaded Armenia and succeeded in forcing the Iberians {{to withdraw from}} Armenia. The harsh winter that followed proved {{too much for the}} Parthians who also withdrew, thus leaving open doors for Radamistus to regain his throne.

2500|$|John Grieve {{said the}} {{avalanche}} was initiated by a climber who dislodged a huge sheet of snow, sending {{it down on}} the nine other climbers who were swept [...] downhill. The climber avoided being swept away by digging into the mountain with his ice axe before he composed himself to alert the emergency services. The surviving climbers had begun to unearth their friends' bodies from the snow with their ice axes by the time the rescue team had arrived. Fifty-year-old Jim Coyne from Lindsayfield, East Kilbride, said he and 53-year-old David Barr from Paisley, were on the mountain when a slab of snow came away from the peak. Barr sustained the shoulder injury. Coyne told of how they were just below the summit when the avalanche occurred, describing it as [...] "massive" [...] and saying they were ... engulfed and I managed to dig my way out. As I tried to get my bearings <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> arm sticking out of the snow. It was Davie. I dug for 10 minutes using just my hands to get him free. 54-year-old Tom Richardson, an experienced climber from Sheffield in England, also had a narrow escape and subsequently alerted the emergency services.|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
