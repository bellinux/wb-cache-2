The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E

25|$|In late February 1758 Active {{sailed to}} Deptford Dockyard to receive her guns and naval stores, and to embark her crew of 200 {{officers}} and men. Her armament comprised 24 nine-pounder cannons located along her gun deck, supported by four three-pounder cannons on the quarterdeck and twelve ½-pounder swivel guns ranged along <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E
25|$|An action ensued {{at about}} 11a.m. with Trincomalee {{engaging}} Iphigénie and Comet engaging Pearl. The exchange of fire lasted {{about two hours}} when suddenly Trincomalee exploded. She {{was so close to}} Iphigénie that the explosion knocked down Iphigénies main and mizzen masts and ruptured <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> with the result that she soon started to founder.|$|E
25|$|Seeing his brother's predicament, Henry Harvey, who {{commanded}} the HMS Ramillies sailed to his aid and raked the Vengeur du Peuple twice, killing dozens of her crew and finally driving the ships apart. Both resembled wrecks, the Vengeur clearly sinking from the huge holes blasted in <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> She finally surrendered to HMS Culloden and HMS Alfred {{who came up}} {{at the close of}} the battle, but her submission was too late and over 300 of her crew drowned when she suddenly heeled over and sank, the rest being picked up by British boats.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, she {{replaced}} the sailing ship Vasco da Gama as the Artillery School of the Portuguese Navy, conducting training missions up until 1878, when it completed her last training mission on sea in a voyage to the Azores islands. In this last voyage she rescued {{the crew of}} the American barque Lawrence Boston, which had caught fire off the Azores archipelago. After this, she remained permanently moored in Lisbon as the Naval Artillery School with significant modifications being made on her in 1889, with the replacement of her elegant masts, and the construction of two redoubts on both <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> for the placement of modern cannons, to better serve her role of artillery instruction unit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1807, Attentives boats cut out two doggers, from the small port of La Trinité, Martinique. There was an English negro on board one who offered to pilot the British in to take an {{unprotected}} sloop with a cargo of sugar that was lying a few miles to the windward. That night, twelve men in two jolly boats set out to capture the sloop. Adverse tides made for slow going {{and it was only}} at dawn {{that they were able to}} enter the harbour. After one of the boats went in chase of a small craft, Lieutenant Cox, the overall commander of the cutting out party, suddenly noticed that a guarda costa was anchored between him and the sloop. The garda costas crew lined <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> and fired small arms at the British, but apparently did not fire the two 6-pounder guns that were pointing at their attackers. Cox and his five men nevertheless pushed forward and within minutes captured her. Cox then set sail and was able to rejoin Attentive within two hours. He had had only one man wounded in the attack.|$|E
25|$|The western portal is {{decorated}} with special splendour. An important role in its decoration is played by the cantilevered stairs {{that lead to the}} upper level, with profiled butts to the steps. The doorways are framed with broad rectangular plaitbands, with ledges in the upper part, with columns, fillets and strips of various, mostly geometrical, fine and intricate patterns. Between the outer plathand and the arched framing of the openings there are representations of doves and sirens with women's crowned heads. Such reliefs were widely used in fourteenth-century Armenian art and in earlier times in architecture, miniatures and works of applied art, on various vessels and bowls. The entrance tympanums are decorated with bas-reliefs showing, on the lower tympanium, the Holy Virgin with the Child and Archangels Gabriel and Michael at <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> and, on the upper tympanium, a half-length representation of Christ and figures of the Apostles Peter and Paul. As distinct from the reliefs of Noravank's vestry, these ones are carved on a plain surface, which gives them greater independence. The figures are distinguished by their plasticity of form, softness of modeling, and accentuation of certain details of clothing.|$|E

25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|E

500|$|Alma had a {{complete}} [...] wrought iron waterline belt, approximately [...] high. The {{sides of the}} battery itself were armored with [...] of wrought iron and {{the ends of the}} battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness.

500|$|The above-water {{portions}} {{of the first two}} ships' hulls were sheathed with wrought iron armor that was [...] thick. Unlike her two sisters, Conte Verde did not have complete iron armor on <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> She instead had wrought iron armor that covered only parts of her bow and stern instead of the full armored belt fitted to her sisters. The rest of the ship received traditional timber armor.|$|E
500|$|Her {{conversion}} {{was completed}} {{by the end of}} June and her first task was to cover the evacuation of British troops from Perth Amboy, New Jersey on 29 July. The following month, Vigilant served as Howe's flagship when he landed British troops at Elkton, Maryland, at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay, during the Philadelphia Campaign. In October, the ship sailed for the mouth of the Delaware River to attack the American fortifications defending Philadelphia. During this voyage, she rolled so badly during heavy weather that the round shot fell out of her guns and it was later decided that she should not put to sea with her guns mounted except during the summer months. Vigilant was not designed to carry such heavy weights as the [...] 24 pounders up high in the ship and cutting gun ports in <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> further weakened her structure.|$|E
500|$|Levants keel {{was laid}} down in June 1757 but work {{proceeded}} slowly and the vessel was not ready for launch until July 1758. As built, Levant was [...] long with a [...] keel, a beam of , and a hold depth of [...] After Adams' modifications, she measured 595 tons burthen, or nearly ten tons larger than the size specified in the contract. Her armament comprised 24 nine-pounder cannons located along her gun deck, supported by four three-pounder cannons on the quarterdeck and twelve -pounder swivel guns ranged along <b>her</b> <b>sides.</b> The Admiralty-designated complement was 200, comprising two commissioned officers [...] a captain and a lieutenant [...] overseeing 40 warrant and petty officers, 91 naval ratings, 38 Marines and 29 servants and other ranks.

500|$|Rutting males {{fight over}} dominance, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another; they walk stiffly and display their neck and horns. Males desist from feeding and allogrooming during the rut, {{probably}} {{to devote more}} time to garnering females in oestrus; the male checks the female's urine to ensure that she is in oestrus. On coming across such a female, the excited male begins the courtship by pursuing her, keeping a distance of [...] from her. The male flicks his tongue and may nod vigorously; the female allows him to lick her vulva, and holds her tail to one side. The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males.|$|E
500|$|For {{the dress}} that Ming-Na Wen wears in the episode, costume {{designer}} Ann Foley had 10 days notice {{to make a}} dress that was appropriate for both dancing and fighting in. Duplicates also had to be made, for Maya Stojan and Wen's two stunt doubles. She explained that she [...] "decided to do a wrap dress so that [...] could easily dance. It already had a slit sort of built into it, so that gave her freedom of movement. [...] goal is always {{to make sure that}} the actors are comfortable in their costumes, that they can move freely and do their stunts, and that nothing is too restrictive. And that they also look amazing at the same time." [...] The dress also [...] "needed long sleeves so that [...] could have pads on underneath the dress for when she was fighting. And then of course she's got the crazy fight where she's fighting herself...she needed serious freedom of movement in that dress, so we built panels that had stretch, and put them in several areas on her arms and <b>her</b> <b>sides,</b> so that it moved with her as she punched...herself." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Second World War {{began in}} August 1939, Vindictive was {{transferred}} to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister , with nine [...] guns, four twin-gun [...] mounts and a catapult. She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October, when a less complex modernisation was considered. This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns, and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range, but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship. Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar's roof. Her aft superstructure was extended to be flush with <b>her</b> <b>sides</b> and slightly lengthened, and a large deckhouse {{was built on the}} quarterdeck. Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns, all on the centreline, two quadruple [...] "pom-pom" [...] mounts, one on each side, and six depth charges. In this role, she had a standard displacement of [...] ( [...] at full load) and her draught increased to [...]|$|E
