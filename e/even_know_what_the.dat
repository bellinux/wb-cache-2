2500|$|On Sunday 12 July, Jason (aged 8), Mark (aged 9) and Richard Quinn (aged 10) were burnt {{to death}} when their home was petrol bombed by loyalists. The boys' {{mother was a}} Catholic, and their home was in a mainly-Protestant part of Ballymoney. Following the murders, William Bingham (County Grand Chaplain of Armagh {{and member of the}} Orange Order {{negotiating}} team) said that [...] "walking down the Garvaghy Road would be a hollow victory, because {{it would be in the}} shadow of three coffins of little boys who wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Orange Order is about". He said that the Order had lost control of the situation and that [...] "no road is worth a life". However he later apologized for implying that the Order was responsible for the deaths. The murders provoked widespread anger and calls for the Order to end its protest at Drumcree. Although the number of protesters at Drumcree dropped considerably, the Portadown lodges voted unanimously to continue their standoff.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{was born}} in Fort Chimo, Quebec on June 22, 1934. Educated at {{northern}} Quebec mission schools, Adams became an electrician, and eventually owned a number of businesses in different industries around Canada. Adams served for two terms {{as the chairman of}} the Rankin Inlet hamlet council, and in 1970 {{became a member of the}} Northwest Territories Territorial Council (now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories). In spring 1977, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau decided that an Inuk should be appointed to the Senate and dispatched Warren Allmand, the Minister for Northern Affairs, to interview potential candidates. Adams was not excited about joining the Senate upon being asked by Allmand - in fact, he joked that he did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Senate was, asking the Minister, [...] "What's the Senate?" [...] However, upon being advised of a Senator's annual salary of approximately C$60,000, far more than Adams' electrician's pay of $7,500 a year, he seized the opportunity. Adams was appointed as a Senator for the Northwest Territories by Governor General Jules Léger on the advice of the Prime Minister on April 5, 1977, and is a member of the Liberal Party.|$|E

A few of the problems he encountered while build the table {{was that he had}} to spend more on tools than materials and found himself with no one to turn to when faced with a glitch. Maker’s Asylum, Delhi, was born to ensure this doesn’t happen to anyone else. The enthusiastic community in the capital is a 2000 sqft haven for makers.|$|R

We promised {{ourselves}} that our first seven inch would have this name and this cover. Well, we never did a seven inch (except for one {{that was part of}} a label series, which meant that the cover and the title were sort of more beholden to the big picture rather than our dumb ideas) and the whole thing kind of languished, and now, ten years later, in conjunction with our ten year anniversary show and subsequent west coast run (the first run in over 2 years), we've got our first real seven inch on our hands. And guess what? We fucking named it the name that we thought up ten years ago.|$|R

60|$|THEY {{had climbed}} up the slope of a hill, and {{they came to a}} broad old ditch, beneath the shade of a wood of pine trees. Below them was a wide marsh, all yellow with marsh flowers, and above them was a steep slope made of stones. Now the dry ditch, where they sat down on the grass, looking towards the Tweed, with their backs to the hill, was called the Catrail. It ran all through that country, and must have been made by men very long ago. Nobody knows who made it, nor why. They did not know in Randal's time, and they do not know now. They do not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> name Catrail means, but that is what it has always been called. The steep slope of stone above them was named the Camp of Rink; it is a round place, like a ring, and no doubt it was built by the old Britons, when they fought against the Romans, many {{hundreds}} of years ago. The stones of which it is built are so large that we cannot tell how men moved them. But it is a very pleasant, happy place on a warm summer day, like the day when Randal and Jean sat there, with the daisies at their feet, and the wild doves cooing above their heads, and the rabbits running in and out among the ferns.|$|E
5000|$|Rebert says {{he started}} {{arranging}} his first gospel quartet, {{with his brother}} Almo and two cousins, before he <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> quartet style was. The group was called the Friendly Four and then the Friendly Gospel Singers when Harris moved to town to start seventh grade at the Trinity Colored High School. After 10th grade, which {{is as far as}} the school went, 15-year-old Harris attended Mary Allen College in nearby Crockett and weighed a tempting offer to join Silas Roy Crain's (also known as [...] "Senior" [...] Crain or S.R. Crain) group the Soul Stirrers, who had moved to Houston. At the time the Stirrers were a jubilee group, singing poppy, up-tempo numbers such as [...] "Down By the Riverside." [...] But as soon as Harris finally committed (Rebert says the year was 1931; gospel historians usually put the year at '35 or '36), he helped change the group's sound to a slower, deeper, more passionate hard gospel style.|$|R

5000|$|The track may be {{considered}} an autobiographical account of Edwards' attempts to hold down any meaningful relationships. [...] "Revol" [...] is [...] "lover" [...] spelt backwards.

50|$|However, it {{has been}} argued that the value of {{physical}} capital is notoriously difficult to measure empirically in an accurate way; and statistical time-series for economic variables over long periods are also susceptible to errors and distortions.

That worth is hypothetical until such time as the business is sold and paid for.
