40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that some visual motion areas can be specifically recruited by auditory motion processing <b>in</b> blindfolded <b>sighted</b> subjects [Poirier, C., Collignon, O., De Volder, A. G., Renier, L., Vanlierde, A., Tranduy, D., Scheiber, C., 2005. Specific activation of V 5 brain area by auditory motion processing: an fMRI study. Brain Res. Cogn. Brain Res. 25, 650 - 658]. The present fMRI study investigated whether auditory motion processing may recruit the same brain areas in early blind subjects. The task consisted of simultaneously determining both {{the nature of}} a sound stimulus (pure tone or complex sound) and {{the presence or absence of}} its movement. When a movement was present, blind subjects had to identify its direction. Auditory motion processing, as compared to static sound processing, activated the brain network of auditory and visual motion processing classically observed <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> subjects. Accordingly, brain areas previously considered as specific to visual motion processing could be specifically recruited in blind people by motion stimuli presented through the auditory modality. This indicates that the occipital cortex of blind people could be organized in a modular way, as <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> people. The similarity of these results with those we previously observed <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> subjects suggests that occipital recruitment in blind people could be mediated by the same anatomical connections as <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> subjects...|$|R

40|$|Although vision offers {{distinctive}} {{information to}} space representation, individuals who lack vision since birth often show perceptual and representational skills {{comparable to those}} found <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> individuals. However, congenitally blind individuals may result in impaired spatial analysis, when engaging in ‘visual’ spatial features (e. g., perspective or angle representation) or complex spatial mental abilities. In the present study, we measured behavioral and brain responses using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and congenitally blind individuals during spatial imagery based on {{a modified version of the}} mental clock task (e. g., angle discrimination) and a simple recognition control condition, as conveyed across distinct sensory modalities: visual (sighted individuals only), tactile and auditory. Blind individuals were significantly less accurate during the auditory task, but comparable-to-sighted during the tactile task. As expected, both groups showed common neural activations in intraparietal and superior parietal regions across visual and non-visual spatial perception and imagery conditions, indicating the more abstract, sensory independent functional organization of these cortical areas, a property that we named supramodality. At the same time, however, comparisons in brain responses and functional connectivity patterns across experimental conditions demonstrated also a functional lateralization, in a way that correlated with the distinct behavioral performance <b>in</b> blind and <b>sighted</b> individuals. Specifically, blind individuals relied more on right parietal regions, mainly in the tactile and less in the auditory spatial processing. <b>In</b> <b>sighted,</b> spatial representation across modalities relied more on left parietal regions. In conclusions, intraparietal and superior parietal regions subserve supramodal spatial representations <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and congenitally blind individuals. Differences in their recruitment across non-visual spatial processing <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and blind individuals may be related to distinctive behavioral performance and/or mental strategies adopted when they deal with the same spatial representation as conveyed through different sensory modalities...|$|R

40|$|Across many {{cultures}} people conceptualize time as extending along a horizontal Mental Time Line (MTL). This spatial mapping of {{time has been}} shown to depend on experience with written text, and may also depend on other graphic conventions such as graphs and calendars. All of this information is typically acquired visually, suggesting that visual experience may {{play an important role in}} the development of the MTL. Do blind people develop a MTL? If so, how does it compare with the MTL <b>in</b> <b>sighted?</b> <b>In</b> this study we tested early blind, late blind and <b>sighted</b> participants <b>in</b> a space-time congruity task. Participants had to classify temporal words by pressing a right and a left key, either with crossed or uncrossed hands. We found that the MTL develops in the absence of vision, and that it is based on the same external frame of reference <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and blind people. Reading braille may provide the same experiential link between space and time in the manual modality as reading printed text provides in the visual modality. These results showing a similar MTL <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and blind participants contrast with previous results showing that the Mental Number Line (MNL) depends on different spatial coordinates <b>in</b> the <b>sighted</b> and the blind, and suggest that spatial representations of time and number may have different experiential bases...|$|R

40|$|Human middle {{temporal}} complex (hMT+) responds also to {{the perception}} of non-visual motion <b>in</b> both <b>sighted</b> and early blind individuals, indicating a supramodal organization. Visual experience, however, leads to a segregation of hMT+ into a more anterior subregion, involved in the supramodal representation of motion, and a posterior subregion that processes visual motion only. In contrast, in congenitally blind subjects tactile motion activates {{the full extent of}} hMT+. Here, we used fMRI to investigate brain areas functionally connected with the two hMT+ subregions (seeds) during visual and tactile motion <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and blind individuals. A common functional connectivity network for motion processing, including bilateral ventral and dorsal extrastriate, inferior frontal, middle and inferior temporal areas, correlated with the two hMT+ seeds both <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> and blind individuals during either visual or tactile motion, independently from the sensory modality through which the information was acquired. Moreover, ventral premotor, somatosensory and posterior parietal areas correlated only with the anterior but not with the posterior portion of hMT+ <b>in</b> <b>sighted</b> subjects, and with both hMT+ seeds in blind subjects. Furthermore, a correlation between middle temporal and occipital areas with primary somatosensory seeds was demonstrated across conditions <b>in</b> both <b>sighted</b> and blind individuals, suggesting a cortico-cortical pathway that conveys non-visual information from somatosensory cortex, through posterior parietal regions, to ventral extrastriate cortex. These findings expand our knowledge about the development of the functional organization within hMT+ by showing that distinct patterns of brain functional correlations originate from the anterior and posterior hMT+ subregions as a result of visual experience...|$|R
