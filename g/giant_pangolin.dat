500|$|The first foragers {{visited the}} West Mouth of Niah Cave (located 110km {{southwest}} of Miri city) 50,000 {{years ago when}} Borneo {{was connected to the}} mainland of Southeast Asia. The landscape of Niah Cave was drier and more open than it is now. Prehistoric Niah Cave was surrounded by a mosaic of closed forests with bush, parkland, swamps, and rivers. The foragers were able to survive in the rainforests through hunting, fishing, mollusc collection, and plant gathering. The earliest evidence of human population in the area dates back to 40,000BC in Niah Cave at Paleolithic period. This is evidenced by the discovery of a Homo sapiens skull nicknamed [...] "Deep Skull" [...] in a deep trench uncovered by Tom Harrisson in 1958, which is the oldest modern human skull in Southeast Asia. The skull probably belongs to a 16- to 17-year-old adolescent girl.

5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>{{pangolin}}</b> (Smutsia gigantea) is a pangolin species. Members of {{the species}} inhabit Africa with a range stretching along the equator from West Africa to Uganda. The <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> is the largest species of pangolins, or [...] "scaly anteaters" [...] - [...] the large, scaled mammals belonging to the family Manidae. It subsists almost entirely on ants and termites. The species was first described by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1815.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>{{pangolin}}</b> is {{the largest}} of all pangolin species. While its average mass has not been measured, one specimen was found to weigh 33 kg (72.6 lb). Males are larger than females, with male body lengths about 140 cm (4.6 ft) and females about 125 cm (4.1 ft). Like all pangolins, the species is armored with large, brown to reddish-brown scales formed from keratin. Curiously, it also has eyelashes. The <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> has a long snout, a long, thick tail, and large front claws.|$|E
2500|$|Leptictidium (meaning [...] "graceful weasel" [...] in Latin) is an extinct genus {{of small}} mammals; {{together}} with macropods, <b>giant</b> <b>pangolins,</b> and humans, {{they are the}} only known completely bipedal mammals.

They are especially interesting for their combination of characteristics typical of primitive eutherians with highly specialized adaptations, such as powerful hind legs and a long tail which aided in locomotion. They were omnivorous, their diet a combination of insects, lizards and small mammals. One of the first branches to split from basal eutherians, they appeared in the Lower Eocene, a time of warm temperatures and high humidity, roughly fifty million years ago. Although they were widespread throughout Europe, they became extinct around thirty-five million years ago with no descendants, probably because they were adapted to live in forest ecosystems and were unable to adapt to the open plains of the Oligocene.|$|R

50|$|Like all pangolins, the <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> is a {{specialized}} insectivore that lacks teeth {{and the ability}} to chew. Its diet mainly consists of ants and termites, which it finds by tearing open anthills and termite nests, both subterranean and mound-type.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> inhabits many countries, {{with the}} largest {{concentration}} in Uganda, Tanzania, and western Kenya.

50|$|A {{number of}} groups of extant mammals have {{independently}} evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans, <b>giant</b> <b>pangolins,</b> the extinct <b>giant</b> ground sloths, numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied, are documented in the next section. Macropods {{are believed to have}} evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago.Bipedal movement is less common among mammals, most of which are quadrupedal. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), kangaroo rats and mice, hopping mice and springhare move bipedally by hopping. Very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping. Exceptions are the ground pangolin and in some circumstances the tree kangaroo. One black bear, Pedals, became famous locally and on the internet for having a frequent bipedal gait, although this is attributed to injuries on the bear's front paws.|$|R
25|$|Mammals in the {{sanctuary}} include Tigers, Leopards, Wild Dogs, Jackals, Gaurs, Elephants; Sloth Bears, Sambar Deer, Spotted Deer, Wild Boar, Common Langurs; Bonnet macaques, Common Mongoose, Striped-necked Mongoose, Porcupine, Malabar giant squirrel, <b>giant</b> flying squirrel, <b>Pangolin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin,</b> {{like other}} pangolins, is nocturnal, which makes {{observation}} difficult. It is also usually solitary, although {{in one case}} an adult was seen in a burrow with a juvenile. The species is capable of climbing trees and other objects.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{comprises}} {{a complex}} mosaic habitat, consisting of savannah, savannah-woodland, regenerating forest and gallery forest. The area {{is rich in}} African fauna typifying both savannah and forest habitats, including: elephants, lions, hyenas, leopards, giant forest hogs, <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin,</b> baboons, grey-cheeked mangabeys, red-tailed guenons, and buffalo.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{relatively}} large size, the <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> is particularly well-suited to breaking open termite mounds by {{leaning on the}} mound and resting its weight on its tail, and then ripping into the mound with its front claws. The combination of weight and physical damage quickly leads to a partial collapse of the mound, exposing the termites. Only the adults {{are strong enough to}} do this; their young must follow behind their mothers until they grow large enough to do it for themselves. It eats the insects by picking them up with its sticky tongue, which is up to 16 in long.|$|E
5000|$|Campo Ma'an National Park covers {{an area of}} 264,064 hectare and was {{established}} in 2000. The combined area for the national park and the buffer zone surrounding the park is approximately 700,000 hectares. The Campo Wildlife Reserve established in 1932 and the Ma’an Production Reserve set up in 1980 were combined to form this park in the year 2000 as a {{compensation for the damage}} caused to the ecosystem due laying of the oil pipe line in Cameroon. The park area includes four logging concessions, an agro-forestry zone, and an agro-industrial zone known for rubber and palms. The biodiversity of the area has wide range of plants and animals species including several taxonomic endemics. The mammal species reported are 87 including elephants, lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, hippos, <b>giant</b> <b>pangolins,</b> black colobus, mandrills and leopards.

50|$|Very little {{information}} about the reproduction of the <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> is known. Two birth records exist, with one litter in September and another in October, with the young weighing around 500 g. As in all pangolins, infants have soft scales that eventually harden, and are born with open eyes. They cannot walk on their legs, but can move on their bellies. During age 6-8 weeks, the young often spew a yellow secretion from their anal glands(that is often said to smell of decay and cabbage) to keep predators and other animals from taking advantage of their mothers.|$|E

40|$|During a {{visit to}} the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden in July 1964, Dr D. A. Hooijer kindly allowed me to re-examine the mandibular {{fragment}} which had been discovered by Eugène Dubois on 24 November 1890 at Kedung Brubus, a fossil locality in the Kendeng Beds in Central Java (Dubois, 1891 a, 1891 b, 1924 a, 1924 b). As a result of a possibly important new point which emerged during my examination of the specimen, Dr Hooijer urged me to place my observations and their implications on record. It is the purpose of this short paper to do so. BRIEF HISTORICAL SYNOPSIS In his original two notes of 1891, Dubois clearly recognized the fragment as belonging to "Homo spec. indet. " He drew attention to the poor chin development and the curious flattening and hollowing of the inner surface, which he attributed to the attachment of the Musculus digastricus. On this basis, he spoke of the fragment as representing " [...] . eene andere en waarschijnlijk lagere type dan eenige die men kent" (1891 a). Thirty-three years later, Dubois described (1924 a) and beautifully illustrated (1924 b) the little jaw fragment. At this time he definitely associated it with the Trinil hominid fossils and regarded it as part of the hypodigm of Pithecanthropus erectus. A passing reference was made to this "very peculiar human mandible" {{in the course of his}} description of the <b>Giant</b> <b>Pangolin</b> of the Kendeng fauna (Dubois, 1926), while the description and illustrations were repeated in Dubois (1938). The mandible (or a cast) was studied by McGregor (1925), Weinert (1928) and Weidenreich (1936). McGregor accepted it as a jaw of P. erectus; Weinert reserved judgment until definite Pithecanthropus mandibles should be discovered. Weidenreich...|$|E
40|$|The Korup {{rainforest}} of Southwest Cameroon {{is an area}} {{of unique}} biological diversity. However, hunting and trapping by people living within the protected zone of the Korup National Park, and in the areas immediately outside it, are eliminating many animal species, including elephant, <b>giant</b> <b>pangolin</b> and many small mammals. The decline in coffee and cocoa prices has led to an increase in sales and consumption of 'bush' meat as people have sought alternative sources of income and food. If continued unchecked, hunting and trapping would lead to the breakdown of the intricate biological web of species interdependence and the destruction of the forest. For example, the World Resources Institute has identified 71 plant species which have germinated after passing through the gut of elephants. These comprise about 11 % of all vascular plants found at Korup and the destruction of elephants alone would jeopardize and perhaps prevent the dispersal and continued survival of many plants. There are six villages within the Park and 100 villages in the surrounding area with a total population of about 27, 000. It was recognized by me Government of Cameroon and international conservation organizations that it was essential for a project to be set up that would work in harmony with the local population through education, involvement and, most importantly, by providing alternative sources of income. The urgent requirement for a positive, structured approach to rural development in the Korup area to help manage me resources of the forest on a sustainable basis has been met by me Korup National Park Project. This was set up in collaboration with the Government of Cameroon and has been managed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). The European Union is the principal funding agency. Other significant donors are UK Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and the German Development Agency (GTZ). Between 1993 and 1996 ODA funding is specifically supporting a rural development component to raise standards of living for both individuals and communities through a variety of rural enterprises and improvements in infrastructure. Activities include projects for rearing small livestock, using improved planting material, developing community farms to multiply improved planting stock, and planting local and exotic fruit trees. EU funding includes financial aid for infrastructural development such as the construction of primary schools, health centres, water supplies and roads. Resettlement of villagers from within to outside the Park is a major concern of the Cameroon authorities. If the Korup forest within the Park is to survive the local people must be assisted and guided to develop a system for exploiting the animals and plants in the zone surrounding the Park on a sustainable basis. If the wildlife within the Park can be adequately protected, preferably with the full cooperation of the local people, breeding populations within the Park will produce an overspill into the surrounding area where hunting and trapping can be carried out under a proper system of controls. Feeder roads will encourage the production of a wider range of cash crops by providing easier access for bringing in inputs, and better transport links to major markets. A more intensive and productive form of agriculture should result in improved food security and thus in better nutrition levels. This in turn should greatly reduce the need for hunting wildlife, and increase household income through the sale of crops. It has been estimated that 80 % of the animals killed are sold and only 20 % are consumed. With poverty endemic in the area it is essential that resource management offers local people more than just the opportunity to substitute crops for animals as a source of income. There should be clear opportunities to gain a higher income as well as better living standards, clean water supply, education and improved communications. The Korup Project is engaged in all these aspects of development. The Korup rainforest of Southwest Cameroon {{is an area of}} unique biological diversity. However, hunting and trapping by people living within the protected zone of the Korup National Park, and in the areas immediately outside it, are eliminating many [...] ...|$|E
