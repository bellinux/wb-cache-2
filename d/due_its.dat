5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} forecast further intensification to 60mph (95km/h), {{although the}} agency {{also noted that}} the circulation could dissipate, <b>due</b> <b>its</b> fast forward motion toward the east-northeast. Ultimately, wind shear prohibited significant strengthening, and Leslie attained peak winds of 45mph (70km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October7, 375mi (600km) north of Bermuda. It accelerated to the northeast and passed over Newfoundland on October8. The remnants of Leslie turned to the east, then southeast, strengthening to near-hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near Ireland on October10.|$|E

5|$|Early on June13, {{satellite}} and weather radar showed heavy rainbands moving across Jamaica and eastern Cuba. <b>Due</b> <b>its</b> {{interaction with the}} two islands, the depression weakened slightly. Later on June13, the storm made landfall near Venezuela, Cuba with winds of 30mph (45km/h). Moving northward, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cayo Santa María early the next day. Around 12:00UTC on June14, the system re-strengthened and again attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 35mph (55km/h). Despite moving back over open waters, the depression failed to intensify further. Operationally, the system was thought to have made landfall in east-central Florida, but later analysis revealed that the center remained over water. The depression continued northward until striking near Charleston, South Carolina late on June16, still with the same intensity. It degenerated into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later. Its remnants continued northeastward across the Southeastern United States, the Mid-Atlantic, and New England until dissipating fully on June18.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, <b>due</b> <b>its</b> low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (MAC), {{also known}} as the Chepauk Stadium or simply Chepauk <b>due</b> <b>its</b> {{location}} in the city's locality of Chepauk, is a sports ground in Chennai, India that has hosted international cricket matches along with provincial games. Named after M. A. Chidambaram, former President of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the venue was formerly known as the Madras Cricket Club ground. It has a capacity of 38,000 spectators for international matches. It is the home ground of the Tamil Nadu cricket team and the Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings. The first Test at this venue took place in 1934, between India and England. As of December 2016, it has hosted a further 31 Test matches. Chepauk has also staged 19 One Day International (ODI) matches, the first of which was in 1987 when Australia defeated India in a group-match during the 1987 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium <b>due</b> <b>its</b> additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} {{has set a}} target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, which requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required {{to contribute to the}} delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region <b>due</b> <b>its</b> large wind energy potential. The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148MW for installed grid-connected renewable energy. There are operational wind farms at Lissett in Holderness and Out Newton {{to the north of the}} Humber estuary.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Mario & Luigi {{differs from}} most other role-playing games <b>due</b> <b>its</b> focus on controlling Mario and Luigi simultaneously. During overworld sections, the directional pad controls Mario's movement with Luigi following closely, while Mario and Luigi's other actions are controlled individually with the A (Mario) and B (Luigi) buttons respectively. The game begins with them {{being able to}} jump independently, though they will soon gain access to hammers {{and a variety of}} other techniques as the game progresses. For example, Luigi's hammer can be used to squash Mario into a smaller size, allowing to access small gaps, while placing Mario on Luigi's shoulders allows them to act like a propeller and hover across large gaps. Various enemies roam the overworld, and coming into contact with these enemies initiates a battle. Landing a hit on the enemy while on the overworld allows the player to deal pre-emptive damage, while the opposite is also possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognition}} of Buckeyes in the Standard {{has been a}} significant factor in its survival. In the past, largely <b>due</b> <b>its</b> lack of color variations, the Buckeye has not been an especially popular exhibition breed, but there is growing interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, threatened being defined as: Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States, with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks, and estimated global population less than 5,000. The breed is also included in the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely <b>due</b> <b>its</b> forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
