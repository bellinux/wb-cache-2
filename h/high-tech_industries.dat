Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important shipping center. As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of the Johnson Space Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the regional economy and began the development of an aerospace industry, and later other <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|E

The <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry</b> must continue research and development (R and D) and innovation to improve New Product Development (NPD) industry performance. This research analyzed the influences of R and D management activities and design/manufacturing integration mechanisms introduced by Taiwan’s <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry</b> on NPD performance. This study {{on the relationship between}} R and D management capacity and NPD performance considers the intervening variables of industry and corporate position. Taiwan’s <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry</b> has gradually entered the technical capacity-based and design/manufacturing integrated industry improvement era. This research reveals the significance of academic and empirical application to the high technology industry. The research result found that the stronger the R and D management capacity of Taiwans <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry,</b> the more significant its influence on NPD performance, the better the design/manufacturing integration mechanisms of Taiwan’s <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry,</b> the more significant the influence on NPD performance, the stronger the R and D management capacity of Taiwans <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry,</b> the better the design/manufacturing integration mechanism and the more significant their influences on NPD performance, corporate scale was not necessarily the major factor for the NPD success and corporate scale did not result in significant differences in NPD performance and the higher the leading degree of corporate techniques, the more significant the NPD performance...|$|R

A lifelong religious skeptic, Ellie tries to convince Joss of her faith in science by standing near a heavy Foucault pendulum and trusting that its amplitude will not increase. Although dismissing Rankin's outbursts, Ellie is intrigued by Joss' worldview. Shortly after, Ellie travels to Paris to discuss the machine with a newly formed consortium. The participants reach a consensus that the machine is a dodecahedron shaped vehicle with five seats. At the conference, Ellie meets Devi Sukhavati, a doctor who left India to marry the man she loved, only to lose him to illness a year later. The final piece of the message is discovered when S. R.
