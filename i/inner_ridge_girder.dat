In the type region in Biberach there is a clear, but rather atypical double moraine ridge, also atypical is the double terrace here, which is probably due to heavy erosion as the meltwater runoff moved from the Wellheim dry valley and Altmühl valley into the present day Danube valley, a process that took place during the Riss glaciation.

40|$|Array camera {{images of}} the central 1 parsec of the Galactic Center at eight {{mid-infrared}} wavelengths between 4. 8 and 20. 0 microns with approximately 1 arcsec resolution are used to model the temperature, opacity and bolometric luminosity distributions of the emitting dust in the central parsec, and the extinction {{in the line of}} sight. We use the results to discriminate between two mechanisms for heating the dust: heating by radiation from a "central engine" (possibly a massive black hole associated with Sgr A*), or internal heating by luminous stars embedded in or among the dust clouds. The temperature and opacity distributions are consistent with the presence of self-luminous objects imbedded at prominent the IRS source positions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} three patho-gnomonic criteria, <b>inner</b> border, <b>ridge</b> sign, and rag sign with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) using video exoscopy. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of video recordings of 335 patients, referred for diagnostic colposcopy, who underwent cervical biopsies, and, if indicated loop excisions, was performed. The most severe histologic diagnosis was recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios for highgrade CIN were calculated. RESULTS: In 285 patients (85 %), a single colposcopy directed biopsy was taken; 50 patients (15 %) underwent two biopsies. One hundred sixty-two patients (48 %) underwent subsequent magnification-guided loop excision. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the inner border to detect high-grade CIN were 20 %, 99 %, 97. 9 %, and 34. 8 %, respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 20. 3 and the negative likelihood ratio (LR 2) was 0. 81. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the ridge sign to detect high-grade CIN were 52. 5 %, 96. 4 %, 96. 8 %, and 46. 6 %, respectively. The LR+ ratio was 13. 2 and the LR-ratio was 0. 49. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the rag sign to detect high-grade CIN were 38. 4 %, 96 %, 95. 7 %, and 40. 2 %, respectively. The LR+ ratio was 9. 7 and the LR-ratio was 0. 6. Only the ridge sign showed a correlation with young age. Presence of any two signs significantly increased the LR {{of the presence of}} high-grade CIN.

5000|$|The Marseilles moraine was {{preceded by}} the Bloomington morainic system. The name is taken {{from the village of}} Marseilles, located where the Illinois River cuts through the moraine.

[...] For 25 misouth it combined with a till ridge called the Minooka Ridge. This follows the east side of Fox River, past St. Charles, Geneva, Batavio, and Aurora. The east side of each city occupies the outer face of the moraine. The width of the belt is 2 mi or 3 mi. The moraine continues south along the line of Will and Kendall counties. It runs about 2 mi or 3 mi beyond the river. The Marseilles moraine turns west, at the bluff between Oswego and Yorkville. The Minooka Ridge continues southward to the Illinois River. The Marseilles moraine follows nearly the southeast bluff of Fox River to the mouth of the stream, its outer border being nowhere more than 4 mi and usually less than 1 mi from the stream. The width in Kendall County is only 2 or 3 miles, but increases to 5 or 6 miles in northeastern LaSalle County, near the north bluff of the Illinois River.At the Illinois Valley it changes from southsouthwest to a south-southeast course.

40|$|Calcareous nannofossils {{occur in}} lagoonal sediments {{recovered}} from Sites 873, 874, and 877 drilled on Wodejebato Guyot {{in the central}} Pacific Ocean. Nannofloras are present only in a few layers, from which several smear slides were prepared. All the specimens were counted, and the relative abundance of taxa was computed as percentages. Assemblages are characterized by excellent preservation, very high diversity (= number of taxa), but extremely low abundance. Both diversity and abundance decrease from the <b>inner</b> perimeter <b>ridge</b> along {{the northern edge of}} the atoll (Sites 877 and 874) to the inner lagoon (Site 873), but the assemblage composition is very similar at the three sites. The dominant species are Prediscosphaera spp., Cribrosphaerella ehrenbergii, Cretarhabdus spp., Biscutum constans, and Zygodiscus erectus. Watznaueria barnesae is common but not dominant. Holococcoliths were observed at all sites. All taxa are represented by dwarf specimens. At Site 877, the CC 22 Zone of late Campanian age was determined; at Sites 873 and 874, nannofloral assemblages indicate a Campanian age. The Cenomanian-restricted species Corollithion kennedyi was found at Site 877, suggesting the presence of older sediments on Wodejebato Guyot. Evidence of reworking is also given by the occurrence of recrystallized, broken, and often phosphatized specimens of long-ranging taxa. Reworking is more abundant in the lagoon than at the <b>inner</b> <b>ridge.</b> The investigation was extended to the upper Campanian interval recovered at Site 869, which was drilled during Leg 143 on the oceanic floor south of Wodejebato Guyot. Here, nannofloras are represented by normal-sized specimens, and the assemblage composition is typically oceanic, suggesting that the nannoplankton at Sites 873, 874, and 877 adjusted to restricted environmental conditions. Calcareous nannoplankton occur in extant lagoons, where coccoliths are found in the sediments and in the water samples. Lagoonal nannofloras are also preserved in the fossil record of various ages: Neogene, Oligocene, Paleocene, Early Cretaceous, and Middle to Late Jurassic. There are similarities and differences between the nannofloras from Wodejebato and assemblages from other ancient lagoons. The small size of the coccoliths seems to be a peculiarity of lagoonal assemblages and {{may be related to the}} unusual environmental conditions. The genus Braarudosphaera—inferred to be a low salinity form—is usually absent. The relatively high abundance of fertility indicators B. constans and Z. erectus at Sites 873, 874, and 877 is possibly controlled by the proximity of Wodejebato Guyot to the paleoequatorial upwelling belt during the Campanian. In fact, similar nannofloras were previously reported from mid-Cretaceous sites at comparable paleolatitudes in the central-western Pacific. This interpretation is substantiated by the record of Site 869, where a few layers are relatively enriched in Prediscosphaera spp., C. ehrenbergii, B. constans, and Z. erectus, although nannofloral assemblages for the most part are affected by diagenesis and dominated by such dissolution-resistant taxa as Watznaueria barnesae, Cretarhabdus spp., and Micula decussata. The present study suggests that C. ehrenbergii and Prediscosphaera also possibly bloomed under relatively fertile surface-water conditions in the Late Cretaceous...|$|R
