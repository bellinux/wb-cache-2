5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 <b>feet</b> <b>apart,</b> at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six <b>feet</b> <b>apart</b> along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} at 5 Buckingham Gate, Kensington (Adare); at Ashley Place, Westminster (Adare); at Victoria Street, Westminster (Lindsay). There was a ledge 4 inches wide below the windows (Adare); a ledge 1½ inches wide (Lindsay); no foothold at all (Lindsay); balconies 7 <b>feet</b> <b>apart</b> (Adare); no balconies at all (Lindsay). The windows were 85 feet from the street (Lindsay); 70 feet (Lindsay); 80 feet (Home); {{on the third floor}} (Adare); on the first floor (Adare). It was dark (Adare); there was a bright moonlight (Lindsay). Home was asleep in one room and the witnesses went into the next (Adare); Home left the witnesses in one room and went himself into the next (Adare).|$|E

5|$|This {{same general}} {{area of the}} {{property}} was used also for the drying of the varnished fabric. This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 <b>feet</b> <b>apart</b> and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 <b>feet</b> <b>apart,</b> including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
25|$|Trains often raced {{one another}} {{so as to}} be the first to arrive at their destination. Racing was {{encouraged}} by the fact that in many areas, the two lines were only several hundred <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b> On the Cape May lines, the trains were in sight of each other for 11 miles between Cape May Court House and Cape May. Over the last 5 miles into Cape May, the tracks were only 50 <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
50|$|The house {{features}} a combined kitchen and family room, a sunken {{living room with}} a cathedral ceiling, and a gallery that leads to four bedrooms. All interior walls are paneled in Philippine mahogany, with raised horizontal bands set about a <b>foot</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{scaffold}} and platform {{was built}} around the tree above the flaring roots. Two chiseled grooves about one <b>foot</b> <b>apart</b> were made around the tree and then the wood between cut away with a hammer and maul. The process was repeated until the tree fell.|$|R

The pontoon was tested with the Palsey Pontoon on the Medway.|$|R
25|$|During the {{competitive}} {{years of the}} English waterways system, an established canal company would often refuse to allow a connection from a newer, adjacent one. This situation created the Worcester Bar in Birmingham, where goods had to be transshipped between boats on rival canals only <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{portrait}} {{heads are}} located {{high on the}} walls of the U-shaped floor, running above the windows, with paintings several <b>feet</b> <b>apart</b> spaced out by images mainly of books. There is a division by the topics on which the authors wrote, corresponding to the university disciplines of the time. The theological display is on the southern flank; the northern side's authors refer to the Faculty of Arts.|$|E
25|$|The International Peace Garden {{is located}} at the border between Manitoba and North Dakota, about midway between the nearby {{communities}} of Boissevain, Manitoba and Dunseith, North Dakota. It has as its focal point the Peace Tower (actually four identical monuments 120 feet (36.6 m) tall set parallel only a few <b>feet</b> <b>apart,</b> two {{on each side of the}} border, giving the appearance of a double tower from most vantage points in the Garden).|$|E

25|$|The Intermediate (50/70) Division, {{which had}} {{operated}} on a pilot basis since the 2011 season, was announced {{as an official}} Little League division, the first new division since 1999. The division, which launched fully in the 2013 season, has the same age limits as standard Little League but extends the pitching rubber to 50 feet from home plate and features bases 70 <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b> The field is also larger than in standard Little League, and the rules are closer to those of standard baseball.|$|E
25|$|On {{the cliff}} face of a {{mountain}} nearby, three colossal statues were carved 4,000 <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b> One of them was 175 feet (53 m) high standing statue of Buddha, the world's tallest. The ancient statue was carved during the Kushan period in the fifth century. The statues were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001, {{on the grounds that}} they were an affront to Islam, even though they were left intact by Muslim rulers for 1200 years. Limited efforts have been made to rebuild them, with negligible success.|$|E
25|$|Vercingetorix {{sent the}} cavalry around Gaul {{to call the}} Gallic tribes to war and come to Alesia. When Caesar heard of this from deserters and captives, he dug a trench twenty feet deep (6 metres, 19ft.) with {{perpendicular}} sides, built all other works four hundred feet (118 m, 388ft.) away from that trench and in between he dug two trenches fifteen feet (4.4 m,14.5ft.) in length and depth. The inner one was filled with water from the rivers. Behind them he built a twelve feet high (3.5 m, 11.6ft.) rampart and wall with a parapet and large stakes projecting from the joint between the parapet and the battlement to prevent the enemy from scaling it. This was surrounded with turrets eighty <b>feet</b> <b>apart</b> (23.7 m, 77.7ft.). The stakes for the palisade were sharpened to a point, sunk into a five-feet deep trench (1.5m, 4.85ft.), fastened at the bottom {{so that they could}} not be pulled up, and placed in five intersected rows. Eight rows, three <b>feet</b> <b>apart</b> (0.89 m, 2.9ft.), of conic pits which were three feet deep were dug in oblique rows {{in the form of a}} quincunx (an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners the fifth at the centre) in front of the palisade.They were called 'cippi.' Stakes sharpened at the top and hardened with fire, the thickness of a man’s thigh, were sunk in the pits and protruded four inches (0.1 m, 3.9 inches) from the ground. The pits were filled with clay and covered over with twigs. One-foot-long stakes (0.3 m) with iron hooks were sunk at small intervals in front of the pits. To prepare for the arrival of the Gallic relief forces he constructed an outer fortification, a contravallation, with the same specifications as protection against external attack by the Gallic relief force. The besiegers were preparing to be besieged.|$|E
5000|$|For instance, {{describing}} the fight at Miskel's barn, Munson says of William H. Chapman (later lieutenant colonel of Mosby's command) wheeling his horse in {{a thicket of}} Yankees [...] "the pistols were not a <b>foot</b> <b>apart.</b> The Yankee's pistol snapped misfired but Chapman's did its deadly work. He fired six shots and emptied five saddles." ...|$|R
60|$|Now Dick set his <b>foot</b> <b>apart</b> and, arrow on string, thrice {{he lifted}} his bow and thrice let it sink again, perhaps because he felt some breath of wind stir the still air. A fourth time he lifted, and drew, not as he had before, but {{straight}} to the ear, then loosed at once.|$|R
50|$|All five {{homes are}} very similar in style except for small {{ornamental}} features. Although only one <b>foot</b> <b>apart,</b> none of the houses touch, despite the first impression {{that they may be}} town homes. A private park for the Wernes existed behind the five houses, it has since became a parking lot for the Belgravia Court Association.|$|R
25|$|Pound locks {{were first}} used in medieval China during the Song Dynasty (9601279 AD).The Songshi or History of the Song Dynasty, volume 307, {{biography}} 66, records how Qiao Weiyue, a high-ranking tax administrator, was frustrated at the frequent losses incurred when his grain barges were wrecked on the West River near Huai’an in Jiangsu. The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges {{so that they}} could steal the spilled grain. In 984 Qiao installed a pair of sluice-gates two hundred and fifty <b>feet</b> <b>apart,</b> the entire structure roofed over like a building. By siting two staunch gates so close by one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden baulks in the top gate and emptied into the canal below by lowering baulks in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.|$|E
500|$|After a case {{which reached}} the Supreme Court in 1871 and a {{subsequent}} {{appeal to the}} United States Court, a decision was ultimately made to construct stations at both locations. [...] Both the Central Square and Market Street stations were in service by mid-1872, but it was untenable for the railroad to serve two stations just several hundred <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b> [...] The Market Street station was demolished in 1873 and replaced with a wooden shelter that served {{only a handful of}} trains.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed during {{the end of}} September/ {{beginning}} of October, 2006. One of the first scenes, where Keller talks to Weir was done on one long take. In {{the middle of the}} scene, the two entered an Atlantis transporter to another floor. The scene was filmed on the same floor, and during the time on the transporter, around 40 people quickly redecorated the hallway. The first scene Michael Beach appeared in was the conference {{at the beginning of the}} episode. Despite his lack of knowledge to the series, Beach still acted the scene in one take, where the writers were convinced at his acting style. Beach also asked several questions about the direction and characteristics of his character. Martin Wood noted that he asked [...] "all the right questions." [...] The scene showing McKay and Zelenka below the horizon was filmed from above by Brad Wright's request, though Gero and Wood wanted the scene shot horizontally. The one scene featuring Stiers as Oberoth was the conversation between him and Weir, which was filmed on the same large room, only Stiers and Torri Higginson had their back to each other around five to ten <b>feet</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E

60|$|We saw the day's output--shining little nests of diamonds, {{distributed}} a <b>foot</b> <b>apart,</b> along a counter, each nest reposing upon a {{sheet of}} white paper. That day's catch was about $70,000 worth. In {{the course of a}} year half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on that counter; the resulting money is $18,000,000 or $20,000,000. Profit, about $12,000,000.|$|R
60|$|They {{were only}} a few inches deep and about a <b>foot</b> <b>apart.</b> Venters began to count them--one--two--three--four--on up to sixteen. That number carried his glance to the top of his first bulging bench of cliff-base. Above, after a more level offset, was still steeper slope, and the line of nicks kept on, to wind round a {{projecting}} corner of wall.|$|R
500|$|In 1941 the {{situation}} improved. From 1 January to 5 March 1941, 79 ships were sunk. In return, just one U-boat was damaged. But in August to December, three were sunk and another three damaged by air attack. With just 12 U-boats at sea {{this was a}} considerable achievement. DCs were being circulated to squadrons and ASV was coming online, though some crews {{did not believe in}} its ability to detect submarines. Coastal Command issued tactical instructions to enact 'full release' of DCs, spaced 60 <b>feet</b> <b>apart,</b> and set at a depth of 50 feet. Later, pistols achieved 25–32 feet depth. The spacing was later altered to 100 feet. The 'total release' was questioned. A miss could mean the exhausting of ammunition for other sightings. Aircraft like the Wellington could carry ten [...] DCs, one of which could sink a U-boat if it hit within [...] Total release of 10 DCs would be wasteful. The aircraft were ordered to attack within 30 seconds of a sighting, as U-boats could dive in that time. Some crews attacked below the 100 foot altitude stated and had to avoid striking the submarine. The modified naval [...] DC could not be released at over , as it broke up. The [...] DC could be dropped at speeds of [...] and was very accurate. It became the standard weapon.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the middle}} of all were two square, wooden columns, {{denominated}} in marine architecture [...] "Bowsprit Bitts." [...] They were about a <b>foot</b> <b>apart,</b> and between them, by a rusty chain, swung the forecastle lamp, burning day and night, and forever casting two long black shadows. Lower down, between the bitts, was a locker, or sailors' pantry, kept in abominable disorder, and sometimes requiring a vigorous cleaning and fumigation.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, {{the city}} decided to {{experiment}} with placing raised safety disks {{on the edges of}} the platforms, in order to increase passenger safety. Compared to the painted orange-and-yellow stripes on the platforms, the disks, which were painted yellow and spaced one <b>foot</b> <b>apart</b> from each other, were expected to last about five times as long. The northbound platform's disks were 4 in in diameter, and the southbound platform's were 3 in.|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} {{already said that}} a low wire fence had been placed at a {{distance}} of a hundred yards beyond the inner enclosure, to protect the young trees from the animals.
