5|$|There are {{two types}} of eruptions in terms of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and tephra. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring of lava without significant <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, volcanic glass, and scoria of red tone. Thirteen craters, all {{located in the}} fissure, contributed to this episode. All are most likely phreatic. During the eruption, pyroclastic flows convened with tephra, as suggested by deposits. Lahar also streamed from the summit.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption,</b> {{extrusion}} of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E
50|$|The almost {{circular}} caldera is a {{nested structure}} {{formed as a}} result of three separate caldera collapse episodes, each associated with <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions.</b> These caldera collapse episodes occurred following <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> that formed the Risco, Bretanha and Santa Barbara pyroclastic fields.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of extensive tuff and pyroclastic deposits {{suggests that a}} number of large <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred during or before the eruptions of basaltic lavas. The {{presence of}} silicic volcanic rocks such as rhyolite is also indicative of <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
5|$|Gareloi has an {{extensive}} eruptive history, {{dating back to}} at least 1760. At least 12 eruptions have occurred at the summit, accompanied by lava and pyroclastic flows. Typically they have been characterized by a central vent eruption followed by an <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption,</b> and sometimes a phreatic explosion. All have been of Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 1 to 3. Such eruptions have occurred in 1790, 1791, 1792, 1873, 1922, April 1929, 1950, January 17, 1952, August 7, 1980, January 15, 1982, September 4, 1987, and August 17, 1989. Uncertain eruptions occurred in 1760, 1828, 1927, and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Lake Toba is {{the site}} of a massive supervolcanic {{eruption}} estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event. It is the largest known <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> on Earth in the last 25 million years. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, it had global consequences for human populations; it killed most humans living at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east Africa and India, which affects the genetic make up of the human worldwide population to the present.|$|E
50|$|Holocene {{activity}} has included <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{ranging in size}} from moderate to plinian. The last major eruption took place about 3600 years ago. Lava dome growth has produced block-and-ash flows that traveled primarily to the NE and SE. Minor <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> have been recorded from Tolima in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|R
30|$|On July 24, 2012, DOY (day of year) 206 at 19 : 15 {{local time}} (JST), a large typical vulcanian eruptive event {{occurred}} at Minamidake crater. In 2012, 883 <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred at Showa crater, whereas only 2 <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred at Minamidake crater. Although there have clearly been fewer eruptions at Minamidake crater, their scale has been {{larger than the}} typical <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> from Showa crater. In fact, the July 24, 2012 event {{was one of the}} largest eruptive events of the Sakurajima volcano {{in the past few years}} and therefore, it was selected as the target event for this study.|$|R

5|$|Tephrochronology and {{radiocarbon}} dating indicate that Glacier Peak eruptions occurred in 1700 AD ± 100 years, 1300 AD ± 300 years, 900 AD ± 50 years, 200 AD ± 50 years, 850 BC, 3150 BC, and in 3550 BC. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) {{for three of}} these was 2 to 4, small compared to the 5 of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. They were characterized mainly by a central vent eruption, followed by an <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption.</b> These eruptions varied in outcome; some produced lahars, some pyroclastic flows, and others lava domes.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E
5000|$|Santorini has erupted many times, {{with varying}} degrees of explosivity. There have been at least twelve large <b>explosive</b> <b>{{eruption}}s,</b> of which at least four were caldera-forming. [...] The most famous eruption is the Minoan eruption, detailed below. Eruptive products range from basalt all the way to rhyolite, and the rhyolitic products are associated with the most <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Mt. Etna {{is renowned}} {{for being the}} most active and highest volcano in Europe. Lava flows and weak <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{characterize}} its activity, but intermediate to large <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> have punctuated its eruptive history. Marine and lacustrine distal records are excellent archives for the recognition of past large explosive activity at Mt. Etna, as testified by the recognition of distal tephra layers of Pleistocene to Holocene age. These data are, to date, neither organised nor correlated to the proximal stratigraphic and chronological records. Here, we propose the reorganisation and correlation of the distal tephra layers from Mt. Etna in order to decipher the timings and frequency of its major <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions...</b>|$|R
40|$|On September 4, 2007, after 25 {{years of}} effusive natrocarbonatite eruptions, the eruptive {{activity}} of Oldoinyo Lengai (OL), N Tanzania, changed abruptly to episodic <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions.</b> This transition {{was preceded by}} a voluminous lava eruption in March 2006, a year of quiescence, resumption of natrocarbonatite eruptions in June 2007, and a volcano-tectonic earthquake swarm in July 2007. Despite the lack of ground-based monitoring, the evolution in OL eruption dynamics is documented based on the available field observations, ASTER and MODIS satellite images, and almost-daily photos provided by local pilots. Satellite data enabled identification of a phase of voluminous lava effusion in the 2 weeks prior to the onset of <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions.</b> After the onset, the activity varied from 100 m high ash jets to 2 - 15 km high violent, steady or unsteady, eruption columns dispersing ash to 100 km distance. The <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> built up a similar to 400 m wide, similar to 75 m high intra-crater pyroclastic cone. Time series data for eruption column height show distinct peaks {{at the end of}} September 2007 and February 2008, the latter being associated with the first pyroclastic flows to be documented at OL. Chemical analyses of the erupted products, presented in a companion paper (Keller et al. 2010), show that the 2007 - 2008 <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> are associated with an undersaturated carbonated silicate melt. This new phase of <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> provides constraints on the factors causing the transition from natrocarbonatite effusive <b>eruptions</b> to <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> of carbonated nephelinite magma, observed repetitively in the last 100 years at OL...|$|R
5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption,</b> then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption,</b> then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{nature of}} past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera {{suggests that this}} volcano poses a significant long-distance threat to communities across Canada. A large <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> can produce large amounts of ash that could significantly affect communities across Canada. Ash columns could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano which would make this a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield surrounding the volcano. Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows. This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other local water sources.|$|E

5|$|The undated air-fall pumice deposit exists {{across the}} southwestern {{part of the}} Big Raven Plateau called Sheep Track Pumice or Sheep Track member. Pumice is a light {{volcanic}} rock full of air spaces and commonly pale in colour, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, but can be green or black. The Sheep Track Pumice is mysterious because the vent of its origin is unknown, {{even though it is}} estimated from its state of preservation to be younger than 500 years. This pumice deposit emphasizes one of the significant volcanic hazards linked to the Mount Edziza volcanic complex – the likelihood of a violent <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption.</b> The volcano that produced the pumice might be covered by glacial ice. Collaborators at the University of British Columbia have started work on samples collected from deposits of Sheep Track Pumice.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E
5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E

40|$|The 2008 {{eruption}} of Chaitén Volcano was widely {{cited as the}} first activity at the volcano for over 9000 years. However, we have identified evidence from proximal pyroclastic deposits for three additional <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> of Chaitén within the past 5000 years. Chaitén has therefore produced at least five <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> in the Holocene, making it among the most active volcanoes, in terms of explosive output, {{in the southern part}} of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone. All of the five identified Holocene <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> produced homogeneous high-silica rhyolite, with near identical compositions. Based on our pyroclastic sequence, we suggest that the largest-volume Holocene {{eruption of}} Chaitén occurred at - 4. 95 ka, and we correlate this with the Mic 2 deposit, which was previously thought to originate from the nearby Michinmahuida Volcano...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea {{with a series of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and <b>explosive</b> <b>eruptions</b> of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of volcanic eruptions and associated activity: phreatic eruptions (steam-generated eruptions), <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> of high-silica lava (e.g., rhyolite), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., basalt), pyroclastic flows, lahars (debris flow) and carbon dioxide emission. All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, hot springs, fumaroles, mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity.|$|E
25|$|Because the “Scouler willow” at {{the summit}} of Cinder Cone was already mature in 1853, Diller {{concluded}} it was extremely unlikely that an eruption could have occurred there {{in the winter of}} 1850. He also noted that trees rooted in volcanic ash erupted from the cone were about 200 years old and that the oldest trees on related lava flows were about 150 years old. Diller believed he recognized two eruptive sequences, which each produced lava flows. However, he thought that only the older eruption was explosive, creating Cinder Cone and the ash deposits. In regard to the <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption,</b> he concluded that “Whatever may be the historical testimony as to the time of the eruption, the geologic evidence clearly demonstrates that it must have occurred long before the beginning of the present century” (before 1800). Diller therefore speculated that the <b>explosive</b> <b>eruption</b> had occurred between about 1675 and 1700 and that the younger, quiet eruption was “certainly” sometime before 1840.|$|E
