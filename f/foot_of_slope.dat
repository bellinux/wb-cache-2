40|$|The {{extent of}} the outer limit of the {{continental}} shelf of a coastal state is greatly dependent on {{the placement of the}} foot of the continental slope. Both the Gardiner line (based on sediment thickness) and the distance formulae line (<b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> + 60 M), which are possible extensions to the continental shelf, are based on an interpretation of the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> points. UNCLOS Article 76 defines the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> as: “ 4. (b) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the foot of the continental slope shall be determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base. ” This article discusses the maximum change of gradient of bathymetric profiles and why this point may not be as unique in a real case, as it may seem from a theoretical point of view. Different algorithms for determining the maximum change of gradient will be presented. Also we will see how the choice of algorithm and the algorithm’s parameter settings affects the placement of the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> point. The article describes some common pitfalls one should avoid when computing the change of gradient in a real case, along with a new approach for calculating the maximum change of gradient. This algorithm gives good and stable results in most cases. The Geocap software package with its bathymetric profile analysis tool is used to examine the different algorithms. 1...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{has nearly}} {{completed}} the surveying phase of its Continental Shelf Project. Some surveys {{have been designed}} to fill gaps in the 2, 500 m isobath and bathymetric <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> positions. Others {{have been designed to}} collect data to demonstrate natural prolongation and to determine sediment thickness beyond the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope.</b> The seafloor around New Zealand is characterised by ridges and plateaus that reflect the complex tectonic history of the region. Rifting and subduction processes have resulted in continental fragmentation and continental growth by the accretion of terranes and the formation of island arcs. These complexities raise questions about how Article 76 should be interpreted in order to identify the edge of the Continental Shelf. The geological and morphological connection of two large continental fragments, Gilbert Seamount and Bollons Seamount, with the New Zealand landmass are discussed. Consideration of their relationship with the landmass highlights a number of issues concerning natural prolongation. The geological and morphological connection of the Hikurangi Plateau and the Resolution Ridge System with the New Zealand landmass are discussed. Their relationship with the New Zealand landmass shows that a subduction trench/plate boundary does not necessarily define <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> positions...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the outer limit of the continental shelf beyond 200 Nautical Miles requires firstly {{the determination of the}} regions mentioned as base of the slope for then to determine the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> (FOS) in order to apply the criteria in accordance to United Nations Convention on The Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> (FOS) is defined on UNCLOS, Article 76 th “ [...] . in absence of the evidence to the contrary, the foot of the slope shall be determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient in its base. ” Based on {{the last part of the}} statement it is reasonable to interpret that first it is necessary to identify the base of slope to find out later the point of the maximum change in the gradient in this region (base of slope). Considering the first sentence of the statement it is comprehensible that there is another way to determine the FOS which is not based on gradient changing. The current study presents some discussions regarding the identification of the base of slope in passive margins using the Southern Brazilian Continental Margin as an example. In order to attend this approach the data carried out by the Brazilian Continental Shelf Project were employed. Furthermore this study considers an overview exercise of the determination of the FOS by means of “evidence to the contrary ” with the use of public domain data basically. The results of this study imply that is more advantage to the Coastal State in using of gradient in this region instead of invoke prove to th...|$|E

40|$|The {{coastal region}} of Maputaland-Mozambique is characterised by an {{extensive}} low-lying coastal plain, which rises to {{a height of}} more than 100 metres in some places and attain a width of 2 kilometres. Maputaland in Mozambique extends from Ponta de Ouro, which borders South Africa to Cabo Santa Maria stretching for a distance over 100 kilometres, and encloses several swamps and coastal lakes such as Satine, Piti, Munde and Nela running in north south direction. The main objective {{of this study was}} to access the different categories of dune morphology in Maputaland-Mozambique by using aerial photographs, satellite images and field checking. Two major distinct dune systems on the Maputaland coastal morphology were mapped: (1) vegetated dunes form a coastal dune system, which face the sea, and characterised by undulating surfaces and continuous irregular crests running in north-south direction. Transfer dunes move along the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> of the vegetated dunes towards north and northeast.

30|$|The PDC {{seems to}} come out just after the {{eruption}} column collapsed (Fig.  2 B, C). Distribution of the major flow of the PDC also supports the column-collapse origin of the PDC. Though one may point out that PDC has branches directing to at least NW, SW, and E, such a branching takes place at a certain part of the slope (~[*] 200  m asl in the western flank and[*]~[*] 400  m in the eastern flank), where deep and steep valley angle of which exceeds 30 º appears. We thus would like {{to conclude that the}} PDC was originally flow down in all direction but branched controlled by the topography. The fallout materials collapsed from the eruption column could not stay on the steep slope and slipped down to produce PDC toward E, NW and SW directions. Lack of the deposit in Zone b (Fig.  4 B) supports the idea that the materials slipped down from the steep slope owing to the instability of the deposit. Acceleration of PDC on the steep slope may diminish deposition of the particles on the slope (e.g., Martin and Nokes 1988) and may also promote the formation of prominent flows at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope.</b>|$|E
40|$|Grapevine is a {{perennial}} crop whose growth and productivity {{can be affected}} by many pedoclimatic and agrotechnological factors. Currently, land terracing is a common field organization for new vineyard plantations, reducing slope on the cultivated land, and for {{the introduction of new}} areas for agricultural production. One of these pedoclimatic factors is the position of vines on vineyard slope. The aim of this paper was to assess the effect of the grapevine position on the field slope on growth expressed by pruning weight and on cold hardiness of bud and cane grapevine. The research used relatively simple methods and it was conducted in a commercial hillside vineyard from Samburesti viticultural region in Romania. The grapevines used for this study were represented by three red grape varieties: Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot, and Vitis vinifera L. cv. Feteasca Neagra. Annual growth of grapevine and cane maturation in the previous growing season was influenced by slope positions. The lowest pruning weight was recorder in Merlot planted {{at the top of the}} vineyard slope. For all grapevine cultivars we found statistically significant differences between vines cultivated on the top of slope and vines cultivated on the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope...</b>|$|E

40|$|Giant {{landslides}} over 1 × 107 m 3 for {{a single}} landslide volume are dominant geological disasters {{in the area of}} the Three Gorges reservoir, whose developing mechanism include two aspects, i. e., forming mechanism and triggering mechanism. Based on investigations in real-time field, forming mechanism for giant landslides in the area are revealed using Geomorphology and are classified as chain avalanching of perilous rock, debris flow deposits, and earthquake, appearing about 70 %, 10 % and 20 % respectively. Meanwhile, lots of loose deposits sitting on slopes are initial conditions to form landslides, and almost all landslides are composed of loose deposits, while that by earthquake belongs to rock landslides. According to many geotechnical observations and physical simulations in laboratory, three triggering mechanisms for landslides are promulgated obviously, i. e, (1) softening landslide earth by precipitation; (2) unreasonable mankind actions such as loading on top and cutting at <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> and engineering refuse dump, etc.; (3) variation between 145 m a. s. l. and 175 m a. s. l. of water level of the reservoir, and alternatively soaking of earth at the variation region. In the three mechanisms, the first and the second extensively appear in engineering construction sits such as urban, roads and highways, and villages for immigrants above 175 m a. s. l., while the third makes a role frequently in landslides locating in the variation region. Giant landslides locating in the variation region are soaked by water of the reservoir totally or partially, so strength of earth composed of the landslide attenuate by a big margin, additionally, greater seepage forces exist in these landslides during descending of water level of the reservoir, coupling both of the aspects speed up forming and rupture processes of landslides sitting on the slope. All results above reveal initially developing mechanism of giant landslides in the area...|$|E
