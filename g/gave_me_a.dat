5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
25|$|When {{the secret}} Treaty was published, it <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> further zest {{to fight for}} Paraguay, as I believed, from {{the terms of the}} Protocol, that she must either fight or be absorbed.|$|E
25|$|The {{discipline}} and evolutions {{of a modern}} battalion <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and {{the captain of the}} Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.|$|E
5000|$|In a long {{interview}} {{conducted by}} Alan Lomax in 1938, Jelly Roll Morton recalled {{that the first}} blues he had heard, probably around 1900, was played by a singer and prostitute, Mamie Desdunes, in Garden District, New Orleans. Morton sang the blues: [...] "Can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ You can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ Just to feed that hungry man of mine". The interview was released as The Complete Library of Congress Recordings.|$|R

25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of {{confidence}} to know that if I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{after being}} dismissed, the future Hall of Fame manager defended {{himself in a}} press conference, arguing that the club was badly organised, for having players that never played {{together}} before. Anderson added that to improve the team, the owners should strengthen the relationship between players and coaches, not make any difference. Also, they <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> group of local veteran players almost gone from baseball, and rookies with little professional experience, he explained earnestly.|$|E
25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

25|$|All I {{suggested}} {{within that}} process was get a good, {{wide selection of}} kids. Let’s get {{a wide selection of}} personalities and temperaments and certainly skill level. Don’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> whole bunch of boy scouts who are going to knock it dead out there and don’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> whole bunch of absolute beginners who are setup for failure. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> wide variety, let’s have regular, normal kids and don’t profile beyond that.|$|R

25|$|On the 14 May 2017 {{broadcast}} of Bakushoku Joō Onna-tachi no Gekokujō Senki, Yuko Shoji {{of the third}} generation as a special invited player went on to compete and the new and old Joō confrontation was realised, {{as a result of}} the realisation of the new and old Queen confrontation, Moeno achieved her third consecutive title of Joō. Actually, Tsunku, who was in the final fighting field in Hawaii, came to cheer and talked about the encouragement of Tsunku who was a teacher who <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance as an idol and a big eating talent became more encouraged and later talked on her blog to have.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E
500|$|... "If {{somebody}} slaps {{you in the}} face, you're {{going to}} slap him back, it's not like he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> touch to jar the puck. What's {{he going to do}} next, break my arm? I'm sorry it was Nilsson and not Anderson I hit, but I just reacted. At the time, it seemed the right thing to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Tom, {{shaking his}} head; [...] "no one will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> penny for playing; but Farmer Bowser might <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> penny to stop playing, if I {{went to his}} house. He did last week, you know." ...|$|R

500|$|In his autobiography, Ganesan {{recalled}} {{that during the}} Afro-Asian film festival, [...] "I was called on stage and I went up a diminutive, five foot nothing, looking boyish with my build, whereas they had expected {{me to be a}} colossus, on seeing [...] Kattabomman, at least seven or eight feet tall! Irrespective of this they <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> standing ovation for five minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Anna Torv {{called the}} episode's hotel scene her {{favorite}} of the show so far, explaining [...] "I loved shooting that {{because it was the}} first time that Olivia really inched her way into that dynamic of Peter and Walter. She’s been kind of on the outside, and wrangling them constantly, but this <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> glimpse into realizing everything is a little bit entwined, and building more of that emotional conflict between them. I really loved shooting that." ...|$|E
500|$|T-Pain, who co-wrote [...] "Hot as Ice", was in {{the studio}} with Spears in February 2007, and stated that one of the three songs they {{recorded}} was finished in only an hour. He said that he [...] "thought {{she was going to be}} sitting on the couch eating Doritos or nachos or something [...] but she came in, shook my hand, <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hug and went right in the booth. She got in there and put it down." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{contains}} a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with [...] "karaoke renditions" [...] of whale calls. Gish later noted that [...] " [...] <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> tape of whale songs, which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer." [...] Carter was inspired to write the scene after a friend gave him a Paul Winter album that incorporated whale sounds into the music. Carter later explained that, [...] "I {{just thought it was}} kind of much like [...] character to appreciate that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following the attacks, many memorials and vigils were held around the world, and photographs {{of the dead and}} missing were posted around Ground Zero. A witness described being unable to [...] "get away from faces of innocent victims who were killed. Their pictures are everywhere, on phone booths, street lights, walls of subway stations. Everything reminded me of a huge funeral, people quiet and sad, but also very nice. Before, New York <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cold feeling; now people were reaching out to help each other." ...|$|E
500|$|She [...] <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> call, {{and she was}} like, [...] "I {{would love}} to do a duet with you. Come by the studio." [...] When I got there, she played the song for me. I didn't expect to record the song, but when I heard it, I said, [...] "Man, there's no way I'm going to leave this studio without my voice being on that record." [...] Everything just {{happened}} so fast. I didn't expect for it to be a single or a video. Everything was just great.|$|E

500|$|In his youth, {{influenced}} by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was {{a supporter of}} the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that I was brought up into it, and I admit that it <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> pain." [...] When asked of his roots, he said [...] "I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!" ...|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Day 1947, Kolish and his {{son were}} struck by a drunk driver while driving to spend the holiday with Sarria and his family. Both were killed. The coroner {{determined}} that Jonathan died first, meaning that Paul's brother inherited everything. The brother ignored Paul's wishes regarding Sarria. [...] "I would have gotten one of the houses", Sarria claimed, [...] "but he only <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little money and one ring. He claimed that was all Paul wanted me to have. He was so evil. He said afterwards, 'If you expect anything else, you're {{not going to get}} it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In March it was {{announced}} that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer use him as a trainer, although this was put into different context by Carlsen himself {{in an interview with the}} German magazine Der Spiegel, in which he stated that they would remain in contact and he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov. In 2011, Carlsen said: [...] "Thanks to [...] I began to understand a whole class of positions better.... Kasparov <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great deal of practical help."
