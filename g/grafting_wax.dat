40|$|Hemicelluloses such as xylans and galactoglucomannans {{are thought}} to serve as {{crosslinking}} and bridging macromolecules in nature, and have been considered for applications ranging from prebiotics to films, coatings, and hydrogels. Accessory hemicellulases {{can be used to}} control and improve the functional performance this major biomass fraction through fine-tuning branching group chemistry. Accordingly, the overall objective of this thesis was to discover and engineer accessory hemicellulases {{that could be used to}} control the branching substituents present in different plant polysaccharides. Herein, the utility of characterized enzymes was demonstrated through chemo-enzymatic synthesis of xylan-based cellulose coatings. First, a new acetyl xylan esterase (AnAcXE) from carbohydrate esterase (CE) family CE 1 was biochemically characterized and then fused to a family 3 carbohydrate binding domain (CtCBM 3) in an effort to increase catalytic performance on high molecular weight and insoluble substrates, including cellulose acetate and acetylated xylan. Whereas increased binding and increased catalytic performance was observed using cellulose acetate, activity on oligomeric substrates was not affected. AnAcXE was then compared in its action on galactoglucomann and glucuronoxylan with enzymes from families CE 6 and CE 16. This direct comparative analysis uncovered differences in substrate preference and regio-selectivity of corresponding enzymes. Finally, a new α-arabinofuranosidase from GH 62 (SthAbf 62 A) was comprehensively characterized. Its action on polymeric wheat and rye arabinoxylans containing high degree of substitution was significantly higher than on arabinan and 4 -nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranose. These analyses indicated that SthAbf 62 A was a good candidate for selective removal of arabinofuranose linked through α-(1 -> 2) and α-(1 -> 3) to singly substituted xylopyranose in arabinoxylans. Accordingly, SthAbf 62 A along with the commercial AXHd 3 (specific for (1 -> 3) on di-substituted xylopyranose) were used to modify wheat arabinoxylan (<b>WAX)</b> prior to <b>grafting</b> with glycidyl methacrylate. Action of SthAbf 62 A lowered the water solubility of WAX, which was correlated to higher grafting efficiency. Although the binding efficiency of <b>grafted</b> <b>WAX</b> to regenerated cellulose did not change compared to ungrafted WAX, treatment with SthAbf 62 A or AXHd 3 prior to grafting increased the viscoelastic properties of the stably adsorbed layer, indicating potential usefulness of these enzymes in production of new xylan-based coatings...|$|R
40|$|Wax {{determines the}} {{compatibility}} of tackifier and polymer in hot melt adhesives. Although {{the influence of}} the addition of microcrystalline and Fischer-Tropsch waxes on the properties of ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) hot melts has been studied, the addition of polypropylene wax has not been considered yet. In this study, different polypropylene waxes (polypropylene wax – PP, – maleic anhydride <b>grafted</b> polypropylene <b>wax</b> – PPMA – copolymer of polypropylene and 10. 9 [*]wt. % polyethylene wax – PP-E) were added to EVA hot melts and they were characterized by Brookfield viscosity, softening point measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, plate–plate rheology, tack, and single-lap shear adhesion. The viscosities of EVA hot melts containing polypropylene waxes were relatively high, the highest viscosity corresponded to the formulation containing PP-E wax which also showed pseudoplasticity. The change in viscoelastic properties (i. e., from dominantly viscous to dominantly elastic) was produced at lower temperature in EVA hot melt containing PP-E wax, this adhesive exhibited the highest tack. On the other hand, the addition of acrylic PPMA wax increased the adhesion of EVA hot melt but lower tack was obtained. Finally, the PP-E wax was more compatible with EVA copolymer than the other polypropylene waxes...|$|R
50|$|Slide {{the wedge}} into the cleft {{so that it}} is {{at the edge of the}} stock and the centre of the wedge faces are against the cambium layer between the bark and the wood. It is {{preferable}} if a second scion is inserted in a similar way into the other side of the cleft. This helps to seal off the cleft. Tape around the top of the stock to hold the scion/s in place and cover with <b>grafting</b> <b>wax</b> or sealing compound. This stops the cambium layers from drying out and also prevents the ingress of water into the cleft.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports a}} {{reactive}} extrusion process leading to {{very high levels}} of anhydride grafting (2. 5 - 3 wt %) along polypropylene backbone without recovering <b>grafted</b> PP <b>waxes</b> at the die exit. Such high graftings are attainable without excessive degradation of the PP chain by using a brominated. reagent. Simultaneously, this brominated reagent allows the tuning of the grafted PP crystallinity via epimerization of the PP backbone. Indeed, the synthesis of a mainly isotactic/atactic stereoblock polymer containing high levels of grafted succinic anhydride moieties is demonstrated by NMR and melting enthalpies recorded by DSC are definitely observed depressed and broadened. Grafting levels of around 3 wt % have been achieved and ascertained by both chemical titration and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, FTIR spectroscopy reveals an unusual observation: for the first time, only one single pair of symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretching bands are observed on those grafted PP, while, in other processes of anhydride grafting, those symmetric and asymmetric bands were both split {{in at least two}} bands. This suggests, for the here reported process, the absence of interacting grafted anhydride rings, i. e., absence of closely grafted anhydride moieties and absence of poly(maleic anhydride). All those observations support that this "bromine route" brings a really new grafting process for PP. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Waxes {{have many}} {{potential}} uses but large-scale application is hampered by their virtual insolubility. By <b>grafting</b> the <b>wax</b> with a polyethylene glycol segment {{to form an}} alcohol ethoxylate, the solubility of the wax in commercial solvents is significantly increased. Alcohol ethoxylates are produced by the polymerisation addition of ethylene oxide onto an oxidised wax. Current methods of alcohol ethoxylate production from alcohols lead to wide ethylene oxide addition distribution and large quantities of residual alcohol. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a method for narrowing the ethylene oxide distribution and to reduce the residual alcohol content. It is proposed to concentrate the alcohol ethoxylate in a post-production separation process using supercritical fluid extraction. The system is modelled to contain three pseudo-components: an alkane, an alcohol and an alcohol ethoxylate. Propane is selected as the supercritical solvent of choice due to the large solubility difference between the alkane and polyethylene glycol. Lower molecular weight alkane phase equilibrium data with propane is abundant but extrapolation to higher molecular weights requires further investigation as it may be complicated by molecular folding. Molecular folding occurs in crystalline polyethylene and high molecular weight normal alkanes but information regarding molecular folding in solution is inconclusive. A model is proposed for molecular folding of normal alkanes in supercritical solution. A high molecular weight alkane mixture is synthesised and phase equilibrium measurement with propane are conducted. A lower molecular weight alkane mixture is used to prove the application of the principle of congruency to high-pressure phase equilibria. In the high wax mass fraction region the measurements are between the no-folding and once-folded relationship, indicating the possibility of partial molecular folding. In the mixture critical and low wax mass fraction region the measurements are similar to the non-folding relationship. Molecular folding in solution is thus dependent on the solution concentration. No phase equilibria measurements exist for propane with either high molecular weight alcohols or alcohol ethoxylates. Measurements of propane with an alcohol mixture show total solubility below 140 barA for temperatures up to 408 K. Measurements of propane with an alcohol ethoxylate at temperatures between 378 and 408 K shows that for an alcohol ethoxylate mass fraction between 0. 025 and 0. 5 pressures greater than 275 barA are required for solubilisation. When comparing the solubility of the three pseudo-components, the alkane is the most soluble followed by the alcohol. The alcohol ethoxylate is the least soluble. A counter-current supercritical extraction process is proposed for the concentration of the alcohol ethoxylate. Pilot plant tests were conducted and the proposed set-up shows good separation. An estimate of the energy requirements shows that heating and cooling constitute the majority of the energy required but with the use of heat integration it can be reduced by approximately 33 %. This work thus shows that the proposed process is both technically and economically viable. Although this work has provided a method for concentrating the alcohol ethoxylate, the process has not been optimised yet and future work includes the fine-tuning of this process...|$|R
