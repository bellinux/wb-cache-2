25|$|After {{the death}} of Gavin Cato, members of the black {{community}} believed that the decision to remove Lifsh from the scene first was racially motivated. They also maintained that this was one example of a perceived system of preferential treatment afforded to Jews in Crown Heights.

Furthermore, many members {{of the black community}} were concerned about the expansion of Jews moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> believing the latter were buying all of the property.|$|E

However the curfew remained in effect in Sadr City into April and the ceasefire only lasted until April 6, when US forces, for the first time, started a push into Sadr City, trying to hold the ground gained in an attempt to get the militia mortar teams further away from the Green Zone.

500|$|Cutter, a {{crossing}} guard, {{hides the}} shotgun in a dumpster, {{calling the police}} to report finding it. The police officer who takes his statement later recognizes him on seeing the video. Black has deduced the killer's motives—he is trying to undermine society's notion of safety. Black and Bletcher organize a stakeout at another open house, identifying Cutter when he arrives; however, Cutter escapes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Black realizes that he has hidden in a nearby house, where he and Bletcher find the occupants tied up. Cutter ambushes Black, knocking him down, but before Cutter can escape, the family's dog lunges at him, sending him falling over a mezzanine to his death. [...] Bletcher later tells Black that Cutter's aunt and uncle were tortured to death {{in front of him}} when he was a child, which led him to recreate the torment for other families.|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was always}} {{intended}} to be the show's promiscuous seductress. In an interview with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune, Jacobs said: [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, {{we were looking for}} a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." [...] Author June L. May of Monsters and Critics said, [...] "In season two of Knots Landing, a catalyst moves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> in the form of Sid’s sister, the drop dead gorgeous Abby Cunningham. [...] Whether Abby is directly involved, or simply in the neighborhood, she has a detrimental affect on the harmony of couples." [...] Almost immediately, Abby sank her claws into Richard Avery (John Pleshette), one of the neighborhood husbands. Though the affair was brief, it set the stage for what was to come.|$|E

2500|$|The {{completion}} of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, the Brooklyn end of which was near Brooklyn Heights' eastern boundary, began {{the process of making}} the neighborhood more accessible from places such as Manhattan. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s Lexington Avenue subway line, which reached Brooklyn Heights in 1908, was an even more powerful catalyst in the neighborhood's development. The resulting ease of transportation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and the perceived loss of the specialness and [...] "quality" [...] began to drive out the merchants and patricians who lived there; in time their mansions were divided to become apartment houses and boarding houses. [...] Artists began to move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> as well as writers, and a number of large hotels [...] the St. George (1885), the Margaret (1889), the Bossert (1909), Leverich Towers (1928), and the Pierrepont (1928), among others [...] were constructed. [...] By the beginning of the Depression, most of the middle class had left the area. Boarding houses had become rooming houses, and the neighborhood began to have the appearance of a slum.|$|E
2500|$|Until the mid-1960s, {{the area}} was simply the {{northern}} part of the Lower East Side, with a similar culture of immigrant, working class life. In the 1950s, the migration of Beatniks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> later attracted hippies, musicians and artists well into the 1960s. The area was dubbed the [...] "East Village", to dissociate it from the image of slums evoked by the Lower East Side. According to The New York Times, a 1964 guide called Earl Wilson's New York wrote that [...] "artists, poets and promoters of coffeehouses from Greenwich Village are trying to remelt the neighborhood under the high-sounding name of 'East Village.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, also in that year, the {{construction}} glut and {{a delay in}} the building of the subway led to a fall in real estate prices which attracted immigrant Eastern Europe Jews and Italians to Harlem in accelerating numbers. There had been a Jewish community of 12 in Harlem in 1869 that grew to a peak of almost 200,000 in about 1915. Presaging their resistance to the arrival of blacks, existing landowners tried to stop Jews from moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> At least one rental sign declared [...] "Keine Juden und Keine Hunde" [...] (No Jews and no dogs). Italians began to arrive in Harlem only a few years after the Jews did. By 1900 there were 150,000 Italians in Harlem. Both groups moved particularly into East Harlem.|$|E

2500|$|Storm surge {{flood waters}} {{appear to have}} poured into the Lower Ninth Ward from at least three sources.

[...] A large barge, the ING 4727 (owned by the Ingram Barge Company), was swept by flood waters <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> through the breach near Claiborne Avenue, leveling homes beneath it.

[...] Police lines pushed the rioting east from Downtown along 14th Street and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> where rioters continued rioting on Jackson Street and Madison Street. [...] After helicopter-mounted television cameras broadcast images of rioters smashing the windows at a McDonald's restaurant at 14th and Jackson, the rioting briefly wound down after Mayor Ron Dellums and other Oakland leaders {{came out to the}} scene to plead with the crowd for calm.
