5000|$|The name [...] "Table Plus" [...] was {{selected}} to be sufficiently similar to [...] "Round Table" [...] but yet distinctive. Since its members are drawn from Ex-Tablers, {{it has a very}} similar feel. In general, it is supportive to its <b>feeder</b> <b>table</b> and will assist in many ways when called upon to do so.|$|E
40|$|Vineyards in New Zealand suffer bird {{damage caused}} by several avian species, {{including}} blackbirds and silvereyes. The introduced European Blackbird takes whole grapes which reduces yield. The self-introduced Australasian Silvereye pecks on grapes, leaving them on the vine to be further attacked by fungi and bacteria, and the subsequent off-odours can cause grapes to be refused by the winery or to suffer a price-reduction. Bird control methods remain primitive and largely ineffective during the long ripening period of wine grapes. An ecologically sound method to manage and reduce bird pressure requires deeper understanding of why some birds eat grapes, especially since grapes are not particularly nutritious. This work investigated {{the extent to which}} blackbirds and silvereyes are attracted by various compounds in ripening grapes. Since in natural grapes these compounds develop and change simultaneously, I developed an artificial grape in which a single parameter could be investigated. Artificial grapes (and sometimes nectar) were presented on a bird <b>feeder</b> <b>table</b> and the responses of birds to hexose sugars, the aromas 2 - 3 -isobutylmethoxypyrazine and geraniol, tartaric and malic acids, grape tannins, and purple and green colour were recorded on timelapse video and analysed...|$|E
50|$|A birdfeeder, bird <b>feeder,</b> bird <b>table,</b> or tray <b>feeder</b> are devices placed {{outdoors}} {{to supply}} bird food to birds (bird feeding). The {{success of a}} bird feeder in attracting birds depends upon its placement {{and the kinds of}} foods offered, as different species have different preferences.|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} indicates that drought stress promotes outbreaks of plant-eating (phytophagous) fungi and insects. Observations and experiments show that colonization success and prevalence of such fungi as root and stalk rots, stem cankers, and sometimes wilts and foliar diseases are much higher on water-stressed plants than on normal plants (Schoeneweiss 1986). The evidence associating insects and drought is more circumstantial, consisting largely of observations that outbreaks around the world of such insects as bark beetles and leaf <b>feeders</b> (see <b>Table</b> 1) are typically preceded by unusually warm, dry weather. There is also a consistent, positive correlation between insect outbreaks and dry, nutrient-poor sites (Mattson and Haack 1987) ...|$|R
50|$|The first proper Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) phase (Phase 1A) {{opened in}} May 2011. It {{includes}} a dedicated West Coast busway {{from the city}} centre through Milnerton to Table View, along which an express bus service operates. Connecting to this trunk route is a route in the City Bowl connecting Gardens, the Civic Centre bus station and the Waterfront, as well as three <b>feeder</b> services around <b>Table</b> View, Bloubergstrand and Parklands.|$|R
5000|$|The Echo Label, who {{released}} [...] "Buck Rogers", folded as {{a record}} label in 2008, leading to Feeder {{to search for}} a new deal. Although there were deals on the <b>table,</b> <b>Feeder</b> decided to create their own label Big Teeth Music in 2010, releasing two albums on the label before signing with Cooking Vinyl in 2016. In 2011, Matt Sime briefly retired from the music business only to work with the band again soon after.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} design {{approach}} for material recovery systems, which, through balancing a combina tion of manual and mechanical sorting techniques, {{is able to}} automatically sort up to 75 % of incoming mate rial and process to market specifications while also achieving a percentage of residue less than 5 %. The system is designed utilizing a two-stream ap proach of processing paper and commingled containers separately to maximize material recovery utilizing engi neering expertise which integrates state-of-the-art tech nology to separate and process recyclable material. The technologies applied include the customized use of various material handling conveyors, electromag nets, eddy current separators, air classifiers, vibratory screens and <b>feeders,</b> mechanical sorting <b>tables,</b> crush ers, densifiers, balers, trommel screens, and dust collec tion equipment...|$|R
40|$|This paper deals {{about the}} quality {{improvement}} in Raw Mill – 2. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of production and greater quality of cement, <b>table</b> <b>feeder</b> is replaced with weigh belt feeder. The weight belt feeder helps to weigh the amount of raw material composition and to maintain the constant TPH which is feed to the raw mill. This load cell transfer electrical signals to the electronic unit which is proportional to the load pressure exerted by the raw material. The replacement of existing coin burner with multi channel burner result in increased clinker quality. It is observed that the flame geometry is improved with new burner. Also there is enhanced nodulization and improved strength. Hence a thorough investigation was done on the problems relating to raw mill – 2 and quality improvement is carried out. This dissertation work reports the successful completion and implementation of the same...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an original integrated solution of montage robotization of assemblies {{of small and}} medium complexity. The robotic station (the robotized cell) proposed contains a joint industrial robot equipped with an anthropomorphic gripper with five fingers, two <b>feeders,</b> a montage <b>table</b> and a storage terminal. CAD modelling of the whole system and functional simulation are performed, which certifies the validity of its correct operation. The gripper used is anthropomorphic with five fingers and five degrees of freedom with a relatively simple structure but high functionality. The gripper, adapted by a popular variant is realized as prototype at low cost, through rapid prototyping, and tested. The gripper control is possible through the advanced method of human hand gestures capture with a Motion Leap device and their transmission through a virtual interface to the real gripper. In perspective, it is considered mounting the gripper in an improved variant, on a real robot and testing {{the operation of the}} proposed montage scenario...|$|R
50|$|Further work {{carried out}} between 1912 and 1916 {{under the name}} Richmond Amalgamated saw the {{production}} of 883 tons of ore yielding 3,696 ounces of gold. This {{appears to have been}} the last major production period. The present battery was erected in 1913, with the assistance of a Queensland Government loan under the Mining Machinery Advances Act of 1906. The stamps and shed came from the Highland Mary mine in Croydon and the mill engine from the yard of the local foundry, Stuart and McKenzies. The year 1913 is inscribed on the concrete footings. The battery also crushed for the public, including nearby tin mines, for which it installed Wilfley concentrating tables. By 1915 the mine's engine house featured a forge and a portable engine driving the winding engine, which was used to bail water by tank as well as raise ore. The mill shed housed a 5 stamp battery with a self <b>feeder,</b> engine, amalgamating <b>table,</b> berdan pan, two Wilfley tables, and a pump bringing in water from a dam at the rear. The boiler for the pump and engine was large and situated beside the mill shed. The mill in that year gained some notoriety when on 2 November, Albert Chambers was caught up in the drive belt for the Wilfley table and killed.|$|R
