5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems <b>emptier.</b> This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|The Mansion District {{took off}} in the 1850s. The city's economy was booming due to the canal, the railroads and the {{industrialization}} taking place. The new workers, many of them Irish immigrants, coming to the city needed houses, and the Pastures had mostly been built out. Developers therefore looked to the <b>emptier</b> lands to the west. Orr developed houses on Madison, Myrtle and Park as well as Grand Street. He was joined by Charles and Lewis Seymour, stonemasons who built the row at 44–50 Grand and possibly several others. Lewis Seymour's slightly unusual frame house still stands at 14 Wilbur Street.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Syzygy" [...] an A, describing the episode as [...] "another uproarious send-up, {{this time of}} teen venom, B-movie paranoia, and our agents' painfully restrained rapport", with praise to the villains and the discussion on why Mulder always drives, considered [...] "one of Mulder's and Scully's funniest exchanges". Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave a B-, describing it as [...] "an entertaining hour that never rises {{to the level of}} those other episodes" [...] like [...] "Humbug" [...] and [...] "War of the Coprophages". VanDerWerff argued that [...] "Syzygy" [...] was an attempt by Carter to try and emulate the writing style of Darin Morgan's scripts, without success; he noted [...] "the laughs here are <b>emptier</b> than they were the week before in 'Coprophages'"—and adding that [...] "every time you think the episode has {{figured out a way to}} plant its foot firmly in comedic territory, there's a horribly judged moment of 'drama,' like Mulder's final monologue." [...] Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Margi and Terri among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, describing [...] "Syzygy" [...] as a [...] "hilarious send-up of Heathers".|$|E
500|$|Before resigning, Rutherford's {{government}} had called a Royal Commission into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not {{reported by the}} time that Sifton took office. [...] Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened. [...] Conservative leader Edward Michener attacked the government's speech from the throne for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. [...] In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question. [...] Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of [...] "pioneer" [...] railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's <b>emptier</b> areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. [...] Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A be built. [...] Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a [...] "responsible company". [...] These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.|$|E

Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 12th {{on his own}} year-end list. He later wrote that its major flaw was its pompous {{declaration}} of greatness, typified by elements such as the [...] "wall-of-sound, white-soul-at-the-opera-house" [...] aesthetic and an [...] "unresolved quest narrative". Nonetheless, he maintained the record was important for how [...] "its class-conscious songcraft provided a relief from the <b>emptier</b> pretensions of late-hippie arena-rock."

2500|$|It {{would have}} been {{impossible}} to have planted the bomb in the Régence any later than 14:00 because it was always full of customers after that time. [...] The timing was also determined by the original intention that the attack should coincide with another, carried out by the Lehi, on government offices at the David Brothers Building. However, that attack, codenamed [...] "Operation Your Slave and Redeemer", was canceled at the last moment. [...] The Irgun said details of the plan were aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. [...] Irgun reports allegedly included explicit precautions so that the whole area would be evacuated. [...] This led to recriminations between the Haganah and Irgun later. The Haganah said that they had specified that the attack should take place later in the day, when the offices {{would have been}} <b>emptier</b> of people.|$|E
2500|$|Idlewild {{eventually}} {{returned to}} Edinburgh in 1999 to begin writing new songs, and contacted engineer Bob Weston, from Chicago, who recorded six songs {{with them in}} London. These songs held a more aggressive, <b>emptier</b> sound than those previously, and the band were pleased with the results; however, they remained unsure of their direction. During the summer, Idlewild were invited {{to play at the}} opening of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, a momentous day for Scottish history. Scotland is where the band would remain for a while, letting the surrounding environment influence their songwriting and letting the songs represent the band as they were. Hitting a stride, the band returned to the studio with producer Dave Eringa and recorded [...] "Little Discourage" [...] and [...] "Roseability" [...] in their first session. Very happy with the results, the band continued to record what would become their second full-length album, 100 Broken Windows. The song [...] "Little Discourage" [...] was released in September and brought Idlewild a larger fan-base and much more radio play. Hope Is Important was released in America, and to support it, the band performed a small number of tour dates on the East Coast. The remainder of the year was spent mixing the new album in Glasgow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of <b>empty</b> holes on blasting vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are <b>empty</b> holes between monitoring point and blast hole is less than that without <b>empty</b> holes. The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of <b>empty</b> hole, the diameter of <b>empty</b> hole, the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole and the rows of <b>empty</b> hole, are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of <b>empty</b> hole has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect on blasting vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of <b>empty</b> hole and the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of <b>empty</b> hole can enhance the damping effect on blasting vibration as well. The results in the present study may provide a reference for the application of <b>empty</b> hole to reduce the blasting vibration in practical engineering...|$|R

2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Robert Christgau said {{three of the}} album's [...] "side-long" [...] compositions [...] "wind down prematurely" [...] but [...] "for the most part this is uncommonly beautiful stuff, and it gets better". He singled out [...] "Lonely Fire" [...] as a highlight, writing that [...] "after meandering at the beginning [...] develops into lyrical mood music reminiscent in spirit and fundamental intent of Sketches of Spain". AllMusic editor Thomas Jurek complimented [...] "some outstanding playing and composing here", but criticized [...] "the numerous lineups and uneven flow of the tracks", writing that [...] "Despite the presence of classic tracks like Joe Zawinul's 'Great Expectations', Big Fun feels like the compendium of sources it is". The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) wrote that the album [...] "defies easy categorization, although its dark, moody tracks boast a strong undercurrent of Indian classical rhythms {{in addition to the}} expected swathes of rock and funk". However, Alternative Press called the album [...] "essential....colorful and exotic" [...] and wrote that it represents [...] "the high water mark of his experiments in the fusion of rock, funk, electronica and jazz". The Penguin Guide to Jazz described it as [...] "an entertaining simulation of a top-drawer R band, just about pushed into the jazz zone", with the key elements of Davis's [...] "electronic" [...] sound. Stylus Magazine's Edwin C. Faust commented that [...] "a world without this music would be a considerably <b>emptier</b> place" [...] and cited it as Davis's [...] "greatest achievement" [...] with regard to an album's [...] "overall effect".
