50|$|Share repurchases are an {{alternative}} to dividends. When a company repurchases its own shares, it reduces the number of shares held by the public. The reduction of the float, or publicly traded shares, means that even if profits remain the same, the <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> <b>increase.</b> Repurchasing shares when a company's share price is undervalued benefits non-selling shareholders (frequently insiders) and extracts value from shareholders who sell. There is strong evidence that companies are able to profitably repurchase shares when the company is widely held by retail investors who are unsophisticated (e.g., small investors) {{and more likely to}} sell their shares to the company when those shares are undervalued. By contrast, when the company is held primarily by insiders and institutional investors, who are more sophisticated, it is harder for companies to profitably repurchase shares. Companies can also more readily repurchase shares at a profit when the stock is liquidly traded and the companies' activity is less likely to move the share price.|$|E

Hypothesis testing was done using the student‟s t-test at 95 % confidence level to find whether there is significant under performance of IPOs in the long run.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{itself with}} executive share option plans that have <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> targets and examines whether {{the existence of}} such vesting criteria results in opportunistic behaviour by managers or represents efficient contracting. Accounting choices by management are studied to see whether <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> targets in various executive remuneration components are associated with (1) the disclosure of alternative <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> (2) <b>earnings</b> management defined as abnormal working capital accruals and (3) earnings management defined as meeting or beating analysts' forecasts. To begin with, the current study tests for an association between the disclosure of alternative <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> figures and <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> performance criteria in executive share options. Following Healy (1985) it is argued that situations might exist where executives are aware they will not meet the target or will overshoot the target giving rise to incentives to manage earnings downwards. There are also situations where executives expect to miss the target but have incentives (and scope) to manage earnings upwards. The study then proceeds to measure earnings management using a modified Jones (1991) model. A proxy for target growth in <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> is developed. The third and final section of the current study considers meeting or beating analysts' forecasts as the earnings management metric. Prior research provides evidence that meeting or beating analysts' forecasts is rewarded by the stock market and as the payout from executive share options is linked to share price, executives have incentives to meet or beat analysts' forecasts. Regression analysis, in the form of either logit or ordinary least squares is employed in all three sections of this study. The results suggest that earnings management is associated with <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> vesting targets in executive share option plans. Moreover, the findings as a whole suggest that the introduction of <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> targets as a vesting criterion in executive share options resulted in opportunistic behaviour by management. This thesis adopts an agency theory framework and contributes to the literature on corporate governance and executive remuneration by identifying a specific contractual setting where management is especially sensitive to reported earnings numbers. This particular setting is novel. Additionally, the research design facilitated the testing of whether or not executive share options with an <b>earnings</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> growth target result in opportunistic behaviour on the part of managers or represent efficient contracting.
