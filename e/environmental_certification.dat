50|$|Many {{companies}} {{believe that}} the implementation of <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> programmes can lead to an improved company image and generate competitive advantage. This is usually achieved {{through the use of}} ecolabels which can be used on the company’s products, allowing the product to stand out as being produced in an environmentally sound way.The ecolabels associated with <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> inform consumers that the product in question has been verified by a third party auditor as originating from an environmentally well managed company. Therefore, the certificate gives an indication of good practice and provides the company a better image. This approach allows consumers to steer their purchasing behaviour in a more environmentally sound direction. This also means that if environmental marketing strategies such as <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> are to work there must be consumers willing to purchase the resulting green products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>certification</b> is {{most likely}} to benefit {{companies}} that already have an environmental management system, even if the environmental variable is not effectively integrated into the overall process of strategic planning, and firms that are introducing and/or modifying it, or have to develop it in order to respond to the expected evolution of the external context. It may help them to organise or reorganise a well structured environmental system which will enable them to establish and access the effectiveness of existing operating procedures, achieve conformance with them and demonstrate conformance to external actors. Therefore, <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> may help these firms to reduce expenses and efforts and develop autonomously an environmental management system which will help them to improve their green image. Certification can also be used by actors in a commodity network to validate their activities. Therefore, the ethical environmental values linked to <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> can be tracked at all stages along the commodity network from the producer to the retailer.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – As the {{awareness}} of environmental preservation and of sustainable development have become increasingly pronounced among various stakeholders, such as governments and communities, many businesses, in response, commence to introduce environmental-friendly measures and/or implement an environmental management system (EMS) in their daily operations. Even a service-oriented industry such as property management is no exception. To showcase their commitment to this cause, property management companies tend to obtain different <b>environmental</b> <b>certifications.</b> This study aims to investigate the effect of green property management, through <b>environmental</b> <b>certifications,</b> on property price. Design/methodology/approach – The hedonic price model is {{used to determine the}} impacts of different <b>environmental</b> <b>certifications</b> on prices of selected residential properties in Hong Kong. Three districts from different parts of Hong Kong, including 16 private residential developments, are covered in this study. Findings – The results show that ISO 14001 certification itself is not statistically significant in explaining property price. It is only when a property management company has obtained other local environmental management awards/certificates that varying levels of (positive) property price premiums are found. Nonetheless, the authors also find that controlling for other housing attributes, obtaining as many <b>environmental</b> <b>certifications</b> as possible does not necessarily result in the highest property price premium. Research limitations/implicationsNonetheless, the data sample has its limitations, such as its relatively small size and the unavailability of housing attribute(s) such as orientations. Practical implications – For the implications, the value of environmental management awards/certificates, {{from the perspective of the}} end-users of property management services, is based on the scopes of these environmental certifications; the promotional effort on the part of organizations behind these awards/certificates; the disclosure of information about the EMS itself and the assessment criteria; and the public’s perceptions as to the companies’ rationale behind such certifications. Originality/value – The study has provided some insights regarding the effect of various management standard certifications in property management, from the perspective of the end-users of the service (i. e. homeowners and potential homebuyers). This serves as a reference for developers, property managers, buyers and users alike. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are also}} ethical motivations {{for a company}} to improve its {{environmental}} performance and move towards achieving sustainable development. [...] All <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> schemes attempt to provide organisations with an effective environmental management system to help them to achieve environmental and economic goals The current high levels of consumption and economic growth often leads to the degradation of land and pollution of the natural environment. The aim of the move towards sustainable development is to ensure the availability of natural resources for future generations. Within <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> the life cycle approach is often adopted, where {{the life cycle of}} the product from its production to its disposal are followed to ensure that it is produced, used and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally sound way.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> {{is that it}} is used as in {{instrument}} to allow actors to make important improvements to the way the environment is managed and in achieving sustainable development. They are usually used as an indicator of the environmental commitment of the organisation thus allowing the organisations involved to have the advantages attributed to environmental proactivity such as gaining a competitive advantage or environmental productivity. Therefore, the <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> generally satisfies the ethical and competitive expectations that lead the company to initiate the certification process. The general scope of the certification process can be looked at {{by the size of the}} area that is influences, either directly or through demonstration or spill-over effects. For example, the FSC since it was established in 1993 has overseen the certification of forests in sixty countries, totalling nearly 50 million ha, and equivalent to perhaps 1.5 percent of the world’s total forest area2, thus making it a large and inclusive certification process with a wide scope. The benefit of <b>environmental</b> <b>certification</b> for consumers is that they can purchase products with the knowledge of the company’s environmental standards and procedures therefore giving the general public the option to consume in an ethical way. As a result of the ethical production, consumers may be willing to pay an additional price as a way of promoting and sustaining ethical production.|$|E
