5|$|Gamal Abdel Nasser {{wrote in}} his memoirs that already by May 25, the Egyptian forces were spread so thin {{that they had no}} mobile {{reserves}} to assault a Jewish force, and considered it strange that they would be ordered to allocate a major contingent to fight <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> area. Following-up his victory in the Battle of Yad Mordechai on May 23–24, al-Mwawi pushed north along the coast, bypassing the relatively well-defended Israeli village of Nitzanim. His column was reinforced by sea near Majdal, where he sent part of his force to the Majdal–Hebron road, hoping it would be able to link with another column, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Aziz, south of Jerusalem. Reduced to about 2,500 men, al-Mwawi resumed his march northwards. Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib was put in charge of the column by al-Mwawi, because the original commander was on vacation in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was sidelined with a groin injury at the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, and did not make his first start until 17 September in a 3–0 victory against Dartford, in which he scored one goal and set up another. This victory provided the springboard for Luton to embark on a 27-game unbeaten run in the league, in which Lawless was heavily involved, scoring five further times and contributing 10 assists. After playing in 32 games and scoring six goals, including many games <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> position as a left midfielder, he missed the final part of the season due to injury. On 15 April 2014, with three games to spare, Luton won the Conference Premier title and were promoted to League Two; this was Lawless' first title and promotion as a player.|$|E

5|$|Comminges {{had played}} youth {{football}} {{in his native}} Guadeloupe for local side Rapid Club Petit-Canal before moving to France in 1997. After a successful spell on trial, he joined the youth academy at Amiens SC {{at the age of}} 15, breaking into the first-team in 2002. Although naturally right-footed, Comminges' first experience in the Amiens first-team came as a left sided player as manager Denis Troch was forced to utilise him <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> position following an injury crisis at the club. During the 2002–03 season, he made 14 league appearances as Amiens finished in a mid-table position, despite only being on an amateur contract at the club. He left the club in May 2003, and joined Stade Reims of Championnat National, the third division of the French football league system, on a free transfer. In his first season with the club, he helped the side earn promotion to Ligue 2, with Reims finishing the season as champions. During his four years with the club, Comminges made 74 league appearances, with Reims establishing themselves in the second tier of French football.|$|E

He appeared in all three games in the 2007 FIFA U20 World Cup, although he was played <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> role as a centre-back. In March 2008, Haber made three Olympic qualification appearances in Canada's unsuccessful campaign to reach the 2008 Men's Olympic Football Tournament in Beijing. He {{was a member of}} Canada's U20 squad that did not qualify for the 2009 FIFA U20 World Cup in Egypt, finishing third in their group. As a result, Canada did not qualify for the Championship round. In March 2012, Haber was once again part of the U23 squad that would attempt to qualify for the Summer Olympics later that year. Canada qualified from the group stage, finishing in second place with five points, qualifying {{at the expense of the}} USA U23 side after securing a surprise 2–0 victory over them. Haber played in two out of the three group matches. They lost in the semi-final stage to the eventual gold medal side, going down 3–1 to their Mexican counterparts, with Haber scoring Canada's solitary goal to briefly restore parity in the match.|$|E
5|$|Irvine {{regained his}} place in the Burnley team {{at the start of the}} 1967–68 campaign, and scored in the first two league matches of the season. However, he was dropped from the {{starting}} eleven after four games. On 7 October 1967, in the 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest, he became the first ever Burnley player to score after coming on as a substitute, after replacing Martin Dobson. Irvine made six consecutive starts throughout October and November 1967, before again being dropped following the 2–0 home win against Newcastle United. After this, he played less often and scored his final goal for the club on 5 December 1967 in the 1–2 defeat to Arsenal in the fifth round of the League Cup. Just over two months later, on 24 February 1968, Irvine made his last appearance for Burnley when he played <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> inside-right position in the 0–1 loss away at Nottingham Forest. In the same month, he formally requested to be placed on the transfer list after becoming increasingly unhappy at Burnley. The request was granted by Potts, who set a price of £60,000 for Irvine. Altogether, he had scored 97 goals in a total of 148 first-team matches for Burnley during his eight years with the club.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{attained}} a first ever win against Durham City on 3 February 1923, {{and this was}} followed by a 4–0 win over the same side. The win saw Sid Hoad and Bob Hutchinson each net their first of the campaign, and striker Eddleston increase his tally for the season to 19. A goal by Black was not enough to prevent Nelson's winning streak come to an end on 17 February with a 1–3 defeat away at Wigan Borough. Nelson made up for the loss the following week, exacting a 1–0 win over Wigan, with new signing Dick Crawshaw scoring on his Nelson debut. At the beginning of March, Nelson achieved back-to-back victories against Chesterfield, the second a 4–0 win which saw a second goal in three games for Crawshaw and two goals from utility man Black, who was playing <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> centre-forward role. Nelson took only one point from the next two matches against Crewe Alexandra. The team failed to score in both games, the only time in the season they did so in successive matches. Entering the Easter period, Eddleston's 20th league goal of the campaign earned Nelson a 1–1 draw with Grimsby Town at Seedhill on 31 March.|$|E

5|$|Waddington first {{played for}} Yorkshire after the First World War, {{when the team}} had been {{weakened}} by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the County Championship that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920–21 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared {{in two of the}} five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.|$|E

This project focuses on core theoretical issues in speech comprehension such as on how episodic memories - such as hearing someone speak <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> dialect - influence the speech perception system, or how is prior knowledge about one's language (phonotactic probabilities, lexical knowledge, frequent versus infrequent word combinations) used during perception.|$|E

Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis, however, some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety.

25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that tells you what the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E
25|$|During the 2005–06 season, Henry {{featured}} 33 {{times for}} the Hertfordshire club, as the club narrowly missed out on a play-off position. In the same season, he was made captain by Westley in the side's 2–0 win over Exeter City. The following season, Henry played a total of 45 games under new manager Mark Stimson, and despite losing his captaincy {{in the early part}} of the season to Luke Oliver, Henry continued playing well and consequently regained his role as team captain later that season. During this season, Henry started the campaign <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> central midfield role, but reverted to full-back following Stevenage's bad start to the season. In April 2007, Henry scored his first ever league goal for Stevenage, in a 2–1 home defeat against Kidderminster Harriers, hitting the ball on the half-volley from the edge of the area. In May 2007, Henry became the first ever player to lift a cup at the new Wembley Stadium; after Stevenage beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 in the FA Trophy Final. The 2007–08 witnessed Henry continue to hold down his place as a first–team regular under both Mark Stimson and Peter Taylor. However, in January of the same season, it was announced that Henry was put on the transfer–list after he was unable to agree terms on a new deal. Despite this, he continued to feature in the first-team until the end of the season. Following the re-appointment of manager Graham Westley, Henry signed a new-contract at Stevenage and again, featured regularly at right–back during the 2008–09 season. He was also a key part in the side's successful FA Trophy campaign in the same season, playing in all seven matches, including the 2–0 win against York City in the final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
