40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that assortative mating acts as a driver of {{speciation}} by countering hybridization between two populations of the same species (pre-zygotic isolation) or through mate choice among the hybrids (hybrid speciation). In both speciation types, assortative mating promotes speciation over a transient hybridization stage. We studied mate choice in a hybrid vertebrate complex, the allopolyploid fish Squalius alburnoides. This complex is composed by several genomotypes connected by an intricate reproductive dynamics. We developed a model that predicts the hybrid complex can persist when females exhibit particular mate choice patterns. Our model is able to reproduce the diversity of population dynamic outcomes found in nature, namely the dominance of the triploids and the dominance of the tetraploids, depending on female mate choice patterns and frequency of the parental species. <b>Experimental</b> <b>mate</b> choice trials showed that females exhibit the preferences predicted by the model. Thus, despite the known role of assortative mating in driving speciation, our findings suggest that certain mate choice patterns can instead hinder speciation and support the persistence of hybrids over time without speciation or extinction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different mating strategies among endogamic strains to create F 1 populations of mice, minimising the effect of inbreeding depression on somatic development and embryo yield. Females from the strains Swiss, CBA and C 57 Bl/ 6 were divided in nine <b>experimental</b> <b>mate</b> arrangements. The total numbers of pups born alive per dam and somatic development, estimated by weighing and measuring the crown-rump length, were recorded. Superovulation response was evaluated in outbreed females. Litter size differed among endogamic dams, irrespective of the sire. Somatic development results suggest heterosis and imprinting phenomena, once a differential parental effect was demonstrated. There was no difference in corpora lutea, ova or embryos recovered (P > 0. 05), but recovery and viability rates differ among F 1 groups (P < 0. 05). The association of dam prolificity with somatic development and superovulation response of the pups should be considered for experimental F 1 populations establishment. The use of outbreed animals, however, did not reduce response variability to hormone treatment...|$|R

40|$|Sex ratios {{are subject}} to strong frequency-dependent {{selection}} regulated by the mating system and the relative male versus female investment. In androdioecious plant populations, where males co-occur with hermaphrodites, the sex ratio depends on the rate of self-fertilization by hermaphrodites and on the relative pollen production of males versus hermaphrodites. Here, we report evolutionary changes in the sex ratio from <b>experimental</b> <b>mating</b> arrays of the androdioecious plant Mercurialis annua. We found that the progeny sex ratio depended strongly on density, with fewer males in the progeny of plants grown under low density.

40|$|Objective: In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the effects of spearmint (Mentha spicata Labiatae) on the reproductive system, fertility and number of offspring in adult male rats. Materials and Methods: Adult Wistar male rats in one control (C) and three experimental groups (I, II and III) received 0, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg spearmint extract orally for 45 days, respectively. Â Following this treatment, the animalsâ weights, and the standard weight of reproductive tissues, sperm count, sperm motility and serum testosterone concentration were measured, and reproductive tissues were examined histopathologically. To evaluate the effects of spearmint on fertility of male rats and growth of their offspring, male rats of the control and <b>experimental</b> groups <b>mated</b> with untreated female rats.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{discovery}} of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and its involvement in graft rejection, immune response and the genetic basis of disease associations {{lead to the}} birth of this new field of science called Immunogenetics. This field is important not only in basic biomedical research but also in clinical medicine. The growth of this field was further substantiated by the various International Histocompatibility Workshops. Solutions to idiopathic syndromes and autoimmune diseases come from the field of Immunology, Immunogenetics and Molecular biology. In studying the genetic basis of disease susceptibility in human beings, one has to have a different approach because predictive <b>experimental</b> <b>mating</b> cannot be achieved in humans as in animal models; moreover the generation time is longer. One approach is through a study of randomly selected patients and comparing their results with those of controls and the other is through a study of affected families (nuclear or extended) and looking for the mode of inheritance of the disease with relation to genetic markers. Nonetheless the sampling stratification, sample heterogeneity, disease heterogeneity, and age at onset, epidemiological conditions and other socio-biological factors limit these studies. Essentially attempts are to be made to control these parameters and achieve a meaningful conclusion. The current concepts of antigen presentation to immunocompetent cells indicate that antigen processing takes place in the acid environment of the endosomes of antigen presenting cells. Proteolytic degradation of the antigenic proteins results in peptides of different fragments, which are subsequently presented by MHC molecule...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe fur {{of common}} rabbits is {{constituted}} of 3 types of hair differing {{in length and}} diameter while that of rex animals is essentially made up of amazingly soft down-hair. Rex short hair coat phenotypes in rabbits were shown {{to be controlled by}} three distinct loci. We focused on the "r 1 " mutation which segregates at a simple autosomal-recessive locus in our rabbit strains. A positional candidate gene approach was used to identify the rex gene and the corresponding mutation. The gene was primo-localized within a 40 cM region on rabbit chromosome 14 by genome scanning families of 187 rabbits in an <b>experimental</b> <b>mating</b> scheme. Then, fine mapping refined the region to 0. 5 cM (Z = 78) by genotyping an additional 359 offspring for 94 microsatellites present or newly generated within the first defined interval. Comparative mapping pointed out a candidate gene in this 700 kb region, namely LIPH (Lipase Member H). In humans, several mutations in this major gene cause alopecia, hair loss phenotypes. The rabbit gene structure was established and a deletion of a single nucleotide was found in LIPH exon 9 of rex rabbits (1362 delA). This mutation results in a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon potentially shortening the protein by 19 amino acids. The association between this deletion and the rex phenotype was complete, as determined by its presence in our rabbit families and among a panel of 60 rex and its absence in all 60 non-rex rabbits. This strongly suggests that this deletion, in a homozygous state, is responsible for the rex phenotype in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|Semibalanus balanoides is a {{simultaneously}} hermaphroditic acorn barnacle that {{mates with}} its neighbors using a long, agile penis. Sex allocation theory (Charnov 1980, 1982) predicts that simultaneous hermaphrodites maximize total reproductive success by increasing allocation to the male role towards an asymptote at 50 % as competition (between functional males) for eggs increases. Acorn barnacles present an ideal system testing this theory, because they are sessile and therefore limited to mates within reach of their penises. Offspring are easily collected, as they are brooded for several weeks after mating. I created experimental groups of barnacles with small or large numbers of potential mates. I allowed these to grow and develop egg-masses and testes specific to their mating group size. Before the brief period of mating activity (in the fall), I reciprocally transplanted individual barnacles from large groups to small groups (and vice versa). At the same time, I retrieved un-mated barnacles from similarly sized groups to measure allocation to male and female function. After the mating activity had ceased, I collected all of the <b>experimental</b> <b>mating</b> groups and measured total reproductive output for the focal individuals. I calculated fitness gained as a female by counting the larvae in each focal individuals brood. I calculated fitness gained as a male by genotyping several highly variable microsatellite loci for a subset of each neighbors brooded larvae and comparing those to potential parents. This allows a comparison of total reproductive fitness of experimentally transplanted barnacles (mating in groups for which they have not strategically allocated energy to the sex roles) with un-transplanted control barnacles. This experiment provides a critical test of sex allocation theory and demonstrates the dynamics of mate competition for sessile, copulating simultaneous hermaphrodites...|$|E

40|$|Repetitive {{sequences}} often {{display a}} high level of homogeneity within species and can diverge rapidly from homologous copies found in other species. Neither this concerted evolution of repeated sequences nor the non-Mendelian processes of DNA turnover that spread these within a genome are controversial. What remains unclear is the significance of these genomic changes on the subsequent spread of variation within populations. In this thesis, the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1) was examined in the Anopheles punctulatus group to determine what generates intraindividual variation and to determine the significance of turnover in the divergence of An. farauti s. s. populations. Multiple length variants were detected within individuals by PCR and Southern hybridization. A high level of interspecific variation was found among 84 cloned isolates, yet several internal repeats are shared among these species. Much of the length variation is generated by a multicopy 52 Ì 7 -subrepeat, which was identified as a duplication of a conserved ITS 2 region. The variation present in an An. farauti s. s. colony indicated that restrictions to interchromosomal recombination are unlikely. Instead, it is the presence of multiple units of turnover that appear to {{play a key role in}} the maintenance of intraindividual variation. A potentially recombinant data set of 36 sequences from an <b>experimental</b> <b>mating</b> between two An. farauti s. s. genotypes was analysed by recombination detection methods. No significant evidence was found for recombination, which suggests that substitutions are more important in generating variation. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the ITS 1 using a data set of 187 sequences from 70 individuals showed that variation in this spacer is congruent with the geographic origin of the An. farauti s. s. samples. Remarkably, intraspecific concerted evolution occurs despite the level of intraindividual variation, while the interpopulation divergence demonstrates a high rate of spread of variation within populations. A quantitative analysis of intraindividual length variants in 14 of these populations was performed with 125 individuals using densitometry and Southern hybridization. Population-specific banding profiles were seen within individuals and the relative proportions of the different length variants within each population were homogeneous among a majority of the individuals. Two temporal samples from a colony also showed the relative abundance of these can change rapidly after just 150 generations. Thus ITS 1 variants are spread rapidly in populations with a low level of interindividual variation, which indicates that a high rate of turnover is a significant factor in generating the allopatric divergence of An. farauti s. s...|$|E
40|$|Most social animals form {{prolonged}} {{relationships with}} other individuals, whether as mating partners, parent-offspring bonds or associations with other kin. The processes that determine the strength and longevity of social relationships are often poorly understood. Many animals form monogamous breeding pairs, however, fundamental issues such as why they pair, how they choose partners and whether they mate exclusively with partners remain to be resolved. Many also live in extended family groups, but the advantages of staying or leaving family groups are complex. These issues are especially poorly understood for coral reef fishes, where social monogamy is common but appears to have evolved in species that provide either no parental care, or minimal care provided by the male. It has always been assumed that social groups in reef fish arise through strong site attachment {{and as a consequence}} of larval dispersal are not family or kin associations. In this thesis, I combined long-term behavioural observations, field experiments and new molecular tools to address these keys issues related to monogamy and genetic relatedness within social groups of a coral reef cardinalfish â Sphaeramia nematoptera (Apogonidae) in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. This species forms small, highly sedentary social groups, tends to mate in pairs within groups and is a paternal mouthbrooder. The following specific questions were addressed in the four data chapters: 1) What role does site attachment play in the choice of mates? i. e. do they primarily show allegiance to a site or a mate? 2) Are mating pairs assorted by size and which sex chooses mates?; 3) Does the social mating system reflect the genetic composition of offspring or do offspring arise from extrapair or sneak mating?; 4) Are social groups comprised of related individuals and what mechanisms might lead to kin association? In Chapter 2, I used long term observational data to show that monogamous pairs within social groups were highly site attached compared with unpaired individuals. Following natural losses of partners or <b>experimental</b> <b>mate</b> removals, individuals rapidly formed new partnerships within the same social group rather than moving to other groups. In addition, partners did not follow their mates when they were experimentally relocated to adjacent groups, instead re-pairing with individuals within the same social group. Together, these results indicate that group cohesion is maintained through strong site attachment, and individuals show greater allegiance to sites than to mates. Thus site fidelity plays a big role in influencing pairing and pair longevity in this species. There was strong size-assortment of males and females in pairs, with larger males pairing with larger females within social groups (Chapter 3). Size-assortative mating was not due to juvenile cardinalfish growing up together, as although individuals pair at a small size, they regularly change partners between spawning cycles until adulthood. Following natural losses, both males and females repaired with partners of more similar size than expected due to chance. Experimental removal of either males or females showed that both sexes actively choose partners, indicating that size-assortative mating was maintained by mutual mate choice. Although most mature males and females remain paired for at least one and often several breeding cycles, genetic analysis of offspring using 19 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed that both sexes exhibited extrapair mating and sneaking behaviour (Chapter 4). Multiple mothers were found in 11. 4...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of neural tube defects and axial skeletal malformations among infants born by mothers who had received Valproic acid [...] . The aim of the present study is, if administration of valproic acid can induce maternal hepatic Metallothionein (MT) synthesis and so secondary decrease of plasma Zn. In the present <b>experimental</b> study, <b>mated</b> rats were divided into four groups of 12 animals each [control, valproic acid (VPA), valproic acid + zinc (VPA+ Zn) and Zinc (Zn) groups]. The VPA group received 300 mg/kg valproic acid; daily. The control group received an equal volume of 0. 9 % NaCI. The VPA+ Zn group received 300 mg/kg VPA as well as 30 mg/kg zinc sulfate, and the Zn group received 30 mg/kg zinc sulfate, daily. These drugs were administered intraperitoneally from day 6 through day 15 of gestation. Dams were killed on GD 16 or 20. Blood was drawn to determine plasma zinc; furthermore, maternal liver Zn and MT were also determined. The zinc concentration in the plasma of rats treated with valproic acid was significantly lower than those of the other groups on GD 16 (p= 0. 004), but liver Zn (p= 0. 016) and MT (p= 0. 004) were significantly higher than those of the control group. On GD 20 the incidence of skeletal malformations and neural tube defects tended to be higher in VPA group than VPA+ Zn treated group and no anomalies were seen in the control group. The results from the present experiment support hypothesis that one of biochemical lesions causing the teratogenicity of VPA is a drug induced maternal plasma zinc deficiency secondary to Metallothionein induction in liver...|$|R
40|$|Before {{the onset}} of female fertility, we removed 12 early-settling male tree {{swallows}} (Tachycineta bicolor) from their nest-boxes and mates, and allowed replacement males which had been floaters to settle with the original female residents. We predicted that females which had their original <b>mate</b> choice altered (<b>experimentals)</b> {{would be more likely}} to obtain extra-pair fertilizations than females which remained paired with their original, early-settling mates (controls). The proportion of females obtaining extra-pair fertilizations, however, did not differ between controls and <b>experimentals,</b> indicating that <b>mating</b> tactics of female tree swallows were unaffected by mate replacement. However, differences between early-settling and replacement males did exist. Replacement males had shorter wing chords than early-settling males, suggesting that they were younger. Moreover, a significantly greater proportion of replacement males than early-settling males were unringed and thus new to the study site. Our results suggest that if females are choosing males for good genes, then early-settling males are not superior in genetic quality to the smaller replacement males which had originally been floaters...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} route of {{infection}} occurs orally, and occasionally through the respiratory tract from the nucleus of congenitally infected hatch <b>mates.</b> <b>Experimental</b> infection of adult chickens through the esophagus, nasal passages, or trachea caused the virus to spread throughout {{all areas of the}} enteric, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, and the hock and tendon joints. In an experiment, avian reovirus was recovered from mononuclear, plasma, and erythrocyte cell fractions of blood within 30 hours of infection in young chicks. After 3-5 days, the infection spread throughout the whole body. The main site of viral replication was observed in the enteric tract. A different study of early pathogenesis in chicks infected with virus one day after birth displayed that the bursa of Fabricius and the epithelial cells of the small intestines are the main sites of infection and portal of entry of the virus which quickly disseminates to other organs within a 24- to 48-hour window post infection. The tibiotarsal-tarsometatarsal (hock joint) was the site where virus replication caused the most severe damage and in some extreme cases, tendon rupture.|$|R
40|$|Valproic acid {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{antiepileptic}} drugs. There is an increased risk of neural tube defects and axial skeletal malformations among infants born to women who had received valproic acid. There is a hypothesis that one biochemical abnormality underlying the teratogenicity of valproic acid is a drug-induced reduction in maternal plasma zinc. In the present <b>experimental</b> study <b>mated</b> rats were divided into four groups of 8 animals each [control, valproic acid (VPA), valproic acid + zinc (VPA+ Zn) and zinc (Zn) groups]. The VPA group received 300 mg/kg valproic acid, daily. The control group received an equal volume of 0. 9 % NaCl. The VPA+ Zn group received 300 mg/kg VPA and 30 mg/kg zinc sulfate and the Zn group received 30 mg/kg zinc sulfate, daily. Valproic acid, NaCl, and Zn were administered intraperitonealy from day 6 through day 15 of gestation. On day 16, six rats of each group were authanized and the other rats were scarified on gestational day (GD) 20 to evaluate the skeletal system among the elder fetuses. Blood was drawn to determine plasma zinc. The data were analyzed by using analysis of variance (Kruskal -Wallis test). The zinc concentration in the plasma of rats treated with valproic acid was significantly lower than those of the other groups on 16 GD (P= 0. 004). Some anomalies such as hydrocephaly, spina bifida, hemivertebrate, and rib malformations were seen in VPA treated group. Low percentage of rib anomalies and spina bifida were observed in the VPA+ Zn treated group while no skeletal anomalies were seen in Zn and control groups. The results from the present experiment support the hypothesis that one of the biochemical abnormalities causing the teratogenicity of VPA is a drugâinduced maternal plasma zinc deficiency, and possibly, it may also result in reduction of embryonic Zn...|$|R

40|$|Competition {{among the}} sperm of rival males is an {{important}} evolutionary phenomenon in many organisms. Yet, despite extensive research on sperm competition in some vertebrate taxa, very little {{progress has been made}} on this topic in amphibians. Urodele amphibians (newts and salamanders) are of particular interest to theories of sperm competition because most urodele femalesâin contrast to other vertebrate femalesâcontrol the transfer of sperm from the male. Here we present a molecular study of sperm precedence and storage patterns in the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa). First, we used microsatellite markers to show that female newts typically use sperm from 1 â 3 males under natural and seminatural conditions. Second, we <b>mated</b> <b>experimental</b> females sequentially to two males and collected fertilized eggs in a temporal series. Patterns of paternity were consistent with first-male sperm precedence and complete mixing of sperm within the female. This simple pattern of sperm usage, best described as âtopping off,â is consistent with the expectation from sexual conflict theory that free female choice before insemination eliminates selective pressures for the evolution of complex patterns of paternity manipulation involving cryptic female choice...|$|R
40|$|Extra-pair copulations (EPCs) (copulations {{outside the}} pair bond) {{resulting}} in extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs) are widespread in birds. To increase reproductive success, males {{should not only}} seek EPCs, but also prevent their females from having EPFs. Male Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) follow their partner closely during the period when these females are most receptive (fertile period). The Seychelles warbler is the first species to offer explicit <b>experimental</b> evidence that <b>mate</b> guarding functions as paternity guarding: in territories where free-living males were induced to stop mate guarding during the pair female's fertile period, the rates of intrusions by other males and successful EPCs (male mounting female) {{were significantly higher than}} those observed in the control group {{and in the absence of}} mate guarding the frequency of successful EPCs increased significantly with local male density. Male warblers do not assure their paternity through frequent copulations to devalue any sperm from other males: males do not copulate with their partners immediately following a successful EPC obtained by their partners, the frequency of successful within-pair copulations does not increase with the frequency of successful EPCs and females initiate all successful copulations and are capable of resisting copulation attempts. ...|$|R
40|$|Extra-pair copulations (EPCs; copulations {{outside the}} pair bond) are {{widespread}} in birds and {{may result in}} extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs). To increase reproductive success, males should not only seek to gain EPFs, but also prevent their own females from gaining EPFs. Although males could {{reduce the number of}} EPCs by their mates, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} they reduce the number of EPFs; indeed several studies have found no association between EPCs and EPFs. Male Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) follow their partner closely during the period when the pair female is most receptive (fertile period). We show that males that guarded their mates more closely were less likely to have extra-pair young in their nest. This study on the Seychelles warbler is the first to provide explicit <b>experimental</b> evidence that <b>mate</b> guarding is effective in reducing EPFs. First, in territories where free-living males were induced to stop mate guarding during the pair femaleâs fertile period, extra-pair parentage was higher than in the control group. Second, in the experimental group, the probability of having an extra-pair nestling in the nest was positively associated with the number of days during the fertile period for which mate guarding was artificially stopped. Thus, male mate guarding was effective in reducing the risk of cuckoldry. ...|$|R
40|$|The egg-release, mating, courting and {{aggressive}} acts for the spawning {{behaviour as well}} as the survival rates after spawning at stages of eyed embryos, viable hatchlings, and larvae to dry food consumption for the mating success were studied in cultured silver bream Blicca bjoerkna Ã rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus hybrids at their first sexual maturity. Experiments were conducted in experimental environments simulating natural reproductive conditions of the parental species. Spawning behaviour was analysed over 1 day from 8. 00 to 18. 00 hours using a remote-controlled video. Mating success was assessed from eggs and hatched embryos collected on the spawning ground. The results showed that these hybrids exhibited all the reproductive behaviours of the parental species with significantly more courtship than mating. Each egg-release act was accompanied by mating behaviour, involving all the experimental males. A surprising aggressive behaviour was observed in one male which attacked all other <b>experimental</b> fish. Successful <b>mating</b> resulted in the presence of fertilized eggs, the production of hatched embryos in experiments, and the survival of larvae at the dry food consumption stage. However, the low viable hatchling rate observed could indicate a very low chance of survival for these hybrids in rivers in which the occurrence of post-F 1 individuals may be more possible by backcrossing.

40|$|Males may {{increase}} their Â¢tness through extra-pair copulations (copulations outside the pair bond) {{that result in}} extra-pair fertilizations, but also risk lost paternity when they leave their own mate unguarded. The Â¢tness costs of cuckoldry for Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) are considerable because warblers have a single-egg clutch and, given the short breeding season, no time for a successful replace-ment clutch. Neighbouring males are the primary threat to a maleâs genetic paternity. Males minimize their loss of paternity by guarding their mates {{to prevent them from}} having extra-pair copulations during their fertile period. Here, I provide experimental evidence that mate-guarding behaviour is energetically costly and that the expression of this trade-o Â¡ is adjusted to paternity risk (local male density). Free-living males that were induced to reduce mate guarding spent signiÂ¢cantly more time foraging and gained signiÂ¢cantly better body condition than control males. The larger the reduction in mate guarding, the more pronounced was the increase in foraging and body condition (accounting for food availability). An experimental increase in paternity risk resulted in an increase in mate-guarding intensity and a decrease in foraging and body condition, and vice versa. This is examined using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.
