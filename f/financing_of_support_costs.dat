40|$|This paper {{presents}} a data modelling and a semi-automatic data searching method to <b>support</b> <b>cost</b> estimation {{in the product}} development process, particularly for low volume, high complexity and long life products typified by defence products and systems. The paper covers a literature review {{in the area of}} cost estimation in product development, the data sets needed to perform cost estimation, the method of modelling the data and the techniques <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>cost</b> data searching. The proposed method will be used to <b>support</b> <b>cost</b> estimation <b>of</b> product development decisions for defence electronic products. To compare with the traditional approach, the method has demonstrated that by creating a centralised environment such as the databases and using a data-driven approach, the system is made more efficient by reducing the number of processes in carrying out cost estimation and thus this provides more information to make an informed concept design decision during the product development process based on the systems competence of instant cost estimation feedback...|$|R

40|$|Many large {{software}} {{systems are}} tightly integrated with their physical environments {{and must be}} adapted when their environment changes. Typically, software development methodologies do not place a great emphasis on modeling the system’s environment, and hence environmental changes may lead to significant and complicated changes in the soft-ware. In this paper we argue that (1) the modeling of the environment should {{be an integral part}} of the process, and (2) to support software evolution, wherever possible, the software should be automatically generated. We present a model-integrated development approach that is capable <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>cost</b> effective system evolution in accordance with changes in the system’s environment. The approach is supported by a “meta-architecture ” that provides a frame-work for building model-based systems. This framework has been successfully used in various projects. One of these projects, a site-production flow visualization system for a large manufacturing operation, is analyzed in detail. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess several {{pathways}} of a harmonised European policy framework for supporting renewable electricity (RES-E) in a 2030 horizon according to different criteria. The pathways combine two main dimensions: degrees of harmonisation and instruments and design elements. A quantitative model-based analysis with the Green-X model is provided. The results of the simulations show that there are small differences between the evaluated cases regarding effectiveness. All the policy pathways score similarly with respect to RES-E deployment, i. e., with different degrees of harmonisation and whether using a feed-in tariff, a feed-in premium, a quota system with banding or a quota without banding scheme. In contrast, the policy costs clearly differ across the pathways, but the differences can mostly be attributed to the instruments rather than to the degrees of harmonisation. This is also the case with other criteria (static and dynamic efficiency and the socioeconomic and environmental benefits in terms of CO 2 emissions and fossil fuels avoided). Both the degree of harmonisation and the choice of instrument influence the distribution <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> across countries. Finally, our findings suggest that keeping strengthened national support leads to similar results to other policy pathways...|$|R

40|$|The {{aircraft}} spares support activities involve several support units {{which are}} located in different places. For this reason, {{it is necessary to}} establish an information network <b>of</b> spares <b>support</b> to coordinate the activity <b>of</b> each <b>support</b> unit. This study focuses its research on creating an Agent collaborative work model <b>of</b> aircraft spares <b>support</b> based on CSCW environment to raise support level and reduce its costs. The author approaches and solves the problem first by designing three-level B/S structure mode for Agent after analyzing the design requirements of it based on CSCW environment and then by exploring the communication mode and collaborative work mechanism between Agent units and probing into the processes of cooperative work group, work flow and formation <b>of</b> <b>support</b> scheme. On the basis of the Agent collaborative work model, the author advances one collaborative control mathematical model under restriction <b>of</b> <b>support</b> level as well and conducts simulating test for the two models by relevant simulation software. The test result is that after collaborative work the support level rises from 93. 87 to 97. 01 % and the total cost per unit time for <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> falls from 903 RMB to 877 RMB. Thus, the optimization of Agent parameters for aircraft spares comes true and relevance <b>of</b> total <b>support</b> <b>cost</b> and <b>support</b> level is determined...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{functional}} product (FP) comprises of {{an integrated}} package <b>of</b> hardware and <b>support</b> services sold under a performance-based contract. A barrier {{to the adoption of}} FP is the lack of tools for obtaining predictions <b>of</b> availability and <b>support</b> <b>costs</b> during product development. A previous paper by the authors described a simulation-driven development strategy for designing FP that are optimised for functional availability and <b>support</b> <b>costs.</b> This iterative strategy involves representing the FP design in a modelling language; using a software code to automatically generate and analyse a simulation model from this representation to produce detailed performance predictions; and using these predictions as feedback to improve the design. The use of a modelling language facilitates the representation of the design details within the hardware and support system that influence availability and <b>support</b> <b>costs.</b> This includes the maintenance process design, maintenance strategy design and maintenance resource availability design. In this paper, an overview of a modelling language the authors have developed for this purpose is described...|$|R
