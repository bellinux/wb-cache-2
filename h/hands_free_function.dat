Annelies Labaere 1, Jan Vanderwegen 2, Frans Debruyne 1 1 Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium 2 Antwerp University Hospital, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Antwerp, Belgium Annelies. Labaere@uz. kuleuven. ac. be Objectives: The {{objective of this}} study was to make a qualitative comparison between tracheo-esophageal speech with manual stoma occlusion and <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> tracheo-esophageal speech with the Provox FreeHands device. Patients/Materials and Methods: Both Manual and handsfree tracheo-esophageal speech were compared in 13 patients who were regular users of Provox Freehands for at least four months. Evaluation of speech material consisted of objective analysis using the KayPentax CSL, perceptual ratings by a group of experienced listeners and patients own perceptual judgment. In addition, data concerning user-friendliness, additional values and inconveniences of the FreeHands device were gathered using questionnaires. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was used to evaluate the relation between voice related QOL and method of stoma occlusion. Therefore a control group of TE-speakers who did not use <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech, was selected. Results: Objective analysis revealed significant differences (p< 0. 05) for parameters fluency (i. e. the number of syllables produced on one intake of breath) and maximal phonation time, to the detriment of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech. There were no significant differences found for the dynamic characteristics Perceptual judgements of running speech were rated higher in the manual occlusion condition for most patients, but there were interrater differences. Subjective impressions showed that the majority of patients preferred <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech to manual stoma occlusion, noticably for voice quality, fatigability, attractivity and feelings of self-confidence. Major inconveniences of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech were a significantly decreased duration of sticker adhesion, the occurrence of disturbing noises and the need for continued effort. The VHI scores were significantly higher in the group of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speakers compared to the control group. Conclusions: This clinical study showed that in selected patients the Provox FreeHands shows important subjective benefits. Improvements however are necessary to make the device a useful rehabilitation device for a larger group of laryngectomized patients.

40|$|In Victoria, <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basins in food {{preparation}} areas were a regulatory requirement introduced under the 1984 Health (Eating House and Food Premises) Regulations. The food safety standards introduced in January 2001 replace existing state, territory {{and local government}} food hygiene regulations {{and the provision of}} a <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basin is no longer prescribed (Australia and New Zealand Food Authority 2001). The aim of the pilot study was to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the effectiveness of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basins and manual tap operated basins in reducing microbial flora on hands. Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection involved an Environmental Health Officer visiting the premises, conducting a survey and swabbing the food handler’s hands prior to and post washing. The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the wash hand basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, <b>Hands</b> <b>free</b> mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to wash hand basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of wash hand basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load. The pilot study has indicated that there is no difference between the use of either a manual or <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basin for a small group of food retailers. Consideration should be given to a range of factors which might have impacted on this study, including frequency of hand washing, types of foods handled, length of mechanical wash, and number of manual wash hand basins available for the study. Education regarding the need to maintain the temperature of the wash hand basin water between 22 - 40 °C should also be investigated among food retailers as well as strategies for the correct washing of hands...|$|R

40|$|When writing generic code, we {{are forced}} to {{differentiate}} between calling member <b>functions</b> and <b>free</b> functions: x. foo() and foo(x) are not the same thing. When using concepts to constrain generic code we will run into the same issue and will have to (arbitrarily) pick member <b>functions</b> or <b>free</b> <b>functions</b> to describe the concept. This is undesirable and has led to the standard library introducing <b>free</b> <b>function</b> equivalents for member functions like begin, end and data. In all cases the <b>free</b> <b>function</b> invokes the member function where it is defined. There have been proposals [N 1585, N 4165, N 4174, N 4474] suggesting changes to C++’s function resolution rules to allow <b>free</b> <b>function</b> invocation syntax to invoke member functions and vice-versa. We are concerned both about the impact such changes may have on existing code (although this concern has been addressed in some of the more recent proposals) and also about the potential for code maintenance problems, were unconstrained uniform function calling to be adopted, when class interfaces are changed since any <b>free</b> <b>function</b> that could potentially be called using member function syntax might have been so used...|$|R
