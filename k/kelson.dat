This {{represented}} the third fight between them, with Pinto being victorious in their two previous encounters, {{both of which}} took place {{while they were still}} amateurs. The fight was televised by HBO from San Juan, Puerto Rico. During this card Cotto utilized a defensive stance with his hands in a high position instead of his usual aggressive orthodox stance. Over the course of the fight Cotto scored three knockdowns and won the World Boxing Organization Junior Welterweight Championship by knockout in the sixth round.|$|E

Their thirty <b>kelsons</b> hummed like thirty harp-strings, and looked as straight whilst they left their parallel traces on the sea. But there proved too many hunters for the game. The fleet broke up, and went their separate ways out of sight, leaving my own ship and two trim gentlemen of London.

25|$|A {{defensive}} stop on USC's next {{possession and}} a 15-yard punt return gave Texas the ball near midfield, and the Longhorns capitalized when Young found Thomas for 14yards on one play, and Taylor running 30yards {{for a touchdown}} on another. Pino's extra point extended the Longhorns' lead to 16–7. On the next drive, Leinart threw a pass intended for Reggie Bush that was grabbed by Texas linebacker/safety Drew <b>Kelson.</b> But <b>Kelson</b> landed on his back after catching the pass and the ball popped out. The pass was ruled incomplete; equipment issues again prevented a review. USC's drive continued with a Leinart pass to wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett, the top Trojan receiver of the day with ten catches totaling 121yards, a quarterback keeper of 14yards, and a Bush 12-yard run took the Trojans to the Texas 13-yard line with 40seconds {{to play in the}} half. But two sacks by defensive tackle Frank Okam pushed USC back 13yards and forced the Trojans to use two timeouts. Consequently, Danelo's 43-yard field goal allowed USC three points, and the half ended with Texas still ahead, 16–10.|$|E

It was classified as a geographic race or subspecies of the montane vole by Hall and <b>Kelson</b> in 1951, but laboratory analyses, including electrophoresis and karyotype evaluations, subsequently confirmed that they are two separate species.

[...] Aldred is deposed on April 15, 1110, and Wencit ascends to the throne as King Wenzel II Furstán. [...] While Wencit moves to secure his position on the throne, Charissa spends the next decade plotting her revenge against King Brion Haldane, and eventually succeeds in murdering him in 1120. [...] However, her attempt to claim the throne of Gwynedd is thwarted when she is slain by Brion's son and heir, King <b>Kelson</b> Haldane on November 15, 1120.

2500|$|Texas center Dallas Griffin was {{determined}} to be out for the season due to injuring his anterior cruciate ligament against Oklahoma State the week before the Texas Tech game. [...] Backup defensive end Eddie Jones and reserve safety Drew <b>Kelson</b> also missed the game, while linebackers Jared Norton and Sergio Kindle were listed as [...] "questionable" [...] and [...] "probable", respectively. The Austin American-Statesman reported, [...] "Defensively, Texas must hope that the injured are quick healers because it's a given that the Longhorns will need every available body against the Red Raiders. Texas Tech fields the most dynamic passing offense in the country, and the Red Raiders also stay on the field an average of 77.3 plays per game. Tech further frustrates a defense by often going for fourth downs. They've been successful on 14 of 23 fourth-down attempts this season.

60|$|Here, it must needs be said, that {{accidents}} {{like this}} have {{in more than}} one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be. In instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle. But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the <b>kelson.</b>|$|E

60|$|In {{less than}} a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon {{alongside}} of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In {{the excitement of the}} moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody-- except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen-- to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the <b>kelson.</b> So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.|$|E
6000|$|He drooped {{and fell}} away from {{himself for a}} moment; then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the {{starboard}} hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher {{the top of that}} delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the <b>kelson</b> is low? Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward delight-- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O Father!-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I die.

60|$|It is {{the same}} with both {{officers}} and men. If a Captain have a grudge against a Lieutenant, or a Lieutenant against a midshipman, how easy to torture him by official treatment, which shall not lay open the superior officer to legal rebuke. And if a midshipman bears a grudge against a sailor, how easy for him, by cunning practices, born of a boyish spite, to have him degraded at the gangway. Through all the endless ramifications of rank and station, in most men-of-war there runs a sinister vein of bitterness, not exceeded by the fireside hatreds {{in a family of}} stepsons ashore. It were sickening to detail all the paltry irritabilities, jealousies, and cabals, the spiteful detractions and animosities, that lurk far down, and cling to the very <b>kelson</b> of the ship. It is unmanning to think of. The immutable ceremonies and iron etiquette of a man-of-war; the spiked barriers separating the various grades of rank; the delegated absolutism of authority on all hands; the impossibility, {{on the part of the}} common seaman, of appeal from incidental abuses, and many more things that might be enumerated, all tend to beget in most armed ships a general social condition which is the precise reverse of what any Christian could desire. And though there are vessels, that in some measure furnish exceptions to this; and though, in other ships, the thing may be glazed over by a guarded, punctilious exterior, almost completely hiding the truth from casual visitors, while the worst facts touching the common sailor are systematically kept in the background, yet it is certain that what has here been said of the domestic interior of a man-of-war will, in a greater or less degree, apply to most vessels in the Navy. It is not that the officers are so malevolent, nor, altogether, that the man-of-war's-man is so vicious. Some of these evils are unavoidably generated through the operation of the Naval code; others are absolutely organic to a Navy establishment, and, like other organic evils, are incurable, except when they dissolve with the body they live in.|$|E

Mind, I am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs, for it did not, in even the slightest degree. He was a capacious container, {{but he did not}} hold enough for that.

Stalwart and portly; not a gray hair; broadbrimmed slouch hat; semi-sailor toggery of blue navy flannel--roomy and ample; a stately expanse of shirt-front and a liberal amount of black silk neck-cloth tied with a sailor knot; large chain and imposing seals impending from his fob; awe-inspiring feet, and [...] "a hand like the hand of Providence," [...] as his whaling brethren expressed it; wrist-bands and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow, out of respect for the warm weather, and exposing hairy arms, gaudy with red and blue anchors, ships, and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India ink.
