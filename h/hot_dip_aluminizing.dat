This heat treatment should produce the high hardness value of material surface {{in order to}} hold the friction load and left the soft and tough characteristic in it’s core for holding the bending load. The heat treatment which can produce those characteristic is called the surface treatment. One of the surface treatment {{that has been done}} on the gear is aluminizing. Aluminizing is not only increase the surface hardness, but also increases the defense corrosion of the metal surface. In this research, the aluminizing was done by the methods to pour a liquid alumunium on the lower cylinder carbon steel surface which have varied the roughness surface grinded with abrasive paper until grid 800, 1500 and 2000 until sticky. And it was continued by the temperature heating of 700 0 C with two hour holding time.

40|$|Zinc has {{traditionally}} been the metallic material most widely used to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion due to its ability to afford cathodic protection to steel in all types of natural atmospheres. In recent decades, aluminium and zinc/aluminium alloy coatings have been used instead of zinc in certain atmospheric applications. Although these coatings present some advantages over zinc, they {{are not able to}} cathodically protect steel substrates in all types of natural atmospheres. The present paper assesses the cathodic protection afforded by Al (flame spraying), Al/ 13 Si (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> 55 Al/Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn/ 15 Al (flame spraying), Zn/ 5 Al (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (discontinuous <b>hot</b> <b>dipping)</b> and Zn (electroplating).

40|$|Abstract. A <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>aluminizing</b> {{process to}} {{simulate}} the continuous galvanizing line (CGL) {{was carried out in}} three successive steps by a hot dip simulator: the pre-treatment for removing scales on the 200 × 250 mm 2 and 1 mm in thickness cold rolled steel sheet, the dipping in 660 °C Al-Si melt for 3 s and the cooling. In a pre-treatment, the steel specimen was partly coated by Au to confirm the mechanism of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were followed to observe the cross-section and the distribution of the elements. The specimen was analyzed in the boundary of the dipped-undipped part to see the formation mechanism of the aluminized steel. An intermetallic compound (IMC) is rapidly developed and grown in the steel-liquid interface. It has been usually reported that the IMC was formed by the dissolution of iron in the steel substrate toward the melt and the diffusion of aluminum in an opposite direction. The specimen is covered with aluminum- 10 wt. % silicon, forms the IMC in the part that was not Au coated. However, IMC is not formed in the Au-coated part. The interface of the dipped-undipped is also analyzed by EDX. At the interface of the steel-IMC, it is clearly shown that the IMC is only formed in the dipped part and exists in the steel substrate as well, and contributes by iron, aluminum and silicon. The result clearly shows that only aluminum diffuses into the steel substrate without the dissolution of iron and forms the IMC between the steel substrate and the melt. Au coating and the short dipping time prevent the iron from dissolving into the aluminum melt. By TEM combined with focused ion beam (FIB) sample preparation, the IMC is confirmed as Fe 2 SiAl 8, a hexagonal structure with space group P 63 /mmc...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coating of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating {{of iron and}} steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. <b>Hot</b> <b>dip</b> practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of <b>hot</b> <b>dip)</b> processes precede the coating step. Moreover, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating.

However, now complimenting this traditional solution, the more recent technology of Thermal Diffusion Galvanising is gaining interest within the Australian market, providing commercially viable solutions for a number of specific application areas that <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> Galvanising cannot address. Thermal Diffusion Galvanising is an alternative zinc based technology, which offers equivalent cathodic protection to that of <b>Hot</b> <b>Dip</b> Galvanising.
