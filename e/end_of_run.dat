50|$|Since Golomb-Rice {{codes are}} quite inefficient for {{encoding}} low entropy distributions because the coding rate {{is at least}} one bit per symbol, significant redundancy may be produced because the smooth regions in an image can be encoded at less than 1 bit per symbol. To avoid having excess code length over the entropy, one can use alphabet extension which codes blocks of symbols instead of coding individual symbols. This spreads out the excess coding length over many symbols. This is the “run” mode of JPEG-LS and it is executed once a flat or smooth context region characterized by zero gradients is detected. A run of west symbol “a” is expected and the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>run</b> occurs when a new symbol occurs or the end of line is reached. The total run of length is encoded and the encoder would return to the “regular” mode.|$|E
50|$|During the {{operation}} of the Sodium Reactor Experiment its operators conducted several test cycles (known as “runs”) to correct and modify facility support systems, conduct reactor physics experiments and generate electricity. During run three, the Sodium Reactor Experiment became the first nuclear reactor in the United States to produce power for a commercial power grid. During Run eight, a black residue (believed to be decomposed tetralin) was noticed on fuel elements removed from the reactor. The fuel elements were washed in the wash cell, and returned to the reactor. The reactor returned to operation for high-temperature testing. Several anomalous temperature readings were occasionally noticed during the next few runs, while the operators attempted to understand the behavior and its cause. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>run</b> 13, it was obvious that something had occurred which impaired the heat-transfer characteristics of the system. It was decided that a tetralin leak had reoccurred, and was the cause of the trouble. The reactor sodium was purged with gaseous nitrogen, to remove volatile contamination.|$|E

40|$|While a {{significant}} fraction of ATLAS physicists directly analyse the (Analysis Object Data) produced at the CERN Tier 0, {{a much larger}} have opted to analyse data in a flat ROOT format. The large production of this Derived Physics Data (DPD) format must cater both detailed performance studies of the ATLAS detector and object, as well as higher level and generally lighter-content analysis.
