Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E

5|$|The Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, {{wanted to}} return the nation of Cambodia to an idyllic notion of the past by {{implementing}} a radical form of agrarian socialism while simultaneously shunning outside aid and influence. In order to build and protect their utopian goals, the regime perceived enmity <b>in</b> <b>anyone</b> tied to the previous Cambodian governments, ethnic and religious minorities, intellectuals, and members of certain professions. Artists posed a threat due to their own influence on culture, incompatibility with an agrarian lifestyle, or exhibiting foreign influence. Between 1975 and 1979, about 2 million people (25% of the country's population) were killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide. Several of the artists on Cambodian Rocks {{are thought to have}} been among those killed, and information about them destroyed along with much of their creative output.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated <b>in</b> <b>anyone</b> suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E

25|$|Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) is insight or {{knowledge}} of {{the true nature of}} existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidyā), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara. By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the non-self nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from dukkha and saṃsāra. Prajñā is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the wisdom about the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self <b>in</b> <b>anyone</b> or anything, and dependent origination.|$|E

This was the opposite of Peter Pan. This was a boy who had grown up too quickly." [...] Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in Empire of the Sun, include a child being separated from his parents (The Sugarland Express, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Poltergeist) and World War II (1941, and Raiders of the Lost Ark).

Her mother Hilda forced her to seek medical assistance for her condition, which Lancashire states [...] "gave me my life back", her twenties having been [...] "a write-off". Lancashire felt her first marriage had also contributed to her unhappiness; in 2001, she stated that though her marriage lasted ten years, it [...] "was 10 years longer than it should have done". [...] In 1995 she separated from Hargeaves; the pair would ultimately later divorce. She described leaving her marriage as a [...] "cleansing experience" [...] and a [...] "renaissance"; one that enabled her to rediscover her sense of identity. Other steps that Lancashire took to combat her depression included remaining single for five years, attending therapy sessions, and taking prescriptions of the anti-depressant drug Paroxetine. In December 1995 Lancashire starred in the spin-off straight-to-video film Coronation Street– The Cruise, a 75-minute special detailing Raquel and Curly's honeymoon. The special was advertised as being exclusive to video, and 750,000 copies were sold, to the value of £10million. Lancashire departed Coronation Street in 1996 due to her heavy work schedule and desire to pursue other projects. She had also tired of the fame the role brought her, shying away from personal appearances and interviews with television magazines. Her final scenes attracted 20million viewers. Lancashire's performance in the role saw her nominated in the Most Popular Actress category at the 2nd National Television Awards in October 1996.|$|E
500|$|While Kosinski, the Traveler and the {{engineering}} crew work on reversing the process, {{the rest of}} the crew begin experiencing lifelike visions of their past (an effect of the strange space around them). After having a vision of his mother (Herta Ware), Picard surmises that they have arrived at the theoretical Outer Rim of the universe, and issues a red alert to awaken the crew from their visions. Finding Picard at the spot where he saw his mother, Riker suggests that Kosinski may have had nothing to do with the warp jumps, which were more likely to be a result of the Traveler's illness. Trying to determine this theory, Picard has the alien moved to sick bay. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) however cannot evaluate the Traveler's alien biology, and is unable to treat him. When Picard visits him in sick bay, the Traveler explains his ability to channel pure thought into reality. He brought the crew of the Enterprise to the Outer Rim, triggering similar effects <b>in</b> <b>anyone</b> within it to ascertain if they were ready to experience thought as reality. The Traveler confides to Picard that he looks for scientific prodigies such as the young Crusher, and Picard should nurture him. When he returns to {{the engineering}} section, the Traveler asks Crusher to assist him in returning the Enterprise to known space. As they concentrate, beginning to return the ship home, the Traveler again phases out and finally disappears. The Enterprise suddenly stops, and the crew is relieved to find themselves back in Federation space. After the incident, Picard finally promotes Crusher to acting ensign (following his own unspoken suggestion in [...] "The Naked Now") on the Enterprise for his performance.|$|E
