5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.|$|E
