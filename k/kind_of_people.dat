5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who do not give up hope even {{at the edge of the}} grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

500|$|Avondale was {{developed}} {{later as a}} new area of Riverside on former Magnolia Plantation land. In 1884 Northern developers planned and platted a community in this area called [...] "Edgewood", however {{it did not take}} off and the land was largely undeveloped; hunters still pursued game there until the 1910s. In 1920 an investment group led by Telfair Stockton purchased Edgewood and surrounding land to develop as an exclusive upscale subdivision. Named for Cincinnati's Avondale neighborhood, plantation of former Edgewood owner James R. Challen, the development was billed as [...] "Riverside's Residential Ideal", which was [...] "...desirable because the right <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have recognized its worth and because the wrong <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> can find property more to their liking elsewhere." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{the theme song}} of the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough. The band's third album, Beautiful Garbage (2001), failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors. Garbage quietly disbanded in late 2003, but regrouped to complete their fourth album Bleed Like Me in 2005, peaking at a career-high number four on the Billboard 200. The band cut short their concert tour in support of Bleed Like Me announcing an [...] "indefinite hiatus". Garbage reconvened in 2007 and released a greatest hits compilation Absolute Garbage. The band's fifth studio album, Not Your <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>People,</b> was released on 14 May 2012 through the band's own label, Stunvolume.|$|E
500|$|Garbage {{later said}} that the album was {{released}} as a contractual obligation to Warner Music: [...] "This was the final straw that broke our backs", recalled Manson five years later. [...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It was right there and then that we realized how crazy and out of whack things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not Your <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>People,</b> released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Garbage {{announced}} {{their return to}} touring upon the release of Not Your <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>People,</b> marking the band's first live performances since 2007, and their first tour since 2005. [...] "Thinking about going {{back on the road}} is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measure," [...] Manson stated, [...] "...but we've always enjoyed a little pain mixed in with our pleasure." [...] Manson considered that self-reflection helped change the way the group approached touring, and, as a result, [...] "we're playing the best shows of our career." [...] Eric Avery, who performed with the band during their Bleed Like Me tour, rejoined them as the tour bassist. The band played concerts throughout North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Asia.|$|E

500|$|Not Your <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>People</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by Scottish-American {{alternative}} rock band Garbage. It was released on May 11, 2012 through the band's own record label, Stunvolume. The album marks {{the return of the}} band after a seven-year hiatus that started with previous album Bleed Like Me. Guitarist Duke Erikson said at the launch of the record that [...] "working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like getting on a bicycle...with three other people." [...] The band emphasized that {{they did not want to}} reinvent themselves, but embrace their sonic identity, reflecting their classic sound whilst updating it for 2012. Although Shirley Manson's morose dispositions have a presence on the record, many of the songs share a more optimistic outlook on life, influenced by some of Manson's personal experiences during their hiatus.|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalists have}} noted the title and artwork as {{reflective}} of the album's musical influences. A columnist for the Santa Fe Reporter later described the artwork as [...] "totally cool, with a blocky style depicting some kind of Miami soul food/taco stand." [...] Music journalist Kimberley Chun of the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote of the concept, stating [...] "So what is a soul food taquería? Do you get a side of collard greens with your menudo?" [...] In an interview with Chun, Guerrero discussed the concept and title, stating [...] "It's just this funny idea I had, {{growing up in the}} city – it's so diverse. The city itself is just down-home, down-to-earth, blue-collar, full of everyday <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> My music is along the same lines, just being simple – I just try to be honest in what I do." ...|$|E

500|$|Scholarship {{since the}} 1970s {{has tended to}} move away from a pure study of iconography, instead {{emphasizing}} the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time. According to Craig Harbison, [...] "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> these were." [...] Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a [...] "prayer book mentality" [...] available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.|$|E
500|$|Donnell's {{goal was}} that the Monadnock would [...] "not only look as it {{originally}} did, it [...] also live as it used to", and he sought tenants for the street-level shops that were similar to their 19th-century occupants. Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street. Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage. Shops, all individually owned, were selected to fit the architectural character of the building. A florist, for example, was chosen that evoked a turn-of-the-century atmosphere, {{as well as a}} barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor. A tobacconist with oak furnishings, a pen shop with glass cases, a shoe-shine stand, and other service establishments represented, in Donnell's words, [...] "the kind of small-scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces {{at the turn of the}} century, the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who bring vitality and life to a building because they have a stake in it." ...|$|E

[...] Whedonesque won SyFy Portal's Genre Award for Best Web Site of 2006, and was nominated for same award in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Entertainment Weekly selected Whedonesque as one of the 100 Greatest Websites on December 20, 2007. In May 2008, EW selected Whedonesque as eighth on their list of 25 Essential Fansites, calling it [...] "a reservoir of material about anyone who's starred in (or, it would seem, breathed near) his nerd-magnet projects: Buffy, Angel, and Firefly/Serenity." ...|$|E
