25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged <b>honeycreeper,</b> emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|The hookbill was {{a member}} of the Hawaiian <b>honeycreeper</b> {{subfamily}} Drepanididae and the tribe Psittirostrini, which it shared with seven historically recorded species and about ten species known only from fossils. It is believed that the Lānai hookbill was most closely related to the ōū [...] No fossil specimens of the Lānai hookbill have been found.|$|E
500|$|The Lānai hookbill {{was first}} {{collected}} by George C. Munro from Lānai's Kaiholena Valley on February 22, 1913. In 1919 Robert Cyril Layton Perkins described the species as Dysmorodrepanis munroi based upon this specimen, placing the hookbill in a new, monotypic genus. The genus name {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek words dusmoros [...] "ill-fated," [...] and drepanis to identify the species as a Hawaiian <b>honeycreeper.</b> Drepanis comes from the Ancient Greek word drepane [...] "sickle," [...] in reference to most Hawaiian honeycreeper's bills. The specific name munroi recognizes the collector of the specimen, George C. Munro. The common name came from the species' limited range and distinctive bill shape.|$|E
5|$|Like other Hawaiian <b>honeycreepers,</b> the hookbill {{possessed a}} {{distinctive}} musty odor. The bird's only known vocalization was an inconspicuous chirp; however, all other Hawaiian <b>honeycreepers</b> are excellent vocalists that demonstrate {{an array of}} sounds, and therefore the hookbill likely had a broader, unrecorded repertoire.|$|R

500|$|The Lānai hookbill (Dysmorodrepanis munroi) is an {{extinct species}} of Hawaiian <b>honeycreeper.</b> It was endemic {{to the island}} of Lānai in Hawaii, and was last seen in the southwestern part of the island. George C. Munro {{collected}} the only known specimen of this species in 1913, which is housed in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu, and saw the species only twice more, once in 1916 and for a final time in 1918. No other sightings have been reported. They inhabited montane dry forests dominated by akoko (Euphorbia species) and ōpuhe (Urera glabra). The Lānai hookbill was [...] monotypic within the genus Dysmorodrepanis and had no known subspecies. Its closest relative {{is believed to be}} the ōū, and some early authors suggested that the Lānai hookbill was merely a deformed ōū. The Lānai hookbill was a plump, medium-sized bird with greenish olive upperparts and pale whitish yellow underparts. It also had a yellow or white superciliary line and a white chin and throat. The wings also had a distinctive and conspicuous white wing patch. The hookbill's distinguishing characteristic was its heavy, parrotlike bill, which had the mandibles hooking sharply towards each other, leaving a gap between them when the beak was closed.|$|E

The shortest-bodied species, the white-eared conebill, is [...] long and weighs , barely {{smaller than the}} short-billed <b>honeycreeper.</b> The longest, the magpie tanager is [...] and weighs [...] The heaviest is the white-capped tanager which weighs [...] and measures about [...] Both sexes are usually {{the same size and}} weight. Tanagers are often brightly colored, but some species are black and white. Birds in their first year are often duller or a different color altogether. Males are typically more brightly colored than females. Most tanagers have short, rounded wings. The shape of the bill seems to be linked to the species' foraging habits.|$|E
