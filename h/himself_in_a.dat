5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E

5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock found <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{position}} from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and {{had been on the}} field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E

Sales then held the school scoring record.|$|E

He performed as <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of works (including The Great Profile, My Dear Children and Playmates), and in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1921 he was played by his friend W. C. Fields. In 1927 the Barrymore family was parodied in The Royal Family in which a character based on him was portrayed by Fredric March, whose performance Barrymore admired.

5|$|Bowman finds <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style.

A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light.

5|$|During the 1893season, Stivetts {{involved}} <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{dispute between}} two catholic players, Tommy Tucker and Hugh Duffy, and their manager Frank Selee.

These disagreements, in part, {{led to an}} incident in a Louisville, Kentucky hotel dining room between Stivetts and McCarthy.
