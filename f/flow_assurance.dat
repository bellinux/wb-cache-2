40|$|Abstract — IEEE 802. 11 {{has become}} de facto {{standard}} for wireless LANs. Although it was originally designed for data communication, emergence of Voice over IP (VoIP) has made it attractive for voice applications. But voice applications require delay guarantee. We have implemented Dynamic Class Selection (DCS) mechanism in Neighborhood Proportional Delay Differentiation (NPDD) (proposed in [1]) architecture to provide delay assurance in IEEE 802. 11 networks. But we found that DCS is not suitable for voice applications which require tight delay bound. Hence, we propose two Adaptive Class Selection (ACS) mechanisms to provide delay <b>assurances</b> to voice <b>flows.</b> However, delay <b>assurance</b> at all nodes within a LAN cannot be provided with ACS or DCS. So we propose Measurement based Distributed Call Admission Control (MDAC) mechanism to provide delay assurances for voice traffic at all nodes.

40|$|Network {{services}} for the most demanding advanced networked applications which require absolute, per-flow service assurances can be deterministic or statistical. By exploiting statistical properties of traffic, statistical assurances can extract more capacity from a network than deterministic assurances. In this paper we consider statistical service assurances for traffic scheduling algorithms. We present functions, so-called effective envelopes, which are, with high certainty, upper bounds of multiplexed traffic. Effective envelopes {{can be used to}} obtain bounds on the amount of traffic on a link that can be provisioned with statistical service assurances. We show that our bounds can be applied to a variety of traffic scheduling algorithms. In fact, one can reuse existing admission control functions for scheduling algorithms with deterministic assurances. We present numerical examples which compare the number of <b>flows</b> with statistical <b>assurances</b> that can be admitted with our effective envelope approach to those achieved with existing methods.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and evaluates new share-based scheduling algorithms for differentiated service {{quality in}} network services, such as network storage servers. This form of resource control {{makes it possible}} to share a server among multiple request <b>flows</b> with probabilistic <b>assurance</b> that each <b>flow</b> receives a specified minimum share of a server’s capacity to serve requests. This assurance is important for safe outsourcing of services to shared utilities such as Storage Service Providers. Our approach interposes share-based request dispatching on the network path between the server and its clients. Two new scheduling algorithms are designed to run within an intermediary (e. g., a network switch), where they enforce fair sharing by throttling request flows and reordering requests; these algorithms are adaptations of Start-time Fair Queuing (SFQ) for servers with a configurable degree of internal concurrency. A third algorithm, Request Windows (RW), bounds the outstanding requests for each flow independently; it is amenable to a decentralized implementation, but may restrict concurrency under light load. The analysis and experimental results show that these new algorithms can enforce shares effectively when the shares are not saturated, and that they provide acceptable performance isolation under saturation. Although the evaluation uses a storage service as an example, interposed request scheduling is non-intrusive and views the server as a black box, so it is useful for complex services with no internal support for differentiated service quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} commoditization {{of computers}} in modern society has exceeded {{the pace of}} associated developments in reliability. Although theoretical computer science has advanced greatly in the last thirty years, {{many of the best}} techniques have yet to find their way into embedded computers, and their failure can have a great potential for disrupting society. This dissertation presents some approaches to improve computer reliability using software and hardware techniques, and makes the following claims for novelty: innovative development of a toolchain and libraries to support extraction from dependent type checking in a theorem prover; conceptual design and deployment in reconfigurable hardware; an extension of static type-safety to hardware description language and FPGA level; elimination of legacy C code from the target and toolchain; a novel hardware error detection scheme is described and compared with conventional triple modular redundancy. The elimination of any user control of memory management promotes robustness against buffer overruns, and consequently prevents vulnerability to common Trojan techniques. The methodology identifies type punning as a key weakness of commonly encountered embedded languages such as C, in particular the extreme difficulty of determining if an array access is in bounds, or if dynamic memory has been properly allocated and released. A method of eliminating dependence on type-unsafe libraries is presented, in conjunction with code that has optionally been proved correct according to user-defined criteria. An appropriately defined subset of OCaml is chosen with support for the Coq theorem prover in mind, and then evaluated with a custom backend that supports behavioural Verilog, as well as a fixed execution unit and associated control store. Results are presented for this alternative platform for reliable embedded systems development that may be used in future industrial <b>flows.</b> To provide <b>assurance</b> of correct operation, the proven software needs to be executed in an environment where errors are checked and corrected in conjunction with appropriate exception processing {{in the event of an}} uncorrectable error.

The value of access to locked data and services makes Smart Cards a desirable attack target for hackers of all sorts. The range of attacks a Smart Card and its environment can be subjected to ranges from social engineering to exploiting hardware and software bugs and features. This research has focused on several hardware related attacks and potential threats. Namely, power glitch attack, power analysis, laser attack, the potential effect on security of memory power consumption reduction techniques and using a re-configurable instruction set as method to harden opcode interpretation. A semi-automated simulation environment to test designs against glitch attacks and power analysis has been developed. This simulation environment can be easily integrated within Atmel’s design <b>flow</b> to bring <b>assurance</b> of their designs’ behaviour and permeability to such attacks at an early development stage. Previous power analysis simulation work focused on testing the implementation of part of the cryptographic algorithm. This work focuses on targeting the whole algorithm, allowing the test of a wider range of countermeasures. A common glitch detection approach is monitoring the power supply for abnormal voltage values and fluctuations. This approach can fail to detect some fast glitches. The alternative approach used in this research monitors the effects of a glitch on a mono-stable circuit sensitive to fault injection by glitch attacks. This work has resulted in a patented glitch detector that improves the overall glitch detection range. The use of radiation countermeasures as laser countermeasures and potential sensors has been investigated too. Radiation and laser attacks have similar effects on silicon devices. Whilst several countermeasures against radiation have been developed over the years, almost no explicit mention of laser countermeasures was found. This research has demonstrated the suitability of using some radiation countermeasures as laser countermeasures. Memory partitioning is a static and dynamic power consumption reduction technique successfully used in various devices. The nature of Smart Card devices restricts the applicability of some aspects of this power reduction technique.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the nature of}} South African municipal water service delivery, and how marketing strategies can {{provide a framework for}} better management of this service. It reflects on the elements that guide municipal decision making and evaluates user preferences for levels of the municipal “water service mix” by employing conjoint analysis. Particular attention is paid to consumer willingness to pay for improvements in the “water service mix”. The study argues that the values municipal consumers attach to the variables of the water service mix need to be better incorporated into decision making regarding water service delivery, and that conjoint analysis is an informative method to assist in generating this information. The study outlines a water service marketing challenge and methods of research followed to deal with it (Chapter One) {{and the nature of the}} laws and institutions governing water service provision in South Africa (Chapter Two). The task of providing water services is delegated to Water Service Providers (municipalities). The key variables of the water service mix from the consumers perspective include; quality of the water, rate of flow from tap, interruption of water <b>flow,</b> sewerage disposal, <b>assurance</b> of supply, and water service tariffs (Chapter Three). The study covers the areas of Amathole, Kouga and Nelson Mandela Bay Municipalities' (Chapter Five). The method of marketing analysis applied is conjoint analysis, alternatively known as choice experiment analysis. An overview of the method is provided and its application to three samples of one hundred residents at each of the study sites is described in Chapter Four. The responses of the three hundred residents provide the basis for the results. Respondents were requested to make a series of choices between alternative water service mixes consisting of six variables differentiated by three levels (Chapter Three). In making these choices they implicitly compared and weighed up the relative worth of the selected variables against each other. The findings of the analysis were diverse (Chapter Six); two of the three estimated models did not yield significant results. An interpretation of these results showed that the respondents of the Kouga municipality were willing to pay R 65. 05 more (per 10 xii Kilolitres of water) than their current monthly tariff for a marginal improvement in water quality, R 57. 29 more (per 10 Kilolitres of water) per month for a marginal improvement in sewerage disposal and R 21. 90 (per 10 Kilolitres) per month for marginal improvements in assurance of water supply. Findings showed that willingness to pay for reduced interruptions and improved flow rates was lower and not as highly valued as the abovementioned variables. Most of these findings were consistent with similar international and national studies showing their reliability. Although there has been significant improvement in extending the reach of the network since 1994, the standards of water service provision in South African municipalities do not appear to have improved. The results of this study mirror a number of concerns that have been expressed about the standards of service, particularly sanitation (in publications like the Green Drop Report). Municipal service delivery in these areas would appear to be constrained by a number of issues including a lack of public involvement, legislation, limited financial resources and institutional capabilities. However, it is a service that is too vitally important to be allowed to deteriorate. Marketing analyses can make a valuable contribution to allocating and managing the scarce resources to best satisfy the consumers of water services (Chapter Seven). When consumer orientation is formally introduced as the main objective into the thinking of the service provider, it becomes untenable to offer poor service delivery. But that is exactly what many municipalities appear to be doing. There is a need to get back to the basics – where the consumer is king. This analysis concludes that consumers want, above all else, assurance of water supply, a high quality of water, and safe environmentally sensitive disposal of waste water. It is recommended that municipalities not lose sight of the fact that price is an important part of the marketing mix. From the paying consumers perspective, when the government incorporate too many other considerations into pricing of water services they are, in effect, disengaging price from the marketing mix by not being sensitive to consumer needs. This approach shows a weak marketing strategy, and may result in dissatisfied consumers who may become unwilling to pay for their water services – an outcome that the researcher would discourag...|$|R
