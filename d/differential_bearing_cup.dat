40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of determining the loads occurring at the tire/road interface of an automobile by strain gage readings taken at the <b>bearing</b> <b>cup.</b> This knowledge could then be used to design a load sensing automobile bearing that could be incorporated into a dynamic control system for an automobile. This paper {{presents the results of}} tests performed on Timken TM automotive bearings that were equipped with strain gages in various positions on the <b>bearing</b> <b>cup.</b> These tests consisted of applying loads to the bearings and recording the strain that was measured by the strain gages. A matrix was then constructed for each bearing, which relates the strains on the bearing to the loads, which are occurring at the tire/road interface...|$|R

50|$|The headset is {{the set of}} {{components}} on a bicycle that provides a rotatable interface between the bicycle fork and the head tube of the bicycle frame. The tube through which the steerer of the fork passes is called the head tube. A typical headset consists of two cups that are pressed into {{the top and bottom}} of the headtube. Inside the two <b>cups</b> are <b>bearings</b> which provide a low friction contact between the <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> and the steerer.|$|R
50|$|The Bayliss-Wiley Unit Bottom Bracket was {{introduced}} in the mid-1940s. It was fitted to various English lightweights through the 1950s and was used by Royal Enfield on its 'Revelation' small wheeler in the mid-1960s. However, the unit bottom bracket was never popular and it had a reputation for being troublesome. A lack of positive location allowed it to rotate within the frame, loosening the <b>bearing</b> <b>cups.</b> Contemporary users overcome the problem by fixing the unit in the frame using adhesive or a screw.|$|R

40|$|The need to {{understand}} and quantify the heat transfer paths within tapered-roller bearings is of great importance in the railroad industry since <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> temperature measurement is the primary tool utilized in the removal of distressed bearings from service. Experiments were performed to acquire temperature histories at several locations on a stationary bearing subjected to heat sources imbedded in two rollers. The experimental results were compared to zero- and first-order thermal models to estimate overall heat transfer coefficients from the bearing. The results presented here {{can be used to}} explain some of the mechanisms that lead to overheating of tapered-roller bearings...|$|R

5000|$|The early {{engines that}} were {{produced}} before 1957 had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup {{which in turn}} is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall. This arrangement (known as a three-piece piston) was abandoned as of 1957 in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> formed integrally in the piston interior. The advantage of this latter set-up was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be re-set to take up play using a suitable [...] "reset" [...] tool to re-swage the cup.|$|R
5000|$|The {{threadless}} headset is a {{more recent}} design. U.S. Patent 5095770 is owned by Cane Creek Cycling Components and expired on September 29, 2010. Headsets of this type are often referred to by the Dia-Compe (now Cane Creek) registered trademark [...] "Aheadset", and are manufactured under license. Like a traditional headset, it uses two sets of <b>bearings</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>cups.</b> Unlike a threaded headset, a threadless headset {{does not have a}} threaded top headset race or use a threaded steerer tube. Instead the steerer tube extends from the fork {{all the way through the}} head tube and above the headset, and is held in place by the stem clamped on top.|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear rate in conical thrust bearings, which is {{responsible}} for field failures of stepper motors in optical disk drives (ODD). These bearings support the stepper motor worm shaft and consist of a steel ball supported in a polymer conical <b>bearing</b> <b>cup.</b> The tribological behaviors of polymers used in bearing application has been addressed by using Archard's wear model, a well known classical model for fretting wear in the literature. However, these studies were for planar bearing surfaces and other geometries, not for the conical geometry addressed in this study. Tests were designed and implemented to study the wear rate of the conical <b>bearing</b> <b>cups</b> at with different load levels. The tribological behavior of Delrin in conical thrust bearing applications has been characterized, by quantifying the wear factors used in the modified Archard's model. Distinct reduction of wear rate is observed due to formation of a polymer transfer film on the steel ball. The variability of the wear properties is explored through replication of the test conditions. Destructive physical analysis is conducted to gain insight into the fundamental wear mechanisms as a part of this study. The results of the wear tests are used to develop a life model of the stepper motor as a case study, to demonstrate an application of this approach. The life model is used to study the effect of variability in the initial axial bearing preload (due to manufacturing tolerances), on the wear rate and life of the stepper motor...|$|R

50|$|In the {{threadless}} headset system, the spacers {{are important}} in placing the stem and preload bolt in the correct position on the steerer tube. Thus the stack height of the stem becomes important. The steerer tube of the fork must be cut to length such that it leaves at least enough of the steerer tube protruding above the headset for the stem to clamp on to; if the steerer tube is cut longer than the stem, then spacers are used {{to fill the gap}} between the stem and the conical compression washer. Bicycle racers seeking the greatest saddle-to-handlebar drop for better aerodynamics will often forego spacers and cut the steerer tube down to exactly match the headset <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> stack height plus the stem height.|$|R

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the {{indentation}} marks on the rollers and the cracks on the <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> were resulted during {{the impact of the}} aircraft on the port main wheel. These were caused instantaneously and not over a period of time. On the other hand, the damages seen on the roller elements of the bearing were progressive in nature and were caused over a period of time. The rollers of the bearing had failed by flaking, a form of fatigue failure. Analysis shows that the most probable reason for the premature flaking in the bearing could be excessive axial load. The failure pattern and the aircraft behaviour during take-off roll strongly support this conclusion. However, the possibility of excessive axial load on the port main wheel needs to be examined...|$|R

They are heading towards a seated man with a raised cup. Between him and the procession are a couple of animals and two other objects, and behind him is a tree. There are various speculations as to the meaning and cultural influences of the friezes. The Encyclopaedia Iranica considers the animals to be depicted in the Hittite tradition, and the tree to be the Tree of Life.

50|$|An {{eccentric}} is a {{cylindrical plug}} or <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> that fits into an enlarged bottom bracket shell. The plug is machined {{to accept a}} typical bottom bracket, but offset {{from the center of}} the plug, so that by rotating the plug, the location of the bottom bracket (and hence the chain tension) may be adjusted (fore and aft to tension the chain, the upper or lower eccentric position for a given chain length can be chosen to fine tune bottom bracket height). Once properly adjusted the plug is then fixed in place by a pair of set screws, a clamping bottom bracket shell, an expanding wedge in the plug, or the plug may be manufactured in left and right halves that clamp against the faces of the bottom bracket shell with screws that connect the two halves.|$|R
50|$|Tightening a {{threadless}} headset requires {{tightening the}} preload bolt (or cap bolt) in {{the cap on}} the top of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star nut driven down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset <b>bearing</b> <b>cups.</b> The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to turn smoothly without binding or excessive friction.|$|R

5000|$|Many modern {{bicycles}} {{use what}} is called a [...] "cartridge" [...] bottom bracket instead. Sealed cartridge bottom brackets are normally two pieces, a unit holding the spindle and bearings that screws into the bottom bracket shell from the drive side and a support cup (often made of light alloy or plastic) that supports the spindle/bearing assembly on the non-drive side. Other designs are three piece, the spindle is separate, but the <b>bearing</b> <b>cups</b> incorporate cheaply replaceable standard cartridge bearing units. Either arrangement makes servicing the bottom bracket a simple matter of removing the old cartridge from the bottom bracket shell, and installing a new one in its place. Cartridge bottom brackets generally have seals to prevent the ingress of water and dirt. The early Shimano LP bottom brackets from the 1990s had the support cup on the drive side and used loose bearings inside; they could be dismantled and serviced much like cup and cone bearings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psJxGx3cVR8 ...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{requirements}} {{necessary for}} sensing bearing distress {{and the related}} criteria to select a particular rotating sensor were established during the phase I.
