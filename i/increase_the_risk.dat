5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{congenital}} {{conditions may}} <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of leukemia; {{the most common}} is probably Down syndrome, which {{is associated with a}} 10- to 18-fold increase in the risk of AML.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E

This <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of coagulation.|$|R
5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of thrombosis further.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling.

5|$|Exposure to anticancer chemotherapy, in {{particular}} alkylating agents, can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of subsequently developing AML.

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth.

Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures.
