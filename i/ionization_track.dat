50|$|The {{detector}} in GEMS {{would have}} been a small chamber filled with gas. When an X-ray is absorbed in the gas, an electron carries off most of the energy, and starts out in a direction related to the polarization direction of the X-ray. This electron loses energy by ionizing the gas; the instrument measures the direction of the <b>ionization</b> <b>track,</b> and thereby the polarization of the X-ray. The GEMS detector readout will employ a time projection chamber to image the track. The GEMS instrument is about 100 times more sensitive than previous X-ray polarization experiments.|$|E

The statistical distribution of the number of electrons that escape recombination is found to deviate from the binomial distribution, and estimates of recombination fluctuations for nuclear recoils tracks are obtained. A study of the recombination kinetics shows that a significant part of electrons undergo very fast static recombination, an effect that may be responsible for the weak drift-field dependence of the ionization yield from nuclear recoils in some noble liquids.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the energy response to low-energy recoils in dual-phase xenon-based dark matter experiments. A recombination model is developed to explain the recombination probability {{as a function of}} recoil energy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is discussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that the volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma effect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the <b>ionization</b> <b>track</b> forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the interior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the plasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero field is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear recoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We show a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a stronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils. As a result, the time-dependent recombination is implemented in the determination of charge and light yield with a generic model.
