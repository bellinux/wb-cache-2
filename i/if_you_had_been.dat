[...] I see in my soul how ruefully you walk, your body so bloody, so raw and blistered. The crown on your head is so sharp, and your hair, blown in the wind, is all matted with blood.

2500|$|In {{the account}} of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha {{followed}} by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, [...] "Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in Luke 10:38–42." [...] When Mary meets Jesus, she falls at his feet. In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brother's death: [...] "Lord, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> here, my brother would not have died." [...] But where Jesus' response to Martha is one of teaching calling her to hope and faith, his response to Mary is more emotional: [...] "When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. As the 17th century Welsh commentator Matthew Henry notes, [...] "Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 7 May 1099 the crusaders reached Jerusalem, {{which had}} been recaptured from the Seljuks by the Fatimids of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the crusaders were able to end the siege by {{breaking}} down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over {{the course of that}} afternoon, evening and next morning, the crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem. Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the Temple Mount inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the crusaders spared few lives. According to the anonymous Gesta Francorum, in what some believe {{to be one of the}} most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade, [...] "...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...." [...] Tancred claimed the Temple quarter for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow crusaders. According to Fulcher of Chartres: [...] "Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared." ...|$|E
