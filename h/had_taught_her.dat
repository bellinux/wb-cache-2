5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E

25|$|After Robinson's {{retirement}} {{she lived}} in Parsons Green, supported by Peterborough and her earnings from the opera. She did not detach herself from the musical world; she retained a close friendship with Bononcini, who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> in the past, and her house became a sort of academy-in-miniature at which Bononcini, Pier Francesco Tosi, and other musicians of the day frequently performed. For Bononcini she obtained a pension of £500 per annum from the Duchess of Marlborough. A Roman Catholic, {{she was also a}} friend of the poet Alexander Pope. After Peterborough's death in 1735, she lived at his family residence near Southampton. Lady Peterborough died in Bath, and her remains were interred in Bath Abbey.|$|E
25|$|Catherine was young, joyous and carefree; Mannox <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> to {{play the}} virginals. She {{was too young to}} take part in {{administrative}} matters of State. Nevertheless, every night Sir Thomas Heneage, Groom of the Stool, came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the City of London to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at Baynard Castle: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards. Every day she dressed with new clothes in the French fashion bedecked with precious jewels. With ominous foresight the motto adopted read Non autre volonte que la sienne (No other wish but his), decorated in gold around her sleeves.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Mary, Elizabeth's other daughter, Anne, {{is thought to}} have had a close relationship with her mother. Elizabeth had been in charge of her children's early education, including Anne's, and she <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> to play on various musical instruments, to sing and to dance, as well as embroidery, poetry, good manners, reading, writing and some French. In 1525, Henry VIII fell in love with Anne, and Elizabeth became her protective chaperone. She accompanied Anne to Court, since Anne was attempting to avoid a sexual relationship with the King. Elizabeth travelled with Anne to view York Place {{after the fall of the}} Boleyn family's great political opponent, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey — an intrigue which had given Anne her first real taste of political power. She was crowned queen four years later.|$|E

25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> how to write better.|$|E
500|$|Hindley's {{father had}} {{served with the}} Parachute Regiment and had been {{stationed}} in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the Second World War. He had been known in the army as a [...] "hard man" [...] and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he {{taught her how to}} fight, and insisted that she [...] "stick up for herself". When Hindley was 8, a local boy approached her in the street and scratched both of her cheeks with his fingernails, drawing blood. She burst into tears and ran into her parents' house, to be met by her father, who demanded that she [...] "Go and punch him , because if you don't I'll leather you!" [...] Hindley found the boy and succeeded in knocking him down with a sequence of punches, as her father <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her.</b> As she wrote later, [...] "at eight years old I'd scored my first victory".|$|E
500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> how to embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, {{all of the time}} that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women who feel the same way".|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, L’Engle {{reflected}} on how suffering <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her.</b> She told how suffering a [...] "lonely solitude" [...] {{as a child}} taught her about the “world of the imagination” that enabled her to write for children. Later she suffered a [...] "decade of failure" [...] after her first books were published. It was a [...] "bitter" [...] experience, yet she wrote that she had [...] "learned a lot of valuable lessons" [...] that enabled her to persevere as a writer.|$|E
2500|$|Crandon used a {{trick in}} an attempt to fool psychical {{researchers}} that the [...] "spirit" [...] voices in her séances did not come from her own mouth. According to magician John Booth this was performed by Crandon filling her mouth with water before the séance had started and when the lights were turned off, swallowing the water. Before the end of the séance she would refill her mouth with water from a corked test tube. Crandon's reputation was also damaged when a fingerprint left on wax ostensibly by her channeled spirit, her deceased brother, Walter, was discovered to belong to her dentist Frederick Caldwell {{by a member of the}} Boston Society for Psychical Research. Her dentist divulged that he <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> how to make these prints.|$|E

2500|$|Obituaries for {{her were}} {{published}} in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, and the Corriere della Sera, amongst others. The Sydney Morning Herald also republished one of her last blog posts, in which she discussed how engaging with a difficult activity <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> about helping students with their own difficulties, partly by teaching them to celebrate the little successes {{on the way to}} a goal. She wrote that, [...] "Ultimately, nothing was more helpful for me than failing repeatedly" [...] and that she wanted her students to realize that failures could be part of learning and were nothing to be ashamed of. The journal ABO, which Wadewitz had worked for from 2011 to 2012, dedicated its March 2014 issue to Wadewitz.|$|E
