5|$|The second main feud {{heading into}} the event was between Kane and Shawn Michaels. This feud began the night after Bad Blood, when Michaels lost a Hell in a Cell match to Triple H. Raw {{commentator}} Jim Ross tried making amends between Michaels and Triple H by making them to shake hands. Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, however, Kane came out and attacked Michaels, which resulted in Kane, in storyline, crushing Michaels' throat with a wedged chair. Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention. On the June 28, 2004 edition of Raw, Ross interviewed Kane {{and asked him to}} explain his actions towards Michaels; Kane explained that he was robbed of the World Heavyweight Championship at Bad Blood against Chris Benoit, as Michaels <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way, which angered him. On the August 30 edition of Raw, Kane revealed that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to him and Lita, who married the week before, was to name any match he wanted for the September pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Lita then informed Kane that Bischoff's present was for both of them, where they were able to pick Kane's opponent for Unforgiven, which resulted in Michaels being picked.|$|E

During his touring of Eastern Europe (1935–1939), he was often arrested by police for taking these pictures, sometimes because he {{was thought to be}} spying. Later, when published, these photographs made him popular enough for his work to be showcased as one-man shows at Columbia University, the Jewish Museum in New York, the International Center of Photography and other such institutions.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the strip}} {{did not have}} a lead {{character}} at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown, a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz' formative years. In early strips, Charlie Brown was depicted as distinctly younger than his cohorts Patty and Shermy. Charlie Brown's main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirably determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame but continues playing baseball; he can never fly a kite successfully but continues trying to do so. Though his inferiority complex was evident from the start, in the earlier strips he also <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet. On September 1, 1958, Charlie Brown's father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication). In 1960, the now popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by Hallmark Cards. Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969, as they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for Apollo 10.|$|E

[...] Following a five-month layoff due to surgery that addressed a problem with his breathing, he returned to the track in November 2011 with a win, won three graded stakes races in 2012, and finished a close second to Fort Larned in that year's Breeders' Cup Classic.|$|E

500|$|Whales {{continue}} to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a [...] "great white whale" [...] as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville {{to be the largest}} type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick. Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories includes the story of [...] "How the Whale <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Throat". Niki Caro's film the Whale Rider has a Māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship. Walt Disney's film Pinocchio features a giant whale named Monstro as the final antagonist. Alan Hovhaness' orchestra And God Created Great Whales including the recorded sounds of humpback and bowhead whales. Léo Ferré's song [...] "Il n'y a plus rien" [...] is an example of biomusic that begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra and his voice.|$|E
500|$|Frank Orr, a {{columnist}} in the Toronto Star, suggested that Hextall's aggressive nature, {{which resulted in}} three suspensions of six or more games during his NHL career, was an intentional part of his game designed to protect him. He theorized that because Hextall's style of play frequently took {{him out of his}} goal crease, the threat of physical violence lessened the chances of him being challenged by an attacker when out of position. In the 1993 playoff series between the Montreal Canadiens and Hextall's Nordiques, the Canadiens' coach Jacques Demers designed a plan to disrupt Hextall's play after Montreal had lost its two first games to Quebec. He noted that Hextall would be off his game if he were disturbed or bumped. Montreal then won four straight games to win the series in six games. Demers felt that Hextall's emotional play lessened his effectiveness; while acknowledging him as a [...] "great competitor", he felt that [...] "he didn't reach the level of a Grant Fuhr or a Martin Brodeur [...] he lost his cool if you <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E

500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they <b>got...</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way".|$|E

Atkinson caught the man he believed was the peeping tom, but the man convinced {{him that he was}} not the window peeper and that he had just taken his girlfriend home. Atkinson later heard the story about Thomas and decided to notify the police of his experience. Atkinson said the man he saw was 5'9, wore khaki and had hair that could have been dark red.

After the match, Royal Rumble winner Sheamus attacked Bryan and chose him as his WrestleMania opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. In March, Bryan began to mistreat AJ, publicly demanding her to shut up and claiming that she always <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> way. Despite these actions, AJ continued to stand by Bryan. Bryan's reign as world champion ended at 105 days when Sheamus squashed him in 18 seconds at WrestleMania XXVIII due to Bryan being distracted with receiving a good luck kiss from AJ. On the following SmackDown, Bryan blamed AJ for his world title loss and [...] ended their relationship. Despite AJ's attempts to mend their relationship, Bryan cruelly rebuffed her multiple times, leaving AJ an emotional wreck.

What I'm interested in is what the guy's <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
