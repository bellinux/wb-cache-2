Judy reluctantly {{produces}} the money and Elle drives Sage to the abortion clinic. After the procedure, Judy forgives Sage and takes her home. On her own way home, Elle giggles and rejoices at memories of her partner Violet. Before reaching home, she makes a short stop at Olivia's house to apologize for saying their relationship meant nothing. Afterwards, Elle walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> laughing on her way home.|$|E
500|$|Leterrier {{had planned}} to use {{prosthetic}} makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film. The make-up artists who worked on [...] were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation, which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky [...] "not [...] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, {{and we talked about}} how when he walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [...] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E

2500|$|Many federal {{offices in}} {{downtown}} Washington had closed early {{that day in}} response to quickly developing blizzard conditions. Thus, there was a massive backup of traffic on {{almost all of the}} city's roads, making it very difficult for ambulances to reach the crash site. The Coast Guard's [...] harbor tugboat Capstan (WYTL 65601) [...] and its crew were based nearby; their duties include icebreaking and responding to water rescues. [...] The Capstan was considerably farther downriver on another search-and-rescue mission. Emergency ground response was greatly hampered by ice-covered roads and gridlocked traffic. Ambulances attempting to reach the scene were even driven <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> in front of the White House. Rescuers who reached the site were unable to assist survivors in the water because they did not have adequate equipment to reach them. Below-freezing waters and heavy ice made swimming out to them impossible. [...] Multiple attempts to throw a makeshift lifeline (made out of belts and any other things available that could be tied together) out to the survivors proved ineffective. The rescue attempts by emergency officials and witnesses were recorded and broadcast live by area news reporters, and as the accident occurred in the nation's capital, there were large numbers of media personnel on hand to provide quick and extensive coverage.|$|E

50|$|A popular Doo Dah Parade {{takes place}} in Columbus, Ohio. The Columbus Doo Dah Parade was {{inspired}} by the Pasadena event and began in 1983 as a small, disorganized march <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> of High Street in The Short North district of the city by regulars of the Short North Tavern. The Columbus Doo Dah Parade takes place yearly on the Fourth of July (rain date, July 3) in the Short North and Victorian Village neighborhoods of Columbus.

60|$|He saw a dark bulk outline {{itself on}} the roof of the porch and slowly descend a pillar. Then it came down the steps, passed through the small iron gate, and went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> taking on the form of a man. He that watched kept on his own side of the street and moved on abreast to the corner, where he crossed over and joined the other. He was quite small {{alongside}} the man he accosted.|$|E
60|$|The {{police for}} the moment had been swept away. Bill Totts leaped to the {{pavement}} {{and made his way}} to the woman on the sidewalk. Catherine Van Vorst saw her throw her arms around him and kiss him on the lips; and Catherine Van Vorst watched him curiously as he went on <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> one arm around the woman, both talking and laughing, and he with a volubility and abandon she could never have dreamed possible.|$|E
60|$|The {{interest}} of the election was very great; and as the vote of Rock River practically settled the contest, the centre of interest was the Court House, which was crowded to suffocation on election night. There was a continual jam and a continual change. Crowds stood around the doorway, or moved up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> Crowds were constantly {{running up and down}} the stairway, and crowding in and out the dingy, dimly lighted court-room, which was roaring with voices, blue with smoke, and foul as a dungeon--with tobacco and vitiated breaths.|$|E

60|$|When {{she reached}} the corner {{she turned her head}} to glance at the motor car, and then passed it, {{continuing}} on across the street. Sheltered behind a convenient standing cab, the young man followed her movements closely with his eyes. Passing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> of the street opposite the park, she entered the restaurant with the blazing sign. The place was one of those frankly glaring establishments, all white paint and glass, where one may dine cheaply and conspicuously. The girl penetrated the restaurant to some retreat at its rear, whence she quickly emerged without her hat and veil.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lives up}} the street here a way--the kindest old gentleman you ever saw. He always has candy in his pockets for the children, and it's a sight to see them follow him up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> He takes them to the Park in the cars on Saturday afternoons. That was all Dicky could think about at first--would he be well enough to go with Mr. Bentley by Saturday? And he was forever asking me to tell Mr. Bentley he was sick. I saw the old gentleman on the street to-day, and I almost went up to him. But I hadn't the courage." ...|$|E
60|$|That kiss {{had been}} Peter's seal of service. And he became, on Sunday afternoons, {{a sort of}} {{understudy}} for Catherine. He took an amazing delight in wheeling Honora {{up and down the}} yard, and up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> Brunhilde or Queen Elizabeth never wielded a power more absolute, nor had an adorer more satisfactory; and of all his remarkable talents, none were more conspicuous than his abilities to tell a story and to choose a present. Emancipated from the perambulator, Honora would watch for him at the window, and toddle to the gate to meet him, a gentleman-in-waiting whose zeal, however arduous, never flagged.|$|E

60|$|The roar came closer, and Saxon, leaning out, saw a dozen scabs, {{conveyed}} {{by as many}} special police and Pinkertons, coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> on {{her side of the}} street. They came compactly, as if with discipline, while behind, disorderly, yelling confusedly, stooping to pick up rocks, were seventy-five or a hundred of the striking shopmen. Saxon discovered herself trembling with apprehension, knew that she must not, and controlled herself. She was helped in this by the conduct of Mercedes Higgins. The old woman came out of her front door, dragging a chair, on which she coolly seated herself on the tiny stoop {{at the top of the}} steps.|$|E
60|$|There was one American tramp royal whom I found {{particularly}} enjoyable. I {{first noticed}} {{him on the}} street, asleep in a doorway, his head on his knees, but a hat on his head that one does not meet {{this side of the}} Western Ocean. When the policeman routed him out, he got up slowly and deliberately, looked at the policeman, yawned and stretched himself, looked at the policeman again as much as to say he didn't know whether he would or wouldn't, and then sauntered leisurely <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> At the outset I was sure of the hat, but this made me sure of the wearer of the hat.|$|E
6000|$|But {{then came}} the {{inevitable}} cop and imminent inconvenience for both the attacker and attacked. John Hopkins was a peaceful citizen, who worked at rebuses of nights in a flat, {{but he was not}} without the fundamental spirit of resistance that comes with the battle-rage. He knocked the policeman into a grocer's sidewalk display of goods and gave Freshmayer a punch that caused him temporarily to regret that he had not made it a rule to extend a five-cent line of credit to certain customers. Then Hopkins took spiritedly to his heels <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> closely followed by the cigar-dealer and the policeman, whose uniform testified to the reason in the grocer's sign that read: [...] "Eggs cheaper {{than anywhere else in the}} city." ...|$|E
50|$|Sweet {{was four}} {{blocks from the}} riots, but did not leave his {{fraternity}} house. Author Kevin Boyle said that Sweet and other young black men were afraid to go out. He had been “walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street when a gang descended on a passing streetcar, pulled a black passenger <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> and beat him mercilessly”. Sweet had seen enough violence as a child when witnessing a lynching. This memory would not leave him until his death.|$|R
