40|$|O uso intensivo de {{glyphosate}} como herbicida não-seletivo tem selecionado espécies de plantas daninhas tolerantes. Dessa forma, é importante que sejam estudadas misturas de tanque com herbicidas de mecanismos de ação alternativos e que apresentem efeitos sinergísticos ou aditivos. Por essa razão, foi instalado um experimento inteiramente casualizado, composto por 13 tratamentos e 4 repetições, em casa de vegetação da Universidade de São Paulo - ESALQ/USP, Piracicaba-SP, com as plantas daninhas Richardia brasiliensis, Commelina benghalensis, Amaranthus hybridus, Galinsoga parviflora e Ipomoea grandifolia em misturas de tanque dos herbicidas chlorimuron-ethyl, sulfentrazone, carfentrazone, bentazon ou <b>flumioxazin</b> com glyphosate. As interações foram aditivas para as plantas daninhas I. grandifolia e C. benghalensis, e os herbicidas <b>flumioxazin,</b> sulfentrazone e carfentrazone aplicados isoladamente e em mistura com glyphosate foram os que proporcionaram os melhores níveis de controle. A interação de glyphosate com sulfentrazone foi antagônica em R. brasiliensis; a mistura de glyphosate com os demais herbicidas estudados foi aditiva, sendo os tratamentos com mistura de glyphosate e chlorimuron-ethyl ou <b>flumioxazin</b> os mais eficazes. Em A. hybridus, os tratamentos que apresentaram melhores níveis de controle foram o glyphosate e carfentrazone, aplicados isoladamente, e a mistura de glyphosate com <b>flumioxazin,</b> sulfentrazone, chlorimuron-ethyl e bentazon, sendo estes interações aditivas. No caso de G. parviflora, os tratamentos com <b>flumioxazin</b> e sulfentrazone apresentaram controle total, o mesmo acontecendo com as misturas de glyphosate com carfentrazone, <b>flumioxazin,</b> sulfentrazone, chlorimuron-ethyl ou bentazon. The {{intensive use}} of glyphosate as a non-selective herbicide for weed vegetation management has selected some tolerant weed species. Thus, {{it is important}} to study the synergistic or antagonic or additive effects of tank mixtures of glyphosate combined with alternative mechanism of action herbicides. An experiment was developed in a randomized complete design, using 12 treatments and four replications, under greenhouse conditions at University of São Paulo - USP/ESALQ - Piracicaba-SP, Brazil, with the weeds Richardia brasiliensis, Commelina benghalensis, Amaranthus hybridus, Galinsoga parviflora and Ipomoea grandifolia and applying glyphosate combined with the herbicides chlorimuron-ethyl, carfentrazone, bentazon, sulfentrazone and <b>flumioxazin.</b> The interactions were additive for the weeds I. grandifolia and C. benghalensis but the herbicides <b>flumioxazin,</b> sulfentrazone and carfentrazone sprayed alone and in mixture with glyphosate gave better control results. The interaction of glyphosate with sulfentrazone was antagonic in R. brasiliensis, whereas the glyphosate mixed with other herbicides was additive; however, the treatments using glyphosate and chlorimuron-ethyl or <b>flumioxazin</b> were more efficient in weed control. In A. hybridus, the best control results were glyphosate and carfentrazone alone and glyphosate mixed with <b>flumioxazin,</b> sulfentrazone, chlorimuron-ethyl and bentazon, all additives.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this work was to develop and utilize a rapid, {{small-scale}} primary screening method to evaluate the activity of a recently registered aquatic herbicide, <b>flumioxazin,</b> against 23 native emergent plant species and five invasive emergent species. BACKGROUND: In evaluating potential use patterns of new aquatic herbicides, {{it is important to}} determine concentrations that impact target as well as non-target vegetation. The recently registered aquatic herbicide <b>flumioxazin</b> is efficacious against the floating weeds water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) and giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta Mitchell) (Richardson et al. 2008) as well as the submersed species hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle) (Mudge and Haller 2006) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) (Getsinger et al. 2011). These species are often found in close proximity to or intermixed with native emergent vegetation and information on the impact of <b>flumioxazin</b> to most emergent plant species is limited. Information regarding the selectivity of <b>flumioxazin</b> (and other aquatic herbicides) will help resource managers decide which herbicides, use rates, and timing of application are most appropriate to reduce injury to the native emergent species present. This work has become increasingly relevant as research conducted last year demonstrated a potential selective use pattern for <b>flumioxazin</b> in areas where water lettuce is intermixed with emergent species (Netherlan...|$|E

The trial was installed ar complete randomized block designing, with 11 treatments: lactofen (96 g ha- 1); lactofen (192 g ha- 1); carfentrazone - ethyl (8 g ha- 1); carfentrazone - ethyl (12 g ha- 1); <b>flumioxazin</b> (25 g ha- 1); <b>flumioxazin</b> (50 g ha- 1); lactofen + <b>flumioxazin</b> (96 + 25 g ha- 1); lactofen + <b>flumioxazin</b> (192 + 50 g ha- 1); nicosulfuron (8 g ha- 1); nicosulfuron (40 g ha- 1) and a check without herbicide. The treatments were applied at 30 days after the corn emergence. It were evaluated the effects of the treatments in the height, dry biomass and productivity of the corn and, also, in the dry biomass of the B. ruziziensis. The herbicides <b>flumioxazin,</b> lactofen and carfentrazone-ethyl didn´t present potential to be used in post-emergence in this integrated system, due to low selectivity for corn.

Ten rates of each herbicide were evaluated for each soil in pots, with five replications per treatment. Herbicide rates tested and the amount of soil per pot varied with the type of soil being evaluated. The soil moisture content was maintained at soil moisture capacity with simulated rainfalls. The soil type, its physical-chemical properties, and mainly its organic carbon content affected the activity rate of both herbicides. For <b>flumioxazin,</b> the soils with the highest organic carbon content presented the highest values of I 50, which means, greater adsorption of the herbicide. Meanwhile, for metribuzin, the activity rate was affected by the pH and the organic carbon content of the different soils tested.

The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design in a split plot scheme, with four replications. Four herbicides were tested: paraquat (400 g a. i. ha - 1), glufosinate ammonium (400 g a. i. ha - 1), glyphosate (720 g a. i. ha - 1), <b>flumioxazin</b> (30 g a. i. ha - 1) and a control without herbicide application.

Vários fatores dificultam o controle dessa espécie em condições de pastagem natural. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o controle de capim-annoni- 2 por meio de herbicidas aplicados em pré-emergência que possam apresentar seletividade de posição no solo à pastagem nativa. Dois experimentos foram realizados neste estudo. O primeiro foi conduzido em casa de vegetação, onde sementes de capim-annoni- 2 foram semeadas em vasos. O delineamento utilizado foi o completamente casualizado com seis repetições. Os herbicidas avaliados foram alachlor, ametryne, ametryne + tebuthiuron, atrazine, clomazone, diuron, <b>flumioxazin,</b> imazaquin, mesotrione, metribuzin, oxadiazon, S-metolachlor, sulfentrazone, {{terbuthylazine}} e trifluralin. Todos os produtos controlaram satisfatoriamente o capim-annoni- 2. O segundo experimento foi conduzido em campo nativo com alta infestação de capim-annoni- 2, em delineamento de blocos completamente casualizados, em esquema de parcelas subsubdivididas. Nas parcelas principais foram alocados os tratamentos de manejo da vegetação em antecedência a aplicação dos herbicidas: fogo técnico e roçada em altura alta e baixa; nas subparcelas, as doses dos herbicidas: 75 e 100 % da dose de rótulo; e, nas subsubparcelas, os herbicidas atrazine, <b>flumioxazin,</b> mesotrione, S-metolachlor, sulfentrazone, trifluralin e testemunha não tratada. Nenhum dos herbicidas testados controlou efetivamente o capim-annoni- 2 em campo, provavelmente devido à grande presença de plantas perenizadas. No entanto, os efeitos dos herbicidas foram mais pronunciados quando associados a fogo técnico e roçada baixa.

Several factors have limited its management in these areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate South African lovegrass control using pre-emergent herbicides safe to the native pasture by applying soil position selectivity. Two experiments were evaluated in this study. The first was conducted in a greenhouse, and South African lovegrass seeds were sown in plastic pots. The herbicides evaluated were alachlor, ametryne, ametryne + tebuthiuron, atrazine, clomazone, diuron, <b>flumioxazin,</b> imazaquin, mesotrione, metribuzin, oxadiazon, S-metolachlor, sulfentrazone, terbuthylazine and trifluralin. All products successfully controlled lovegrass. The second experiment was conducted on native pastures highly infested with South African lovegrass, arranged in a split-split-plot design. In the main plots, the following vegetation management methods were allocated before herbicide application: prescribed burning, and high and low cutting; in the split-plots, the herbicide doses: 75 and 100 % of the label rate; and in the split-split-plots, the herbicide doses: atrazine, <b>flumioxazin,</b> mesotrione, S-metolachlor, sulfentrazone, trifluralin and the untreated-check control.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyJ. Anita DilleIntegrated weed {{management}} (IWM) is {{an ecological}} approach to weed control that reduces dependence on herbicides through understanding of weed biology and involves using multiple weed control measures including cultural, chemical, mechanical and biological methods. The critical period of weed control is {{the duration of}} the crop life cycle in which it must be kept weed-free to prevent yield loss from weed interference. Eight experiments were conducted throughout Kansas between October 2010 and June 2012 to identify this period in winter wheat grown under dryland and irrigated conditions. Impact of henbit and downy brome density on winter wheat yields were evaluated on four farmer’s fields with natural populations and on a research station with overseeded populations. Henbit density up to 156 plants m- 2 did not affect winter wheat yield, while downy brome at a density of 40 plants m- 2 reduced yield by 33 and 13 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In the presence of downy brome, winter wheat should be kept weed-free approximately 30 to 45 days after planting to prevent yield loss; otherwise, weeds need to be removed immediately following release from winter dormancy to prevent yield loss due to existing weed populations. <b>Flumioxazin</b> and pyroxasulfone are herbicides registered for use in winter wheat, soybean and corn for control of broadleaf and grass weeds. <b>Flumioxazin</b> and pyroxasulfone were evaluated for plant response to localized herbicide exposure to roots, shoots, or both roots and shoots utilizing a novel technique. Two weed species, ivyleaf morningglory and shattercane, as well as two crops, wheat and soybean, were evaluated for injury after localized exposures. The location and expression of symptoms from the <b>flumioxazin</b> and pyroxasulfone herbicides were determined to be the shoot of seedling plants. The utilization of preemergence herbicides in winter wheat is not a common practice, although application may protect winter wheat from early season yield losses as determined by the critical weed-free period. Kansas wheat growers should evaluate the presence and density of weed species to determine which weed management strategy is most advantageous to preserving winter wheat yield...|$|E

Os tratamentos avaliados foram: glyphosate (1, 20 kg ha- 1 e. a.), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 02 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 18 kg ha- 1), fomesafen (0, 25 kg ha- 1), <b>flumioxazin</b> (0, 025 kg ha- 1), imazethapyr (0, 10 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) mais lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) mais fomesafen (0, 125 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1) mais fomesafen (0, 125 kg ha- 1), as misturas de glyphosate (0, 60 kgha- 1) com chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), fomesafen (0, 125 kg ha- 1), <b>flumioxazin</b> (0, 0125 kg ha- 1), imazethapyr (0, 05 kg ha- 1) e uma testemunha sem aplicação de herbicida. No experimento com C. benghalensis, testou-se também a aplicação seqüencial de glyphosate (0, 96 mais 0, 72 kg ha- 1 e. a.). A associação de ghyphosate a herbicidas utilizados em soja convencional ocasionou danos visuais às plantas de soja. Em alguns casos, como nas misturas de glyphosate com lactofen e glyphosate com <b>flumioxazin,</b> os sintomas foram severos, com necroses e pontos cloróticos nas folhas. Mesmo assim, essa fitointoxicação não influenciou no desenvolvimento vegetativo e reprodutivo da soja. A mistura de glyphosate a outros herbicidas, assim como a sua aplicação seqüencial, não foram eficazes no controle de C. benghalensis, nas doses testadas e quando as plantas estavam no estádio de 4 a 6 folhas totalmente expandidas. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate phytotoxicity effects of herbicides applied during post-emergence, either alone or in mixture with other chemicals in transgenic glyphosate-tolerant soybean (cv.

Two experiments were carried out from January to May 2006, in pots, under uncontrolled conditions, at Plant Protection Department of UNESP, Jaboticabal (SP), Brazil. The following herbicides were used: glyphosate (1, 20 kg a. e. ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 02 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 018 kg ha- 1), fomesafen (0, 25 kg ha- 1), <b>flumioxazin</b> (0, 025 kg ha- 1), imazethapyr (0, 10 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) plus lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) plus fomesafen (0, 125 kg ha- 1) and lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1) plus fomesafen (0, 125 kg ha- 1). It was also used the glyphosate (0, 60 kg a. e. ha- 1) in mixture with chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), fomesafen (0, 125 kg ha- 1), <b>flumioxazin</b> (0, 0125 kg ha- 1) and imazethapyr (0, 05 kg ha- 1) and a no treated control. Also the sequential application of glyphosate (0, 96 plus 0, 72 kg a. e. ha- 1) was used in the experiment with C. benghalensis. The association of glyphosate and conventional soybean herbicides caused soybean injury.

By becoming a species sown as a crop, {{it is necessary to}} control the weeds that coexist with showy crotalaria. This change in the use of this crop creates the possibility of this specie becoming a weed. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential use of herbicides applied in preemergence and postemergence of C. spectabilisfor different purposes (control of volunteer and selectivity plants). Three experiments were installed in a greenhouse (two with herbicides applied in preemergence - in soils with distinct textural categories; and one experiment with herbicides applied in postemergence). The results of the experiments with herbicides applied in preemergence showed that: amicarbazone, atrazine, diuron, metribuzin, prometryn, fomesafen and sulfentrazone showed effectiveness for control of C. spectabilis in clayey soil. Besides these, <b>flumioxazin</b> and isoxaflutole also showed potential to be used in the control of showy crotalaria in soils with loam texture.

The combination of chlorimuron + rimsulfuron did not provide sufficient efficacy on the winter annual grass species little barley and annual bluegrass. Factors contributing the sub-lethal activity include: 1) a relatively low inherent sensitivity of the species to these herbicides, 2) a significant reduction in herbicide efficacy with increases in weed plant height, and 3) a lack of herbicide enhancement with more aggressive foliar adjuvants. The tank-mixture of glyphosate with chlorimuron + rimsulfuron was frequently necessary to achieve a maximum herbicide activity above 90 % on annual bluegrass and little barley. Optimum GAT herbicide treatments including chlorimuron + rimsulfuron + <b>flumioxazin</b> in field experiments provided the greatest control of horseweed and common waterhemp in glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant populations. The addition of chlorimuron + rimsulfuron to glyphosate and 2, 4 -D improved horseweed control above glyphosate and 2, 4 -D applied alone even as weed height increased with applications made closer to soybean planting. However, removal of competitive vegetation with herbicide combinations including chlorimuron + rimsulfuron selected for emergence of ALS-resistant common waterhemp. Inclusion of <b>flumioxazin</b> with chlorimuron + rimsulfuron was beneficial for control of common waterhemp when applied 7 days before planting. However, chlorimuron + rimsulfuron + <b>flumioxazin</b> provided only 80 % control of common waterhemp in a glyphosate-resistant population which demonstrates opportunity for improvement in herbicide concepts enabled by Optimum GAT. Grain yield of Optimum GAT soybean was greatest for herbicide treatments which provided effective weed management throughout the growing season which were the herbicide treatments applied the closest to soybean planting (7 days before planting). 	Optimum GAT herbicide concepts for corn include chlorimuron + thifensulfruon + tribenuron, chlorimuron + rimsulfuron, and rimsulfuron + tribenuron + mesotrione. These herbicides provided similar to slightly increased control of annual morningglory (Ipomoea spp.) in comparison to glyphosate alone. The addition of atrazine increased the consistency of control of annual morningglory for any herbicide treatment with additional residual activity at 28 days after treatment. 	Optimum GAT enabled herbicide concepts can improve control of some problematic weed species, including some glyphosate-resistant weed populations, compared to current herbicide tactics that rely primarily on glyphosate for weed control in commercial glyphosate-resistant soybean and corn. However, the integration of postemergence soybean herbicides beyond the ALS chemistry is necessary to provide a broader spectrum of weed control when considering the challenges of managing both glyphosate- and ALS-resistant weed species that are becoming more frequent in commercial fields...|$|E

Glyphosate has been used extensively to control Palmer amaranth but control has become difficult. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate various herbicide treatments for Palmer amaranth control in established alfalfa, (2) confirm the presence and scope of glyphosate-resistance in common waterhemp and Palmer amaranth populations in eastern Kansas, and (3) to characterize glyphosate-resistance in two Palmer amaranth populations from south central Kansas. Residual Palmer amaranth control in alfalfa varied among herbicide treatments. The best late season Palmer amaranth control was accomplished with sequential treatments that included <b>flumioxazin</b> at 140 g ha- 1 or diuron at 2, 690 g ha- 1 as dormant applications followed by a between cutting treatment of <b>flumioxazin</b> at 70 g ha- 1, which was still providing 85 to 96 % control in late summer.

Foram avaliados tratamentoscompostos por duas aplicações sequenciais de dessecação de manejo: a primeira com a misturaem tanque de glyphosate+ 2, 4 -D e a segunda por misturas em tanque contendo glyphosate e umou mais herbicidas com atividade residual no solo (chlorimuron-ethyl, <b>flumioxazin</b> e diclosulam). Avaliou-se o efeito dos tratamentos no controle das plantas de buva com altura superior a ≥ 20 cm(20 a 40 cm) e plantas com altura menor a < 20 cm(3 a 19 cm) e o efeito residual dos herbicidassobre os novos fluxos de emergência de corda-de-viola e de guanxuma até o fechamento daentrelinha da soja. A semeadura da soja ocorreu cinco dias após a segunda aplicação sequencial. Uma única aplicação de glyphosate + 2, 4 -D foi suficiente para controlar a buva com altura inferiora 20 cm. Para plantas de buva maiores que 20 cm, a mistura de chlorimuron-ethyl ou diclosulamao glyphosate na segunda aplicação sequencial de manejo evitou a ocorrência de rebrotas,sem, contudo, eliminar as mesmas. Os tratamentos de manejo com atividade residual no solo(chlorimuron-ethyl, <b>flumioxazin,</b> chlorimuron-ethyl+flumioxazin e diclosulam) foram eficazes nasupressão do desenvolvimento de corda-de-viola e guanxuma durante o ciclo da cultura da soja.  Burndown systems with residual activity for fallow areas infested with fleabaneAbstractThis work aimed at evaluating the burndown efficiency of sequential applications of herbicides onConyza spp. in areas that remained in fallow during the winter, as well as at monitoring the residualeffect of herbicides in soil on weed control within soybean cycle. The experiment was carried outin a field where soybean was the previous summer crop and that remained non-cultivated duringthe winter. All herbicide treatments were composed by two burndown sequential applications: thefirst by spraying a tank mixture of glyphosate+ 2, 4 -D and the second by tank mixtures composed byglyphosate plus one or more herbicides with residual activity in the soil (chlorimuron-ethyl, flumioxazinand diclosulam). Evaluations included the burndown efficiency on emerged fleabane (plants ≥ 20 cm and plants < 20 cm) and the residual effect of herbicides on the new fluxes of morningglory andsida. Soybean was sowed five days after the second burndown application. One single applicationof glyphosate+ 2, 4 -D was sufficient to control completely fleabane plants < 20 cm. For plants ≥ 20 cm,tank mixtures of glyphosate plus either chlorimuron-ethyl or diclosulam in the second applicationprevented the occurrence of fleabane regrowth, without however eliminate them. Treatmentscontaining herbicides with residual activity in soil (chlorimuron-ethyl, <b>flumioxazin,</b> chlorimuronethyl+flumioxazin and diclosulam) were in suppressing the development of morningglory and sida...|$|E
40|$|In the Central Coast of California, USA, {{wine grape}} growers are making efforts to {{identify}} weed control practices that promote biodiversity in their vineyards while maintaining yields. A field {{study was conducted}} in Paso Robles, CA in 2006 and 2007 evaluating the effect on Zinfandel grape-vine growth and production, groundcover plant, and ground dwelling arthropod communities of five weed control practices: 1) <b>flumioxazin,</b> 2) simazine, 3) cultivation, 4) cover crop, and 5) untreated control. The herbicide treatments had the lowest weed biomass followed by the cultivation, being approximately 10 and 2 times lower than the weed biomass of either the cover crop or untreated control treatments respectively. However, the differences in grape yield were not as evident. In 2006, a rainy year, the herbicides and cultivation treatments did not differ in grape yield, but the cover crop and untreated control had a reduction of approximately 20...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the environmental fate of herbicides (acetochlor, 2, 4 -D, diuron, clomazone, thidiazuron, paraquat, simazine, fluazifo-p-butil, clethodim, oxufluorfen, <b>flumioxazin,</b> carfentrazone-ethyl, ametrina, trifluralin and MSMA) in cotton, coffee and citrus cultivation areas, applying the level I fugacity model. The methodology basically used the chemical and physical characteristics of the pesticides, environmental compartments and the fugacity equations. The preliminary evaluation of risk of contamination due to the use of these pesticides on the cultures studied was carried out swiftly, based on the chemical and physical properties of these products as the level I fugacity model was applied. For most of the herbicides evaluated, the water compartment was the most vulnerable. The prediction evaluation study using fugacity level I was found to be a relevant tool for the environmental fate of the herbicides studied for cotton, coffee and citrus cultures...|$|E
40|$|Information {{is limited}} {{concerning}} {{the impact of}} delaying applications of pesticides after solution preparation on efficacy. Experiments were conducted to determine weed control when diclosulam, dimethenamid-P, <b>flumioxazin,</b> fomesafen, imazethapyr, pendimethalin, and S-metolachlor were applied preemergence the day of solution preparation or 3, 6, and 9 days after solution preparation. Herbicide solutions were applied {{on the same day}} regardless of when prepared. Control of broadleaf signalgrass, common lambsquarters, entireleaf morningglory, and Palmer amaranth by these herbicides was not reduced regardless of when herbicide solutions were prepared. Surprisingly entireleaf morningglory control by all herbicides increased when herbicide application was delayed by 9 days. In separate experiments, control of broadleaf signalgrass by clethodim, common ragweed by glyphosate and lactofen, entireleaf morningglory by lactofen, Italian rye grass by glyphosate and paraquat, and Palmer amaranth by atrazine, dicamba, glufosinate, glyphosate, imazethapyr, lactofen, and 2, 4 -D was affected more by increase in weed size due to delayed application than the time between solution preparation and application...|$|E
40|$|Annual morningglories (Ipomoea Spp) are {{difficult}} to control with existing cultural and herbicide practices in cotton. In 2002, six studies were conducted in Acala cotton evaluating herbicides for control of tall annual morningglory (Ipomoea purpurea). The first study evaluated Roundup Weather Max (MON 78270) with different tank mixes, the second study evaluated CGA 362622 (trifloxysulfuron) with different tank mixes sprayed over-the-top and directed, the third study evaluated different glyphosate formulations, the fourth study evaluated Shark (carfentrazone-ethyl), Valor (<b>flumioxazin),</b> and Harvade (dimethipin) with different tank mixes, the fifth and sixth studies compared Goal 4 F and the Goal 2 XL formulations (oxyfluorfen) with different application methods for control of tall annual morningglory. Herbicide combinations were most effective, but needed two applications. Both formulations of Goal caused significant injury. These studies showed that most treatments with two applications helped to reduce tall annual morningglory but complete control was not achieved using the post-directed herbicides in these studies...|$|E
