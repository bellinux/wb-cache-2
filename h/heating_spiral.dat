40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{numerical}} method {{was developed to}} investigate the heat transfer performance of a <b>spiral</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. In the <b>spiral</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, two long metal strips are wound concentrically to create hot-flow channel and cold-flow channel. The flow of the two fluids through a <b>spiral</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger was considered counter-current, the hot-flow circulates counter-clockwise and the cold-flow circulates clockwise. The upper surface, lower surface and outer-most side of the <b>spiral</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger were assumed to be insulated. A heat transfer effectiveness and an exergy recovery effectiveness were defined and evaluated based on the calculated non-dimensional temperatures of the two counter-flow fluids in the heat exchanger. At small NTU value, the heat transfer effectiveness value initially increases with the NTU value; while at higher NTU values, after reaching the maximum heat transfer effectiveness, the heat transfer effectiveness value starts to slightly decrease. For a set of Nt and NTU values, the heat transfer effectiveness reaches a minimum value at C*= 1. 0. As the C* approaches zero or infinity, the heat transfer effectiveness would approach the maximum. Conversely, {{for a set of}} NTU, Nt, inlet temperature of hot flow and cold flow, and overall pressure drop factor values, as the C* approaches zero or infinity, the exergy recovery effectiveness of the <b>spiral</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger is at the minimum. The exergy recovery effectiveness reaches a maximum as the C* value nears 1. 0. The result also shows that, at small values of Nt (Nt < 40), the heat transfer effectiveness value and the exergy recovery effectiveness value slightly increase with the Nt value; while these two values remain almost the same when the number of turns is larger than 40 turns.

40|$|Circumplanetary disks (CPDs) {{control the}} growth of planets, supply {{material}} for satellites to form, and provide observational signatures of young forming planets. We have carried out two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling to study CPDs, and suggested a new mechanism to drive the disk accretion. Two spiral shocks are present in CPDs, excited by the central star. We find that spiral shocks can at least contribute to, if not dominate the angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in CPDs. Meanwhile, dissipation and <b>heating</b> by <b>spiral</b> shocks have a positive feedback on shock-driven accretion itself. As the disk is <b>heated</b> up by <b>spiral</b> shocks, the shocks become more open, leading to more efficient angular momentum transport. This shock driven accretion is, on the other hand, unsteady on a timescale of months/years due to production and destruction of vortices in disks. After being averaged over time, a quasi-steady accretion is reached from the planet's Hill radius {{all the way to}} the planet surface, and the disk α-coefficient characterizing angular momentum transport due to spiral shocks is ∼ 0. 001 - 0. 02. The disk surface density ranges from 10 to 1000 g cm^- 2 in our simulations, which is at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the "minimum mass sub-nebula" model used to study satellite formation; instead it is more consistent with the "gas-starved" satellite formation model. Finally, we calculate the millimeter flux emitted by CPDs at ALMA and EVLA wavelength bands and predict the flux for several recently discovered CPD candidates, which suggests that ALMA is capable of discovering these accreting CPDs.

Fixed bed and fluidized bed are typical installations (Schmidt and Kaminsky 2001; Shen and Zhang 2003; Liu et al. 2008), which are generally considered suitable for laboratory research. Rotary barrel device (or rotary kiln) is an optional scheme for continuous processing of materials (Fortuna et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2006; Sun et al. 2017). The rotary barrel device usually fixes up the heating unit on the outer side, heating the material through heat conduction. The whole equipment is usually larger and the heating may not be efficient. On the other hand, continuous feeding and discharging are not very convenient because of the rotary kiln structure characteristic.

40|$|We re-examine the age-velocity {{dispersion}} relation in {{the solar}} neighborhood using improved stellar age estimates {{that are based on}} Hipparcos parallaxes and recent stellar evolution calculations.

However, at an age of 10 Gyrs there is an abrupt increase in the stellar velocity dispersions. To explain the abrupt increase (by almost a factor of 2) in dispersions we propose that the Milky Way suffered a minor merger 10 Gyrs ago that created the thick disk. The quiescent phase is consistent with inefficient heating caused by scattering from tightly wound transient spiral structure.

40|$|The work {{reported}} {{here is the}} preliminary analysis of two-phase Thermosyphon heat transfer performance with various alkali metals. Thermosyphon is a device for transporting heat from one point to another with quite extraordinary properties. Heat transport occurs via evaporation and condensation, and the heat transport fluid is re-circulated by gravitational force. With this mode of heat transfer, the thermosyphon has the capability to transport heat at high rates over appreciable distances, virtually isothermally and without any requirement for external pumping devices. For process heat, intermediate heat exchangers (IHX) are required to transfer heat from the NGNP to the hydrogen plant in {{the most efficient way}} possible. The production of power at higher efficiency using Brayton Cycle, and hydrogen production requires both heat at higher temperatures (up to 1000 oC) and high effectiveness compact heat exchangers to transfer heat to either the power or process cycle. The purpose for selecting a compact heat exchanger is to maximize the heat transfer surface area per volume of heat exchanger; this has the benefit of reducing heat exchanger size and heat losses. The IHX design requirements are governed by the allowable temperature drop between the outlet of the NGNP (900 oC, based on the current capabilities of NGNP), and the temperatures in the hydrogen production plant. <b>Spiral</b> <b>Heat</b> Exchangers (SHE’s) have superior heat transfer characteristics, and are less susceptible to fouling.

The <b>spiral</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger possesses some advantages over most of commercialheat exchangers. For instances, in a limited space, it can provide a larger heat transfer area. Its flow pattern can be arranged to be counter-flow, thus the heat transfer is more effective. Its two streams flow between two spirals, due to flow disturbance, a larger convective heattransfer coefficient between the flow and solid wall can be achieved. Consequently, theoverall heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger is also larger. In addition, the heatexchange can be made of stainless steel.

The temperature distributions of the two flows will be solved using anumerical method and the result will yield the ε-NTU relation of the heat exchanger.

2500|$|The compact central {{object is}} {{consuming}} the companion star which rapidly loses mass into an accretion disc formed around the [...] central object. The accretion disc {{is subject to}} extreme <b>heating</b> as it <b>spirals</b> into the primary and this heating causes the accretion disc to give off intense X-rays and opposing jets of hot hydrogen along the axis of rotation, {{above and below the}} plane of the accretion disc. [...] The material in the jets travels at 26% of the speed of light., pp.2324; , p.508. [...] The companion star presumably had lower mass than the original primary object and was therefore longer lived. [...] Estimates for its mass range from 3, p.25 to 30 solar masses. [...] The primary and secondary orbit each other at a very close distance in stellar terms, with an orbital period of 13.1 days., p.510.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{necessity}} to intensify {{the process of}} heat transfer in the heat pump is justified. The possibility of heat pumps using for liquid cooling in the engine pipe is shown. The new heat pump design of spiral type with LED ring semiconductor structures, powered by magnetic induction is proposed. The efficiency of LED ring semiconductor structures that operate at low temperatures due to {{the difference in the}} levels of energy charges in p- and n-regions isrevealed. The mathematical model for the electrical and thermal parameters calculating of energy-efficient thermoelectric heat pump of the spiral type is developed. The diagram of coolant temperature dependence at the outlet of energy-efficient thermoelectric <b>heat</b> pump of <b>spiral</b> type on the supply current is built. The efficiency of <b>spiral</b> type thermoelectric <b>heat</b> pump application for cooling of the internal combustion engine is proven.  </p...|$|R
