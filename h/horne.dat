5|$|<b>Horne</b> {{has been}} the subject of two biographies, Norman Hackforth's Solo for <b>Horne</b> in 1976 and Barry Johnston's Round Mr Horne: The Life of Kenneth <b>Horne</b> in 2006. In 1998 Ernie Wise {{unveiled}} a blue plaque to <b>Horne</b> at BBC Broadcasting House. Editions of Beyond Our Ken and Round the <b>Horne</b> are regularly broadcast on the digital radio service BBC Radio 4 Extra, and by 2006 over half a million copies of tapes and CDs of Round the <b>Horne</b> had been sold by the BBC. In a 2002 survey conducted by the BBC to find listeners' favourite British comedian, <b>Horne</b> appeared third, behind Tony Hancock and Spike Milligan.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the planned}} fifth series of Round the <b>Horne</b> began recording, <b>Horne</b> {{died of a}} heart attack while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers' and Directors' Awards; Round the <b>Horne</b> could not {{continue}} without him and was withdrawn. The series has been regularly re-broadcast since his death. A 2002 BBC radio survey to find listeners' favourite British comedian placed <b>Horne</b> third, behind Tony Hancock and Spike Milligan.|$|E
5|$|Charles Kenneth <b>Horne,</b> {{generally}} {{known as}} Kenneth <b>Horne,</b> (27 February 1907– 14 February 1969) was an English comedian and businessman. He {{is perhaps best}} remembered {{for his work on}} three BBC Radio series: Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh (1944–54), Beyond Our Ken (1958–64) and Round the <b>Horne</b> (1965–68).|$|E

50|$|In 1849, <b>Horne's</b> began {{operations}} and {{soon became a}} leading Pittsburgh department store. In 1879, it opened a seven-story landmark {{which was the first}} department store in the city's downtown. In 1972, Associated Dry Goods acquired <b>Horne's,</b> and ADG expanded operations of <b>Horne's</b> to several stores in suburban malls throughout the Pittsburgh region as well as in Erie, Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. In December 1986, <b>Horne's</b> was acquired by a local investor group following ADG's acquisition by May Department Stores. By 1994, Federated Department Stores acquired the remaining ten <b>Horne's</b> stores and merged them with its Lazarus division, completely ceasing all operations of any store under the <b>Horne's</b> name.|$|R
5|$|Later that evening, Benjamin <b>Horne</b> {{is meeting}} with Mr. Tojamura at The Great Northern. Mr. Tojamura gives <b>Horne</b> {{a check for}} $5 million to {{purchase}} the lands of the Packard Sawmill. Immediately after accepting the check, Sheriff Truman, Deputy Hawk, and Agent Cooper enter Horne's office. Truman arrests <b>Horne</b> for murder. <b>Horne</b> attempts to flee but is restrained and handcuffed. At the Palmer home, a severely impaired Sarah Palmer crawls down the stairs, crying to Leland for help.

5|$|On 27 February 2007 (Horne's centenary), BBC Radio 4 {{broadcast}} a half-hour documentary tribute entitled Sound the <b>Horne,</b> hosted by Jimmy Carr. The following year, on 18 September, another Radio 4 documentary was broadcast, Thoroughly Modest Mollie, {{which focused on}} Horne's frequent ghost-writer, Mollie Millest, and featured Jonathan Rigby again as <b>Horne..</b> Rigby reprised the role yet again in a new stage show, devised by Barry Took's widow Lyn, called Round the <b>Horne</b> – Unseen and Uncut, which toured in 2008 and 2009. Also in 2009, an unbroadcast pilot script written by <b>Horne</b> and Millest in 1966 was produced by Radio 4. Called Twice Ken is Plenty and intended as a two-man showcase for <b>Horne</b> and Kenneth Williams, the 21st-century version, broadcast on 1 September 2009, was performed by Rigby and, as Williams, Robin Sebastian.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{learns that}} a new life {{insurance}} policy has been taken out in her name, by Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Benjamin <b>Horne</b> (Richard Beymer). Martell had been planning with <b>Horne</b> to burn down Packard's sawmill in order to cheaply purchase the land it occupies. Packard speaks to <b>Horne</b> over the telephone, cooperating with the sawmill arson, but arranging to burn it down with Martell inside. As Packard hangs up, it is seen that the recently paroled killer Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) has been beside her.|$|E

50|$|In 1972, Associated Dry Goods (ADG) {{acquired}} <b>Horne's,</b> and ADG expanded {{operations of}} <b>Horne's</b> to several stores in suburban malls throughout the Pittsburgh region {{as well as}} in Erie, Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. In December 1986, <b>Horne's</b> was acquired by a local investor group following ADG's acquisition by May Department Stores. The local buyout was part of May's divesting of the <b>Horne's</b> chain, since May was already the owner of cross-town rival Kaufmann's.|$|R
50|$|Frederick III, Prince of Salm-Kyrburg (Frederick John Otto Francis Christian Philip; 1744-1794) was {{the prince}} of Salm-Kyrburg, <b>Hornes</b> and Overijse, Gemen and Count of Solre-le-Château. He was the eldest son of Philip Joseph, Prince of Salm-Kyrburg and Princess Maria Theresa of <b>Hornes,</b> and he grew up at the French court. Through his mother, the eldest {{daughter}} of Maximilian, Prince of <b>Hornes,</b> he inherited all the possessions of the <b>Hornes</b> family. He held the title from 1779 to 1794.|$|R
5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding <b>Horne</b> (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick <b>Horne</b> of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry <b>Horne,</b> having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 <b>Horne</b> {{suffered}} a stroke and gave up his business dealings to focus on his entertainment work. He was the anchor figure in Beyond Our Ken, which also featured Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and Bill Pertwee. When the programme {{came to an end}} in 1964, the same cast recorded four series of the comedy Round the <b>Horne.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1982, Arrington's wife Grace died. Arrington married Harriet <b>Horne,</b> {{granddaughter of}} Alice Merrill <b>Horne,</b> in November 1983. Arrington {{continued}} on {{as director of}} the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History until 1986 and he retired in 1987. In 2005, the Institute was closed and the department's historians were returned to LDS Church Headquarters.|$|E
50|$|Eugene Maximillian, 1st Prince of <b>Hornes</b> (October 1, 1631 - March 10, 1709) {{was the son}} of Ambrosius, Count of <b>Hornes</b> and Marie Marguerite de Bailleul de Lesdaing. He {{was made}} a Prince of the Empire on October 19, 1677, and his domain {{elevated}} to the Principality of <b>Hornes.</b> It was an enclave of Liege. He was married to Princess Anne Marie Jeanne of Croÿ and had one son, Philippe Emanuel, Prince of <b>Hornes.</b> He died 14 October 1718.|$|R
50|$|<b>Horne's</b> primary {{challenge}} came {{up short}} in June, 2016, although she polled stronger than expected with Sanford receiving 56% of the vote to <b>Horne's</b> 44%.|$|R
50|$|Well beyond Pittsburgh, <b>Horne's</b> {{became a}} part of popular culture. Artist Andy Warhol worked at a <b>Horne's</b> {{location}} in the store's display department as a summer job in 1947.|$|R
5|$|Kenneth <b>Horne</b> {{was born}} Charles Kenneth <b>Horne</b> on 27 February 1907 at Ampthill Square, London. He was {{the seventh and}} {{youngest}} child of Silvester <b>Horne</b> and his wife, Katherine Maria neé Cozens-Hardy. Katherine's father was Herbert Cozens-Hardy, the Liberal MP for North Norfolk who became the Master of the Rolls in 1907 and Baron Cozens-Hardy on 1 July 1914. Silvester, a powerful orator, was a leading light in the Congregationalist movement, as minister at the Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road from 1903 and, from 1910, chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Between 1910 and 1914 he was the Liberal MP for Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1966, {{at the age}} of 59, <b>Horne</b> {{suffered}} a major heart attack. He was much weakened, and was unfit to work for three months. As a result, he did not appear in the Round the <b>Horne</b> Christmas special. He returned to work in January 1967 to record the third series.|$|E
5|$|Round the <b>Horne</b> ran to four series, {{broadcast}} in successive years, and finished in June 1968. Three {{weeks after the}} fourth series finished, the first episode of <b>Horne</b> A'Plenty was broadcast on ITV. In a sketch show format, and with Barry Took as script editor (and later producer), this {{was an attempt to}} translate the spirit of Round the <b>Horne</b> to television, although with different actors supporting Horne: Graham Stark, for example, substituted for Kenneth Williams and Sheila Steafel for Betty Marsden. The first six-part series ran from 22 June to 27 July 1968, the second (by which time ABC had become Thames Television) from 27 November to 1 January 1969.|$|E
5000|$|After only a {{few years}} of ownership, on April 30, 1969, Greyhound sold <b>Horne's</b> to Formco, who owned the [...] "Stand N' Snack" [...] chain. When Stand N' Snack {{acquired}} <b>Horne's</b> from Greyhound, the company had 19 franchised motor lodges. After the purchase, the headquarters of <b>Horne's</b> was moved to Topeka, Kansas, but it continued to operate as a separate entity from [...] "Stand N' Snack".|$|R
5000|$|By 1994, Federated Department Stores {{acquired}} the remaining ten <b>Horne's</b> stores and merged them with its Lazarus division, completely ceasing all operations of any store under the <b>Horne's</b> name. This caused some anger among Pittsburgh shoppers, as <b>Horne's</b> {{was the oldest}} store {{in the city and}} had been a 145-year-old Pittsburgh tradition. After its closure the company was often praised for surviving 145 years with only a maximum of 15 stores. Several former <b>Horne's</b> locations operating as Lazarus closed in 1998. Those that remained eventually became [...] "Lazarus-Macy's" [...] and in 2006 were joined with Kaufmann's in the nationwide Macy's consolidation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Horne's</b> also {{appeared}} in movies, including the Monroeville Mall location, which was shown in George A. Romero's 1978 movie Dawn of the Dead. The Pittsburgh flagship store {{was the site of}} the 1987 erotic thriller, Lady Beware, which starred Diane Lane as a window designer employed there. This was <b>Horne's</b> most notable appearance, as in addition to the location, the store's name appeared. Diane Lane's character worked at <b>Horne's</b> proudly.|$|R
5|$|Shortly thereafter, on 20 April, Ernest Avenue and Van <b>Horne</b> Avenue {{were closed}} to traffic at Woodbine.|$|E
5|$|Actress Sherilyn Fenn {{stated in}} a 2014 {{interview}} that the original idea came during the filming of Twin Peaks, as a spin-off film for her character of Audrey <b>Horne.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Many of <b>Horne's</b> plays feature young, often {{virginal}} women who, {{in their}} burgeoning sexuality, [...] "offer themselves up, {{with some degree}} of apprehension, for ravishment." [...] Actor George Cole, who appeared in the West Side run of A Public Mischief, wrote of <b>Horne's</b> style: [...] "Kenneth <b>Horne's</b> scripts were always carefully crafted to let the humour come naturally without being forced. He insisted that, in order to work properly, comedy should always be played straight".|$|R

5|$|By 1913 Silvester was {{suffering}} from continual poor health. He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914, and intended to resign his parliamentary seat. On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University, and then took the ferry to Toronto; as it entered the harbour, he collapsed and died, aged 49; <b>Horne</b> was aged seven at the time. From September that year <b>Horne</b> attended St George's School, Harpenden as a boarder—the seventh of the <b>Horne</b> children to attend the school. Although he was not strong academically, he developed into a good sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket, and during the summer holidays {{took part in the}} Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen's Club; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|During the evening, the 14th RWF {{launched}} a minor trench raid. On 8 July, {{this was supposed}} to develop into an attack on the southern tip of the wood. While the division prepared to launch a battalion-sized attack, XV Corps commander Lieutenant General Henry <b>Horne</b> ordered a smaller attack by a platoon. The day was spent in confusion; conflicting orders were issued and <b>Horne</b> travelled to the division to clarify his intentions. In the end, no attack was launched.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 <b>Horne</b> {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on a {{part-time}} training scheme. He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer in No. 911 (County of Warwick) Squadron, a barrage balloon unit in Sutton Coldfield, and was called up into the RAF full-time on the outbreak of war. In the initial months of the conflict—the Phoney War—Horne's duties were undemanding, and he formed a concert party from his friends and colleagues. In November 1940 {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant, and to squadron leader a year later. In early 1942, the BBC producer Bill McLurg asked whether the RAF station at which <b>Horne</b> was based could put on an edition of his programme Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. <b>Horne</b> was ordered to put on the show, and he made his broadcasting debut on 16 April 1942, as the compere. Although the standard of the talent on the show was not high, McLurg was impressed with Horne's presentation, especially the way he hosted the programme's quiz; he invited <b>Horne</b> to be the programme's regular quizmaster, a role the latter fulfilled on over fifty Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer quizzes over the next two years. In January 1943 {{he became one of the}} show's regular comperes and presented the entire show for the first time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Horne's</b> was a Southern-style {{restaurant}} chain located {{primarily in the}} Southeast and Southern United States along major highways. It was headquartered in Bayard, Florida. At the chain's peak there were over 60 <b>Horne's</b> locations, but today only one original restaurant remains. Many restaurant locations featured diner-style sit-down service as well as lodging, Texaco gas stations, gift shops, and an ice cream bar, creating a one-stop shop atmosphere. Since many locations were on highways, many <b>Horne's</b> restaurants were open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighting}} of the <b>Horne's</b> Christmas tree at the flagship store was a long-held holiday season tradition. The six-story electric tree occupied {{a place on}} the corner of the building at Penn Avenue and Stanwix Street and viewers would crowd the area for a show and the lighting. The tree is still displayed annually in the tradition of Pittsburgh's Light Up Night at the <b>Horne's</b> building. Crowds also eagerly awaited the Christmas window displays at <b>Horne's,</b> once part of the high competition among Pittsburgh's downtown stores for the attention of the Light Up Night visitors.|$|R
