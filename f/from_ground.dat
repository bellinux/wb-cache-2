5|$|The Syrians {{responded by}} {{launching}} about 100 fighter aircraft {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks from the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.|$|E

5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S.

Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E

5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{storage in}} the Pushkar Lake {{has been reduced}} alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the {{situation}} became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks {{near one of the}} upper ghats, fed by tube wells <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> water sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E
5|$|Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi {{is a source of}} fish including chambo (similar to bream) usipa (similar to sardine), and mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E

5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64E Apache has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches can request to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. UAVs can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E

50|$|The museum {{building}} {{was designed by}} {{a team led by}} Kris Yao those design was inspired by the cuestas commonly seen along Beiguan Coast. The museum adopts the geometric shapes of the cuestas where the roof protrudes <b>from</b> the <b>ground</b> at an angle of 20 degrees meeting a wall which rises <b>from</b> the <b>ground</b> at an angle of 70 degrees. Thus the building emerges <b>from</b> the <b>ground</b> in a similar fashion to those cuestas.|$|R
5|$|This British Empire victory, {{the first}} against the Ottoman Empire in the war, ensured {{the safety of}} the Suez Canal <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> attacks, and ended the Central Powers' ambitions of disrupting traffic through the canal by gaining control of the {{strategically}} important northern approaches to the Suez Canal. The pursuit by the Anzac Mounted Division which ended at Bir el Abd on 12 August began the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Thereafter, the Anzac Mounted Division supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade were on the offensive, pursuing the German and Ottoman army many miles across the Sinai Peninsula, reversing in a most emphatic manner the defeat suffered at Katia three months earlier.|$|E
5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
