5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen target many sharks {{for their}} jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely {{an object of}} {{commercial}} fishing, although its <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.|$|E
5|$|The milk {{is first}} carrot-red {{and becomes a}} maroon colour within 10 to 30minutes. The brittle and pale-yellowish <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> often infested with maggots. If cut or injured it becomes, as the milk, first carrot-red, then maroon and within hours dirty green. The fruit body smells harsh, fruit-like and first tastes mild, but then {{slightly}} resinous-bitter and nearly spicy or somewhat astringent.|$|E

50|$|The Mayo {{used the}} cactus as an herbal remedy. Pieces of the <b>flesh</b> <b>were</b> applied to wounds to inhibit bleeding. The cactus <b>flesh</b> <b>was</b> cooked in salted {{water and the}} {{solution}} was applied to infected wounds three times daily, followed by a sulfathiazole powder. The juice was consumed as an herbal tonic and to treat sore throat.|$|R
5|$|The sand whiting is {{a highly}} prized table fish often rated equal to the King George whiting, making it a common target for both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> white, tender and has a moist, low oil content composition, making it easily digestible. Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and {{has led to the}} development of farmed sand whiting.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are pale orange to {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are egg-shaped, measuring 20–24 by 14–16µm when mature, but smaller (14.5–19 by 9–10µm) in immature fruit bodies. They are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The cylindrical asci (spore-bearing cells) are 300–360 by 16–20µm with walls up to 1.5µm thick. Paraphyses measure 90–184 by 10–18.5µm (6–9µm thick if immature); they are hyaline, have a septum at the base, and comprise either {{one or two}} cells. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae measuring 3–9µm wide.|$|E

5|$|Khandoba is {{believed}} to be a kadak (fierce) deity, who causes troubles if not propitiated properly as per the family duties. Khandoba is worshipped with Turmeric (Bhandār), Bel fruit-leaves, onions and other vegetables. The deity is offered puran poli - a sweet or a simpler dish called bharit rodga of onion and brinjal. Mostly a vegetarian naivedya (offering of food) is offered to Khandoba in the temples, though most devotees consider him a non-vegetarian and a goat <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> offered to the deity outside the temple.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies sometimes have hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E
5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. It is highly {{regarded}} and can be quite expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E

5|$|The cap <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied {{to the surface of}} the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E

After he married Jane Foster in 1847 {{at the age}} of 22, they emigrated to Canada West.|$|R
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
50|$|A strong {{smell of}} {{decomposed}} <b>flesh</b> <b>was</b> also {{reported in the}} nearby village of Crowthorne, but {{this turned out to}} be rotten sheep.|$|R

5|$|The <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> reddish or purplish-brown {{with white}} flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E
5|$|The spore dust is olive to {{brownish}} olive. The spores are oval to somewhat -shaped, measuring 11–15μm long by 4.5–6.5μm wide. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap <b>flesh</b> <b>is</b> loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
