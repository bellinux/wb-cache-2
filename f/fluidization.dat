This type of reactor contains two banks of heat exchangers which remove heat; the remainder of which is removed by the products and recycled in the system. The formation of heavy waxes should be avoided, since they condense on the catalyst and form agglomerations. This leads to <b>fluidization.</b> Hence, risers are operated over 570nbsp&K.|$|E
2500|$|Ignimbrites {{deposited}} during eruptions of APVC volcanoes {{are formed}} by [...] "boiling over" [...] eruptions, where magma chambers containing viscous crystal-rich volatile-poor magmas partially empty in tranquil, non-explosive fashion. As a result, the deposits are massive and homogeneous and show few size segregation or <b>fluidization</b> features. Such eruptions have been argued to require external triggers to occur. There is a volume-dependent relationship between homogeneity of the eruption products and their volume; large volume ignimbrites have uniform mineralogical and compositional heterogeneity. Small volume ignimbrites often show gradation in composition. This pattern {{has been observed}} in other volcanic centres such as the Fish Canyon Tuff in the United States and the Toba ignimbrites in Indonesia.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} few {{fluidized}} beds were successfully applied into industrial processes, demand for more types of <b>fluidization</b> technology has rose to satisfy the growing industrial demand. The addition of vibratory mechanism to the fluidized bed in 1984 where Geldart showed that using mechanical vibrating sieve can improve the performance of fluidising small size of fine particles. These experiments are difficult to process these powders by fluidisation due to the unpredictable behaviours of particles. It was later found {{that it would be}} cheaper and more environmentally friendly by adding vibration into the <b>fluidization</b> process. This was then used as a starting point by many others for further <b>fluidization</b> research based on the effects of vibrations. Mujumdar (1988) devised two methods using vibration technic of <b>fluidization</b> for fluidizing hot-sensitive and paste-like materials. Yoshihide et al. (2003) studied the effect of vibration on fluidisation behavior and prediction of minimum fluidisation velocity. Kaliyaperumal et al. (2011) determined the effect of different vibration to the nano and sub-micro particles, those particles are hard to fluidise in the absence of mechanical vibration and have special properties.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fluidization</b> is the {{phenomenon}} by which solid particles are transported into a fluid like state through suspension in a gas or liquid. In fact, {{there is a}} simple and precise way to classify the various fluid-particle beds (Winaya et al., 2003; Souza-Santos, 2004; Basu, 2006). Most of the CFB operating and environmental characteristics are the direct results of the hydrodynamic behaviour. Numerous of searchers have studied the hydrodynamics of CFB (Yang, 1998; Basu, 2006; Rhodes, 2008; Scala, 2013). The <b>fluidization</b> {{is a function of}} several parameters such like the particles’ shape, size and density, velocity of the gas, bed's geometries etc. Kunii and Levenspiel (1991), Oka and Dekker (2004), and Souza-Santos (2004) defined the regimes of <b>fluidization</b> as described below: ...|$|E

50|$|The term voidage {{refers to}} the spacing between the materials. It is {{critical}} {{to know how the}} voidage behaviour of certain particle sizes affects the process in a vibrating fluidized bed as they are one of the key factors to be considered when designing and scaling up the vibrating fluidized bed from lab scale to industrial scale. From several experiments conducted, it was shown that vibration helps in the <b>fluidization</b> of particles as the axial and radial voidage distribution become more homogeneous. This is especially true for vibrating fluidized beds with large vibration amplitudes. It was also found that with increasing bed height, the layers of particles in the bed could be damped out by the vibration energy. Analysis of the wave propagation showed that its parameters are affected by the <b>fluidization</b> behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} <b>fluidization</b> of soil grains takes place during resonant vibration whereby the granular material constraining the stuck pipe {{is transformed into a}} fluidic state that offers little resistance to movement of bodies through the media.

5000|$|Pressure Loss Scenarios: If <b>fluidization</b> {{pressure}} is suddenly lost, {{the surface area}} of the bed may be suddenly reduced.

5000|$|<b>Fluidization</b> {{has many}} {{applications}} {{with the use}} of ion exchange particles for the purification and processing of many industrial liquid streams. Industries such as food & beverage, hydrometallurgical, water softening, catalysis, bio-based chemical etc. use ion exchange as a critical step in processing.
