25|$|Kalanimoku, an {{experienced}} military commander from earlier campaigns of Kamehameha <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> stationed on Kauai, and sent for reinforcements {{to search for}} Humehume.|$|E
500|$|... {{arrived at}} my Broadway studio in New York {{with a small}} bag of clothes and jewelery, and no entourage. Then, {{in front of the}} camera she was explosive, like a great model, but with her own unique style. She came over the next day to see some prints and the proofs, and there was shot after shot to choose from. We agreed on every choice and whittled it down to the album cover images. I had no idea what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> a party to." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{execution}} of Charles.—I {{told him of}} Gardiner’s new volume which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> reading. “Charles,” he said, “was no doubt a dreadful liar; Cromwell perhaps did not always tell the truth; Elizabeth was a tremendous liar.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{told that}} your servant was desired by {{you not to}} wait a minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good evening, sir," [...] said Mr Rubb. [...] "I am Mr Samuel Rubb. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> seeing Miss Mackenzie, on business. Good evening, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, Uncle Jake," [...] said John briskly. [...] "My {{cousin and}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{notified}} to expect you. We are both Carterets, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did I {{understand}} you {{that any of}} them were here?' added the other voice; 'for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> struck by the likeness of that boy opposite, talking to my sister, to poor Mr. Edward Underwood, as I remember him.' ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not enter}} the big, lonely room. I went to my own chamber, which, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> informed, was {{the best in the}} house. I sat down in an easy-chair by the open window. I looked up to the {{twinkling}} stars.|$|E
60|$|I thanked him; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{thinking}} of {{asking him to}} do that very thing, as in a couple of days, as he knew, we were going to sea, where all our troubles of every sort would be over at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{left him}} {{asleep in the}} dining-room. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> asking Miss McQuinch whether she thought you {{would give me a}} copy of this carte." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{real reason}} why I wish you to preach this sermon <b>is</b> because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{offering}} a fee to the head-waiter at our hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's this? Aye, aye, mistress, it's you, is it? You {{appear at}} a good time. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> hearing of you. Now! What do you want?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{released}} from one hundred hours, and I was weaker than I {{had ever been}} before. So weak was I that though my whole body was one mass of bruise and misery, nevertheless I scarcely was aware that I had a body.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{amounted}} {{to the same}} thing. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> telling her how I did the lake-hole today in two, {{and she said that}} in her opinion golf was a game for children with water on the brain who weren't athletic enough to play Animal Grab." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer smell--yes! Like bilge or a rank swamp. It was {{distinctly}} nauseating; when I {{came out}} I {{felt as if}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> going to be sick. I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of what I saw or felt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father and {{grandfather}} William have expected ye a little sooner. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{for a run}} round by Ewelease Stile and Hollow Hill to warm my feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your father," [...] was the {{deliberate}} reply, [...] "was {{killed in a}} railway accident, four days ago. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> notified of the fact by a cable from America." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A few," [...] said Psmith. [...] "One or {{two very}} {{entertaining}} fellows. Comrades Asher, Philpotts, and others. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{giving them a}} bite of lunch at the Knickerbocker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other man drily, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> married to a woman like Mrs. Leland, I figure I mightn't have been so willing to put myself {{in the way of}} a bullet. I'd have let {{somebody}} else make the first move and stayed at home with her." ...|$|E
60|$|The captain again {{placed a}} sheet of paper before me to {{communicate}} His determination to the prince. When I had finished the letter and took the sheet from the quire, I found {{on the opposite side of}} it the portrait which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> tracing. I was about to tear it off and give it to the chief.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{introduced}} to her shortly before her father's death, and have scarcely exchanged a dozen sentences with her. It {{is said that}} her father died in debt, but of course in regard to that I know nothing certainly. At parting, {{she told me that}} she meant to leave the coast and go to stay with a relative at the Cape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford {{friend of}} mine. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> telling him what a capital sitter you were, {{and now you}} have spoiled everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{glad to see}} you, Captain Stride," [...] she said, {{shaking hands}} with unfeminine heartiness. [...] "Have you been to see mother? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>having</b> a walk before--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{seen this}} fever out, and can {{dispose of the}} things here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> to Moy's office to see about {{getting rid of the}} lease." ...|$|R
60|$|I mean to say, {{all this}} had {{come as a}} {{complete}} surprise. In formulating the well-laid plan which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> putting into effect, the one contingency I had not budgeted for was that she might adhere to the sentiments which I expressed. I had braced myself for a gush of stormy emotion. I was expecting the tearful ticking off, the girlish recriminations {{and all the rest}} of the bag of tricks along those lines.|$|E
60|$|As soon as I judged it safe, {{and that}} was not before Burchell Fenn had talked himself back into his breath and a {{complete}} good humour, I proposed he should introduce me to the French officers, henceforth to become my fellow-passengers. There were two of them, it appeared, and my heart beat as I approached the door. The specimen of Perfidious Albion whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> studying gave me the stronger zest for my fellow-countrymen. I could have embraced them; I could have wept on their necks. And all the time I was going to a disappointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just at this moment," [...] {{continued}} the officer, [...] "a {{man came to}} me for a letter which was to go to Persia, and which I had left in my tent. I directed the file-leader to run to my tent and bring the letter to me. He immediately set off, and the rest, obeying literally the directions which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> giving them, all followed, running behind him in a line like a troop of savages, so that I had the whole squad of twenty men running in a body off the field to fetch a letter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will tell}} you when she arrives. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> 'phoning to her. She is coming at once." [...] There was another pause. [...] "I'm afraid she has bad news." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{looking at}} the view from my window--and I notice one thing which has struck me. The mist this morning is the {{thickest}} mist <b>I</b> <b>have</b> yet seen here.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> really nothing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> foolish, that is all. I {{wanted a}} hat with forget-me-nots and a grey silk, and Louisa says <b>I</b> must <b>have</b> black and a bonnet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, lassie, {{an illness}} called curiosity. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> telling Mr. McLean that curiosity is {{essentially}} a woman's ailment, and up you come ahint to prove it." [...] He shook a finger at her reprovingly, and was probably still reflecting on woman's ways when Grizel walked home at midnight breathing through her nose, and Tommy fell asleep with his mouth open. For Tommy could never have stood the doctor's test of a man. In the painting of him, aged twenty-four, which was exhibited in the Royal Academy, his lips meet firmly, {{but no one knew}} save himself how he gasped after each sitting.|$|E
60|$|I do remember, though, how one {{afternoon}} I discovered the peculiar appeal of her form for me. I had been restless {{with my work}} and had finally {{slipped out of the}} Laboratory and come over to the Art Museum to lounge among the pictures. I came upon her in an odd corner of the Sheepshanks gallery, intently copying something from a picture that hung high. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> in the gallery of casts from the antique, my mind was all alive with my newly awakened sense of line, and there she stood with face upturned, her body drooping forward from the hips just a little--memorably graceful--feminine.|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} feeling seedy, {{and we were}} getting quite nervous about it. Harris said he felt such {{extraordinary}} fits of giddiness come over him at times, that he hardly {{knew what he was}} doing; and then George said that he had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what he was doing. With me, it was my liver that was out of order. I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "you will be {{more than}} welcome. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> telling Arnold that your coming will make the world a {{different}} place for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] he replied, [...] "but I feel uncommonly hungry, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> {{wondering}} how {{you manage to}} feed when at sea in so small a craft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{recently}} become {{possessed of a}} tricycle. A bicycle is, I regret to say, considered too--how shall I put it?--flippant by my parishioners. So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a tricycle. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> hauling it hither." ...|$|R
