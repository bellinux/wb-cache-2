50|$|This {{method is}} {{normally}} implemented by first picking out {{a part of}} the search image to use as a template:We will call the search image S(x, y), where (x, y) represent the coordinates of each pixel in the search image. We will call the template T(x t, y t), where (xt, yt) represent the coordinates of each pixel in the template. We then simply move the center (or the origin) of the template T(x t, y t) over each (x, y) point in the search image and calculate the sum of products between the coefficients in S(x, y) and T(xt, yt) over the whole area spanned by the template. As all possible positions of the template with respect to the search image are considered, the position with the highest score is the best position. This method is sometimes referred to as Linear Spatial Filtering and the template is called a <b>filter</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{transfer}} image processing to vector fields and flow visualization by defining a suitable convolution operation. For this, a multiplication of vectors is necessary. Clifford algebra provides such a multiplication of vectors. So we define a Clifford convolution on vector fields with uniform grids. The Clifford convolution works with multivector <b>filter</b> <b>masks.</b> Scalar and vector masks can be easily converted to multivector fields. So, <b>filter</b> <b>masks</b> from image processing on scalar fields can be applied as well as vector and multivector masks. Furthermore, a method for pattern matching with Clifford convolution on vector fields is described. The method is independent of the direction of the structures. This provides an automatic approach to feature detection. The features can be visualized using any known method like glyphs, isosurfaces or streamlines. The features are defined by <b>filter</b> <b>masks</b> instead of analytical properties and thus the approach is more intuitive...|$|R

For linear position invariant procedure, the corruption process is modeled in the spatial domain by convolving the image with a point spread function (PSF) and addition of some noises into the image. It is assumed that a given artificial image is corrupted by a degradation function, represented by the PSF, and an additive noise. Then a <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> (as a candidate for the corruption function inverse) is calculated to restore the original image from the corrupted one, with some accuracy. Calculating a suitable <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> is formulated as an optimization problem: find optimal coefficients of the <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> such that the difference between the original image and <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> restored image to be minimized. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to compute the optimal coefficients of the <b>filter</b> <b>mask.</b> Square filter masks are considered.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{algorithm}} is presented for the efficient two-dimensional (2 -D), {{mean squared error}} (MSE), FIR filtering and system identification. Filter masks of general boundaries are allowed. Efficient order updating recursions are developed by exploiting the spatial shift invariance property of the 2 -D data set. Single-step-order updating recursions are developed. During each iteration, the filter coefficients set is augmented by a single new element. The single-step-order updating formulas allow {{for the development of}} an efficient, true order recursive algorithm for the 2 -D MSE linear prediction and filtering. In contrast to the existing column(row) wise 2 -D recursive schemes based on the Levinson–Wiggins–Robinson multichannel algorithm, the proposed technique offers the greatest maneuverability in the 2 -D index space in a computational efficient way. This flexibility can be taken into advantage if the shape of the 2 -D mask is not a priori known and has to be dynamically configured. The recursive character of the algorithm allows for a continuous reshaping of the <b>filter</b> <b>mask.</b> Search for the optimal <b>filter</b> <b>mask,</b> essentially reconfigures the <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> to achieve an optimal match. The optimum determination of the mask shape offers important advantages in 2 -D system modeling, filtering and image restoration.

30|$|Initial {{parameter}} {{settings for}} PC 1 DARMF algorithm involves initial value determination of <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> M(0), assigned value m(0,j)for each element in <b>filter</b> <b>mask,</b> rank parameter r(0)and the threshold thm_M. Several reasons are supporting the random initial parameter settings. First, the only variable of <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> in 1 DARMF is its length. Based on analysis of Nikolaou and Antoniadis [11] of empirical rule {{for the length}} selection and consideration of keeping computational complexity relatively low, we propose to random chose it between 0.3 and 0.5 times of the total length of input signal. Secondly, there are no guidelines in theory for mi and ri initial values. They get renewal in continuous manner to optimal value during iterations, so their initial values {{are expected to be}} different chosen each time within an interval (e.g., [0, 1]). Thirdly, notice the derivations of (6) and (18) in Section 2.1 are all irrelevant to the value of thm_M, thm_M can be also randomly chosen within [0, 1]. Besides, the most important is {{that it is impossible to}} find optimal initial parameter settings for signals with varying nonstationary characteristics. The first goal of PC 1 DARMF is to measure how good two signals match each other rather than achieve optimal signal recovering, so the selection of initial parameter values would not be necessarily restrained as special ones. Based on the analysis, we use random initial parameter settings for later experiments.|$|E
30|$|The {{convolution}} operation {{requires a}} neighborhood {{with the same}} width that the <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> to calculate the result for each pixel. So, each thread transfers one datum from the global memory to the shared memory. In {{order to get the}} maximum precision and to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory, these data are stored as floating point data. Therefore, there are n- 1 threads per block that only load data, but do not calculate any filtered pixel. So, as to not waste too many threads in the loading stage, the block size must be large enough compared to the <b>filter</b> <b>mask</b> width. In this case, the block size is set to 1 × 128, and the filter width is 7, so only 6 threads are wasted per processing block. The block width is set to 128 to achieve the required alignment when accessing to global memory, and also to optimize the multiprocessor utilization.|$|E
