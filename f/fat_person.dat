In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous <b>fat</b> <b>person</b> – I am often asked about the issue… I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said hurt you – I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it…as I know you can—the often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy – is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. It’s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Humpty Dumpty {{has become}} a highly popular nursery rhyme {{character}}. American actor George L. Fox (1825–77) helped to popularise the character in nineteenth-century stage productions of pantomime versions, music, and rhyme. The character is also a common literary allusion, particularly {{to refer to a}} person in an insecure position, something that would be difficult to reconstruct once broken, or a short and <b>fat</b> <b>person.</b> Humpty Dumpty has been used in a large range of literary works in addition to his appearance as a character in Through the Looking-Glass, including L. Frank Baum's Mother Goose in Prose (1901), where the rhyming riddle is devised by the daughter of the king, having witnessed Humpty's [...] "death" [...] and her father's soldiers' efforts to save him. In Neil Gaiman's early short story The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds, the Humpty Dumpty story is turned into a film noir-style hardboiled crime story, involving other characters from popular nursery rhymes. Robert Rankin used Humpty Dumpty as one victim of a serial fairy-tale character murderer in The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse (2002). Jasper Fforde included Humpty Dumpty in his novels The Well of Lost Plots (2003) and The Big Over Easy (2005), which use him respectively as a ringleader of dissatisfied nursery rhyme characters threatening to strike and as the victim of a murder. Humpty Dumpty appears as a lead villain in the DreamWorks animation Puss in Boots (2011).|$|E
2500|$|One {{rational}} {{tendency is}} towards increasing {{the efficiency and}} output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular exercise, dieting, increased hygiene, drugs, and an emphasis on optimal nutrition. As well as increasing lifespans, these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks. [...] Another aspect of this is maintaining {{a certain level of}} physical attraction. Processes such as the combing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate haircut, and wearing certain clothes receive calculated use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals. In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a <b>fat</b> <b>person</b> is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.|$|E
40|$|The 'war on obesity' {{is a very}} salient {{topic in}} {{contemporary}} Westernised cultures, with increasing rates of obesity and associated health consequences receiving regular public attention and condemnation. As such it seems timely to re-examine social attitudes and beliefs about <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> and fatness – the consequences of which may contribute to, and be as severe as, the health risks associated with fatness. Previous anti-fat attitude and attribution {{research has focused on}} controllability beliefs as determinants of hostility towards <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> (i. e., anger and hostile attitudes). The primary focus of the current investigation was to extend research on reactions to <b>fat</b> <b>persons,</b> by conceptualising and exploring paternalistic attitudes and related beliefs. Paternalistic anti-fat attitudes were defined as the degree to which an individual espouses that <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> should be helped to lose weight in the interests of benefiting <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> (e. g., in terms of happiness and health), regardless of the beliefs and wishes of <b>fat</b> <b>persons.</b> The conceptualisation of paternalistic anti-fat attitudes was based on Fiske et al. 's (1999; 2002) stereotype content model of prejudice toward social out-groups and bioethical definitions of paternalism. Paternalistic attitudes are described as subjectively positive as they are viewed as helpful and caring by the individual espousing the attitude, but are based on undesirable stereotypic beliefs, such as the assumption that the target is incompetent, inferior, needy, and weak. Two samples of Australian adults were surveyed. For Study 1, the final sample consisted of 210 psychology students, who completed a web survey. The final sample for Study 2 consisted of 344 community participants, predominantly recruited from a regional centre. Study 2 participants completed a self-administered paper survey. Study 1 may be considered a pilot study, which enabled preliminary examination of original attitude and belief variables developed for this research, prior to re-examining the research aims in a more diverse community sample in Study 2. Study 2 replicated Study 1 with methodological improvements. The current research has provided preliminary evidence that reactions to <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> are both hostile and paternalistic; that is, <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> are both disliked and disrespected.

Participants were administered a computerized task called the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz. 1998) aimed at assessing the strength of the association among concepts. As expected, results demonstrated that the category "fat person" was indeed more easily paired with low-contact jobs than with jobs requiring extensive interpersonal contact.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that lean persons are more responsive than <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> {{to the effects}} of dietary cholesterol was investigated in 1, 903 middle-aged employed men who were examined in 1958 and 1959 as participants in the Chicago Western Electric Study. Change in intake of dietary cholesterol was positively associated with change in serum cholesterol for men in the lowest tertile of body mass index (defined as weight (kg) / height (mf) ( 26. 6) after adjustment for change in body mass index and change in intakes of energy and saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. A decrease of 150 mg/ 1, 000 kcal in dietary cholesterol was associated with mean changes of- 0. 46,- 0. 18, and 0. 13 mmol/liter in serum cholesterol for men with body mass indices of 26. 6, respec-tively. Body mass index was strongly correlated with subscapular skinfold thickness; thus, these differences in body mass index reflect true differences in adiposity. These results may help to explain inconsistencies that have occurred in feeding experiments with dietary cholesterol, and they suggest that a reduction in dietary cholesterol should have a more favorable effect on the serum cholesterol levels of <b>fat</b> <b>persons</b> after the...|$|R

He was a funny, <b>fat</b> <b>person</b> with a round face and a comic manner, the most unexpected sort of fellow to find in the wildest of African districts; and he was eminently unsuited for the life he led.

When his last penny was spent he had been offered a post by a friend of his family's, who happened to be a director of the company, and had accepted it as his only refuge from starvation. Adversity had not been able to affect his happy nature. He was always cheerful no matter what difficulties he was in, and neither regretted the follies of his past nor repined over the hardships which had followed them.

[...] It was not till a <b>fat</b> <b>person</b> {{in a black}} dressing-gown began to squeal demands for horrible stuff called [...] "a bottle of wine" [...] that I began to understand {{the glory of the}} situation. I was seeing Life. [...] "Life" [...] is a great thing. It consists in swigging sweet champagne that was stolen from a steward of the P. and O., and exchanging bad words with pale-faced baggages who laugh demnibly without effort and without emotion. The argot of the real [...] "chippy" [...] (this means man of the world--Anglice, a half-drunk youth with his hat {{on the back of his}} head) is not easy to come at. It requires an apprenticeship in America. I stood appalled at the depth and richness of the American language, of which I was privileged to hear a special dialect. There were girls who had been to Leadville and Denver and the wilds of the wilder West, who had acted in minor companies, and who had generally misconducted themselves in a hundred weary ways. They chattered like daws and shovelled down the sickly liquor that made the rooms reek. As long as they talked sensibly things were amusing, but a sufficiency of liquor made the mask drop, and verily they swore by all their gods, chief of whom is Obidicut. Very many men have heard a white woman swear, but some few, and among these I have been, are denied the experience. It is quite a revelation; and if nobody tilts you backwards out of your chair, you can reflect on heaps of things connected with it. So they cursed and they drank and they told tales, sitting in a circle, till I felt that this was really Life and a thing to be quitted if I wished to like it. The young man who knew a thing or two, and gave the girls leave to sell him if they could, was there of course, and the hussies sold him as he stood for all he considered himself worth; and I saw the by-play. Surely the safest way to be fooled is to know everything. Then there was an interlude and some more shrieks and howls, which the generous public took as indicating immense mirth and enjoyment of Life; and I came to yet another establishment, where the landlady lacked the half of her left lung, as a cough betrayed, but was none the less amusing in a dreary way, until she also dropped the mask and the playful jesting began. All the jokes I had heard before at the other place. It is a poor sort of Life that cannot spring one new jest a day. More than ever did the youth cock his hat and explain that he was a real [...] "chippy," [...] and that there were no flies on him. Any one without a cast-iron head would be [...] "real chippy" [...] next morning after one glass of that sirupy champagne. I understand now why men feel insulted when sweet fizz is offered to them. The second interview closed as the landlady gracefully coughed us into the passage, and so into the healthy, silent streets. She was very ill indeed, and announced that she had but four months more to live.|$|E

6000|$|The {{truth is}} doubtless, however, much {{less in the}} wealth of my {{experience}} than in the tenacity of my impression, the fact that I have lost nothing of what I saw and that though I can't now quite divide the total into separate occasions the various items surprisingly swarm for me. I shall return to some of them, wishing at present only to make my point of when and how the seeds were sown that afterwards so thickly sprouted and flowered. I was greatly to love the drama, at its best, as a [...] "form"; whatever variations of faith or curiosity I was to know in respect to the infirm and inadequate theatre. There was of course anciently no question for us of the drama at its best; and indeed while I lately by chance looked over a copious collection of theatrical portraits, beginning with the earliest age of lithography and photography as so applied, and documentary in the highest degree on the personalities, as we nowadays say, of the old American stage, stupefaction grew sharp in me and scepticism triumphed, so vulgar, so barbarous, seemed the array of types, so extraordinarily provincial the note of every figure, so less than scant the claim of such physiognomies and such reputations. Rather dismal, everywhere, I admit, the histrionic image with the artificial lights turned off--the fatigued and disconnected face reduced to its mere self and resembling some closed and darkened inn with the sign still swung but the place blighted for want of custom. That consideration weighs; but what a [...] "gang," [...] all the same, when thus {{left to their own}} devices, the performers, men and women alike, of that world of queer appreciations! I ought perhaps to bear on them lightly in view of what in especial comes back to me; the sense of the sacred thrill with which I began to watch the green curtain, the particular one that was to rise to The Comedy of Errors on the occasion that must have been, for what I recall of its almost unbearable intensity, the very first of my ever sitting at a play. I should have been indebted for the momentous evening in that case to Mr. William Burton, whose small theatre in Chambers Street, to the rear of Stewart's big shop and hard by the Park, as the Park was at that time understood, offered me then my prime initiation. Let me not complain of my having owed the adventure to a still greater William as well, nor think again without the right intensity, the scarce tolerable throb, of the way the torment of the curtain was mixed, half so dark a defiance and half so rich a promise. One's eyes bored into it in vain, and yet one knew it would rise at the named hour, the only question being if one could exist till then. The play had been read to us during the day; a celebrated English actor, whose name I inconsistently forget, had arrived to match Mr. Burton as the other of the Dromios; and the agreeable Mrs. Holman, who had to my relentless vision too retreating a chin, was so good as to represent Adriana. I regarded Mrs. Holman as a friend, though in no warmer light than that in which I regarded Miss Mary Taylor--save indeed that Mrs. Holman had the pull, on one's affections, of [...] "coming out" [...] to sing in white satin and quite irrelevantly between the acts; an advantage she shared with the younger and fairer and more dashing, the dancing, Miss Malvina, who footed it and tambourined it and shawled it, irruptively, in lonely state. When not admiring Mr. Burton in Shakespeare we admired him as Paul Pry, as Mr. Toodles and as Aminadab Sleek in The Serious Family, and we must have admired him very much--his huge <b>fat</b> <b>person,</b> his huge fat face and his vast slightly pendulous cheek, surmounted by a sort of elephantine wink, to which I impute a remarkable baseness, being still perfectly present to me.|$|E

He will not speak of his [...] "frame," [...] and hang clothes like sacks over it; he will know and feel that he and the people about him have wonderful, delightful and beautiful bodies.|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids {{characteristic}} of ruminant-animal fat {{have been found}} to be present in significantly lower proportions in samples from the depot <b>fat</b> of <b>persons</b> dying of ischaemic heart disease (cases) than in specimens from persons dying of unrelated causes (controls). Although such acids are also present, in lesser amounts, in hydrogenated marine oils, this case-versus-control difference is difficult to explain other than on the basis that controls consumed a higher proportion of ruminant-animal fat in their total dietary fat than did the cases. The proportions of polyunsaturated acids and of certain higher (C 20 and C 22 mostly mono-enoic) acids in the depot fat of cases and controls are virtually identical. There is also no indication of any difference in degrees of saturation of fats between the case and control specimens...|$|R
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the subcutaneous adipose layer and total body <b>fat</b> in a <b>person</b> is often modelled by using regression equations. The most popular of these equations was formed by Durnin and Wormersley, who rigorously tested many types of skinfold, and, as a result, created two formulae to calculate the body density of both men and women. These equations present an inverse correlation between skinfolds and body density—as the sum of skinfolds increases, the body density decreases.|$|R
