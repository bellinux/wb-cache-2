25|$|In humans, a mutant variant at {{a single}} site in the FY cis-regulatory region abolishes all {{expression}} of the gene in erythrocyte precursors. As a result, homozygous mutants are strongly protected from infection by P. vivax, and {{a lower level of}} protection is conferred on heterozygotes. The variant has apparently arisen twice in geographically distinct human populations, in Africa and Papua New Guinea. It has been driven to high frequencies on at least two haplotypic backgrounds within Africa. Recent work indicates a similar, but not <b>identical,</b> <b>pattern</b> exists in baboons (Papio cynocephalus), which suffer a mosquito-carried malaria-like pathogen, Hepatocystis kochi. Researchers interpret this as a case of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the {{massacre}} showed an almost <b>identical</b> <b>pattern</b> in every city he visited. Before his arrival, {{there were only a}} few killings, despite his orders. When Dessalines arrived, he first spoke about the atrocities committed by former French authorities, such as Rochambeau and Leclerc, after which he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area's French population be carried out. Reportedly, he also ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that blame would not rest solely on the black population. Mass killings then took place on the streets and on places outside the cities. In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred.|$|E
40|$|When {{there is}} a {{discussion}} about unity, word widely used in music, {{the idea of an}} internal pattern as its central aspect almost always comes to mind. However, one question arises: is the presence of <b>identical</b> <b>patterns</b> that permeate the whole work of art, the most important way of confering inner unity in music? Based on principles of the Pythagorean School of philosophy, I discuss in this article that unity requires both the use of <b>identical</b> <b>patterns</b> and elements of opposition...|$|R

2500|$|The wreck at Madrague de Giens is {{significant}} {{not only because}} {{it is one of the}} largest Roman vessels ever discovered, or that its excavation was the first “truly scientific underwater excavation carried out in France”, but because it also reveals important information about Roman art. During the excavations Pomey created a detailed, scale plan of the hull which he then compared with a selection of images showing ships from around the same time period as the wreck. He discovered that in several mosaics the proportions and shapes were identical to his own plans, suggesting three things: firstly, that mosaics [...] "represent ancient ships with much more realism and accuracy than might be supposed"; secondly, that the deteriorated, destroyed or lost parts of the Madgrague de Giens wreck (such as the rigging) were likely similar to those displayed in the images; and thirdly, based on the date ranges of the comparable mosaics, [...] "that this type of ship was built to a virtually <b>identical</b> <b>pattern</b> for more than three centuries".|$|E
60|$|The {{thing that}} weighed {{heaviest}} on Raggles's soul and clogged his poet's fancy was {{the spirit of}} absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint. Each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit. Humanity was gone from them; they were toddling idols of stone and varnish, worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images. Frozen, cruel, implacable, impervious, cut to an <b>identical</b> <b>pattern,</b> they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion, while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble.|$|E
60|$|But, {{to return}} to my window {{at the back of}} the hotel. Together with a due contemplation of the fruit-trees, the grapevines, the buttonwood-tree, the cat, the birds, and many other particulars, I failed not to study the row of fashionable {{dwellings}} to which all these appertained. Here, it must be confessed, there was a general sameness. From the upper story to the first floor, they were so much alike, that I could only conceive of the inhabitants as cut out on one <b>identical</b> <b>pattern,</b> like little wooden toy-people of German manufacture. One long, united roof, with its thousands of slates glittering in the rain, extended over the whole. After the distinctness of separate characters to which I had recently been accustomed, it perplexed and annoyed me not to be able to resolve this combination of human interests into well-defined elements. It seemed hardly worth while for more than one of those families to be in existence, since they all had the same glimpse of the sky, all looked into the same area, all received just their equal share of sunshine through the front windows, and all listened to precisely the same noises of the street on which they boarded. Men are so much alike in their nature, that they grow intolerable unless varied by their circumstances.|$|E

60|$|I was myself very {{successful}} in one beautiful group of insects, the tiger-beetles, which seem more abundant and varied here {{than anywhere else in}} the Archipelago. I first met with them on a cutting in the road, where a hard clayey bank was partially overgrown with mosses and small ferns. Here, I found running about, a small olive-green species which never took flight; and more rarely, a fine purplish black wingless insect, which was always found motionless in crevices, and was therefore, probably nocturnal. It appeared to me to form a new genus. About the roads in the forest, I found the large and handsome Cicindela heros, which I had before obtained sparingly at Macassar; but it was in the mountain torrent of the ravine itself that I got my finest things. On dead trunks overhanging the water and on the banks and foliage, I obtained three very pretty species of Cicindela, quite distinct in size, form, and colour, but having an almost <b>identical</b> <b>pattern</b> of pale spots. I also found a single specimen of a most curious species with very long antennae. But my finest discovery here was the Cicindela gloriosa, which I found on mossy stones just rising above the water. After obtaining my first specimen of this elegant insect, I used to walk up the stream, watching carefully every moss-covered rock and stone. It was rather shy, and would often lead me on a long chase from stone to stone, becoming invisible every time it settled on the damp moss, owing to its rich velvety green colour. On some days I could only catch a few glimpses of it; on others I got a single specimen; and on a few occasions two, but never without a more or less active pursuit. This and several other species I never saw but in this one ravine.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 270 frozen {{adenovirus}} isolates, obtained from January 1981 to December 1986, were grown in KB cells. DNA was successfully prepared from 248 of these isolates, and the prepared DNA was digested initially with SmaI restriction endonuclease and then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Restriction fragment patterns showed that 68 of these DNAs were either adenovirus type 3 (Ad 3) or Ad 7. Further analysis by digestion with BamHI showed that 24 isolates were Ad 3 a and 44 isolates were Ad 7 b. When Ad 3 isolates were digested with SmaI or PstI, the restriction fragment {{patterns of the}} 24 isolates were identical. Of these 24 isolates, 20 (83 %) also gave <b>identical</b> <b>patterns</b> when digested with HindIII, and the patterns of the remaining 4 isolates were {{different from that of}} the 20 but identical to each other. All Ad 3 isolates were obtained in 1982, 1983, and 1986. All the 44 Ad 7 b isolates gave <b>identical</b> fragment <b>patterns</b> when digested with BglI or PvuII, and 43 of 44 (98 %) isolates gave <b>identical</b> <b>patterns</b> when digested with SstII. We obtained at least two Ad 7 isolates during each of the 6 years studied. Although considerable genome heterogeneity within adenovirus serotypes and subtypes has been reported, our population of isolates is remarkably homogeneous. This homogeneous set of genome types was obtained from diverse anatomical sites and was associated with a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes...|$|R
