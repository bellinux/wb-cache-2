2500|$|For {{an analog}} meter movement, DC voltage is {{measured}} with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages.

2500|$|Any meter will {{load the}} circuit under test to some extent. For example, a {{multimeter}} using a moving coil movement with full-scale <b>deflection</b> <b>current</b> of 50 microamps, the highest sensitivity commonly available, must draw at least 50 microamps from the circuit under {{test for the}} meter {{to reach the top}} end of its scale. This may load a high-impedance circuit so much as to affect the circuit, thereby giving a low reading. The full-scale <b>deflection</b> <b>current</b> may also be expressed in terms of [...] "ohms per volt". The ohms per volt figure is often called the [...] "sensitivity" [...] of the instrument. Thus a meter with a 50 microampere movement will have a [...] "sensitivity" [...] of 20,000 ohms per volt. [...] "Per volt" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} impedance the meter presents to the circuit under test will be 20,000 ohms multiplied by the full-scale voltage to which the meter is set. For example, if the meter is set to a range of 300 volts full scale, the meter's impedance will be 6 megohms. 20,000 ohms per volt is the best (highest) sensitivity available for typical analog multimeters that lack internal amplifiers. For meters that do have internal amplifiers (VTVMs, FETVMs, etc.), the input impedance is fixed by the amplifier circuit.|$|E

The first results in a compression of the lunar field and, if it is strong enough, can stop the wind above the surface. The extent of compression {{depends on how much}} the wind is slowed before striking the surface. The second mode results in a small deflection of the wind. In both modes, charging up of the surface is important.

The uniform air gap between the iron core and the permanent magnet poles make the deflection of the meter linearly proportional to current. These meters have linear scales.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of perturbations in {{the magnetic field}} resulting from the deflection of an injected electric current around a defect {{has been shown to}} have many potential applications in NDE. Characteristics of such a technique include through-wall sensitivity to defects at tens of millimetres of lift-off between sensor and sample, which makes the technique suitable to a number of traditionally difficult-to-inspect scenarios where extensive insulation and/or coating removal is undesirable. This paper presents a study into the feasibility of using Magnetoresistive (MR) sensors to measure <b>current</b> <b>deflection</b> from corrosion-like defects via an internal or external scan of the pipe. Prediction of the signal due to different defect geometries have been facilitated by a validated FE model, and <b>current</b> <b>deflection</b> measurements using Anisotropic MR sensors have allowed prediction of the sensitivity of the technique. The various practical challenges are explored which include the misalignment of the sensors with the target components of the magnetic field, the influence of nearby ferromagnetic objects, and the effect of pipe features such as bends and crossings. The results suggest that low-powered, inexpensive MR sensors in a gradiometric configuration can be used to measure <b>current</b> <b>deflection</b> from defects occurring on the inner or outer wall of pipes carrying a few amps of current while the coating, insulation and (non-ferromagnetic) cladding remain intact.

The primary thesis of this work is that the response to a forced motion can often be represented with a small, predictable number of frequency components without loss of accuracy. By resolving only those frequencies of interest, the computational effort is significantly reduced so that the routine calculation of dynamic derivatives becomes practical. The current implementation uses this same non-linear, frequency-domain approach and extends the application to the 3 -D Euler equations. The current work uses a Cartesian, embedded-boundary method to automate the generation of dynamic stability derivatives...|$|R

Magnetic field strength at the neutralizer cathode orifice is a crucial factor influencing the coupling voltage. The effects of electrostatic accelerator grid aperture diameters on the ion current extraction capabilities were examined experimentally to describe the divergence, <b>deflection,</b> and <b>current</b> extraction capabilities of grids with the screen and accelerator apertures displaced relative to one another. Experiments performed in orificed, mercury hollow cathodes support the model of field enhanced thermionic electron mission from cathode inserts.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental procedure {{to determine the}} acoustic and vibration behavior of an inverter-fed induction motor based on measurements of the current spectrum, acoustic noise spectrum, overall noise in dB, and overall A-weighted noise in dBA. Measurements are carried out on space-vector modulated 8 -hp and 3 -hp induction motor drives over a range of carrier frequencies at different modulation frequencies. The experimental data help to distinguish between regions {{of high and low}} acoustic noise levels. The measurements also bring out the impact of carrier frequency on the acoustic noise. The sensitivity of the overall noise to carrier frequency is indicative of the relative dominance of the high-frequency electromagnetic noise over mechanical and aerodynamic components of noise. Based on the measured current and acoustic noise spectra, the ratio of dynamic deflection on the stator surface to the product of fundamental and harmonic current amplitudes is obtained at each operating point. The variation of this ratio of <b>deflection</b> to <b>current</b> product with carrier frequency indicates the resonant frequency clearly and also gives a measure of the amplification of vibration at frequencies close to the resonant frequency. This ratio is useful to predict the magnitude of acoustic noise corresponding to significant time-harmonic currents flowing in the stator winding...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear explosions, and a {{wide variety}} of {{technologies}} not yet realized, have been proposed to deflect asteroids away from collision with Earth. In contrast, this article presents realistic models for simple kinetic energy impact deflection, using the actual or-bital elements of 795 catalogued Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, and impactor masses launched to intercept trajectories by Atlas V HLV rockets or equivalent. The authors take asteroid diameter, density, cratering characteristics, and Earth-collision lead time as parameters whose influence is to be investigated. Assuming asteroids of rocklike density, the article finds deflection off of Earth-collision to be achievable given 5 -year lead time with a single kinetic energy intercept for 100 % of 250 m diameter PHAs, 20 -year lead with a single intercept for 93 % of 500 m PHAs, 20 -year lead with 5 and 10 intercepts, respectively, for 55 % and 94 % of 1 km PHAs, or 100 -year lead with 1 and 2 intercepts, respectively, for 55 % and 94 % of 1 km PHAs. Considering likely future lead times for Near-Earth Objects, simple impact <b>deflection</b> using <b>current</b> launch vehicles is therefore a viable strategy for up to kilometer-diameter asteroids.

40|$|AbstractNeuroimaging of {{exogenous}} tracer extravasation {{has become}} the technique of choice in preclinical and clinical studies of bloodâbrain barrier permeability. Such tracers have a larger molecular weight than small ions, neurotransmitters and many drugs. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} tracer extravasation indicates both permeability to these and the cancelation of the electrical polarization across the barrier. Electrophysiological anomalies following intracarotideal administration of dehydrocholate, a bile salt causing extravasation of the albumin-binding tracer Evans blue, seemingly supported this. By contrast, electron microscopic studies suggested a different hierarchical pattern of bloodâbrain barrier dysfunction, a milder degree of impairment being characterized by increased function of the transcellular pathway and a severe degree by opening of the tight junctions. This would imply that the extravasation of macromolecules can occur before disruption of the electrical barrier. However, functional evidence for this has been lacking. Here, we further investigated the electrophysiological anomalies following intracarotideal application of dehydrocholate in rats and found that it caused focal cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery thrombosis, the electrophysiological recordings being characteristic of long-lasting spreading depolarization. These observations indicated that intracarotideal dehydrocholate is not a suitable model to study the isolated dysfunction of the bloodâbrain barrier. Second, we studied the topical application of dehydrocholate to the brain and the application of mannitol into the carotid artery. In both models, we found significant extravasation of Evans blue but no changes in either extracellular potassium or the CO 2 -dependent intracortical direct <b>current</b> <b>deflection.</b> The latter is assumed to depend on the proton gradient across the barrier in rats which we confirmed in additional experiments in vivo and in vitro. The stability of the extracellular potassium concentration and the CO 2 -dependent direct <b>current</b> <b>deflection</b> are two functional tests which indicate the integrity of the electrical barrier. Hence, our results provide functional evidence that the bloodâbrain barrier opening to large molecules does not necessarily imply the opening to small ions consistent with the hierarchy of damage in the previous electron microscopic studies...|$|R
