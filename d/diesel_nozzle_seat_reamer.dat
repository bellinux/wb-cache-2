The investigations have been focused both on the fuel flow pattern at hole inlet and on the flow features at hole exit section; in such a modeling process, transient data concerning spatial distribution of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and cavitation behavior at hole exit have been computed, highlighting the perturbations induced by the unconventional hole shape on the fuel flow; once the flow behavior has been explored, results have been resumed indicating how flow pattern properties are reflected at hole exit, quantitatively...|$|R
40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) is an {{alternative}} fuel which, of late, has shown tremendous potential in reducing the pollution emissions of automobiles. Simultaneously, electronic actuated fuel injectors, {{with the use of}} solenoids, have repeatedly demonstrated superior performance with respect to needle movement control. This thesis, in order to combine the advantages of both electronic actuation and DME fuel, presents an adaptation of the novel use of solenoid operated fuel injectors with DME. The thesis also sets to reduce injector <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> wear, by reducing the bouncing of the injector needle at the bottom of its stroke.

40|$|Cutting edge {{experiments}} and thorough investigations {{have pointed out}} that radial components affect the needle lift of <b>diesel</b> <b>nozzles.</b> So far, the effects of such needle “off-axis” have been investigated within the nozzle and immediately downstream from the hole outlet. Here, the focus has been extended to the spray ambient, far outside a multi-hole VCO (Valve Covered Orifice) nozzle. A reference off-axis configuration of the needle has been defined and used to investigate its effects on the spray, in terms of hole-to-hole differences. Indeed, the spray alterations due to the needle position have been addressed for those factors, such as the velocity-coefficient CV and the area-coefficient CA, able to describe the nozzle flow behavior under needle off-axis. The investigation has been based on 3 D-CFD (three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics) campaigns. The modeling of <b>diesel</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow has been interfaced to the Eulerian–Eulerian near-nozzle spray simulation, initializing the break-up model {{on the basis of the}} transient flow conditions at each hole outlet section.

40|$|The near nozzle exit {{flow and}} spray {{structure}} generated by an enlarged {{model of a}} second generation pintle type outwards opening injector have been investigated under steady flow conditions {{as a function of}} flow-rate and needle lift. A high resolution CCD camera and high-speed video camera have been employed in this study to obtain high-magnification images of the internal nozzle exit flow in order to identify the origin of string ligaments/droplets formation at the nozzle exit. The images of the flow around the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> area showed clearly that air was entrained from outside into the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> area under certain flow operating conditions (low cavitation number, CN); the formed air pockets inside the annular nozzle proved to be the main cause of the breaking of the fuel liquid film into strings as it emerged from the nozzle with a structure consisting of alternating thin and thick liquid filaments. As the flow rate increased, the air pockets were suppressed, reduced in size and pushed towards the exit of the nozzle resulting in a smoother spray. The results showed that the number of strings increased linearly, within the measured range, with liquid exit velocity and that the spray cone angle was smaller or larger than the nominal value depending on the attachment of air pockets to the cartridge or needle surfaces, respectively; these two distinct small and large cone angles were found to be dominant at low and high lifts. Increasing the flow rate further so that CN exceeds the critical value, gave rise to pockets of vapour that started to emerge in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> region and disintegrated rapidly as they were convected towards the nozzle exit. The analysis of the near nozzle flow visualizations has shown the existence of air entrainment and cavitation as two different phenomena occurring under different operating condition...|$|R

The model accounts {{for a number of}} primary physical processes pertinent to cavitation bubbles, which are integrated into the stochastic framework of the model. Its predictive capability has been assessed through comparison of the calculated onset and development of cavitation inside <b>diesel</b> <b>nozzle</b> holes against experimental data obtained in real-size and enlarged models of single- and multi-hole nozzles. For the real-size nozzle geometry, high-speed cavitation images obtained under realistic injection pressures are compared against model predictions, whereas for the largescale nozzle, validation data include images from a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, computed tomography (CT) measurements of the liquid volume fraction and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements of the liquid mean and root mean square (r. m. s.) velocities at different cavitation numbers (CN) and two needle lifts, corresponding to different cavitation regimes inside the injection hole. Overall, and {{on the basis of this}} validation exercise, it can be argued that cavitation modelling has reached a stage of maturity, where it can usefully identify many of the cavitation structures present in internal nozzle flows and their dependence on nozzle design and flow conditions. 1...|$|R

This study demonstrates the effect of reduction in the sac volume of diesel fuel injectors utilised in medium-/heavy-duty applications on the internal nozzle flow. This is realised by comparison of two heavy-duty <b>diesel</b> <b>nozzles</b> that feature a large difference in sac volume size of almost three times. For visualisation purposes, the nozzles have been enlarged by six times, and replicas were manufactured from a transparent material.

A cavity first formed near the upstream corner, but soon caused the jet to leave the wall altogether so that only the upstream corner had any effect on the flow. Under non-cavitating conditions the emerging jet had a rufffed appearance, but under conditions when the jet had left the wall, it emerged smooth and glass-like.

The cavitation of diesel promotes nano-particle formation through induced pyrolysis and oxidation, which may result in deposit formation in the vehicle fuel system.

40|$|In {{order to}} enable {{investigations}} of the fuel flow inside unmodified injectors, we have developed a new experimental approach to measure time-resolved vibration spectra of <b>diesel</b> <b>nozzles</b> using a three dimensional laser vibrometer. The technique we propose {{is based on the}} triangulation of the vibrometer and fuel pressure transducer signals, and enables the quantitative characterisation of quasi-cyclic internal flows without requiring modifications to the injector, the working fluid, or limiting the fuel injection pressure. The vibrometer, which uses the Doppler effect to measure the velocity of a vibrating object, was used to scan injector nozzle tips during the injection event. The data were processed using a discrete Fourier transform to provide time-resolved spectra for valve-closed-orifice, minisac and microsac nozzle geometries, and injection pressures ranging from 60 to 160 MPa, hence offering unprecedented insight into cyclic cavitation and internal mechanical dynamic processes. A peak was consistently found in the spectrograms between 6 and 7. 5 kHz for all nozzles and injection pressures. Further evidence of a similar spectral peak was obtained from the fuel pressure transducer and a needle lift sensor mounted into the injector body. Evidence of propagation of the nozzle oscillations to the liquid sprays was obtained by recording high-speed videos of the near-nozzle diesel jet, and computing the fast Fourier transform for a number of pixel locations at the interface of the jets. This 6 - 7. 5 kHz frequency peak is proposed to be the natural frequency for the injector's main internal fuel line.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to acquire more insight into the {{relationship}} between wall and piston impingement of liquid fuel and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions (UHC) emissions, under early direct injection (EDI) premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) operating conditions. To this end, the vaporization process is modeled for various operating conditions using a commercial CFD code (StarCD). Predicted values for liquid core penetration, or liquid length LL, have been successfully checked against experimental data from literature over a wide range of operating conditions. Next, the correlation between the CFD results for wall and piston impingement and measured UHC emissions is studied. The diesel fuel used in the experiments is modeled as n-dodecane and n-heptadecane, representing the low and high end of the diesel boiling range, respectively. A distinction is made between liquid spray impingement on the piston surface and cylinder liner. For a conventional DI <b>diesel</b> <b>nozzle,</b> the high UHC emissions in the EDI PCCI regime correlate well with modeled cylinder wall impingement. Conversely, piston impingement is negligible in this regime. Accordingly, it may be assumed that the primary cause for high UHC emissions in the EDI PCCI regime, using conventional DI nozzles, is caused by liquid spray impingement against the cylinder liner. In this regime it was found that a higher intake and fuel temperature, as well as an elevated intake pressure have a positive effect on both UHC emissions and the spray impingement against the cylinder wall. This provides additional evidence that the two parameters (i. e., UHC and wall impingement) are linked. Lastly, the impact of nozzle cone angle is investigated. When adopting a narrow cone angle nozzle in the EDI PCCI regime, wall impingement is negligible and piston wetting becomes the dominant source of UHC emissions...|$|R

Finally, PDA measurements on real-size transparent nozzle tips have confirmed that such nozzles reproduce successfully the sprays generated by production metal nozzles...|$|R
40|$|Investigating nozzle’s orifice flow is {{challenging}} both experimentally and theoretically. This paper focuses on simulating flow inside <b>diesel</b> injector <b>nozzle</b> via Ansys fluent v 15. Validation is performed with experimental results from Winkhofler et al (2001). Several important parameters such as mass flow rate, velocity profiles and pressure profiles {{are used for}} this validation. Results include the effects of contraction inside nozzle’s orifice, effect of compressibility; effect of injection pressures and several orifice entries are also simulated in this study. For considering the effect of compressibility a user defined function used in this simulation. Cavitation model which is used in this simulation is Singhal et al. cavitation model. Presto discretization method is used for Pressure equation and second upwind discretization method is used for Momentum equation. Converging Singhal et al. cavitation model is very challenging and it needs several efforts and simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{presence}} of cavitation and turbulence in a <b>diesel</b> injector <b>nozzle</b> has {{significant effect on}} the subsequent spray characteristics. However, the mechanism of the cavitating flow and its effect on the subsequent spray is unclear. The initiation, development and collapse of the cavity are strongly influenced not only by the injection pressure and back pressure but also by the nozzle geometry. The numerical simulation of cavitating flow in nozzle holes of a vertical multi-hole injector with mixture multi-phase cavitating flow model was carried out. The effects of sac geometry, hole entrance curvature radius and hole inclination angle on the cavitating flow in nozzle holes were investigated. It is finally concluded that the performance of IMPROVED nozzle is better than that of STD nozzle and VCO nozzle and small inlet turning angle of the orifice can enhance the atomization of the spray...|$|R
