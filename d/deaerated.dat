25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side).

E. ATHEY AND E. SPENCER, GRAHAM MANUFACTURING CO. Anew system of steam condenser dissolved oxygen control hasfound favor in the combined-cycle cogeneration market. Savings in equipment, a reduction in building size (and plant height), {{and the ability to}} <b>deaerate</b> large quantities of makeup water using only turbine exhaust steam are the reasons. In earlier days, no condenser manufacturer guaranteed condensate oxygen levels of 7 parts per billion (ppb) under any operating condition.

5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In <b>deaerating</b> heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) <b>Deaerating</b> heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two <b>deaerating</b> heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type <b>deaerating</b> heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type <b>deaerating</b> heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|R

50|$|Boiler {{feedwater}} is {{an essential}} part of boiler operations. The feed water is put into the steam drum from a feed pump. In the steam drum the feed water is then turned into steam from the heat. After the steam is used it is then dumped to the main condenser.

50|$|The Sonogashira {{reaction}} is typically run under mild conditions. The cross-coupling {{is carried out}} at room temperature with a base, typically an amine, such as diethylamine, that also acts as the solvent. The reaction medium must be basic to neutralize the hydrogen halide produced as the byproduct of this coupling reaction, so alkylamine compounds such as triethylamine and diethylamine are sometimes used as solvents, but also DMF or ether {{can be used as}} solvent. Other bases such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate are occasionally used. In addition, <b>deaerated</b> conditions are formally needed for Sonogashira coupling reactions because the palladium(0) complexes are unstable in the air, and oxygen promotes the formation of homocoupled acetylenes. Recently, development of air-stable organopalladium catalysts enable this reaction to be conducted in the ambient atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|The wear {{behavior}} of a forged Co- 29 Cr- 6 Mo alloy without any Ni and C added has been investigated by using a tribosystem consisting of a pin-on-disc type wear testing machine in distilled water containing different dissolved oxygen content. Dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water was controlled by aerating with oxygen or by <b>deaerating</b> with argon. Wear volume in the distilled water containing high oxygen content is approximately two times larger than in that containing low oxygen content. Accordingly, it is deduced that the overall wear volume is significantly affected by the dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water surrounding the tribosystem. Although abrasive wear, caused by wear debris, is operative as a wear mechanism in the present tribosystem irrespective of oxygen content, {{the transfer of the}} wear debris to sliding surfaces, as well as the aggregation of the wear debris on the sliding surfaces, is more prone to occur during the wear process with the lower oxygen content. Therefore, in the present tribosystem with the lower oxygen content, since the transfer of the wear debris to the disc or the pin readily occurs, the generation of the wear debris does not directly contribute to the wear volume, leading to the apparently lower wear volume in the tribosystem with lower oxygen content than in that with higher oxygen content; the transfer of the wear debris is not counted as wear loss because the wear volume is estimated based on the loss in disc and pin weight that occurs during the wear test.
